     "abstract": "In 2019, Europe will adopt a no-discards policy in fisheries. This entails the landing of captured species unless strong evidence is provided supporting their survival and recovery after fishing. Thus, research on this topic is gaining momentum. Bottom-trawling, as a non-selective fishing method, is characterized by a high proportion of discards including vulnerable key species, such as demersal sharks. Their survival may also depend on capture depth. By paralleling onboard and laboratory experiments with the small-spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula, we offer a robust experimental design to assess the survival of discarded sharks. Catsharks were captured by bottom-trawling at two depths (shallow ~89\u202fm and deep ~479\u202fm). Blood samples were collected following trawl capture and analyzed for stress biomarkers (lactate, osmolality, phosphate, urea). During recovery in onboard tanks, behavior was video-recorded and fish were re-sampled after 24\u202fh. A second experiment was conducted in laboratory facilities to simulate air-exposure after trawling and to analyze the physiological recovery. Our results showed that 95.7% of the animals survived 24\u202fh after trawling. We confirmed that trawling elicited acute stress responses in catshark but that they managed to recover. This was demonstrated by lactate concentrations that were 2.6\u202fmM upon capture, but recovered to assumed baselines after 24\u202fh (0.2\u202fmM). Non-invasive video monitoring revealed behavioral differences with depth, whereby those captured at 89\u202fm depth required longer to recover than those captured at 479\u202fm depth. Implementation of standardized survival studies by fishery managers can benefit from holistic physiological approaches, such as the one proposed here.",

     "publication date": "07-2019",
     "abstract": "When insects are cooled, they initially lose their ability to perform coordinated movements at their critical thermal minima (CTmin). At a slightly lower temperature, they enter a state of complete paralysis (chill coma onset temperature - CCO) and if they are returned to permissive temperatures they regain function after a recovery period which is termed chill coma recovery time (CCRT). These three phenotypes (CTmin, CCO, and CCRT) are all popular measures of insect cold tolerance and it is therefore important to characterize the physiological processes that are responsible for these phenotypes. In the present study we measured extracellular field potentials in the central nervous system (CNS) and muscle membrane potential (Vm) during cooling and recovery in three Drosophila species that have different cold tolerances. With these measurements we assess the role of the CNS and muscle Vm in setting the lower thermal limits (CTmin and CCO) and in delaying chill coma recovery (CCRT). The experiments suggest that entry into chill coma is primarily caused by the onset of a spreading depolarization in the CNS for all three species. In the two most cold-sensitive species we observed that the loss of CNS function was followed closely by a depolarization of muscle Vm which is known to compromise muscle function. When flies are returned to benign temperature after a cold exposure we observe a rapid recovery of CNS function, but functional recovery was delayed by a slower recovery of muscle polarization. Thus, we demonstrate the primacy of different physiological systems (CNS vs. muscle) as determinants of the most commonly used cold tolerance measures for insects (CTmin vs. CCRT).",

Dopamine had no effect on enzyme activity in juveniles but stimulated activity in adult shrimp gills by \u224835%. Stimulation of the gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase in adult shrimps by 100\u202fmmol\u202fL\u22121 dopamine was characterized kinetically by varying ATP, MgATP, and Na+ and K+ concentrations, together with inhibition by ouabain.

Stimulation by Na+ (\u224850%) and K+ (\u224825%) revealed distinct kinetic profiles: although KM values were similar, Na+ stimulation followed cooperative kinetics, contrasting with the Michaelian kinetics seen for K+. Stimulation by MgATP increased activity by \u224830% with little change in KM. Similar saturation profiles were seen for ouabain inhibition with very similar calculated KI values. Our findings suggest that dopamine may be involved in hemolymph sodium homeostasis by directly binding to the gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase at a site different from ouabain, thus stimulating enzyme activity in an ontogenetic stage-specific manner. However, dopamine binding does not affect enzyme affinity for cations and ouabain. This is the first report of the direct action of dopamine in stimulating the crustacean gill (Na+, K+)-ATPase.",

     "abstract": "In marine fish the intestinal HCO3\u2013 secretion is the key mechanism to enable luminal aggregate formation and water absorption. Using the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), the present study aimed at establishing the functional and molecular organization of different sections of the intestine concerning bicarbonate secretion and Cl\u2212 movements. The proximal intestinal regions presented similar HCO3\u2013 secretion rates, while differences were detected in the molecular expression of the transporters involved and on regional HCO3\u2013 concentrations. The anterior region presented significantly higher Na+/K+-ATPase activity, Cl\u2212 transepithelial transport and basolateral slc4a4, apical slc26a6 and slc26a3 expression levels. In the mid intestine, the total HCO3\u2013 content was significantly increased in the fluid as in the carbonate aggregates. In the rectum no HCO3\u2013 secretion was observed and was characterized by the diminished HCO3\u2013 total content, residual molecular expression of slc4a4, slc26a6 and slc26a3, higher H+-ATPase activity and expression, suggesting the existence of a different bicarbonate handling mechanism. The possible regulation of HCO3\u2013 secretion by extracellular HCO3\u2013 and increased intracellular cAMP levels were also investigated. cAMP did not affect HCO3\u2013 secretion, although Cl\u2212 secretion was enhanced by cftr. HCO3\u2013 secretion rise due to the HCO3\u2013 basolateral increment showed that at resting levels slc4a4 was not a limiting step for secretion. The transcellular/intracellular dependence of apical HCO3\u2013 secretion differed between the proximal regions. In conclusion, intestinal HCO3\u2013 secretion has a functional region-dependent organization that was not reflected by the anterior-posterior regionalization on HCO3\u2013 secretion and expression profiles of chloride/water absorption related genes.",

ALAN is a problem of growing importance because it may significantly disrupt the seasonal and daily physiological rhythms and behaviors of animals. There has been considerable interest in the impacts of ALAN on health of humans and other animals, but most of this work has centered on adults and we know comparatively little about effects on young animals. We exposed 3-week-old king quail (Excalfactoria chinensis) to a constant overnight blue-light regime for 6\u202fweeks and assessed weekly bactericidal activity of plasma against Escherichia coli \u2013 a commonly employed metric of innate immunity in animals. We found that chronic ALAN exposure significantly increased bactericidal activity and that this elevation in immune performance manifested at different developmental time points in males and females. Whether this short-term increase in immune activity can be extended to wild animals, and whether ALAN-mediated increases in immune activity have positive or negative fitness effects, are unknown and will provide interesting avenues for future studies.",

     "abstract": "Vibrational communication is common in insects and often includes signals with prominent frequency components below 200\u202fHz, but the sensory adaptations for their detection are scarcely investigated. We performed an integrative study of the subgenual organ complex in Troglophilus cave crickets (Orthoptera: Rhaphidophoridae), a mechanosensory system of three scolopidial organs in the proximal tibia, for mechanical, anatomical and physiological aspects revealing matches to low frequency vibration detection. Microcomputed tomography shows that a part of the subgenual organ sensilla and especially the accessory organ posteriorly in this complex are placed closely underneath the cuticle, a position suited to evoke responses to low-frequency vibration via changes in the cuticular strain. Laser-Doppler vibrometry shows that in a narrow low-frequency range the posterior tibial surface reacts stronger to low frequency sinusoidal vibrations than the anterior tibial surface. This finding suggests that the posterior location of sensilla in tight connection to the cuticle, especially in the accessory organ, is adapted to improve detectability of low-frequency vibration signals. By electrophysiological recordings we identify a scolopidial receptor type tuned to 50\u2013300\u202fHz vibrations, which projects into the central mechanosensory region specialised for processing low-frequency vibratory inputs, and most likely originates from the accessory organ or the posterior subgenual organ.

Thus, we investigated the upper thermal tolerance of 15 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) families by challenging them with acute (2\u202f\u00b0C\u202fh\u22121) and incremental (1\u202f\u00b0C every 4\u202fdays) temperature increases (CTmax and ITmax tests, respectively) under normoxia (~ 100% air saturation) and mild hypoxia (~ 75% air sat.). The cod's CTmax was 22.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fS.E.) during normoxia and 21.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202f\u00b0C during hypoxia (P\u202f<\u202f0.001); and these two CTmax values were significantly correlated across families. In both the normoxic and hypoxic ITmax tests, feed intake fell by ~50% between 17 and 18\u202f\u00b0C, and stopped entirely by 21\u202f\u00b0C. No mortalities were observed under 20\u202f\u00b0C in the normoxic and hypoxic ITmax tests, and the ITmax value was ~21.7\u202f\u00b0C in both groups. Differences in the upper thermal tolerance between families were only observed in the CTmax experiment. No correlation was found between the specific growth rate and the CTmax of the families. Further, no correlation existed between CTmax and ITmax. This study is the first to compare the thermal tolerance of fish families to both CTmax and ITmax challenges, and the data: 1) suggest that the Atlantic cod is quite tolerant of acute (i.e., hours) or short-term (i.e., weeks) exposure to high water temperatures (i.e., up to 20\u202f\u00b0C); 2) indicate that it might be difficult to select fish with higher ITmax values; and 3) question the relevance of CTmax for selecting fish that are destined for sea-cages where temperatures slowly warm over the summer.",

     "abstract": "Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid hormone in teleosts involved in the regulation of metabolic adjustments under both normal and stressful physiological conditions. In the skeletal muscle, cortisol modulates the energetic metabolism promoting the mobilization of glucose and other energetic substrates to overcome the stress stimulus. The effects of cortisol-mediated stress response are attributed to canonical/genomic mechanisms which involve the interaction of the hormone with its intracellular glucocorticoid receptor and, consequently, modulation of target genes. However, cortisol also can interact with membrane components, activating rapid signaling pathways with unknown contribution during the early stress response. In the present work, we evaluated the impact of membrane-initiated cortisol action over the expression of the critical modulator of energetic metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (pdk2), in fish skeletal muscle. Juvenile rainbow trout were intraperitoneally administered with stress-related doses of cortisol and cortisol-BSA, and the expression of pdk2 was assayed by using RT-qPCR. Our results reveal that pdk2 mRNA levels increased in the skeletal muscle at one hour in both cortisol- and cortisol-BSA-treated fish. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed a biphasic response over the pdk2 regulation in myotubes mediated first through membrane-cortisol signaling pathways followed by the classic cortisol action. Finally, pdk2 up-regulation owing to cortisol and cortisol-BSA is reverted in RU486 treated myotubes, suggesting that GR signaling participates in both cortisol signaling pathways. This work suggests that non-classical cortisol pathways contribute to regulate the early metabolic response to stress in fish skeletal muscle.",

The current study was conducted to determine if the endothermic fish species, the smalleye opah (Lampris incognitus), has higher levels of sln transcription in tissues thought to be the main source of endothermic heat, namely the red aerobic pectoral fin musculature, which powers continuous swimming in this species. A search of the draft assembly of the opah genome reveals a single sln gene that is 95% identical to the zebrafish sln ortholog at the amino acid level. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) using opah-specific sln shows significantly higher sln transcript levels in the dark red pectoral fin muscle compared to both the light red pectoral muscle and white axial muscle tissues. The high ratio of sln transcripts to CaATPase (serca1) transcripts suggests that opah may utilize a futile calcium cycling NST mechanism in the dark red pectoral fin muscle to generate heat.",

While evidence exists that fish final length and size are partially determined by muscle fibre structure. However, the molecular basis behind final body size and muscle fibre composition remains yet to be fully understood. Here we use the fish model zebrafish (Danio rerio) to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in muscle fibre number, muscle growth and their role on animal size determination. In order to do so, we used two lines of zebrafish artificially selected by Amaral and Johnston 2012 for body length to obtain large (L) and small (S) genetic lineages. After selection animals from the L-lineage were significantly larger than individuals from the S-lineage (+6.6%, +6.7% and\u202f+\u202f5.5% for standard, total and fork lengths) and had larger and higher number of muscle fibres (+15% and\u202f+\u202f24% on average fibre area and fibre number respectively) while individuals from S-lineage showed a higher fibre density (+17%). RNAseq analysis on fast skeletal muscle revealed differences in gene expression, splice variants (SV) abundance and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) retention between lineages, indicating the complexity of the molecular processes involved in the determination of the trait. We found that animals from the L-lineage showed an enrichment in genes related to the dystroglycan complex (GO:0016011) while genes related to the proteasome (GO:0022624), sarcomere (GO:0030017), muscle homeostasis (GO:0046716) and response to stress (GO:0006950) were enriched on the S-lineage.

     "abstract": "Adsorbed and structurally incorporated carbonate in bioapatite, the primary mineral phase of bone, is observed across vertebrates, typically at 2\u20138\u202fwt%, and supports critical physiological and biochemical functions. Several turtle species contain elevated bone-associated carbonate, a property linked to pH buffering and overwintering survival. Prior studies of turtle bone utilized bulk analyses, which do not provide spatial resolution of carbonate. Using Raman spectroscopy, the goals of this study were to: (1) quantify and spatially resolve carbonate heterogeneity within the turtle shell; (2) determine if cortical and trabecular bone contain distinct carbonate concentrations; and (3) assess if simulated overwintering conditions result in decreased bioapatite carbonation. Here, we demonstrate the potential for Raman spectroscopic analysis to spatially resolve bioapatite carbonation, using the western painted turtle as a model species. Carbonate concentration was highly variable within cortical and trabecular bone, based on calibrated Raman spot analyses and mapping, suggesting heterogeneous carbonate distribution among crystallites. Mean carbonate concentration did not significantly differ between cortical and trabecular bone, which indicates random distribution of crystallites with elevated and depleted carbonate. Carbonate concentrations (range: 5\u201322\u202fwt%) were not significantly different in overwintering and control animals, deviating from previous bulk analyses. In reconciling bulk and Raman analyses, two hypotheses explain how overwintering turtles potentially access carbonate: (1) mobilization of mineral-associated, surface components of bone crystallites; and (2) selective, dispersed crystallite dissolution. Elevated bioapatite carbonate in the western painted turtle, averaging 11.8\u202fwt%, represents the highest carbonation observed in vertebrates, and is one physiological trait that facilitates overwintering survival.",

In this study, a full-length cDNA encoding a 278-amino-acid FAMeT protein (MrFAMeT) was characterized from the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a high degree of conservation of FAMeT among crustaceans and a close phylogenetic relationship between MrFAMeT and that of Scylla paramamosain. The prokaryotic expressed MrFAMeT could catalyze the conversion of FA to MF in a radiochemical assay. Expression analysis by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that MrFAMeT mRNA was highly expressed in the muscle and the hepatopancreas of both females and males. During the molt cycle and the ovarian development, the mRNA expressions of MrFAMeT displayed stage-specific patterns in the muscle of both sexes and the female hepatopancreas, and the highest expressions were detected at intermolt and ovarian development stage V. Double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of MrFAMeT increased expressions of myostatin in the muscle of both sexes and reduced expressions of vitellogenin (Vg) in the female hepatopancreas. Furthermore, both in the muscle and the hepatopancreas, silence of MrFAMeT downregulated the expression of ecydone receptor gene (MrEcR) and silence of MrEcR decreased the expression of MrFAMeT as well. Results in our study indicate that MrFAMeT is involved in prawn muscle growth and female vitellogenin biosynthesis and its function may be closely related with the ecdysteroid signaling.",

Catfish Heteropneustes fossilis is an economically important species of the Asian subcontinent and holds an important place in reproductive physiology study. In the present study, the full-length cDNA encoding secretogranin IIb (SgIIb) was cloned from the brain of catfish H. fossilis. Sequence analysis showed that a 33 amino acid SN peptide (SNb) is present in SgIIb proprotein. The full-length sequence of SgIIb is 2912\u202fbp with open\u2013reading frame 1761\u202fbp long. The 5'UTR is 681\u202fbp long upstream and the 3'UTRis 470\u202fbp long downstream. The ORF encodes 586 amino acid residues comprising signal peptide (24 amino acids) and SNb (33 amino acids), EM66 (66 amino acids). Catfish SgIIb showed 88% nucleotide homology and 90% protein identity with Ictalurus punctatus. Tissue expression showed that it is highly expressed in the brain among all tissues studied. In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR showed significant brain regional distribution with highest transcript abundance in the pituitary. In ovary tissue SgIIb transcripts were localized in the granulosa layer. In the brain, hCG administration stimulated expression highly at 16\u202fh. In ovary, hCG treatment under in vivo and in vitro condition decreased SgIIb expression at all doses. Thus, in the present study in situ localization of SgIIb mRNAs in different regions of brain and pituitary, and ovary suggest its putative role in regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and also suggest that the SgIIb expression pattern in the brain and ovary could be related to reproductive activity and may be involved in the neuroendocrine role of SgIIb in the catfish H. fossilis.",

Cvv inhabits intertidal estuaries and saltwater marshes along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast, where they experience a broad temperature range from \u22121.9 to 43\u202f\u00b0C and frequent bouts of hypoxia. In contrast, Cvh lives in several lakes in central Florida, where temperature is more stable (12\u201331\u202f\u00b0C) and hypoxia is uncommon. To assess whether relaxed selective pressure on Cvh has resulted in reduced temperature and hypoxia tolerance, a comparative study on the effects of acclimation to 25, 30 and 35\u202f\u00b0C on critical thermal tolerance (CTMax), hypoxia tolerance, and aerobic scope was performed. The CTMax was similar between subspecies and positively correlated with acclimation temperature. Neither subspecies, however, could survive at 38\u202f\u00b0C for a prolonged period of time. In general, Cvv displayed greater hypoxia tolerance and aerobic scope relative to Cvh over the range of acclimation temperatures. Routine metabolic rate was significantly lower while maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope were significantly higher in Cvv, but only in fish acclimated to 30\u202f\u00b0C. Overall, the different responses of Cvh to relaxed selective pressure suggest these traits are weakly linked physiologically in these fishes.",

We investigated the responses of Pacific hagfish to changes in respiratory and ionoregulatory demands imposed by a 48-h exposure to altered salinity (25\u202fppt, 30\u202fppt (control) and 35\u202fppt) and by an acute hypoxia exposure (30\u202fTorr; 4\u202fkPa). When hagfish were exposed to 25\u202fppt, oxygen consumption rate (MO2), ammonia excretion rate (Jamm) and unidirectional diffusive water flux rate (JH2O, measured with 3H2O) were all reduced, pointing to an interaction between ionoregulation and gas exchange. At 35\u202fppt, JH2O was reduced, though MO2 and Jamm did not change. As salinity increased, so did the difference between plasma and external water [Ca2+] and [Mg2+]. Notably, the same pattern was seen for plasma Cl\u2212, which was kept below seawater [Cl\u2212] at all salinities, while plasma [Na+] was regulated well above seawater [Na+], but plasma osmolality matched seawater values. MO2 was reduced by 49% and JH2O by 36% during hypoxia, despite a small elevation in overall ventilation. Our results depart from the \u201cclassical\u201d osmorespiratory compromise but are in accord with responses in other hypoxia-tolerant fish; instead of an exacerbation of gill fluxes when gas transfer is upregulated, the opposite happens.",

Cloacal temperatures were elevated in chicks injected with 0.156 and 0.625\u202fnmol at 30 and 60\u202fmin, and up to 180\u202fmin in those injected with 2.5\u202fnmol. MT also increased temperatures and decreased food and water intake in chicks from lines selected for low (LWS) or high (HWS) body weight with a higher dose threshold but longer food intake response in HWS chicks. An oxytocin receptor antagonist prevented MT-mediated changes in food intake but not water intake or temperature. Yohimbine, an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor antagonist, did not affect food intake, temperature, or MT-mediated effects. MT increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor receptor sub-type 1, and melanocortin receptor 3 mRNAs increased in response to MT. There was increased MT mRNA in the LH and L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase mRNA in the PVN of MT-injected chicks. In conclusion, MT induced anorexia and hyperthermia and reduced water intake. MT was associated with activation of the PVN and LH and differences in the mRNA abundance of some appetite-associated factors, thus implicating these nuclei and several signaling pathways in the effects observed.",

Our sustained low pH exposures revealed that C. ornata was least tolerant, P. hypophthalmus and M. albus were moderately tolerant, and O. goramy and T. pectoralis were highly tolerant to low pH. In general, net ion loss in acute low pH exposures was greatest in species with the shortest time to LOE in the sustained low pH exposure. We also explored how low water [Ca2+] (relative to current Mekong levels) affected ion flux at low water pH in the least tolerant C. ornata and highly tolerant T. pectoralis. In C. ornata, low water Ca2+ (56\u202f\u00b1\u202f1\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL\u22121) increased net ion loss relative to high Ca2+ (342\u202f\u00b1\u202f3\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fL\u22121) water while no effect was observed in T. pectoralis.

Jacks were identified based on elevated plasma 11-ketotestosterone (range, 3\u201312\u202fng/ml) and the occurrence of type B spermatogonia in January 2017. However, these males failed to show running milt as post-smolts at the expected time in May 2017. Subsequently, 6 out of the 21 (32%) suspected \u201cterminated jacks\u201d went on to become grilse, whereas only 1 of the 22 (5%) males that showed no signs of initiating puberty in January became grilse in December 2017. Therefore, \u201cterminated\u201d jacks were more likely to mature as grilse than the males that remained immature. Why these pubertal pre-smolt males did not complete maturation is unclear but could be related to the transfer of fish from conditions of warm water and long days, risk factors for early maturation, to conditions of cold water and short days, which are expected to delay the age of maturation. We provide a description of the conditions under which male Atlantic salmon appear to have terminated the process of sexual maturation.",

The rBGH treatment increased body weight and specific growth rate (SGR) in juveniles and potentiated hyperplastic muscle growth while reducing circulating triglyceride levels. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the in vivo treatment enhanced also lipolysis in both isolated hepatocytes and adipocytes, as well as in day 4 cultured myocytes. Furthermore, these cultured myocytes extracted from rBGH-injected fish presented higher gene expression of GH/IGF-I axis-related molecules and myogenic regulatory factors, as well as stimulated myogenesis (i.e. increased protein expression of a proliferation and a differentiation marker) compared to Control fish-derived cells. These data, suggested that cells in vitro can retain some of the pathways activated by in vivo treatments in fish, what can be considered an interesting line of applied research.

Given our understanding of glucose regulation in trout, we sought to understand how glucose concentrations affect protein synthesis, protein degradation; and expression of genes associated with muscle growth and proteolysis in MPCs. We found that following 24\u202fh and 48\u202fh of treatment with low glucose media (5.6\u202fmM), myoblasts had significant decreases in protein synthesis.

In this study, a new cDNA encoding type I CHH peptide, termed Sp-CHH3, was isolated from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain and its potential functions were investigated. The full length cDNA of Sp-CHH3 was identified as encoding a 127-aa precursor composed of a 27-aa signal peptide, a 23-aa CHH precursor-related peptide and a 75-aa mature peptide with a typical motif of CHH. Phylogenic analysis suggested that, Sp-CHH3 is a previously unreported CHH from S. paramamosain. Tissue distribution analysis showed that Sp-CHH3 was mainly expressed in the eyestalk ganglia, thoracic ganglia, stomach and the ovary. A RNA interference experiments showed that after injection of Sp-CHH3-targeted dsRNA, both the level of Sp-CHH3 expression in the eyestalk ganglia and hemolymph glucose level decreased significantly. A further short-term starvation experiments demonstrated that, the level of Sp-CHH3 detected in the eyestalk ganglia was significantly up-regulated at the 12th h of starvation, it then fell back at the 24th h of starvation and subsequently remained relative stability between the 24th to 96th h of starvation. The hemolymph glucose level decreased significantly (P\u202f<\u202f.05) at each sampling time during the 96\u202fh starvation duration when compared to that of 0\u202fh (prior to starvation) and the overall trend was largely correlated with the level of Sp-CHH3 expression in the eyestalk ganglia.

The effects of serotonin are mediated through interactions of several 5-HT receptor types. The expression and pharmacological properties of 5-HT1 have received more attention than other serotonin receptors, but its functions at the individual level are little studied in arthropods. Silkworm, a Lepidoptera model, almost has no reports about serotonin receptors. To analyze the function of Bm5-HT1A receptor in vitro, the ORF of Bm5-HT1A was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector and expressed in HEK 293 cells. Serotonin activation of Bm5-HT1A-expressing cells decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis and had the most potent effect compared to other biogenic amines. Serotonin reduced cAMP synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, and half-maximal activation (EC50) occurred at a concentration of 1.17\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127\u202fM (117\u202fnM).

The crucian carp is usually more abundant than the common carp in high predation-pressure habitats. To verify whether the crucian carp exhibits a significantly higher survival capacity combined with additional antipredator strategies than the common carp, we measured the morphology, behavioral traits, fast-start escape swimming performance and survival time under predation in both fish species. Additionally, the relationships between morphology, behavioral traits, locomotion and survival in both fish species were analyzed to determine which components can explain survival. We found that the crucian carp showed significantly higher survival times combined with greater body depth and fast-start escape performance than did the common carp, and the fast-start escape performance may be the main reason that the crucian carp showed a higher survival capacity. Additionally, the predator (Channa argus) chased the common carp more frequently when exposed to both species simultaneously. The higher survival capacity of the crucian carp and the preference of the predator for the common carp may be partial reasons that crucian carp were more abundant in habitats with high-predation pressure. Despite the differences among species, only the fast-start maximum velocity and exploration of the crucian carp were significantly related to survival time based on Pearson correlations. Overall, the relationships between the components measured in this study and survival in both fish species were quite weak or even lacking, which may be associated with the lack of predation experience in the fish specimens used.",

To answer these questions, we evaluated in vivo the effects of E injections on glucose and triglycerides in the hemolymph and tissue glycogen levels of crabs fed with HC or HP diet. An in vitro investigation was carried out to assess the direct effects of E on glycogenolysis, lipolysis and glycolysis pathways in the hepatopancreas, mandibular muscle and anterior and posterior gills of this crab. E injections increased glucose and did not affect triglycerides levels in the hemolymph of either group of crabs, and E decreased glycogen in the hepatopancreas and mandibular muscle only in HP crabs, suggesting that these effects may be mediated by the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH). When the tissues were incubated with different concentrations of E, the concentration of glucose released to the medium decreased in the hepatopancreas and posterior gills, while glucose oxidation increased in the posterior gills of HP crabs. Incubation with E did not alter any parameter in tissues of HC crabs. These effects suggest that E may be involved in the metabolic response to osmotic stress.",

Much less is known about the impacts of elevated PO2 (hyperoxia) on cardiac performance and energetics, especially in fishes. The fish heart is of particular interest because cardiac dependence on oxygen is extremely variable between species and the early evolution of fish occurred when atmospheric PO2 was higher than current conditions. Although extracellular PO2 is variable and normally does not exceed 21\u202fkPa, recent evidence suggests that teleost cardiac function is stimulated at supraphysiological PO2 values. The purpose of this study was to address whether cardiac contractility and energy metabolism is responsive to elevated PO2 values in sexually-immature female rainbow trout. Isometric force development (contractility) and oxygen consumption ( V \u0307 O 2 ) were recorded in electrically-paced ventricular preparations. Contractility and V \u0307 O 2 decreased when superfusate PO2 was decreased from ~70\u202fkPa to 57\u202fkPa or 45\u202fkPa. However, PO2 calculated at the preparation core was always above 18\u202fkPa. This estimate, along with complete recovery of contractility and V \u0307 O 2 at ~70\u202fkPa, suggests that decreases observed in cardiac performance were not due to tissue hypoxia at the lower PO2 levels. In conclusion, the heart of female rainbow trout may be oxygen-limited in vitro and this study raises new questions about the choice of appropriate PO2 for experimentation, the relevance of elevated and varying PO2 to measurements of cardiac performance, and the possible existence of an oxygen sensor within rainbow trout cardiomyocytes.",

In this study, we present results in a captive population that demonstrate strong effects of ambient temperature on the tail beat frequency and swimming speed of a pelagic fish in both pre- and post-prandial states. We measured the responses of a ram ventilator, the Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), after digestion of a meal to explore the impacts of the metabolic costs of digestion on behavior and respiration. A combination of respirometry, physiological biologging of visceral temperatures, and activity monitoring with accelerometry were used to explore the metabolic costs of digestion and the impacts on ventilation and swimming speed. Experiments were conducted at temperatures that are within the metabolic optimum for Pacific bluefin tuna (17\u202f\u00b0C), and at a second temperature corresponding to the upper distributional limit of the species in the California Current (24\u202f\u00b0C). Warmer temperatures resulted in higher tail-beat frequency and greater elevation of body temperature in pre-prandial Pacific bluefin tuna. Specific dynamic action (SDA) events resulted in a significant postprandial increase in tail-beat frequency of ~0.2\u202fHz, compared to pre-prandial levels of 1.5\u202fHz (17\u202f\u00b0C) and 1.75\u202fHz (24\u202f\u00b0C), possibly resulting from ventilatory requirements. Data of fish exercised in a swim-tunnel respirometer suggest that the observed increase in tail-beat frequency comprise 5.5 and 6.8% of the oxygen demand during peak SDA at 24\u202f\u00b0C and 17\u202f\u00b0C respectively. The facultative increase in swimming speed might increase oxygen uptake at the gills to meet the increasing demand by visceral organs involved in the digestive process, potentially decreasing the available energy of each meal for other metabolic processes, such as growth, maturation, and reproduction. We hypothesize that these post-prandial behaviors allow tuna to evacuate their guts more quickly, ultimately permitting fish to feed more frequently when prey is available.",

Phenotypic plasticity allows animals to handle environmental changes. However, the patterns of flexibility in metabolic rates and its ecological consequences under different predator stress and food availability conditions are poorly understood. Here, we used crucial carp (Carassius auratus) as a prey species and northern snakehead (Channa argus) as a predator to test whether predator stress influences metabolism and growth, and alters the link between flexibility in metabolic rate and its ecological consequences (e.g., growth) in crucial carp. The experiment was carried out under the conditions of predator stress (with or without a predator) and three food availabilities (satiation feeding 1 time per day, low food availability; 2 times per day, intermediate food availability; and 3 times per day, high food availability) for 3\u202fweeks. After 21\u202fdays of feeding, the final body mass and body length in the two treatments increased compared to the initial values in all three food availabilities.

The control treatment had a higher FI and SGR than the predator stress treatment in all three food availabilities. The feeding efficiency (FE) of the two treatments was higher at the high and intermediate food availabilities than at the low food availability. However, no effect of predator stress on FE was detected. The final values of original or standardized SMR were higher in the control treatment than the predator stress treatment at the intermediate and high food availabilities. The changes in SMR (\u0394SMR) were higher in the control treatment than in the predator stress treatment. The positive correlation between the \u0394SMR and SGR was found in the intermediate food availability in the predator stress treatment, suggesting that individuals with a higher flexibility in SMR had a larger growth rate and vice versa, but this relationship was dependent on food availability. Our results suggest that predator stress decreased maintenance metabolism, feeding and growth of juvenile crucial carp irrespective of food availability. Predator stress does not alter the growth advantages conferred by the metabolic plasticity of the fish under changing food availability.",

     "abstract": "The brain-pituitary-gonadal (BPG) axis regulates the activation of the endocrine machinery that triggers reproduction, which is a typical rhythmic process. In this research we focused on investigating the daily expression rhythms of the key reproductive genes involved in the BPG axis and the liver of zebrafish. To this end, male and female zebrafish were subjected to a stimulating photoperiod with a 14\u202fh light:10\u202fh dark cycle. Brain, pituitary and gonads, as well as female liver samples, were taken every 4\u202fh during a 24\u202fh\u202fcycle. The results revealed that most genes exhibited statistically significant daily rhythms. Most of the brain reproductive genes (gnrh2, gnrh3, kiss1, kiss2 and gnrhr3) displayed a daily rhythm of expression with a nocturnal acrophase (between Zeitgeber Time [ZT] 14:34\u202fh and ZT18:34\u202fh, lights off at ZT\u202f=\u202f14\u202fh). The male kiss2 gene presented neither significant rhythms nor daily variations, while the male gnrh3 and female kiss2 genes exhibited diurnal peaks of expression at ZT06:34\u202fh and ZT04:34\u202fh, respectively. In contrast, the pituitary genes (fsh\u03b2, lh\u03b2, gnrhr2) showed daily rhythms of expression with an acrophase during the light phase (between ZT02:10\u202fh and ZT10:35\u202fh). The female gnrhr3 gene exhibited neither significant rhythms nor daily variations. The male gnrhr3 gene presented a nocturnal acrophase (ZT14:32\u202fh). The gonad genes (star, cyp17a1, 20\u03b2hsd, lhr, fshr, cyp19a1a, foxl2, amh, dmrt1 and 11\u03b2hsd) revealed statistically significant daily rhythms with nocturnal acrophases, except for female cyp17a1a (ZT06:21\u202fh) and 20\u03b2hsd (ZT05:19\u202fh). Lastly, the female liver genes presented daily rhythms with a maximum peak of expression around the transition phase from darkness to light (ZT01:00\u202fh for er\u03b1 and at ZT23:09\u202fh for vtg2). These findings are consistent with the daily reproduction rhythms displayed by zebrafish, which are timed by the reproductive axis. Considering that reproductive success is critical for survival of the species, the knowledge of the rhythms of the endocrine BPG machinery provides useful information to understand the reproduction process and to establish optimal protocols and conditions for reproductive treatments.",

In milkfish (Chanos chanos), gill NKA has been widely investigated and found to alter its expression (both mRNA and protein) and activity in response to environmental salinity changes. However, the expression and roles of the regulatory proteins of NKA, the FXYD proteins, in milkfish gills upon salinity challenge is not yet clear. Hence, this study illustrated the potential roles of milkfish branchial FXYD proteins in modulating NKA expression via identification and tissue distributions of FXYD proteins, as well as the effects of salinity on expression of gill fxyd and nka mRNA. Six milkfish FXYD proteins (CcFXYD) were identified. In milkfish gill, gill-specific Ccfxyd11 was the predominant member, followed by Ccfxyd9 and Ccfxyd8. Upon hypoosmotic challenges, increases in gill Ccfxyd11, Ccfxyd8, Ccnka \u03b11, and Ccnka \u03b21 mRNA as well as significantly positive correlations were observed. Moreover, after acute salinity changes, expression of gill Ccfxyd11 and Ccnka was found to change with ambient salinity, and significant positive correlations were also exhibited between Ccfxyd11 and Ccnka \u03b11. Overall, these results revealed close relationships between CcFXYD11 and CcNKA \u03b11 in milkfish gills, highlighting the potential roles of CcFXYD11 in osmoregulation.",

Herein, we report the molecular characterisation of two MRFs, myogenin (myog) and myogenic factor 6 (myf6) in Indian snow trout Schizothorax richardsonii. The full length mRNA sequence of Srmyog and Srmyf6 was 1437 and 1296\u202fbp, with an ORF of 762 and 720\u202fbp, encoding a putative protein of 253 and 239 amino acids, respectively. In silico analysis and predicted tertiary protein structure revealed that both these nuclear localized MRFs contained the highly conserved basic helix loop helix motif, to potentially aid in dimerization with functional partners and DNA binding. Phylogenetically, the deduced protein sequences of Srmyog and Srmyf6 closely clustered with high altitude dwelling cyprinids, suggesting common ancestry. Tissue-wise, transcripts of Srmyog and Srmyf6 were abundant in skeletal muscle, affirming their muscle-specific role. Moreover, Srmyog was highly expressed in females as compared to males, whereas Srmyf6 expression was higher in older-bigger individuals as compared to younger-smaller fish. Nutritional status (fed-starved-refed) and diet composition (protein and lipid levels) had no significant influence on Srmyog expression. But, Srmyf6 expression was elevated in fishes re-fed after 3\u202fweeks of starvation and in those fed low protein diet. Only rearing temperature was found to coherently influence Srmyog and Srmyf6 transcripts, with highest expression at 18\u202f\u00b0C, which favoured growth. Overall, molecular characterisation of the structure and regulation of these MRFs is the first step taken towards deciphering slow growth in this important Himalayan cyprinid.",

Aegla schmitti were exposed to FW and dilute seawater of salinities 15, 20, and 25\u2030 for 1, 5 and 10\u202fdays. Mortality in 35\u2030 was also assessed. Hemolymph osmolality, Na+, K+, Cl\u2212, and Mg2+ ions, and hydration levels of the abdominal muscle were assayed. The activities of the Carbonic Anhydrase (CA), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-H+-ATPase (VHA) were also assayed in the gills. A. schmitti preserves osmoregulatory mechanisms of its marine ancestors. It is able to survive in high salinities (25\u2030) for at least 10\u202fdays. Mortality in 35\u2030 was of 56% after 1\u202fday, and of 100% after 7\u202fdays. In 25\u2030, NaCl is apparently hyporegulated at all times, while hemolymph osmolality rises after 5\u202fdays. CA and NKA activities remained unchanged in all experimental conditions, while VHA activity decreased after 10\u202fdays in 25\u2030. Hemolymph NaCl data was compatible with either hyporegulation and/or putative influx of NaCl into cells for regulatory volume increase (RVI). Further studies should deepen the understanding of the roles of low permeabilities and saturation of high affinity uptake systems in truly FW decapods, in their responses to high salinities. Moreover, the fate of extracellular NaCl as secretion in true hypo-regulation and/or influx into cells for RVI should also be investigated.",

     "abstract": "In aquaculture facilities fish welfare could be compromised due to stressors. Fish deal with stress, inter alia, through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal endocrine axis and, as a result, corticosteroids are released into the blood. Recent studies have described that corticosteroids actions depend on the specific affinities to their receptors, and the subsequent differentiated responses. Cortisol is the main corticosteroid hormone in teleost fish, being its actions dependent on the intensity and time of exposure to stressors. Short-term effects of corticosteroids are well described, but long-term effects, including changes in the energy management directly affecting growth and survival, are less understood in fish. Here we show the effects of chronic oral administration of cortisol and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DXM) on the intermediary metabolism of the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). We described a higher energy expenditure associated to both corticosteroids resulting in lower growth rates of fish. Moreover, the effects of these compounds were tissue-dependant, with differences between both hormones. Thus, cortisol-fed animals accumulated triglycerides in the liver, while DXM treatment led to glycogen storage. Cortisol and DXM stimulated amino acids catabolism and gluconeogenic pathways in muscle and gills, but the effects were significantly enhanced in DXM-fed fish. The described effects highlighted differentiated mechanisms of action associated to both corticosteroids under chronic stress conditions. Further studies should aim at describing those pathways in detail, with special attention to the functionality of glucocorticoid receptor isoforms. The effects described here for S. aurata juveniles, may serve as a basis to assess long-term stress in future comparative studies with other aquaculture species.",

     "abstract": "The European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a teleost remarkably adapted to a wide range of water salinity, through osmoregulatory mechanisms, mainly operating in the gills and the intestine. As an important aquaculture species, its rearing in low-salinity conditions offers benefits for its inland culture. However, this demands a full comprehension of the European seabass osmoregulatory mechanisms and its response to acclimation protocols. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different acclimation protocols in terms of osmoregularity and stress response, following transferring of European seabass juveniles from seawater to freshwater. In addition, nutrient absorption was also examined since drinking rates are sensitive to salinity. The acclimation challenge was applied through three protocols: direct transfer (0\u202fh) to freshwater, gradual transfer during 3\u202fh and during 72\u202fh. The short- (1\u202fh after complete change to freshwater) and long-term effects (after 2\u202fmonths) of each acclimation protocol were evaluated by assessing the expression of 1. The osmoregulatory genes: Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11, Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 1 co-transporter, aquaporins 1 and 3, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; 2. The heat shock protein 70 gene; 3. The peptide transporter genes corresponding to PepT1a, PepT1b and PepT2. The short-term acclimation response was pronounced in both gills and the intestine affecting stress-, osmoregulatory- and nutrient-related gene expression. Long-term effects were only evident in the intestine. Direct transfer in freshwater mainly induced a long-term stress response, while the short-term effect was more pronounced in the 3\u202fh-transfer, potentially due to handling. Our results suggest that although the European seabass can withstand direct transfer to low-salinity conditions, a gradual transfer is recommended to prevent long-term stress effects.",

M. amblycephala (average initial weight 2.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.15\u202fg) were reared at two different initial densities (low density group [LD] had 534 fish/m3 and high density group [HD] had 1073 fish/m3) for 90\u202fdays. The growth performance was adversely influenced by the high stocking density. The HD group had elevated white blood cell counts, hemoglobin content, and hematocrit on days 60 and 90. The mRNA levels of NOX2 on days 60 and 90, Nrf2 on days 30, 60, and 90, Keap1 on day 30, Bach1 on days 30 and 60, SOD on day 30, and CAT on day 30 were significantly higher in the HD group than in the LD group. Similarly, higher trends were observed in the enzymatic activities of SOD on day 60, CAT on days 60 and 90, and GPx on day 60 in the HD group, compared to the LD group. Furthermore, HD bream showed an increased MDA content on days 60 and 90 compared to that of the LD group. This study demonstrates that high density-induced antioxidant defenses were involved in modifications to the enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of Nrf2-Keap1 signaling molecules and that M. amblycephala growth was reduced in a crowded IPRS.",

     "abstract": "The most capricious environmental variable in aquatic habitats, dissolved O2, is fundamental to the fitness and survival of fish. Using swim tunnel respirometry we test how acute exposure to reduced O2 levels, similar to those commonly encountered by fish in crowded streams and on commercial aquaculture farms, affect metabolic rate and swimming performance in Atlantic salmon of three size classes: 0.2, 1.0 and 3.5\u202fkg. Exposure to 45\u201355% dissolved O2 saturation substantially reduced the aerobic capacity and swimming performance of salmon of all sizes. While hypoxia did not affect standard metabolic rate, it caused a significant decrease in maximum metabolic rate, resulting in reduced absolute and factorial aerobic scope. The most pronounced changes were observed in the smallest fish, where critical swimming speed was reduced from 91 to 70\u202fcm\u202fs\u22121 and absolute aerobic scope dropped by 62% relative to the same measurement in normoxia. In normoxia, absolute critical swimming speed (Ucrit) increased with size, while relative Ucrit, measured in body lengths s\u22121, was highest in the small fish (3.5) and decreased with larger size (medium\u202f=\u202f2.2). Mass specific metabolic rate and cost of transport were inversely related to size, with calculated metabolic scaling exponents of 0.65 for bSMR and 0.78 for bMMR. Metabolic O2 demand increased exponentially with current speed irrespective of fish size (R2\u202f=\u202f0.97\u20130.99). This work demonstrates that moderate hypoxia reduces the capacity for activity and locomotion in Atlantic salmon, with smaller salmon most vulnerable to hypoxic conditions. As warm and hypoxic conditions become more prevalent in aquatic environments worldwide, understanding local O2 budgets is critical to maximizing the welfare and survival of farmed and wild salmon.",

Thus, we investigated the effects of dietary corticosteroids (7\u202fdays; long-term exposure) and transport (4\u202fh; short-term stress) on stress and innate immune response in pacu. For this end, fish were fed with diets containing dexamethasone (100\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121) or hydrocortisone (200\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121), followed by transport, and then were intraperitoneally inoculated with heat-killed Aeromonas hydrophila or PBS (sham-inoculation). Fish were sampled after a 7-day feeding period, immediately post-transport and 24\u202fh post-transport and inoculation. The dietary treatment of corticosteroids decreased resting cortisol levels by inhibiting the production of cortisol on the hypothalamus pituitary interrenal-axis. Further, both corticosteroids reduced hematocrit, red blood cells, haemoglobin and hemolytic activity of the complement, while they increased glucose levels and serum lysozyme concentrations. The transport increased cortisol and glucose levels and reduced the humoral immune defenses such as serum lysozyme concentration and hemolytic activity of the complement system. Interestingly, the hemolytic activity of the complement system increased sharply in fish fed with corticosteroids immediately post-transport, when they had their HPI-axis partially suppressed by the corticosteroids. This finding suggests a stimulatory effect of the catecholamines released during the transport on the activity of the complement system. Our results are highly valuable to understanding the stress and innate immune responses to long-term exposure to corticosteroids and short-term stress in fish and may provide insights into how corticosteroids modulate the innate immune system.",

     "abstract": "Land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) have been used to rear salmon from smolt to market-sized adults, but high operating costs have limited their wide spread adoption. One clear advantage of using RAS for salmon aquaculture over open net pens is that fish can be reared under optimal conditions in an attempt to maximize growth and physiological performance and reduce overall production costs. However, few studies have attempted to define the optimal conditions for the long-term rearing of salmon. Thus, the goal of this study is to determine the effects of salinity and photoperiod, two factors that can be easily manipulated in RAS, on the physiological performance of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) during long-term rearing. To address this goal, post-smolt coho salmon were reared for 150\u202fdays in replicate RAS at 2.5, 5, 10 and 30\u202fppt under either 12:12 and 24:0 (light:dark) photoperiods. Routine metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, aerobic scope and hypoxia tolerance were measured at 60 and 120\u202fdays of rearing, while swimming performance was assessed at 60 and 150\u202fdays of rearing. There were no effects of salinity or photoperiod on metabolic rate measurements, hypoxia tolerance or swimming performance at any sampling time. There were, however, significant effects of salinity and photoperiod on post-swimming hematology. The results suggest that physiological disturbances continue to manifest due to different environmental conditions, despite acclimation, but do not hinder the animal's ability to cope with physiological stressors. Overall, rearing salinity and photoperiod had very few measurable effects on the physiology and performance of coho salmon except the ionoregulatory disturbances following swimming at salinities of 2.5 and 30\u202fppt.",

     "abstract": "The timing with which salmonid larvae emerge from their gravel nests is thought to be correlated with a particular suite of behavioural and physiological traits that correspond to the stress coping style of the individual. Among these traits, aggressiveness, dominance and resilience to stress, are potentially interesting to exploit in aquaculture production. In the present study a series of experiments were performed, with the purpose of characterising behavioural, metabolic and production related traits in rainbow trout juveniles from different emergence fractions. Newly hatched rainbow trout were sorted according to their emergence time from an artificial redd. The early, middle, and late fractions were retained and assessed for their physiological response to stress, growth performance, metabolism, fasting tolerance, and potential for compensatory growth. The early emerging fraction showed proactive behavioural traits; they were faster to reappear following startling, showed a reduced cortisol response following stress, and a reduced metabolic cost of recovery. Emergence time was not correlated with any differences in standard or maximum metabolic rates, but was however, correlated with higher routine metabolic rates, as demonstrated by significantly bigger weight losses during fasting in the early emerging group. Growth rates and feed conversion efficiencies were not significantly different when fish were co-habitated under a restrictive feeding regime, suggesting that early emerging fish are not able to monopolise food resources. The intermediate emerging group, which makes up the bulk of a population and is often ignored, appears to possess the best growth performance traits, possibly because they do not expend excessive energy on dominance behaviour such as the early emerging group, while they are also not overly timid or stress prone such as the late emerging group.",

This study focuses on the sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria), an emerging aquaculture species that has a unique ecology in the wild. For instance, adults inhabit oxygen minimum zones and cool waters at depths up to 1500\u202fm. Using Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (~1132\u202fg adults) as a comparative species, we used intermittent-flow respirometry to characterize the tolerance and metabolic response of sablefish (~10\u202fg juveniles and ~675\u202fg adults) to acute increases in temperature (2\u202f\u00b0C\u202fh\u22121) and decreases in oxygen level (~10% air saturation h\u22121). Adult sablefish were much more hypoxia tolerant than adult salmon [O2 level at loss of equilibrium ~5.4% vs. ~24.2% air saturation, respectively]. In addition, sablefish could withstand upper temperatures only slightly lower than salmon [critical thermal maximum (CTmax) ~24.9\u202f\u00b0C vs. ~26.2\u202f\u00b0C, respectively]. Sablefish juveniles were both less hypoxia and thermally tolerant than adults [critical O2 tension ~18.9% vs. ~15.8% air saturation; CTmax ~22.7 vs. ~24.9\u202f\u00b0C, respectively]. Interestingly, many of these differences in environmental tolerance could not be explained by differences in metabolic parameters (aerobic scope or routine metabolic rate). Our findings show that sablefish are tolerant of high temperatures, and very tolerant of hypoxia, traits that are advantageous for an aquaculture species in the era of climate change.",

Cortisol affects many biological functions including immunity, stress, growth, and reproduction. The objective of this study was to investigate the ontogeny of the cortisol and GR stress response in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) at several early life stages. To accomplish this, resting and stress-induced levels of tissue cortisol and the two catfish GRs (GR-1 and GR-2) expression were measured. Resting cortisol levels in newly fertilized eggs averaged 2.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fng/egg and decreased to 0.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.01\u202fng/egg by day 5. Cortisol levels in newly fertilized eggs subjected to an acute stress (lowered dissolved oxygen from 6.5\u202fmg/L to 1.8\u202fmg/L) averaged 2.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fng/egg and decreased to 0.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202fng/egg by day 5. At hatching, resting cortisol levels were 24\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fng/0.1\u202fg tissue while levels increased to 83\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.0\u202fng/0.1\u202fg tissue in fry subjected to an acute stress (P\u202f<\u202f.05). Four days post-hatch, resting cortisol levels were 83\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202fng/0.1\u202fg tissue while levels increased to 149\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.0\u202fng/0.1\u202fg tissue in fry subjected to an acute stress (P\u202f<\u202f.01). There was no significant difference between GR-1 and GR-2 mRNA in stressed and unstressed newly hatched fry. Four days post-hatch, GR-1 mRNA increased 3-fold while GR-2 mRNA increased 2-fold in fry that were subjected to low dissolved oxygen conditions (P\u202f<\u202f.05). These results indicate that cortisol biosynthesis, integration and maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis can be observed in channel catfish at hatching. The upregulation of GR-1 and -2 mRNA in stressed fry supports roles for both transcripts in integrating the channel catfish stress response.",

Farmed carnivorous fish under high carbohydrate diets tend to increase adiposity but it remains unclear if this happens by increased lipid retention/accumulation, promotion of lipogenic pathways, or both. In order to determine the response of extrahepatic tissue to dietary starch, European (Dicentrarchus labrax) and Asian (Lates calcarifer) seabass were fed a control (low starch; LS) or experimental (high starch; HS) diet, for at least 21\u202fdays and then transferred for 6\u202fdays to saltwater enriched with deuterated water 2H2O. Incorporation of 2H-labelling follows well-defined metabolic steps, and analysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) 2H-enrichment by 2HNMR allowed evaluation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in muscle and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Fractional synthetic rates for TAG-bound fatty acids and glycerol were quantified separately providing a detailed lipogenic profile. The FA profile differed substantially between muscle and VAT in both species, but their lipogenic fluxes revealed even greater differences. In European seabass, HS promoted DNL of TAG-bound FA, in muscle and VAT. High 2H-enrichment also found in muscle TAG-bound glycerol was indicative of its role on lipid cycling. In Asian seabass, HS had no effect on muscle FA composition and lipogenic flux, with no 2H-enriched TAG being detected. VAT on the other hand revealed a strong enhancement of DNL in HS-fed fish along with high TAG-bound glycerol cycling. This study consolidated the use of 2H2O as tracer for fish lipid metabolism in different tissues, under different dietary conditions and suitable to use in different fish models.",

This study evaluated the role of forskolin on reducing fat accumulation in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by using in vitro and in vivo experiments. The use of 50\u202f\u03bcM forskolin in vitro increased free fatty acid and glycerol release, but decreased triglyceride in adipocytes and hepatocytes. The adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha (PKAR I) and other genes related to \u03b2-oxidation (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha, PPAR\u03b1 and carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1, CPT1) were significantly up-regulated. After feeding a high-fat diet for six weeks, O. niloticus were fed with 0 (control), 0.5 and 1.5\u202fmg/kg forskolin for two weeks to determine whether forskolin could reduce fat accumulation in vivo. Fish fed the two levels of forskolin decreased significantly the hepatosomatic and mesenteric fat indices. The total lipid in the whole fish and liver together with the serum glycerol content were lower in fish fed on forskolin than in the control. The fish fed on forskolin diets exhibited smaller areas of lipid droplets in adipose and liver tissues. Lipolysis related genes (ATGL, hormone-sensitive lipase, HSL; monoacylglycerol lipase, MGL; and protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit, PKAC) and \u03b2-oxidation genes (PPAR\u03b1; fatty acid binding protein 1, FABP1; and CPT1) in the adipose were up-regulated. Similarly, in the liver lipolysis genes such as ATGL and PKAR I and \u03b2-oxidation genes (PPAR\u03b1, FABP1, CPT1 and acyl-CoA oxidase, ACO) showed an increasing trend with the increase of forskolin doses.

Both sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) are the key regulators of fatty acid metabolism. In this study, the coding sequences (CDS) of SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b1 were firstly identified and characterized from Onychostoma macrolepis, encoding peptides of 1136 and 470 amino acids, respectively. The functional domains in O. macrolepis SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b1 proteins retained the high similarity with those of other animals, at 74.69% and 77.29%, respectively. The mRNA encoding SREBP-1 was primarily expressed in the muscle and PPAR\u03b1 was highly expressed in the liver and intestine. Under thermal exposure, the content of non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) decreased gradually after 1\u202fh in the liver and muscle of O. macrolepis, which might be due to that the organism meet more energy expenditure via fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of SREBP-1 decreased, while the mRNA expression level of PPAR\u03b1 increased from 0\u202fh to 6\u202fh in the liver. And we found that the mRNA expression levels of both SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b1 decreased significantly at 48\u202fh (P\u202f<\u202f.05) in the muscle, which was in accordance with the significant decrease of target gene FAS and CPT1A mRNA expression levels, respectively. It might be the physiological adjustment that the fish adapted to thermal exposure at the end of experiment.

Despite increasing cardiac contractility (increasing twitch force and contraction kinetics in isometric myocardial strip preparations) and accelerating heart rate (\u0192H), adrenaline (5\u202fnmol\u202fkg\u22121 bolus intra-arterial injection) did not significantly increase cardiac output (Q\u0307) in vivo because it elicited a large decrease in vascular conductance (Gsys).

To understand the adaptation mechanisms to cope with low or high temperatures, we investigated global epigenetic modifications, histone variants, transcript levels of related genes, and the cellular acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and free CoA (CoA-SH) levels, in the livers of tadpoles collected in summer and winter and of those acclimated to 4\u202f\u00b0C and 21\u202f\u00b0C. Among epigenetic marks tested, the levels of acetylated histones and the histone variant H2A.Z were influenced by different temperature conditions. Histone acetylation levels were higher in summer than in winter and increased within 3\u202fdays of warm acclimation, whereas histone H2A.Z levels were higher in winter than in summer and decreased within 2\u202fweeks of warm acclimation. Transcript analysis revealed that decreased expression of histone H2A.Z in warm acclimation was regulated at the transcriptional level. Acetyl-CoA levels were not correlated with those of the acetylated histones, indicating that cellular acetyl-CoA levels may not directly influence the state of histone acetylation in the tadpole liver. Such epigenetic and metabolic changes in the tadpole liver may contribute to the maintenance of energy balance during seasonal acclimatization and thermal acclimation.",

For example, bees generally feed on pollen and nectar, whereas wasps also actively hunt and scavenge heavy prey. These variations in metabolic demands may result in different capacities of metabolic pathways in flight muscle, and utilisation some of these pathways may come at a cost of increased free radical production. To examine how metabolic requirements and oxidative stress vary between species, we explored the variation in flight mechanics and metabolism of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), and German wasp (Vespula germanica). Wing structures and flight muscle properties were compared alongside measures of oxygen flux and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from permeabilised flight muscle. The wasp wing structure is best adapted for carrying heavy loads, with the highest wing aspect ratio, lowest wing loading, and highest flight muscle ratio. Bumblebees had the lowest wing aspect ratio and flight muscle ratio, and highest wing loading. Although wasps also had the highest rates of oxygen consumption during oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen consumption did not increase in the wasp muscle following chemical uncoupling, while it did for the two bee species. While mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) mediated oxygen flux was greatest in wasps, muscle fibres released greater amounts of ROS through this pathway. Overall, the wasp has maximised lifting capacities through varying wing and flight muscle mass and by maximising OXPHOS capacities, and this accompanies elevated ROS production.",

     "abstract": "Animals living in the intertidal zone must adapt to thermal variability, including adjustments in metabolism. We examined metabolic responses to temperature in the copepod, Tigriopus californicus, which inhabits supratidal splash pools along the Pacific coast of North America. We maintained three populations of T. californicus at 20\u202f\u00b0C, one from southern California (San Diego, \u201cSD\u201d) and two from Oregon (Fogarty Creek, \u201cFCN\u201d, Boiler Bay, \u201cBOB\u201d) and examined possible geographic patterns in metabolism. We measured oxygen consumption rate ( V \u0307 o2) at 20\u202f\u00b0C and following 48\u202fh (chronic) acclimation to 25, 27.5 and 30\u202f\u00b0C. V \u0307 o2 was temperature-independent, with temperature quotients (Q10) values \u22641 in all populations, indicative of metabolic compensation. We detected no variation in V \u0307 o2 or survival between populations. To explore the time course of metabolic compensation, we performed an acute acclimation experiment in which V \u0307 o2 was measured at 20\u202f\u00b0C, following immediate exposure to 25\u202f\u00b0C, and following 2\u202fh, 4\u202fh and 6\u202fh exposure to 25\u202f\u00b0C. This acute acclimation experiment revealed that V \u0307 o2 increased immediately in SD and FCN, but was no longer different than 20\u202f\u00b0C levels by 2\u202fh and 4\u202fh at 25\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. BOB showed no significant change in V \u0307 o2, which may indicate complete temperature-independent metabolism or different mechanisms of compensation between populations. This study demonstrates a time course of rapid metabolic compensation in response to temperature that occurs in a small intertidal animal, and suggests intertidal invertebrates can thermally acclimate within a few hours of a significant temperature change.",

     "abstract": "Land-based, closed containment salmon aquaculture involves rearing salmon from smolt to adult in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Unlike in open-net pen aquaculture, rearing conditions can be specified in RAS in order to optimize growth and physiological stress tolerance. The environmental conditions that yield optimal stress tolerance in salmon are, however, unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we reared Atlantic (Salmo salar) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon in 7 separate RASs for 400\u202fdays post-smoltification under 2 photoperiods (24:0 or 12:12, light:dark) and 4 salinities (2.5, 5, 10 or 30\u202fppt.) and assessed the effects of these conditions on thermal tolerance. We found that over the first 120\u202fdays post-smoltification, rearing coho under a 24:0 photoperiod resulted in a ~2\u202f\u00b0C lower critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than in coho reared under a 12:12 photoperiod. This photoperiod effect did not persist at 200 and 400\u202fdays, which was coincident with an overall decrease in CTmax in coho. Finally, Atlantic salmon had a higher CTmax (~28\u202f\u00b0C) compared to coho (~26\u202f\u00b0C) at 400\u202fdays post-smoltification. Overall, these findings are important for the future implications of RAS and for the aquaculture industry to help identify physiologically sensitive time stages.",

     "abstract": "Aquaculture jeopardizes the aquatic environment by discharge of the most dietary phosphorus (P) into the water. Reducing the dietary P level is a common approach for decreasing the P discharge but it may result in increased risk of P deficiency leading to vertebral deformities. However, the molecular mechanism of vertebral deformities is poorly understood. We assessed vertebral transcriptome and compared the genes associated with bone metabolism in Japanese seabass (Lateolabrax japonicus) fed three diets containing different P and Ca levels including: diet I (0.4% P, 0.3% Ca), diet II (0.8% P, 0.3% Ca) and diet III (0.8% P, 3% Ca). The results showed that P deficiency reduces the ossification of vertebrae and induces visible vertebral deformities. Moreover, 256 gens were up-regulated and 125 genes were down-regulated in fish fed P deficient diets. Furthermore, administration of the diet with adequate P and Ca excess (diet III) resulted in the significant enhancement in expression of 19 genes and reduced expression of 93 genes. Comparing group II with group III, expression of 109 genes was up-regulated and expression of 1369 genes was down-regulated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed significant alterations in biological functions by P deficiency. In summary, these findings indicated that both dietary P shortage and Ca excess lead to reduced differentiation and proliferation of osteoblast and induce a higher activity of osteoclastogenesis, which could subsequently impair vertebral mineralization and cause skeletal deformities.",

     "abstract": "Aquatic organisms, including important cultured species, are forced to contend with acute changes in water temperature as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events worsen. Acute temperature spikes are likely to threaten aquaculture species, but dietary intervention may play an important protective role. Increasing the concentration of macronutrients, for example dietary fat content, may improve the thermal resilience of aquaculture species, however, this remains unexplored. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used two commercially available diets (20% versus 10% crude fat) to examine if dietary fat content improves the growth performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer) while increasing their resilience to acute thermal stress. Fish were fed their assigned diets for 28-days before assessing the upper thermal tolerance (CTMAX) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (UCRIT) and metabolism. We found that feeding fish a high fat diet resulted in heavier fish, but did not affect the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance or metabolism over an 18\u202f\u00b0C temperature range (from 20 to 38\u202f\u00b0C). Thermal tolerance was compromised in fish fed the high fat diet by 0.48\u202f\u00b0C, showing significantly lower CTMAX. Together, these results suggest that while a high fat diet increases juvenile L. calcarifer growth, it does not benefit physiological performance across a range of relevant water temperatures and may even reduce fish tolerance of extreme water temperatures. These data may have implications for aquaculture production in a warming world, where episodic extremes of temperature are likely to become more frequent.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "The present study is focused to elucidate the main characteristics of the digestive function of this carnivorous fast-growing fish living at high temperatures. With this aim, we have examined the effects of an increased temperature from 30 to 34\u202f\u00b0C on the daily pattern of gastrointestinal pH, enzymatic proteolytic digestive activity and the feed transit time in early juveniles of cobia (Rachycentron canadum), a species living in tropical and subtropical waters with an increasing aquaculture production. Fish were fed two meals a day. Gastric luminal pH was permanently acidic (mean pH values: 2.76\u20134.74) while the intestinal pH increased from neutral/slightly acidic to slightly alkaline when the digesta was present, with an increasing alkalinity from proximal to distal intestine (mean pH values: 6.05 to 7.69). The temperature did not affect the gastric pH but a slightly higher acidity was induced in the intestine at 34\u202f\u00b0C.Pepsin activity showed a daily rhythm at 30\u202f\u00b0C with maximum in the middle of the light period, while at 34\u202f\u00b0C some hourly changes coinciding with feed adding without a clear daily trend during the 24-h period were observed. The trypsin activity exhibited a daily rhythm at both temperatures with an increase after morning feeding to reach a maximum several hours later. Average pepsin activity during the daily cycle was slightly higher at 34\u202f\u00b0C (6.1 and 7.3\u202fU\u202fmg\u22121 BW at 30 and 34\u202f\u00b0C respectively), but values were significantly different only at 8 and 24\u202fh after the morning meal. Similarly, the trypsin activity was significantly affected by the temperature only at 8 and 16\u202fh after the morning meal, but daily activity averages were similar (1.20 and 1.29\u202fU\u202fg\u22121 BW at 30 and 34\u202f\u00b0C respectively).The partial transit rates of the first meal in the stomach for each period inter-samplings were higher during the first 4-h period and decreased progressively along the rest of the 24-h\u202fcycle at both temperatures, but no significant differences were detected at 30\u202f\u00b0C. In addition, the transit was notably faster at 34\u202f\u00b0C particularly during the first 8\u202fh after feeding, with rates between 100 and 65% of total volume displaced (intake or released) during each 4-h period. In the intestine the transit rate was relatively constant and similar at both temperatures during 12\u202fh after feeding. Then the rates remained very low during the following 12\u202fh.Residence time of the first meal was longer at 30 than at 34\u202f\u00b0C, particularly in the stomach (12\u202fh:02\u202fmin vs 4\u202fh:54\u202fmin respectively). In the intestine the difference was not so large (8\u202fh:18\u202fmin vs 6\u202fh:24\u202fmin respectively). In a parallel study under same conditions, cobia reared at 30\u202f\u00b0C grew faster and showed a more favorable feed conversion ratio than those at elevated temperature (34\u202f\u00b0C). The present results indicate that at 34\u202f\u00b0C, a subtle increase of proteolytic activity cannot compensate for the faster gut transit rate. Therefore, 30\u202f\u00b0C is more appropriate temperature for the early on-growing of cobia because at higher temperatures the digestion efficiency decrease being one of the causes for a lower growth.",

Fish (initial weight 32.4\u202fg) were fed four diets having similar DE levels (~18 kJ g\u22121) with a high (HP/E~26\u202fmg\u202fkJ\u22121) vs. low (LP/E~14\u202fmg\u202fkJ\u22121) DP/DE ratio using F or C as major NPE source (7\u202fweek-experiment). The lowering of dietary DP/DE ratio increased myoblast determination protein 1a (myod1a) and decreased myostatin 1b (mstn1b) and cathepsin D (ctsd) muscle mRNA levels. The isoenergetic change in dietary NPE from F to C decreased myod1a and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (pcna) muscle mRNA levels. An interaction between DP/DE ratio and NPE source was observed in muscle transcript levels of myogenic factor 6 (mrf4/myf6), fast myosin heavy chain (fmhc) and fast myosin light chain 2 (fmlc2). White muscle total cross-sectional area decreased at low dietary DP/DE ratio and also when NPE source changed from F to C, linked i) to a decreased total number of white muscle fibres, indicating that low dietary DP/DE restricted muscle hyperplasia and that dietary carbohydrate were less efficiently used than fat to sustain muscle hyperplasia, and ii) to decreased percentage of large muscle fibres, indicating limited fibre hypertrophy. Not only the DP level or the DP/DE ratio, but also the isoenergetic change in dietary NPE source (fat vs carbohydrates) thus appears as a potent regulator of muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy.",

The commercial importance and the overexploited status of natural stocks of A. gigas brought the interest to rear it in the Amazon region, but rearing techniques are not fully understood to obtain reproduction success. Gonadal steroids (plasma and cephalic liquid), lipids and proteins (muscles, liver and ovary) of wild A. gigas females were analyzed during one year on Mexiana Island (Amazon Basin, Brazil) and ovarian maturation stages were described. The sexual gender determination method based on 11-ketostestosterone (11KT) and estradiol (E2) ratio was applied to check if the value is in agreement of the sex previously determined by direct observation. Adult females were classified into four reproductive stages according to ovary development stage: previtellogenic, maturation, mature, and regression/spawning. Immature females were also analyzed. All mature females were sampled during the rainy season. Lipids stored in the ventrecha (belly) are a possible source of this substrate for the developing ovary. Plasma steroid profile throughout A. gigas female reproductive stages is similar to that found in most teleosts, but plasma 11KT levels peaked at the mature stage, suggesting an important role of this androgen in female ovulation. The 11KT/E2 method was 100% efficient when sexing juveniles and adults at the beginning of their reproductive cycle and can successfully be applied to identify the sexual gender of animals. The steroid profile of the cephalic liquid suggests a possible role of this fluid as a pheromone, due to the high level of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone at the final stages of the reproductive cycle.",

However, this species has a low growth rate under captive conditions, and the optimal feed ration together with the metabolic process is unknown. This study aimed to determine the optimum feed ration during 90\u202fdays based on growth performance, body composition, intermediary metabolism, and serum parameters. For this, fish were randomly assigned to rations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4% of body weight. No fish mortality was registered, but all fish, developed fatty liver. The results of weight, length, growth performance (WGR, SGR), and body parameters (HSI, VSI and K) followed a similar pattern, with the lowest values observed in the 0.5% and no significant differences between rations of 1, 2 and 4%. The feed intake and feces increased with the feed ration. However, the percentage of food consumed by the fish decreased with the ration size and the feed conversion ratio was lowest in the 1% ration. Total serum proteins and calcium were lowest in the 0.5% ration and presented no differences in the rations 1, 2 and 4%, while triglyceride content was significantly different only between the rations of 0.5 and 4%. Blood cortisol levels were significantly higher in the rations of 0.5 and 1%, and decreased in rations of 2 and 4%. The lipids, fiber, and energy of the total body mass increased with the feed ration, while dry matter, proteins, and ash of the body decreased to higher feed ration. In liver, triglyceride and protein levels decreased with a larger feed ration, amino acids increased in the rations of 0.5 and 4%, while glucose levels increased in rations of 2 and 4%. Liver enzymes Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and Glutamate dehydrogenase increased their activity at a higher feed ration, while Glycogen Phosphorylase, Aspartate aminotransferase and 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase presented their highest enzymatic activity only in the 4% ration. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate showed low enzymatic activity in rations of 2 and 4% and Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was significantly different only between the ration of 0.5 and 1%. Finally, our results suggests that optimal feed rations for E.\u202fmaclovinus corresponds to 1% since this ration size produces the highest growth and metabolism with a minimum loss of food and feces present in the environment.

The first objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of ammonia and urea excretion in mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) up to 102\u202f\u00a0hours post fertilization (hpf). Similar to other teleosts, mahi embryos are ureotelic before hatch and gradually switch to being ammoniotelic around the time of hatch. The second objective was to characterize mRNA levels of ammonia transporters (Rhag, Rhbg, Rhcg1 and Rhcg2), as well as urea transporter (UT) and sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHE3 and NHE2) during mahi development. As predicted, the mRNA levels of the Rhesus glycoprotein (Rh) genes, especially Rhag, Rhbg and the UT gene were highly consistent with the ontogeny of ammonia and urea excretion rates. Further, the localization of each transporter was examined in larvae collected at 60 and 102 hpf using in situ hybridization. Rhag was expressed in the gills, yolk sac, and operculum. Rhbg was expressed in the gills and upper mouth. Rhcg1 and NHE3 were co-localized in the sub-operculum, and Rhcg2 was expressed in the skin. Together, these results indicate that urea excretion is critical for ammonia detoxification during embryonic development and that Rh proteins are involved in ammonia excretion via gills and yolk sac, possibly facilitated by NHE3.",

We examined the effects of dietary antioxidants (\u03b2-carotene and vitamin E) on the ability of Lithobates sylvaticus (wood frog) tadpoles to overcome the detrimental effects imposed by two common environmental stressors \u2013 exposure to the herbicide atrazine or infection by a pathogenic helminth parasite (Echinostoma trivolvis). Tadpoles which were fed high concentrations of either vitamin E or \u03b2-carotene had a greater immune response compared to those given trace diets of either compound as measured by circulating white blood cells and a phytohemaglutination assay (PHA). Similarly, tadpoles in the herbicide and parasitism treatments that were given trace antioxidant diets had significant weight loss, whereas those consuming high levels of vitamin E or \u03b2-carotene did not. Our results suggest that dietary antioxidants, specifically \u03b2-carotene and vitamin E, have a positive effect on tadpole immune systems and overall condition that likely allows them to better cope with natural stressors, with potential implications for their foraging behaviour.",

B. splendens is a sedentary facultative air breather frequenting often hypoxic waters, while T. trichopterus is a more active obligatory air-breather inhabiting better oxygenated waters. Despite their close taxonomic relationship, previous studies have shown inter-specific differences in both physiological and morphological plasticity. Consequently, we hypothesized that B. splendens would have the higher blood oxygen affinity characteristics typical of more hypoxia-tolerant fishes. Whole blood oxygen equilibrium curves were determined at 27\u202f\u00b0C and pHs of 7.62, 7.44 and 7.25. At a pH of 7.62, the blood O2 affinity (P50) of B. splendens was just 2.9\u202fmmHg, while that of T. trichopterus was ~5 times higher at 14.7\u202fmmHg. There were no significant differences in P50 between males and females in either species. The Bohr coefficient in B. splendens and T. trichopterus was \u22121.79 and\u202f\u2212\u202f0.83, respectively. B. splendens, unlike T. trichopterus, showed a large Root effect. Hills cooperatively coefficient, n, was ~2 in both species, indicating a significant binding cooperative between oxygen and hemoglobin. Collectively, these differences in blood O2 transport characteristics in these two closely related species are likely correlated with the differing habitats in which they breed and inhabit as adults, as well as different activity levels. Finally, the very high blood O2 affinity of B. splendens is not extraordinary among air-breathing fish, as revealed by a review of the literature of blood oxygen affinity in air-breathing fishes.",

The influence of post-prandial hypoxia on oxygen consumption rate was also investigated to replicate the immersive feeding environment. Fed hagfish displayed a 1.9-fold increase in peak oxygen consumption relative to sham controls. This elevation in post-prandial oxygen consumption continued for 72\u202fh, during which the energy cost of digesting the meal (specific dynamic action; SDA) was 2.1\u202fkJ. Oxygen consumption rate increased when the post-prandial environment was hypoxic, a response suggesting a lack of hypoxia tolerance in this species. Feeding did not alter gut somatic index (percentage of digesta-free gut mass to whole body mass), but there was an increase in the mucosal thickness of the gut epithelium. Maltase activity in the gut was unchanged by feeding, but the activity of gut peptidases was increased significantly, consistent with a protein-based diet.

     "abstract": "Piwi proteins comprise a subfamily of Argonaute that plays a major role in germline development by association with a distinct class of small RNAs called Piwi interacting RNA (piRNA). Although the functions of Piwi in the development of germline cells as well as transposon regulation were reported in a number of mammalians and insects, developmental expression and function of Piwi subfamily in crustaceans is poorly known. This study is aimed at cloning and characterization of a Piwi cDNA in the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. The cDNA encoding a Piwi protein of P. monodon (PmPiwi1) was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The PmPiwi1 coding cDNA contains 2811\u202fnt encoding a putative protein of 936 amino acids, and was specifically expressed in testis and ovary, suggesting its possible function in gametogenesis. RNAi experiment showed that suppression of PmPiwi1 expression led to a significant up-regulation of retrotransposon gypsy2 and DNA element transposon mariner in shrimp testis. Investigation of the function of PmPiwi1 in spermatogenesis by sperm count showed significantly lower number of sperms in the spermatophore sac of PmPiwi1-knockdown shrimp compared with that in the control shrimp. Our study thus reported for the first time the cDNA encoding a Piwi protein in the shrimp P. monodon. Its roles in controlling transposons and spermatogenesis as implied by the results in this study will be important for understanding sperm development and could be useful for the improvement of reproduction in male shrimp in the future.",

     "abstract": "The vitellogenin receptor (VgR) is highly expressed in the ovaries where it is responsible for vitellogenin (Vg) deposition during oogenesis in insects. Therefore, identifying the VgR of insect pests, and understanding the mechanism regulating its expression, could lead to the development of pest management strategies based on disrupting reproduction. We cloned and identified VgR in the cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi, which is a serious pest of cruciferous vegetables in Asia. The regulation of VgR transcription by juvenile hormone (JH) was also investigated. The results show that C. bowringi VgR cDNA contains an open reading frame of 5310\u202fbp encoding 1769 amino acid residues. Protein domain prediction indicates that C. bowringi VgR belongs to the LDLR gene superfamily, having the same group of structural domains that has been well characterized in other insects. VgR mRNA was highly expressed in the ovaries of reproductive female cabbage beetles. Knockdown of VgR reduced yolk deposition in the ovaries, increased the accumulation of Vg proteins in the hemolymph and decreased the transcription of Vg1 and Vg2 in the fat body. RNA interference and hormone challenge experiments showed that JH induced VgR transcription via the JH intracellular receptor methoprene-tolerant (Met) and the JH-responsive transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1). Our results suggest that there is a feedback loop between VgR transcription in the ovaries and Vg transcription in the fat body. JH acting through Met-Kr-h1 pathway induces the transcription of the VgR that is essential for Vg uptake and reproductive development. These findings not only reveal the potential JH signaling mechanism regulating VgR transcription, but may also contribute to the development of pest control strategies based on disrupting endocrine-regulated reproduction.",

     "abstract": "Crustacean growth is characterized by molting, whereby the old exoskeleton is shed and replaced by a new and larger version. The cellular events that lead to molting are driven by steroid hormones (ecdysteroids) secreted by paired endocrine glands (Y-organs). Between molts, ecdysteroid production is suppressed by a polypeptide molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) released from neurosecretory cells in the eyestalks. Although a decrease in the MIH titer precedes the upsurge in ecdysteroidogenesis, it is hypothesized that a positive regulatory signal is also required for full activation of Y-organs. Existing data point to an intracellular Ca2+ signal. Ca2+ signaling is dependent on a tightly regulated Ca2+ gradient, achieved through membrane transport proteins. One such protein, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), pumps Ca2+ from cytosol to the lumen of the ER. We have recently cloned from Y-organs of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) a cDNA encoding a putative Cas-SERCA protein. In studies reported here, quantitative PCR (QPCR) was used to quantify Cas-SERCA transcript abundance in Y-organs during a molting cycle, and radioimmunoassay was used to quantify ecdysteroids in hemolymph. The abundance of the Cas-SERCA transcript in Y-organs increased gradually during pre-molt. Similarly, the level of ecdysteroids in hemolymph increased during pre-molt. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that Cas-SERCA functions to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis in Y-organs. Cas-SERCA transcript abundance also changed in several non-ecdysteroidogenic tissues during a molting cycle. The pattern of change differed among tissues suggesting a functional role for SERCA in each.",

We found a longer time to succumb in immature adults that we attribute to a larger tracheal volume. Time to succumb was also longer after autotomizing the hindlegs to reduce the energetic cost of muscular activity. Time to recover was longer in gregarious males and this developed during maturation, suggesting an increase in the cost of neural processing associated with social interactions under crowded conditions.

We tested the effect of season and acute food restriction and their interaction on the energetic cost of immune response activation of a tropical vertebrate, the Seba's short-tailed fruit bat (Carollia perspicillata). We specifically stimulated the acute phase response (APR) with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to measure metabolic changes along with changes in body temperature (Tb), body mass (Mb), white blood cell counts and the Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio (N/L). We found no effect of season on the different factors associated to the activation of the APR. In contrast to our expectations, unfed bats reached similar Tb increments and RMR peak values and had higher RMR scope values and higher caloric costs than fed bats after LPS injection. However, food deprivation led to delayed metabolic response indicated by longer time required to reach peak RMR values in unfed bats. Both food-deprived and fed bats did not present leukocytosis after APR activation and their WBC counts were similar, but unfed bats had a significant increase of N/L. APR activation represented a small fraction of the bat daily energy requirements which might explain why unfed bats were not limited to mount a metabolic response. Our study adds to recent evidence showing that activating the innate immune system is not an energetically expensive process for plant-eating bats.",

The goal of this project was to investigate differences in the capacity of diploid (8\u202fN) and triploid (12\u202fN) white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, to respond to both warm acclimation (6-weeks of acclimation to either 18 or 22\u202f\u00b0C) and a subsequent acute stress (10-min low water stress). Following the 6-week acclimation, fish were sampled either before or following an acute low water stress. Bioindices of the primary and secondary stress response, hematology and cellular metabolic status were measured. We also sought to determine if time to peak cortisol levels were similar between diploid and triploid sturgeon after exposure to a severe acute stressor (netting stress). While both ploidies had similar primary and secondary responses to acute stress, both with and without warm acclimation, warm acclimation impacted the ability of diploid and triploid white sturgeon to mount a typical stress response to an acute stressor. In response to warm acclimation, triploids exhibited little change in branchial lactate dehydrogenase activity, while diploids increased activity. After exposure to an acute water reduction stress, diploids increased citrate synthase activity, yet triploids showed a decrease in activity. Differences in metabolic enzyme activity in response to warm acclimation and acute stress suggest triploid white sturgeon may have a reduced cellular metabolic capacity under chronic and acute stress, which may impact performance of triploid sturgeon in suboptimal conditions.",

     "abstract": "A novel third channel catfish growth hormone secretagogue (ghrelin) receptor, GHS-R3a, gene was characterized. Identification and analysis of the genomic organization of channel catfish GHS-R3a revealed differences in exon/intron structure relative to the previously published GHS-R1a and GHS-R2a sequences. Amino acid sequence alignment of catfish GHS-R3a with -R1a and -R2a revealed 48 and 52% sequence identity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis predicted a new clade of GHS-R3a receptors found only in fish, with representation in the teleost infradivisions Osteoglossomorpha, Clupeomorpha, and Euteleostei. In functional analyses, homologous catfish ghrelin increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing catfish GHS-R3a. On the contrary, intracellular Ca2+ concentration was unaffected by treatment with the synthetic growth hormone secretagogues GHRP-6 and hexarelin. Realtime PCR results indicated high expression of GHS-R3a in the brain and gonads, demonstrating tissue specificity among the catfish GHS-Rs. The effects of fasting and refeeding on all three ghrelin receptors were evaluated in catfish brain, pituitary, stomach, and Brockmann bodies. Most notably, GHS-R3a was the only receptor observed to significantly increase (2.9\u20136.3-fold) in brain, pituitary, and stomach within 4\u202fdays of fasting (P\u202f<\u202f.05). Stomach GHS-R1a also increased (P\u202f<\u202f.05) after 4\u202fdays; however, GHS-R2a was only elevated in brain and pituitary after refeeding for 1\u202fweek. Expression of all three ghrelin receptors were elevated (P\u202f<\u202f.05) in the Brockmann bodies after 2\u202fweeks of fasting and returned to prefasting levels following refeeding. Together with the previously published characterization of GHS-R1a and -R2a, these results establish three ghrelin receptors, each altered by energy state, in channel catfish and add to the growing body of information on GHS-R evolution and function.",

Seven-day old myocytes were starved of amino acids for two hours then exposed to media that contained amino acid treatments, during which protein degradation rates were analyzed over five hours by measuring cellular release of 3H-tyrosine. Increasing concentrations of essential amino acids (EAA) reduced protein degradation rates; this effect was dose-dependent within the physiological range found in plasma. Addition of leucine or phenylalanine at 5\u202fmM and 2.5\u202fmM, respectively, decreased rates of protein degradation compared to media without amino acid supplementation, suggesting that these amino acids directly regulate muscle proteolysis. Protein degradation rates were similar in cells exposed to media without EAA and media lacking only leucine, further supporting a role for leucine as a central regulator of protein turnover. Addition of 5\u202fmM lysine or valine to media without amino acids increased protein degradation; this response was attenuated as EAA were added back into media, supporting that a lysine or valine imbalance is costly for muscle protein retention. In summary, there is evidence for amino acids as both positive and negative regulators of protein turnover in rainbow trout muscle. These findings suggest that there may be an optimal plasma amino acid profile that minimizes protein turnover and that this could be achieved through diet formulation.",

There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in both obesity progression and obesity-related complications. In recent years, Drosophila models of diet-induced obesity and associated pathologies have been successfully developed through manipulation of carbohydrate or fat concentrations in the food. Obese flies accumulate triacylglycerols in the fat body, an organ homologous to mammalian adipose tissue and exhibit metabolic and physiological complications including hyperglycemia, redox imbalance and shortened longevity; these are all similar to those observed in obese humans. In this review, we summarize current data on the mechanisms of oxidative stress induction in obesity, with emphasis on metabolic switches and the involvement of redox-responsive signaling pathways such as NF-\u03baB and Nfr2. The recent achievements with D. melanogaster model suggest a complicated relationship between obesity, oxidative stress, and longevity but the Drosophila model offers probably the best opportunities to delve further into unraveling these interactions, particularly the roles of antioxidants and of Nrf2-regulated responses, in order to increase our understanding of the obese metabolic phenotype and test and develop anti-obesity pharmaceuticals.",

The aim of the present work was to evaluate if an in ovo ghrelin administration could positively influence the zebrafish performance in the long-term and to gain insight on the mechanisms associated to ghrelin regulation of food intake during the larval phase. Food intake, growth potential, protein metabolism, expression of target genes involved in ghrelin, feeding behaviour regulation and locomotor activity were assessed in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae at 25\u202fdays post-fertilization. Elevated levels of acylated ghrelin in zebrafish eggs did not result in increased growth or food intake. Differences in mRNA expression between larvae fasted for 16\u202fh before and 1\u202fh after feeding were found for igf1ra, gh1 and pomca. Moreover, ghrelin treated larvae showed higher swimming activity, indicating that the peptide may have an important role on foraging activity.

We hypothesize that male manakins have enhanced cardiovascular capabilities to meet these demands on the heart. Using histological and molecular techniques, we examined manakin heart structure as well as expression of genes involved in Ca2+ handling, action potential duration, steroidal signaling and cardiac growth. These measures were also made on the hearts of zebra finches, a similar-sized bird with limited cardiovascular demands. Compared to the zebra finch, the manakin had a significantly thicker left ventricular (LV) muscle (cross-sectional thickness of the free LV wall and septum) with a smaller LV chamber. In addition, compared to zebra finches, manakin hearts had significantly greater gene expression of ryanodine receptors as well as androgen receptors. Testosterone (T) treatment of non-breeding manakins (with low T) increased gene expression of the Ca2+ pump SERCA. These observations suggest that hearts of breeding male manakins require specialized Ca2+ handling and androgens may facilitate manakin cardiovascular function.",

An immunoblot analysis showed that Bombyx eggs contained a 59-kDa catalytic A subunit (CNA), a 19-kDa regulatory B subunit (CNB), and a 27-kDa calcipressin; the CNA, CNB, and calcipressin were found to undergo differential changes between diapause and developing eggs during the diapause process. In developing eggs, protein levels of CNA and calcipressin were high during the first stages and then gradually decreased with embryonic development. However, CNB protein levels showed inverse temporal changes, with increased levels being detected during later embryonic stages of developing eggs. In diapause eggs, protein levels of CNA and calcipressin remained at relatively high levels during the first 8\u202fdays after oviposition, but CNB levels remained at low levels. CN enzymatic activity was directly determined and results showed that it remained at low levels in diapause eggs during the first 8\u202fdays after oviposition. However, in developing eggs, CN enzymatic activity sharply increased during the first several days, reached a peak during middle embryonic development, and then greatly decreased 5 or 6\u202fdays before hatching. Examination of temporal changes in mRNA expression levels of CNB also showed differences between diapause and HCl-treated eggs. These results demonstrated that protein levels of CNA, CNB, and calcipressin, transcriptional levels of CNB, and CN enzymatic activity between diapause and developing eggs are differentially regulated, and these regulated changes are likely related to the embryonic diapause process of B. mori.",

In shallow coastal areas, bivalves are exposed to frequent disturbance and salinity stress that might negatively affect their activity and physiological performance; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of osmotic stress (low and fluctuating salinity) and repeated burrowing on aerobic and contractile capacity of the foot muscle (assessed by the activity of succinate dehydrogenase and myosin ATPase) as well as the levels of organic osmolytes (free amino acids) and biochemical markers of protein synthesis and proteolysis in key osmoregulatory and energy storing tissues (gills and hepatopancreas, respectively) in a common bioturbator, the soft shell clam Mya arenaria. Osmotic stress and exhaustive exercise altered the foot muscle capacity of soft shell clams and had a strong impact on protein and amino acid homeostasis in tissues not directly involved in locomotion. Acclimation to constant low salinity (5 practical salinity units) depleted the whole-body free amino acid pool and affected protein synthesis but not protein breakdown in the gill. In contrast, fluctuating (5\u201315) salinity increased protein breakdown rate, suppressed protein synthesis, caused oxidative damage to proteins in the gill and selectively depleted whole-body glycine pool. Clams acclimated to normal salinity (15) increased the aerobic capacity of the foot muscle upon repeated burrowing, whereas acclimation to low and fluctuating salinity reduced this adaptive muscle plasticity. Under the normal and low salinity conditions, exhaustive exercise induced protein conservation pathways (indicated by suppression of protein synthesis and catabolism), but this effect was disrupted by fluctuating salinity. These findings indicate that exhaustive exercise and osmotic stress interactively affect whole-body protein homeostasis and functional capacity of the foot muscle in soft shell clams which might contribute to reduced burrowing activity of bivalve bioturbators in osmotically challenging environments such as estuaries and shallow coastal zones.",

Feeding hormones can be described as orexigenic (stimulate food intake, e.g. orexin and neuropeptide Y \u2013 NPY) or anorexigenic (inhibit food intake, e.g. cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript \u2013 CART). Reproduction and energy homeostasis are closely linked, as factors that affect appetite have also been shown to influence reproductive hormones and behaviors. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is one of the most influential factors controlling reproduction. Although our understanding of the endocrine regulation of feeding and reproduction in fish is progressing, many gaps still remain, particularly in catfish. Glass catfish (Kryptopterus vitreolus) are freshwater fish known for their natural transparency. In this study, we isolated cDNA encoding reproductive hormones (GnRH1, GnRH2) and appetite regulators (orexin, NPY, and CART) from glass catfish and examined their distribution in various tissues. All peptides had wide distributions across various brain and peripheral tissues, except CART, which was only present in brain. In order to assess whether limited energy supply affects these peptides, we examined the effects of fasting on their brain mRNA expression levels. Fasting increased the expression of both the orexigenic (i.e. orexin and NPY) and anorexigenic (i.e. CART) hormones, and decreased expression levels of GnRH1, but did not affect GnRH2. Overall, our results suggest that fasting affects the expression of peptides involved in both feeding and reproduction, and provides new insights on the endocrine mechanisms that regulate feeding and reproduction in catfish.",

Weaning lasted for 20\u202fdays and then, eels were fed compound diets for 70\u202fdays, whereas the other group was only fed cod roe (90\u202fdays). Diets were tested with four replicates and evaluated in terms of growth, survival, glass eels metamorphosis into elvers, oxidative stress status and activity of digestive enzymes. Although glass eels are traditionally fed with fish roe and progressively weaned onto compound diets, results revealed that this strategy should not be prolonged for a long time, since feeding glass eels with cod roe for 90\u202fdays negatively affected their growth (2 times lower than fish fed compound diets), delayed their metamorphosis, as well as the maturation of their digestive function as the ratio of alkaline phosphatase and leucine-alanine peptidase indicated. Weaning glass eels onto compound diets differing in their FM levels did not affect their growth, metamorphic stage nor the activity of pancreatic enzymes (total alkaline proteases, trypsin, bile salt-activated lipase and \u03b1-amylase), although 75% FM replacement by PP sources delayed the level of intestinal maturation in eels. In comparison to glass eels fed the 100% FM diet, survival was negatively affected in groups fed diets with 50 and 75% FM replacement by PP ingredients, which indicated that further improvement is needed in diet formulation for this stage of development.",

     "abstract": "Many teleost fishes exhibit sequential hermaphroditism, where male or female gonads develop first and later undergo sex change. Model sex change species are characterized by social hierarchies and coloration changes, which enable experimental manipulations to better understand these processes. However, other species such as the protogynous black sea bass (Centropristis striata) do not exhibit these characteristics and instead receive research attention due to their importance in fisheries or aquaculture. Black sea bass social structure is unknown, which makes sex change sampling difficult, and few molecular resources are available. The purpose of the present study was to induce sex change using exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor, and assess gonadal gene expression using sex markers (amh, zpc2) and genes involved in steroidogenesis (cyp19a1a, cyp11b), estrogen signaling (esr1, esr2b), and apoptosis or atresia (aen, casp9, fabp11, parg, pdcd4, rif1). Overall, dietary exemestane treatment was effective, and most exposed females exhibited early histological signs of sex change and significantly higher rates of ovarian atresia relative to control females. Genes associated with atresia did not reflect this, however, as expression patterns in sex changing gonads were overall similar to those of ovaries, likely due to a whole ovary dilution effect of the RNA. Still, small but insignificant expression decreases during early sex change were detected for ovary-related genes (aen, casp9, fabp11, zpc2) and anti-apoptotic factors (parg, rif1). Exemestane treatment did not impact spermatogenesis or testicular gene expression, but testes were generally characterized by elevated steroidogenic enzyme and estrogen receptor mRNAs. Further research will be needed to understand these processes in black sea bass, using isolated ovarian follicles and multiple stages of sex change.",

     "abstract": "In order to provide year round spawning broodstock, lumpfish (initial size 746\u202fg and 24.9\u202fcm) were reared under four different photoperiod regimes from January 2017 to July 2018. One group was reared under simulated natural photoperiod (LDN, control group) for Troms\u00f8 (70\u00b0N). The second group was transferred to continuous light (LD240) on 30 January 2017 and reared at LD24:0 throughout the trial period. Two compressed and phase advanced photoperiods were also established. Both groups were moved from LDN to LD24:0 on 30 January 2017, and after that reared at compressed natural photoperiods where the annual photoperiod was compressed down to six months (L6) or nine months (L9) for the duration of the study. Spawning time was shifted in both compressed groups during both years of the study. Spawning activity in the second year of the study was higher and followed more closely the expected spawning period in the compressed and the LDN groups. Spawning in the LD240 group was spread out over the experimental period with no distinct peak in spawning. A seasonal and pronounced drop in condition factor was found for females in the L9, L6 and the LDN groups. This post-spawning loss in condition was closely related to the spawning activity of each group. The current findings suggest that photoperiod has a strong influence on the timing of lumpfish maturation and can be used as an efficient and inexpensive tool to secure lumpfish reproduction operations i.e. year-round supply of egg and milt and/or timing with optimal temperature regimes.",

Trial 1 evaluated the effect of microalgae produced water turbidity on grey mullet larval performance and digestive tract (DT) enzyme ontogeny. Two microalgae (Nannochloropsis oculata and Isochrysis galbana) water turbidity levels (0.76 and 1.20 NTU, respectively) and a non-microalgae control (0.26 NTU) were investigated on 2 to 23 dph grey mullet larvae. The higher turbidity (1.2 NTU) larvae (5 dph) consumed markedly (P\u202f<\u202f.05) more rotifers than other treatment fish, independently of the microalgae type. There was no clear effect of the turbidity treatments on DT enzyme ontogeny. However, in all treatments lipase and alkaline proteases appeared to be modulated by the diet. Alkaline phosphatase activity was ca. 8 times higher and \u03b1-amylase activity increased 5.3 times in 79 dph fish compared to 40 dph individuals. The ratio of alkaline phosphatase and leucine-alanine aminopeptidase indicated gut maturation occurred around 61 dph. Trial 2 compared the most effective N.occulata produced turbidity level (1.2 NTU) with the identical water turbidity produced by inert clay on larval performance. M. cephalus larvae exposed to high algal turbidity demonstrated superior performance (P\u202f<\u202f.05), in terms of rotifer ingestion, dry weight gain and survival, compared to cohorts reared under the clay treatment and the lower microalgae produced turbidity. These findings suggested that water algal turbidity is not the dominant factor determining improved grey mullet larval performance.",

To determine the threshold light intensity to suppress the nocturnal elevation of plasma melatonin, three groups of individually tagged fish (n\u202f=\u202f26\u201328/group ca. 1040\u202fg) were reared on 12\u202fh light: 12\u202fh dark (LD 12:12) and subjected to nighttime light intensities of either 50\u201365, 0.1\u20130.3 or 0 (control) lux for five months (November to April). Daytime light intensity was 720\u2013750\u202flx. Diel plasma melatonin profiles in both November and April were similar; mean daytime levels ranged from 20 to 100\u202fpg/ml, and nighttime levels were inversely proportional to light intensity. In the control group at 0\u202flx, plasma melatonin increased about four-fold after lights-off, ranging between 320 and 430\u202fpg/ml. Nighttime light intensity of 0.1\u20130.3\u202flx halved plasma melatonin levels to 140\u2013220\u202fpg/ml, and 50\u201365\u202flx further reduced the levels to one quarter of the control group, 68\u2013108\u202fpg/ml. Among the lit groups, daytime plasma melatonin levels were about 20\u201330\u202fpg/ml, significantly lower than the nocturnal levels suggesting the diel hormonal rhythm was not completely abolished. Fish grew steadily from about 1100\u202fg to 1600\u202fg between November and April, independent of light intensity (P\u202f=\u202f.67).

GAT-1 belongs to the GAT group, in which five related transporters, GAT-2, GAT-3, GAT-4, CT1, and TAUT are known in mammals. By contrast, the deep-sea mussel, Bathymodiolus septemdierum has only two GAT group members, BsGAT-1 and BsTAUT, and their function in environmental adaptation is of interest to better understand the physiology of deep-sea organisms. Compared with BsTAUT, the function of BsGAT-1 is unknown. Here, we report the functional characterization of BsGAT-1. Analyses of BsGAT-1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that it could transport GABA in a Na+- and Cl\u2212-dependent manner, with Km and Vmax values of 0.58\u202f\u03bcM and 1.97\u202fpmol/oocyte/h, respectively. BsGAT-1 activity was blocked by the GAT-1 selective inhibitors SKF89976A and ACHC. Competition assays indicated that BsGAT-1 has no affinity for taurine and thiotaurine. These characteristics were common with those of mammalian GAT-1, suggesting its conserved function in the nervous system. However, BsGAT-1 showed a certain affinity for hypotaurine, which is involved in sulfide detoxification in hydrothermal vent-specific animals. This result suggests an additional role for BsGAT-1 in sulfide detoxification, which may be specific to the deep-sea mussel. In a tissue distribution analysis, BsGAT-1 mRNA expression was observed in various tissues. The expression in the adductor and byssus retractor muscles, labial palp, and foot, which possibly contain ganglia, suggested a function in the neural system, while BsGAT-1 expression in other tissues might be related to sulfide detoxification.",

In the last decade, there has been growing interest in the ecological relevance of cellular oxidative stress, which would provide complimentary information to that obtained by the classic analyses of glucocorticoid hormones. In this study, we analysed the sex and species variation of five blood-based markers of oxidative status, both molecular oxidative damage and antioxidant protection, in sympatric cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus) living on Namibian farmlands. Both these terrestrial carnivores are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We found that female cheetahs had significantly higher serum reactive oxygen metabolites of non-protein origin and lower glutathione peroxidase activity in whole blood than both male and female leopards and male cheetahs. We also found that cheetahs and leopards differed in the association between the two antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase. Correlations among oxidative status markers were stronger in female cheetahs than leopards or male cheetahs. Our results suggest that female cheetahs are more sensitive to local sources of stress. Our work did not corroborate the assumption that two species with different life histories consistently differ in key physiological traits.",

Furthermore, an interaction between dietary carbohydrate levels and lipid sources was also observed in the activities of liver mitochondrial Na+-K+-ATPase and respiratory chain complex III as well as the transcripts of ATP6 and PGC-1\u03b1. Overall, these findings suggested that dietary carbohydrate levels and lipid sources remarkably affected the mitochondrial biosynthesis and function of M. amblycephala.

In this study we characterized a LGBP gene (SpLGBP) which was highly expressed in the late embryonic, zoea I larval stage and hepatopancreas of S. paramamosain.. It encodes 364 amino acids, composed of several conserved domains like the bacterial glucanase motif. The recombinant SpLGBP protein (rSpLGBP) was obtained through the E.coli expression system, in which two 6\u25caHis-tags were added to both C and N terminals during vector construction for the improvement of purification efficiency. In vivo the study showed that the SpLGBP mRNA was significantly up-regulated under Vibrio parahaemolyticus and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in the hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The ELISA binding assay in vitro indicated that the rSpLGBP was capable of binding to LPSs and peptidoglycan (PGN). The rSpLGBP could agglutinate both G+ and G- bacteria in the presence of Ca2+. Our results suggest that SpLGBP may play an immunological role against pathogenic infection in the early developmental stages of S. paramamosain.",

We investigate the effects of predator exposure on locomotion capacity (both fast-start escape and critical swimming performance), survival under predation and the relationships between these factors in juvenile Chinese bream (Parabramis pekinensis). This study aims to test whether there is a positive relationship between the above factors and whether such relationships are context dependent (i.e., with or without 20 d of predator exposure). We found that predator-exposed Chinese bream showed higher rates of survival under predation and improved fast-start swimming performance compared with individuals not exposed to predation. At individual level, no relationship was found between survival and any locomotion performance component in the no-predator group, but mean fast-start swimming speed, maneuverability and responsiveness were all positively related to survival in the predator group after 20 d of exposure. This finding indicates that the recognition of and vigilance for predators achieved through predation experience can be crucial preconditions for prey to employ the fast-start escape response, especially to escape ambush predators. Furthermore, a tradeoff was observed between the critical and fast-start swimming performances in the predator group, but not in the no-predator group, which may have been due to the intensified competition throughout the entire locomotion-support system (e.g., energy, proportions of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers) between critical and fast-start swimming because the increased demand for fast-start escape capacity constrains (or compromises) critical swimming performance under the threat of predation.",

Our previous study suggested that the snap25s gene (encoding a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor [SNARE] protein) is involved in pre-synaptic functions for olfactory imprinting and/or olfactory memory retrieval in chum salmon (O. keta). In this study, the expression of other SNARE proteins was analyzed in chum salmon brains. Three cDNAs, encoding salmon SNARE proteins (STX-1a, STX-1b, and VAMP2), were isolated and sequenced, which are well-conserved among vertebrates. Quantitative PCR detected the expression of stx1s and vamp2 in all regions of the brain, and especially highly in the olfactory bulb (OB) and telencephalon. The expression levels of snares in the olfactory rosette (OR) were higher during seaward migration than in adult life stages, subsequently vamp2 in the OB and telencephalon increased during seaward migration, corresponding well with development of the olfactory nervous system. Both stx1s in the OB and stx1b in the telencephalon were elevated in the seaward period, whereas stx1a in the telencephalon increased continuously until the feeding period. Both stx1s in the telencephalon increased in the last phase of upriver migration, possibly related to the retrieval of imprinted memory. Our results indicated the involvement and distinct roles of upregulated snares in synaptic plasticity for olfactory imprinting and/or olfactory memory retrieval in Pacific salmon.",

Water is a fundamental resource that has received far less consideration for parent-offspring conflicts. Previous research suggests that, when water is limited, reproductive females are compromised in favor of developing embryos. However, these studies limited their assessments to standard metrics such as clutch size and mass. We tested the hypothesis that the mother-offspring conflict over limited water resources leads to finer scale morphological and physiological impacts on the eggs in Children's pythons (Antaresia childreni). We predicted that water deprivation during gravidity alters female investment into her eggs, impacting egg water content and shell development. Additionally, we predicted that the yolk in these dehydrated eggs would have enhanced immune performance metrics, as has been documented in dehydrated adults. We found that eggs from water-deprived females were dehydrated as indicated by reduced percent water and greater yolk osmolality compared to eggs from females that received ad libitum water. We also found that eggs from dehydrated mothers had thinner shells and higher water loss rates. The impacts were not entirely negative as dehydrated eggs had higher antimicrobial capabilities. Also, thinner and more permeability eggshells might allow for elevated rates of rehydration from nest substrate. Overall, by examining an array of egg traits, we demonstrated that dehydration of gravid females impacts the eggs, not just the females as previously reported. As a result, the mother-offspring conflicts are indeed two-sided.",

We classified reflex impairments and visible dermal injuries, and through repeated blood sampling, assessed metrics indicative of stress, exhaustion, and osmoregulatory disturbances. Reflex-impairments and blood lactate levels suggested fish were exhausted upon capture but recovered after 48\u202fh. Conversely, fish with dermal injuries showed disruptions to ion homeostasis that were greater in more severely injured fish and increased over time.

Acclimation to 10\u202fppt for 24\u202fh increased tadpole survival of F. cancrivora in 15\u202fppt, and it activated osmoregulatory mechanisms such as increase in NKA expression, which enabled them to maintain a stable osmolality below that of the surrounding media, to reach lower sodium and chloride concentrations of body fluid, and to modulate dehydration at higher salinities. The minimum required acclimation period is shorter than that reported previously on this species and non-euryhaline tadpoles. This study highlights that these physiological mechanisms are ecologically relevant and critical for tadpoles living in coastal brackish waters, improving their survival in coastal microhabitats with highly variable salinity levels.",

     "abstract": "Marsupial embryos of Armadillidium vulgare (Isopoda: Oniscidea) were collected at different stages of development and assayed for products of nitrogen excretion. Stages were classified as early stage one, late stage one (clear embryo and somite differentiation), early stage two (chorion shed, prior to blastokinesis), late stage two (following blastokinesis), and mancae (vitelline membrane shed; second embryonic molt). Stage one and stage two embryos were primarily ammonotelic. Mancae showed a significant increase in stored uric acid and decrease in ammonia production, in most cases to undetectable levels. The increased metabolic rate of mancae, and the fact that they imbibe marsupial fluid prior to exiting the marsupium, may have favored a switch from ammonotely to uricotely to avoid ammonia toxicity. Protein metabolism, estimated from ammonia production, accounted for 7% of the measured catabolic rate in Stage 2 embryos. Newly emerged juveniles showed a >2-fold increase in metabolism relative to mancae, accompanying the transition from aquatic to aerial respiration. Following 48\u202fh post-emergence, juveniles resumed ammonia excretion, volatilizing the base (NH3) as in later instars. Elevated ammonia excretion in early juveniles may derive from the catabolism of remaining yolk protein. A sharp increase in whole-animal glutamine in juveniles is consistent with its role as an intermediary nitrogen store during periodic ammonia excretion. Total ammonia concentration in the marsupial fluid fluctuated but did not increase significantly over time and ammonia was not volatilized across the oostegites, indicating that embryo ammonia is transported into the maternal hemolymph for excretion.",

Although vitamin D status is not known in penguins during peri-molting period, vitamin D intake is supposed to be remarkably altered. The objective of the present study was to clarify the alterations in plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration, the most reliable biomarker for assessing vitamin D status, and vitamin D intake during peri-molting period. Blood samples were collected from seven adult male African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in the control period, pre-molting period, early-molting period, and late-molting period. The dietary content of vitamin D and calcium (Ca) were higher than that of the estimated requirements. Feed intake increased in the pre-molting period and drastically decreased during the molting periods. Body weight increased in the pre-molting period, followed by the loss of weight towards the end of the experiment. Although vitamin D and Ca intakes decreased during the molting periods, plasma 25(OH)D concentration increased during the molting periods and the increase in plasma Ca concentration was also observed in the late-molting period. These results suggest that the reduction in body fat induced by reducing feed intake stimulated the release of vitamin D from body fat, which increased plasma 25(OH)D and Ca concentrations in molting penguins. Penguins are unlikely to suffer from typical hypervitaminosis D even during molting and vitamin D toxicity is not a realistic problem in penguins because of the short duration of molting.",

We assessed DNA damage as a potential metric that could be a more integrative stress measurement with direct links to health. We captured free-living house sparrows, took an immediate blood sample, and transferred them to the laboratory, exposing them to the chronic stress of captivity. Biweekly blood and weight samples were then taken for 4\u202fweeks. We immediately assessed DNA damage in red blood cells using the comet assay and later quantified corticosterone. Uric acid was analyzed in a separate group of birds. We found that birds initially lost, but began to regain weight over the course of captivity. DNA damage peaked within the first 10\u202fdays of captivity, and mostly remained elevated. However, the cellular distribution of damage changed considerably over time; most cells showed low levels of damage early, a bimodal distribution of high and low DNA damage during the peak of damage, and a wide unimodal distribution of damage at the end of the 4\u202fweeks. Furthermore, corticosterone increased and remained elevated and uric acid decreased and remained depleted over the same period. Although both a molecular (DNA damage) and an endocrine (corticosterone) marker showed similar response profiles over the 4\u202fweeks, they were not correlated, suggesting they reflect different aspects of the underlying physiology. These data provide convincing preliminary evidence that DNA damage has potential to be an additional indicator of chronic stress.",

However, the presence and function of these enzymes are largely unknown in copepods such as the ectoparasite salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) a major pest in salmonid aquaculture. Here we describe six genes found in the L. salmonis genome (LsCHS1, LsCHS2, LsGFAT, LsGNA1, LsAGM, and LsUAP) with high homology to enzymes in the chitin synthesis pathway. The transcription profiles of these enzymes together with three chitinases enzymes (LsChi1, LsChi2, and LsChi4), which have been characterized before, were examined during the synthesis of a new exoskeleton and revealed a dynamical expression concurrent with the morphological changes during the molt cycle. Further understanding of chitin metabolism and its regulation may prove useful tool to develop new pesticides.",

The neuroendocrine system plays a key role in salinity acclimation by directing ion uptake and extrusion in osmoregulatory tissues such as gill. While most studies with O. mossambicus have focused on acclimation to steady-state salinities, less is known about the ability of adult fish to acclimate to dynamically-changing salinities. Plasma osmolality, prolactin (PRL) levels, and branchial gene expression of PRL receptors (PRLR1 and PRLR2), Na+/Cl\u2212 and Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporters (NCC and NKCC), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA\u03b11a and NKA\u03b11b), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and aquaporin 3 (AQP3) were measured in fish reared in FW and SW steady-state salinities, in a tidal regimen (TR) where salinities changed between FW and SW every six hours, and in fish transferred from FW or SW to TR. Regardless of rearing regimen, plasma osmolality was higher in fish in SW than in FW fish, while plasma PRL was lower in fish in SW. Furthermore, branchial gene expression of effectors of ion transport in TR fish showed greater similarity to those in steady-state SW fish than in FW fish. By seven days of transfer from steady-state FW or SW to TR, plasma osmolality, plasma PRL and branchial expression of effectors of ion transport were similar to those of fish reared in TR since larval stages. These findings demonstrate the ability of adult tilapia reared in steady-state salinities to successfully acclimate to dynamically-changing salinities. Moreover, the present findings suggest that early exposure to salinity changes does not significantly improve survivability in future challenge with dynamically-changing salinities.",

Studies that show the condition of organisms against the natural environmental variations are fundamental for future evaluation of environmental change due to anthropic impacts. Biomarkers are useful tools defined as biological changes in low levels of organization induced by stressors and considered as predictive responses of more severe effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the modulation of biochemical biomarkers in Ucides cordatus against the natural variation a pristine mangrove forest in an Amazonic estuary (Japerica Bay). The samplings were carried out throughout one year at rainy-dry transitional period (June/2013), dry period (September/ 2013), dry-rainy transitional period (November/ 2013) and rainy period (February/ 2014) in the lower, middle and upper estuary. The biochemical biomarkers evaluated were glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutamate cysteine-ligase (GCL), total antioxidant capacity (ACAP), reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration and the lipid peroxidation (LPO). There was a decrease in the activity of both enzymes, GSH concentration and lower LPO in the rainy-dry transitional period for the organisms of all sites, pointing to this period as a season of greater metabolic stability. The organisms, especially those of the middle estuary, presented physiological plasticity against the variations of the environment which they are submitted. Seasonality, more than salinity influence due to position in estuary, is the main modulator of biomarkers. Also, our results indicate that the species presents high viability for biomonitoring studies.",

During torpor, protein synthesis is suppressed but can resume during interbout arousals. The current study aimed to identify molecular targets responsible for the global suppression of protein synthesis during torpor as well as possible mechanisms that could allow for selective protein translation to continue over this time. Relative changes in protein expression and/or phosphorylation levels of key translation factors (ribosomal protein S6, eIF4E, eIF2\u03b1, eEF2) and their upstream regulators (mTOR, TSC2, p70 S6K, 4EBP) were analyzed in liver and kidney of 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) sampled from six points over the torpor-arousal cycle. The results indicate that both organs reduce protein synthesis during torpor by decreasing mTOR and TSC2 phosphorylation between 30 and 70% of control levels. Translation resumes during interbout arousal when p-p70 S6K, p-rpS6, and p-4EBP levels returned to control values or above. Only liver translation factors were activated or disinhibited during periods of torpor itself, with >3-fold increases in total eIF2\u03b1 and eEF2 protein levels, and a decrease in p-eEF2 (T56) to as low as 16% of the euthermic control value. These data shed light on a possible molecular mechanism involving eIF2\u03b1 that could enable the translation of key transcripts during times of cell stress.",

     "abstract": "Winter quiescence in fishes is not uncommon, however understanding the mechanisms that cause dormancy are poorly understood. This study highlights the physiological stress temperature places on locomotor musculature and its consequences on whole organism locomotion. Cunner and tautog experience temperatures ranging from 0 to 25\u202f\u00b0C and enter dormancy at ~10\u202f\u00b0C. We aimed to address the question: how do winter temperatures affect steady swimming and muscle contraction kinetics in cunner? Fishes were collected and housed at 5, 10, 15, or 20\u202f\u00b0C. Gait transition speed and fin beat frequency were measured at each acclimation temperature. Twitch and tetanus kinetics were recorded from the aerobic locomotor muscle, which is responsible for the power stroke during swimming. Fish acclimated to colder temperatures (5, 10\u202f\u00b0C) demonstrated lower gait transition speeds than the warm temperature treatments. Similarly, twitch kinetics were slower in muscle acclimated at \u226410\u202f\u00b0C. Locomotor muscle from tautog was significantly slower to contract and relax than cunner when tested at 5 and 10\u202f\u00b0C. These results suggest that muscle acclimation differs in these closely related labrids from the same habitat. Additionally, these results suggest that cunner locomotor musculature can maintain greater performance at a wider range of temperatures. Cunner occupy more northern latitudes which likely allows for greater performance shifts in response to temperature. However, when temperatures get cold enough muscle function is reduced, perhaps contributing to their overwintering ecology.",

Activation of signaling pathways, cell development and expression of relevant genes were analyzed in day 4 myocytes.

Thus, demonstrating that these cells are \u03b22-agonists-responsive, and supporting enhanced cell proliferation. The expression of the myogenic factor myf5 was significantly down-regulated, suggesting that the cells were already destined to the muscular linage; while insulin-like growth factors (igf-1 and igf-2) transcript levels were up-regulated, proposing an additional anabolic effect through their local production. Furthermore, SALM treatment up-regulated expression of the lipases (hsl and lipa) and the \u03b2-oxidation marker cpt1a, and all three agonists increased mitochondrial dehydrogenase hadh mRNA levels. These data correspond with a situation of enhanced lipolytic and \u03b2-oxidation capacity, a fact supported by the higher glycerol released into the media induced by the agonists. Overall, these results suggest a hyperplastic growth condition and a favorable protein/fat ratio profile upon these treatments; consequently, \u03b22-agonists (especially SALM) may be considered good candidates to optimize the growth in this aquaculture species.",

The protein sequences of the three species showed most similarities with those of other Characiformes, followed by Cypriniformes and Siluriformes. mRNAs of all four peptides were expressed in the brain. Orexin, CCK and leptin mRNAs were widely distributed in peripheral tissues of all species. CART mRNA displayed a wide peripheral distribution in bucktooth but was predominant in brain in black widow tetra and silver dollar. In order to assess possible interspecific differences in the response to fasting, we compared the expression of these peptides in fed and fasted fish. Fasting induced increases in orexin expression in all species, but decreased brain CART and leptin expressions in silver dollar only. In the intestine, fasting induced a decrease in CCK expression in silver dollar and black widow, and a decrease in leptin expression in bucktooth. Our results suggest that, in Characiformes, different responses of appetite-regulating peptides to fasting are related to both feeding habits and family.

In this study, we examined the influence of cortisol, cortisol inhibitors and a repeated, acute stressor (net-chasing) on sex differentiation in black sea bass (BSB; Centropristis striata), a protogynous hermaphroditic teleost. Wild-caught, sexually-undifferentiated, BSB juveniles (~90\u202fmm) were collected from Rhode Island waters, raised in recirculating systems and fed diets supplemented with cortisol, a cortisol receptor antagonist (mifepristone), a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone), or net-chased twice a week for two min until gonads were differentiated (77\u201389\u202fdays). Long term cortisol administration partially masculinized all female fish, but repeated net-chasing did not alter sex differentiation relative to the control group. Blocking cortisol receptor binding delayed sex differentiation in some individuals, but overall led to increased masculinization compared to control fish. The proportion of treatment fish that developed as males suggests a functionally, diandric protogynous reproductive strategy in this species. We also identified a glucocorticoid response element in the gonadal aromatase (cyp19a1a) promoter, indicating a possible relationship between cortisol and cyp19a1a gene expression.",

     "abstract": "Na+ uptake in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) is coordinated by three mechanisms: Na+/H+-exchanger 3b (NHE3b) expressed in H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, an unidentified Na+ channel coupled to electrogenic H+-ATPase expressed in HR cells, and Na+-Cl\u2212-cotransporter (NCC) expressed in NCC cells. Recently, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) were proposed to be the putative Na+ channel involved in H+-ATPase-mediated Na+ uptake in adult zebrafish and rainbow trout. In the present study, we hypothesized that ASICs also play this role in Na+ uptake in larval zebrafish. In support of this hypothesis, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that ASIC4b was expressed in HR cells on the yolk sac skin at 4\u202fdays post-fertilization (dpf). However, neither treatment with the ASIC-specific blocker 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nor morpholino knockdown of ASIC4b reduced Na+ uptake in circumneutral conditions at 4 dpf. However, because ASIC4b knockdown led to significant increases in the mRNA expression of nhe3b and ncc and a significant increase in HR cell density, it is possible that Na+ influx was sustained by increased participation of non-ASIC4b pathways. Moreover, when fish were reared in acidic water (pH\u202f=\u202f4), ASIC4b knockdown led to a stimulation of Na+ uptake at 3 and 4 dpf, results which also were inconsistent with an essential role for ASIC-mediated Na+ uptake, even under conditions known to constrain Na+ uptake via NHE3b. Thus, while ASIC4b clearly is expressed in HR cells, the current functional experiments cannot confirm its involvement in Na+ uptake in larval zebrafish.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the localization and expressions of the androgen receptor (AR), SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 in the prostate glands of wild male ground squirrels during different reproductive periods by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Gross mass of the prostate gland was higher in the breeding season than that of the non-breeding season. Histological observation showed that exocrine lumens in the prostate gland were enlarged in the breeding season and shrank in the non-breeding season. Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that AR was presented in both epithelial and stromal cells' nuclei during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Intriguingly, the positive staining of SRD5A1 and SRD5A2 was only found in the stromal cells. The mRNA expression of the three genes including Ar, Srd5a1 and Srd5a2 in the prostate gland was higher in the breeding season than those of the nonbreeding season. In addition, the circulating concentration of testosterone (T) and the concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate gland were also markedly higher in the breeding season than those of the nonbreeding season. These results suggest that expression levels of AR, SRD5A1 and SRD5A2, as well as DHT synthesis, might be correlated with seasonal changes in morphology and function of the prostate gland, indicating that DHT may serve as a pivotal regulator to affect the morphology and function of prostate gland via a autocrine/paracrine pathway in wild male ground squirrels.",

All tetras displayed ionoregulatory characteristics that are very similar to each other, which supports the argument that these physiological traits may be ancestral for this group and pre-date colonization of the Rio Negro. The novel finding that, Jmax and Km did not change after acclimation to 1\u202fmM Na+ water indicates that, unlike in other species examined uptake is not plastic. The HEA and AZ results, along with pH insensitivity suggest Na+ uptake is not coupled to H+ extrusion or NH3 excretion and leaves the exact mechanism involved unclear.",

     "abstract": "Porcelain crabs inhabit from upper intertidal to subtidal habitats. These environments are characterized by highly variable environmental conditions, which subject species found in these habitats to stress. In this study, we compared reproductive traits of mothers [i.e. fecundity, reproductive output (RO), dry weight, organic matter] and physiological parameters of their offspring (i.e. wet weight, water content, dry weight, organic matter, lactate content of embryos) of three species of porcelain crabs that inhabit the Southeastern Pacific: Petrolisthes laevigatus (upper intertidal); P. violaceus (low intertidal); Allopetrolisthes punctatus (subtidal). Overall, female P. laevigatus had lower fecundity (802 \u00b1 115 vs. 4181 \u00b1 1097 embryos) and amount of organic matter in their embryo masses (0.053 \u00b1 0.006 vs. 0.27 \u00b1 0.025 g) but higher RO values (1.34 \u00b1 0.34 vs. 0.20 \u00b1 0.07) than Allopetrolisthes punctatus. In addition, P. laevigatus embryos had higher organic matter content (81.09 \u00b1 28.8 vs. 64.54 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcg), higher water content (188.6 \u00b1 91.9 vs. 152.4 \u00b1 30.8 \u03bcL) and higher lactate content (0.26 \u00b1 0.04% vs. 0.07 \u00b1 0.01% dry weight) than that found in A. punctatus embryos. Furthermore, females and embryos of P. violaceus showed low values and similar to those observed in P. laevigatus. As a potential strategy to increase survival of the offspring, P. laevigatus seems to invest a large portion of its energy in production of high quality embryos, despite costs to fecundity. This study reveals that porcelain crabs have physiological adaptations during their ontogeny that allow them to survive in fluctuating environments.",

However, anesthesia-induction protocols are commonly established and implemented without proper physiological/behavioral evaluation. Additionally, concentration and time of exposure to the anesthetic are often set without considering species-specific responses. The fat snook (Centropomus parallelus) is a fish with great potential for aquaculture. Given its remarkable euryhalinity, it can grow in fresh- or seawater. Most studies on fat snook anesthesia tested natural compounds (essential oils) instead of traditional anesthetics. However, the use of benzocaine is much more common in the commercial sector, as it is easy to obtain and of relatively low cost. The present study aimed at analyzing the effects benzocaine exposure on glucose and cortisol plasma levels (two traditional stress markers in teleost fish), as well as on plasma osmolality, chloride and magnesium, (indicators of osmo-ionic allostasis) in animals acclimated to different salinities. Results showed that while osmo-ionic allostasis was strictly maintained across the treatments, time of anesthesia had a strong positive relationship to plasma cortisol and glucose, regardless the salinity of exposure and acclimation. The results are discussed as they relate to anesthesia protocols and how stress response generated by time of anesthesia may challenge farming flexibility.",

     "abstract": "It has been suggested that induced swimming has the potential to improve the growth performance of fish. We tested this hypothesis by measuring growth, metabolic efficiency and physiological capacity of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Fish were swum at different exercise regimes: 0.0 (control), 1.5 and 2.5 body lengths per second (BL/s) in 1600\u202fL recirculating raceways for 4\u202fweeks. The results showed a significant increase in weight gain, specific growth rate, improved feed conversion efficiency, and a higher hepatosomatic index for 2.5\u202fBL/s exercised fish compared to control. Glycogen, protein and lipid energy stores in hepatic and muscular tissue showed limited differences among experimental groups. Likewise, plasma [Na+], [K+] and [Cl\u2212] remained stable at all swimming regimes. Expression of genes controlling energy metabolism and growth (IGF-I axis, cytochrome oxidase) and stress response (cortisol receptor, heat shock protein 70) revealed clear regulatory roles as the mRNA transcript levels of IGF-I and growth hormone receptors in hepatic tissue were up-regulated in fish exercised for 3\u20134\u202fweeks at 2.5\u202fBL/s. Oxygen consumption rate and swimming performance (Ucrit) for each experimental group were evaluated in parallel in Blazka-type swim-tunnels (3.9\u202fL) and showed no training effect while prolonged swimming at 1.5 and 2.5\u202fBL/s facilitated ammonia excretion and prevented build-up of plasma ammonia. Overall, these data suggest that sustained exercise at 2.5\u202fBL/s enhanced growth and physiological fitness without compromising energy metabolism or ion-regulation. Our study provides a prospective of implementing exercise as a tool to increase fish production efficiency in commercial aquaculture systems.",

Oxygen consumption rate (V\u0307o2) was significantly affected by the interaction between treatment and measurement temperature (P\u202f<\u202f0.001).

In digesta passage experiments, secondary marker excretion peaks in feces are considered indicative of marker-reingestion via cecotrophy, but corroboration by behavioral observation was lacking so far. The paca (Cuniculus paca), a Neotropical hystricomorph rodent, produces two different kinds of feces (hard and soft) and practices cecotrophy either directly (from the anus) or indirectly (from a pile of defecated feces, mostly when hard and soft feces are defecated together). To investigate effects of diet on cecotrophy, we monitored cecotrophy behavior and digesta passage marker excretion of solute and particle markers in four adult pacas, at constant food intake, on four diets varying in protein and fiber content. Marker excretion patterns suggested a \u2018mucus-trap\u2019 CSM typical for hystricomorph rodents, and showed secondary peaks of a similar time lag after cecotrophy as the primary marker peak after marker feeding. However, not every cecotrophy event was followed by a secondary marker peak. On higher fiber/lower protein diets, the number of cecotrophy bouts, the duration of cecotrophy, the number of secondary marker peaks and the difference between solute and particle marker retention increased, whereas the proportion of indirect cecotrophy decreased, indicating a higher degree of digesta phase separation on these diets. Compared to hard feces, soft feces were particularly enriched in solute marker concentration. Cecotrophy depends on a CSM that varies in its efficiency with the nutrient composition of the diet.",

Although many studies have focused on molecular mechanisms behind this accelerated growth response in fish, little is known on the roles of protein and metabolism. We also assessed, for the first time, the potential roles of miRNAs in regulating compensatory growth. Artcic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, a northern freshwater species, was deprived of food for 101\u202fdays and then fed to satiety for 126\u202fdays. The refeeding period resulted in compensatory growth, with a partial compensation of body mass. The feed deprivation period lead to a decrease in hepatosomatic index (HSI) and intestinal somatic index (ISI). HSI and ISI were then gradually replenished during early refeeding, following a lag phase prior to the compensatory growth response. mRNA transcripts regulating protein degradation via the autophagy pathway (Cathepsin D and Cathepsin L) in muscle were upregulated during feed restriction and downregulated after refeeding, which could allow for greater protein accretion in muscle, facilitating compensatory growth. Transcript levels from the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Mafbx and Murf1) and the calpain system (Calpain 7 and Calpastatin) suggested that these pathways were not involved in regulating compensatory growth. Furthermore, we've shown that miRNAs (miR-29a and miR-223) could be involved in fish glycogen homeostasis during the early stages of refeeding. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating growth in fish.",

     "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis is centrally implicated in stressor mitigation in teleost fishes. Sustained HPI axis activation can be detrimental to the physiological functioning of an organism and can result in fitness-related trade-offs. Predator-induced mortality is known to be higher in stressed fish than in unstressed conspecifics, suggesting a role for the HPI axis in mediating fish behaviour. However, the underlying specific mechanism(s) for this phenomenon is(are) unknown. The purpose of the current study was to address how the HPI axis influences risk-taking, and antipredator behaviours in a wild teleost, the pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus). Here, individual juvenile pumpkinseed were implanted either with cocoa butter as a sham control or with a biologically-relevant concentration of cortisol. Forty-eight hours post-implantation, fish were assessed for behavioural metrics associated with boldness and risk taking in three sequential behavioural tests: (i) a predation-risk test, (ii) an exploration tendency test, and (iii) a shoaling tendency test, with test order randomized among different trials. Cortisol treatment had no influence on antipredator, exploratory, or shoaling behaviours. However, post-attack swimming duration (in predation-risk test) and exploratory activity (in Z-maze exploration test) were significantly affected by body mass. Collectively, our results indicate that cortisol may not have a role in mediating sociability, boldness, and risk-taking behaviours in pumpkinseed sunfish, at least under the current laboratory conditions. However, cortisol may nonetheless play a role in mediating predator-prey interactions in fishes in more natural environmental settings that were not considered here.",

Two hundred and sixteen fish (average body weight: 45.57\u202fg\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.98\u202fg) were fed three experimental diets (6% fat/L6 group, control, 11% fat/L11 group, and 11% fat with 0.3\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121 GA/L11GA group) for 8\u202fweeks.

However, the UCP1 physiological roles are still unclear in fish, although several teleost ucp1 genes have been identified. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential roles of fish UCP1 involved in food intake regulation and energy homeostasis. We herein report on the molecular cloning, tissue distribution and the effect of fasting and refeeding on the expression of ucp1 in Channa argus. UCP1 consisted of a 921\u202fbp open reading frame predicted to encode 306 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed that snakehead UCP1 was highly conserved (>80%) with teleost UCP1, but shared a lower identity (60\u201372%) with mammals. Phylogenetic analysis supported that snakehead UCP1 was closely related to piscine UCP1. In addition, ucp1 was found to extensively expressed in all detected tissues, with the highest level in liver. Futhermore, the hepatic ucp1 was found to significantly increased after short-term and long-term food deprivation, and dramatically increased following refeeding. These findings suggested that snakehead UCP1 might play important roles in food intake regulation and fatty acid metabolism in snakehead fish, and it could be as a potential target locus to improve commercial production of this kind of fish.",

Neural oscillators in the rostral and caudal medulla drive ventilation in amphibians, and previous reports describe ventilatory oscillators and CO2 sensitive regions arise during different stages of amphibian metamorphosis. However, inconsistent findings have been enigmatic, and make comparisons to potential mammalian counterparts challenging. In the current study we assessed amphibian central CO2 responsiveness and respiratory rhythm generation during two different developmental stages. Whole-nerve recordings of respiratory burst activity in cranial and spinal nerves were made from intact or transected brainstems isolated from tadpoles during early or late stages of metamorphosis. Brainstems were transected at the level of the trigeminal nerve, removing rostral structures including the nucleus isthmi, midbrain, and locus coeruleus, or transected at the level of the glossopharyngeal nerve, removing the putative buccal oscillator and caudal medulla. Removal of caudal structures stimulated the frequency of lung ventilatory bursts and revealed a hypercapnic response in normally unresponsive preparations derived from early stage tadpoles. In preparations derived from late stage tadpoles, removal of rostral or caudal structures reduced lung burst frequency, while CO2 responsiveness was retained. Our results illustrate that structures within the rostral medulla are capable of sensing CO2 throughout metamorphic development. Similarly, the region controlling lung ventilation appears to be contained in the rostral medulla throughout metamorphosis. This work offers insight into the consistency of rhythmic respiratory and chemosensitive capacities during metamorphosis.",

At low salinities, the gill enzyme exhibits a single, low affinity ATP binding site. However, at elevated salinities, a second, high affinity, ATP binding site appears, independently of exposure time. (Na+, K+)-ATPase \u03b1-subunit mRNA expression increases only after 10\u202fdays acclimation to 5\u2030S.

To better understand the underlying molecular regulation mechanisms of the NlVg in the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens (N. lugens), the correlation between one early ecdysone response gene E74 and one important fecundity-related gene angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on the regulation of Vg gene expression, was investigated. We first showed that the mRNA expression level of NlACE were significantly higher in a high-fecundity population (HFP) than a low-fecundity population (LFP) at different development stages, and knockdown of NlACE expression by RNA interference (RNAi) results in a reduced level of NlVg expression and N. lugens fecundity. Subsequently, we analyzed the promoter of NlACE and found an E74A binding site, which was also differentially expressed in HFP and LFP. Then a gene putatively encoding E74A, namely NlE74A, predominant in the ovary and fat body was cloned and characterized. Furthermore, the developmental profile during female adult and the tissue-specific expression pattern of NlACE and NlE74A were similar to the expression pattern of NlVg gene, implying that both NlACE and NlE74A may be involved in regulating the expression of NlVg. Finally, after injecting the dsRNA of NlE74A, the NlACE expression levels were significantly reduced simultaneously at 24 h and 48 h post-injection, and the NlVg expression level was significant reduced at 24 h post-injection and the downswing was more significant at 48 h post-injection. These results imply that regulation of NlE74A on NlVg transcription might be mediated by NlACE through the E74 binding site at the NlACE promoter region in N. lugens.",

An understanding of the cellular shifts throughout the temperature range that an organism experiences in the wild is often lacking, especially for species of conservation concern such as the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). We examined the expression of 15 genes that represented cellular responses related to stress, growth, cell proliferation and osmoregulation to show how the response patterns change to acute increases in temperatures that occur throughout the thermal distribution of the species. Several genes showed U-shaped or inverted U-shaped response patterns suggesting the presence of sub-lethal thresholds as temperatures increase. We also highlight the importance of including a temporal component to exposure studies as several genes showed a delay in the recovery to control levels at extreme temperatures. We propose that the non-linear response patterns represent sub-lethal thermal thresholds that can predict the severity of the response to thermal stressors. Identifying these sub-lethal thresholds can help differentiate between responses to routine increases in water temperature and responses that can lead to longer-term fitness impacts.",

Autotransplantation of methanol-fixed cell-free scales triggers scale resorption and regeneration, as well as helps elucidate the process of bone remodeling. We investigated osteoclastic markers, osteoblastic markers, and gene expressions of communicating molecules (RANKL, ephrinB2, EphB4, EphA4, Wnt10b) by qPCR, in situ hybridization for Wnt10b, and immunohistochemistry for EphrinB2 and EphA4 proteins to elucidate the bone remodeling process. Furthermore, functional inhibition experiments for the signaling of ephrinB2/Eph, ephrin/EphA4, and Wnt10b using specific antibodies, revealed that these proteins are involved in key signaling pathways promoting normal bone remodeling. Our data suggests that the remodeling process comprises of two successive phases. In the first absorption phase, differentiation of osteoclast progenitors by RANKL is followed by the bone absorption by mature, active osteoclasts, with the simultaneous induction of osteoblast progenitors by multinucleated osteoclast-derived Wnt10b, and proliferation of osteoblast precursors by ehprinB2/EphB4 signaling. Subsequently, during the second formation phase, termination of bone resorption by synergistic cooperation occurs, with downregulation of RANKL expression in activated osteoblasts and Ephrin/EphA4-mediated mutual inhibition between neighboring multinucleated osteoclasts, along with simultaneous activation of osteoblasts via forward and reverse EphrinB2/EphB4 signaling between neighboring osteoblasts. In addition, the present study shows that autologous transplantation of methanol-fixed cell-free scale is an ideal in vivo model to study bone remodeling.",

However, sperm production in response to the hormones is highly variable, and the steroidogenic potential of the testis may be diminished due to sustained hormone supply. Here, we compared the effectiveness of low (9\u202f\u03bcg/kg) and high (18\u202f\u03bcg/kg) doses of rFsh and rLh to improve sperm production in adult sole during late winter-early spring (onset of the natural spawning period), and in autumn under a controlled temperature of 12\u202f\u00b0C (period of testicular recrudescence). Treatment with rFsh over six weeks during spring, followed by a single rLh injection, did not enhance sperm production, possibly because of an advanced stage of sexual maturation of the males, as reflected by high Lh plasma levels (~17\u202fng/ml) before rFsh treatment. In contrast, in autumn, when the Lh circulating levels were much lower (~3\u202fng/ml), the low doses of rFsh and rLh generated a four-times increase in sperm production, whereas the high doses of the hormones were ineffective. However, treatment with rLh, regardless of the effect of rFsh, improved the motility of spermatozoa during both spring and autumn. These data confirm that consecutive rFsh and rLh treatments increase sperm production and quality in adult sole males, although they seem to be highly sensitive to the rFsh dose. The efficiency of recombinant gonadotropins also appears to be season-dependent despite the asynchronous nature of the sole testis.",

Burst amplitude was maintained for 120\u202fmin, but then decreased during the last 120\u202fmin. The number of bursts/respiratory event decreased within 30\u202fmin and remained decreased. Pretreatment with either prazosin (\u03b11-adrenergic antagonist) or MDL7222 (5-HT3 antagonist) blocked the hypoxia-induced short-term increase and the longer duration decrease in burst frequency. MDL7222, but not prazosin, blocked the hypoxia-induced decrease in bursts/respiratory event. Thus, during bath hypoxia, isolated turtle brainstems continued to produce respiratory motor output, but the frequency and pattern were altered in a manner that required endogenous \u03b11-adrenergic and serotonin 5-HT3 receptor activation. This is the first example of isolated reptile brainstems exhibiting central hypoxic chemosensitivity similar to other vertebrate species.",

In the present study, we assessed changes in glycogen concentration and gene expression patterns of glycogen-metabolizing enzymes in developing masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou masou), a salmonid species inhabiting west side of North Pacific Ocean. As we measured glycogen levels in the bodies and yolk sacs containing the liver separately, the glycogen concentration increased in both parts as the fish developed, whereas it transiently decreased in the yolk sac after hatching, implying glycogen synthesis and breakdown in these tissues. Immunofluorescence staining using anti-glycogen monoclonal antibody revealed localization of glycogen in the liver, muscle and yolk syncytial layer of the pre-hatching embryos and hatched larvae. In order to estimate glycogen metabolism in the fish, the genes encoding homologs of glycogen synthase (gys1 and gys2) and glycogen phosphorylase (pygma, pygmb and pygl) were cloned, and their expression patterns were assessed by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. In the fish, gys1 and gys2 were robustly expressed in the muscle and liver, respectively. Also, expression of pyg isoforms was found in muscle, liver and yolk syncytial layer during hatching. With changes in glycogen concentration and expression patterns of relevant genes, our results suggest, for the first time, possible involvement of glycogen in energy balance of fish embryos, especially during hatching.",

The behavior can be induced by reduced glutathione (GSH), contained in body fluids that leak from prey impaled by hydra's cnidocysts. Mouth, tentacle, and body-contraction behavior is carried out by hydra's ectodermal and endodermal epitheliomuscular cells. Here, we present the first evidence of GSH-induced electrical activity in the hypostome and its modification by GABA and GABAB ligands. The \u2018heads\u2019 of hydra were ablated and the tentacles removed. Suction electrodes, positioned on the mouth, recorded electrical activity produced by GSH, contained either within the electrode, or in the surrounding bath, the mouth being shielded. Recorded impulses were characterized, according to size and temporal pattern, as small, medium and (large) pacemaker impulses. GSH applied in the bath caused a frequency increase of small and medium impulses and a decrease in pacemaker bursts. The changes in frequencies of medium and pacemaker bursts, though not obviously affected by GABA, were counteracted by blocking GABAB inhibition with phaclofen. Only the highest concentration of GSH applied at the mouth potentially decreased pacemaker frequency and potentially increased medium impulses, without affecting small impulses. GABA caused a significant increase in small and medium impulses relative to GSH which was counteracted by baclofen and/or baclofen plus phaclofen. The results indicate that considerable GSH-receptor circuitry is located in hypostomal tissue proximal to hydra's mouth, and substantiate GABA and GABAB inhibition within the neuroeffector network of the feeding response.",

The plasma osmolality of all the tilapia species were elevated with the salinity challenge. The activities of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) in both the gill and kidney showed a similar increased change tendency compared with the control. The distribution of NKA \u03b11 mRNA in all the examined tissues suggested that NKA \u03b11 has a possible housekeeping role for this isoform. The amount of NKA \u03b11 mRNA in the gill and kidney was elevated in the four fishes with similar expression patterns after transfer from freshwater to seawater. The NKA\u03b11 mRNA expression levels in the gill reached their peak level at 24\u202fh after transfer (P\u202f< 0.01) compared to the freshwater group, following decreases in the pretreatment level at 48\u202fh (P\u202f> 0.05).

The differences in the responses to saltwater challenge may be associated with differences in saltwater tolerance between the four tilapia. The drastic increase in the plasma osmolality, NKA activities and mRNA expression suggested that the hybrids (O. mossambicus\u2640\u202f\u00d7\u202fO. hornorum\u2642) possess heterosis in salinity responsiveness compared to that of both the parents, indicating a maternal effect on the salinity tolerance of the tilapia hybrids.

     "abstract": "Leptin (Lep) is a key factor for the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis in mammals. To date, a number of studies have provided evidence for the existence of multiple leptin genes in teleosts, but not much information is available in fish regarding the regulation of leptin genes by sex steriods. As a first step, two leptin genes (lepa and lepb) and a leptin receptor (lepr) gene were cloned from the half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), a representative species of the order Pleuronectiformes. The full-length cDNAs of tongue sole lepa and lepb were 1265\u202fbp and 1157\u202fbp in length, encoding for proteins of 160 aa and 158 aa, respectively. The three-dimensional structures modeling of tongue sole LepA and LepB showed strong conservation of tertiary structure with other vertebrates. The full-length cDNA of tongue sole lepr was 4576\u202fbp, encoding a protein of 1133 aa which contained all functionally important domains conserved among vertebrate LepRs. Tissue distribution analysis showed that tongue sole lepa mRNA was highly detectable in the ovary and brain, while lepb mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Notably, the tongue sole lepr mRNA was most abundant in the ovary. Using a primary hepatocyte culture system, we evaluated the effects of sex steroids on lep/lepr gene expression. Both 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) inhibited hepatic lepa and lepr mRNAs without affecting lepb mRNA levels. In addition, T also suppressed growth hormone receptor 1 (ghr1), ghr2, and insulin-like growth factor 2 (igf-2) mRNA levels, and stimulated expression of igf-1 gene. On the other hand, none of these four genes were altered by E2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a direct and differential regulation of lep/lepr gene expression by sex steroids at the hepatocyte level of a flatfish, supporting that individual leptin peptide may possess different biological roles in teleosts.",

White sturgeon of two ploidies (8\u202fN and 10\u202fN) were acclimated to ambient (18\u202f\u00b0C) and warm (22\u202f\u00b0C) water. Bioindices of stress (plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate, total erythrocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean erythrocyte volume, mean erythrocyte hemoglobin, and mean erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration), immunity (respiratory burst, plasma lysozyme, and total leukocyte count), and cellular metabolic capacity (lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activity) were measured before and after a 6-week acclimation period. Both ploidies appear comparable in their constitutive immune and stress parameters and respond similarly to warming. Hematological indices suggest 8\u202fN and 10\u202fN sturgeon are similar in oxygen carrying capacity; however, differences in enzyme activity between ploidies indicate that 10\u202fN sturgeon may have a lower cellular aerobic capacity. Our results have implications for the screening and management of ploidy on white sturgeon farms and hatcheries, as the differences between ploidies may affect 10\u202fN sturgeon performance at elevated water temperatures. Further research is needed to elucidate the differences in inducible stress and immune responses and metabolism of white sturgeon of different ploidies.",

Relatively little is known about the importance of metabolic rate for the survival of freezing, despite a good understanding of several cold tolerance related physiological mechanisms. We hypothesized that low basal metabolism would be selected for in freeze-tolerant organisms where winter survival is important for fitness for two reasons. First, avoidance of the additive effect of ROS production from metabolism and freezing, and second, as an energy-saving mechanism under extended periods of freezing where the animal is metabolically active, but unable to feed. We used the terrestrial oligochaete, Enchytraeus albidus, which is widely distributed from Spain to the high Arctic and compared eight populations originating across a broad geographical and climatic gradient after they had been cold acclimated at 5\u202f\u00b0C in a common garden experiment. Cold tolerance (lower lethal temperature: LT50) and the potential metabolic activity (PMA, an estimator of the maximal enzymatic potential of the mitochondrial respiration chain) of eight populations were positively correlated amongst each other and correlated negatively with latitude and positively with average yearly temperature and the average temperature of the coldest month. These results indicate that low PMA in cold tolerant populations is important for survival in extremely cold environments.",

This study tested whether plasma Igf1 concentrations might serve as an indicator of somatic growth in olive rockfish (Sebastes serranoides), one species among dozens of rockfishes important to commercial and recreational fisheries in the Northern Pacific Ocean. Juvenile olive rockfish were reared under food ration treatments of 1% or 4% wet mass per d for 98 d to experimentally generate variation in growth. Juvenile rockfish in the 4% ration grew 60% more quickly in mass and 22% faster in length than fish in the 1% ration. Plasma Igf1 levels were elevated in rockfish under the 4% ration, and individual Igf1 levels correlated positively with growth rate, as well as with individual variation in hepatic igf1 mRNA levels. Transcripts encoding the Igf binding proteins (Igfbps) igfbp1a and igfbp1b were also at higher abundance in the liver of rockfish in the 1% ration treatment, while mRNAs for igfbp5a and igfbp5b were elevated in the skeletal muscle of 4% ration fish. These findings support the use of plasma Igf1 as a physiological index of growth rate variation in rockfish.",

In contrast, ZIP9 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated 4-fold in hypoxia-exposed fish compared to normoxic controls. The enhanced apoptosis in ovaries of hypoxia-exposed fish was associated with increased caspase-3/7 activity and elevated expression of the pro-apoptotic genes, Bax and p53.

An hypoxia/re-oxygenation experiment using wild-caught Cyphocharax abramoides (Rio Negro, Brazil), was designed to answer these questions. Lipid peroxidation (MDA), a measure of oxidative damage, and antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP)), were measured in brain, gill and liver tissues after normoxia, 3-h hypoxia (2.7\u202fkPa), and 3-h hypoxia followed by 1-h or 3-h re-oxygenation, implemented either immediately or slowly (3.0\u202fkPa\u00b7h\u22121). Critical oxygen tension of routine oxygen consumption rate (Pcrit) (4.1\u202fkPa) and the PO2 at loss of equilibrium (LOE) (1.7\u202fkPa) were determined to set the experimental hypoxia exposure. The Regulation Index, a measure of oxyregulation with declining PO2, was 0.32. Oxidative damage occurred during hypoxia: no additional damage was observed during re-oxygenation. Tissues responded differentially. GPx and MDA rose in the brain and gills, and SOD (and likely GPx) in the liver during hypoxia. Antioxidants increased further at LOE. Rate of oxygen increase during re-oxygenation did not affect antioxidant responses. In brain and gills, GPx and MDA decreased or recovered after 1-h re-oxygenation. In liver, SOD remained high and GPx increased. In summary, C. abramoides incurred oxidative damage during hypoxic exposure with no additional damage inflicted during re-oxygenation: the rate of re-oxygenation was inconsequential.

To minimize energy expenses, Wilson's storm-petrel chicks can reduce their metabolism and body temperature by entering hypothermia. Hypothermia is reported to impact development, hence we hypothesized that hypothermia will be majorly used after long fasting periods. Chick development in a breeding colony of Wilson's storm-petrels on the South Shetland Islands was monitored daily during three consecutive summers by recording chicks' body mass and temperature, as well as environmental parameters. Provisioning, and body conditions were highest in 2017, and chicks became hypothermic most frequently in 2016. Body temperature was influenced by age, mass, body condition, and minimal nocturnal temperatures. While most chicks were able to maintain stable body temperatures when not fed for one day, some chicks' body temperatures decreased by up to 21\u202f\u00b0C. Age did not differ between those two groups, but chicks maintaining their active body temperatures had higher body conditions. Snowstorms were typically followed by several days of unreliable food provisioning and continuous days of fasting. Most chicks were hypothermic during this time, and were hence able to survive periods of food shortages, reverse their low body temperatures after the next feeding event, and regain body mass. We conclude that hypothermia is a strong survival strategy to endure times of fasting, which might be necessary for Antarctic storm-petrel chicks to reach adulthood. However, in future scenarios, which may include more frequent snowstorms due to climate change, malnourishment could lead to more frequent use of hypothermia, which could affect chicks' development.",

In order to better understand the role of monoamine neurotransmitters in the regulation of feeding in fish, we examined the effects of fasting on the brain and intestine gene expression of enzymes involved in their synthesis pathways (SPR: sepiapterin reductase; DHPR: dihydropteridine reductase; TH: tyrosine hydroxylase; TPH: tryptophan hydroxylase; AADC: aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase; DBH: dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase) in goldfish. In order possible interactions between the monoaminergic pathways and appetite-regulating hormones, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injections of orexin, CCK and irisin on the brain and intestine gene expression of these enzymes. Fasting increased the expressions of SPR, TH, DBH, TPH1 and DHPR in the brain but did not affect the intestinal expressions of any of the enzymes examined, suggesting that nutritional status might affect the synthesis of monoamines in the central nervous system. CCK injections decreased feeding and increased SPR, TH, and TPH expressions in both brain and intestine. Orexin injections increased feeding and SPR and AADC expressions in the brain but did not affect the expressions of any of the enzymes in the intestine. Irisin injections decreased feeding and increased TPH2 and AADC brain expressions and TH and SPR intestinal expressions, and decreased TPH1 brain expression and AADC intestinal expression.

Exposure to 35\u202f\u00b0C also significantly increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in the gills of Sp1 and Sp2, with transient changes in hepatopancreas. Apart from changes in antioxidant enzyme activities, HSPs were highly up-regulated after exposure to 37\u202f\u00b0C, especially for HSP70. Gill HSP70 expression in Sp2 was 6.1 folds that of the control after 24\u202fh of exposure to 37\u202f\u00b0C, and 9.2 folds that of Sp1. Moreover, exposure to 37\u202f\u00b0C further up-regulated HSP70 in the hepatopancreas of Sp1, compared to that in Sp2. Hence, HSPs play important roles in thermotolerance in S. paramamosain and Sp1 might have a stronger tolerance to hyperthermal stress than Sp2.",

Vespertilionidae has a world-wide distribution. Mystacinidae is restricted to New Zealand, although related to five neotropical families and one in Madagascar reflecting a shared Gondwanan origin of their Noctilionoidea superfamily. Both species have highly variable body temperatures and rates of metabolism. They feed on flying insects, which requires them to be torpid in shelters during cold, wet periods. In dry weather Mystacina is active in winter at ambient temperatures as low as \u22121.0\u202f\u00b0C, foraging for terrestrial invertebrates in leaf litter, even in the presence of snow, and consuming fruit, nectar, and pollen from endemic plants that bloom in winter. The behavior of Mystacina expands its presence in a cool, wet, temperate forest in a manner unlike any other bat, another example of the distinctive characteristics of the endemic New Zealand fauna. The use of torpor generally depends on a series of factors, including body mass, ambient temperature, latitude, reproductive cycle, sociality, and fat deposits. These factors result in a diversity of responses that range along a continuum from short-term torpor to hibernation.",

However, little information is available in teleosts regarding the intracellular signal transduction pathway in response to GnIH. To this end, we first cloned the gene of LPXRFa (the piscine ortholog of GnIH) receptor in the half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), a representative species of the order Pleuronectiformes. The full-length cDNA of LPXRFa receptor was 2201\u202fbp in size with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1365\u202fbp that encoded 454 amino acids. Tissue distribution showed that LPXRFa receptor transcripts could be detected at high levels in the brain, to a lesser extent in the pituitary, and at low levels in the ovary and other peripheral tissues. In vitro functional analysis revealed that putative tongue sole LPXRFa-1 and LPXRFa-2 peptides significantly stimulated serum responsive element-dependent luciferase (SRE-luc) activity in COS-7 cells transfected with the novel receptor, and these stimulatory effects were evidently reduced by two inhibitors of the PLC/PKC pathway. In addition, neither LPXRFa-1 nor LPXRFa-2 altered the cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-luc activity, but only LPXRFa-2 could markedly decrease forskolin-induced CRE-luc activity in COS-7 cells expressing its cognate receptor. Taken together, our results encompass the first study reporting the existence of LPXRFa receptor in the order Pleuronectiformes and provide novel evidence of differential activation of signaling pathways by LPXRFa peptides in fish.",

The membrane associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, syndecan-4 and glypican-1, link the satellite cell niche to the intracellular environment. Sydnecan-4 and glypican-1 are differentially expressed with age in turkey satellite cells and their over-expression impacts both satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, but their effect on satellite cells from lines with different growth potentials is not known. The objective of the current study was to determine if syndecan-4 and glypican-1 regulation of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation is affected by age and growth selection. Pectoralis major satellite cells isolated at 1\u202fd, 7 and 16-wk of age from a Randombred Control 2 (RBC2) line and a 16-wk body weight (F) line selected from the RBC2 line turkeys were studied. Syndecan-4 and glypican-1 expression was knocked down in both lines. The F-line cells proliferated faster than RBC2 line cells regardless of age, while differentiation tended to be greater in RBC2 line cells than F-line cells at each age. Syndecan-4 knockdown decreased proliferation at 7- and 16-wk but not 1\u202fd cells, and increased differentiation at 1\u202fd and 7\u202fwk but not 16\u202fwk cells. Glypican-1 knockdown differentially affected proliferation depending on cell age, whereas differentiation was decreased for 7- and 16-wk but not 1\u202fd cells.

     "abstract": "Vagility is defined as the relative capacity for movement. We developed previously a quantitative metric in vertebrates for physiological vagility (PV), the speed at which an animal can move sustainably, incorporating aerobic capacity, body size, body temperature, and transport costs, allowing quantitative tests of whether PV can explain variation in interclass population genetic structure and behaviors involved in dispersal. We found that PV increased with body mass, correlated with maximal dispersal distances, and was inversely related to genetic structure in multiple vertebrate groups. Here we review these relationships and expand our analysis to include additional groups; we also suggest that PV may be utilized to partially explain variation in migratory capacity between groups. We show a positive correlation between PV and maximum migration distance (MMAX) in most groups that reflects many of the relationships observed between PV and dispersal. Flying birds, marine mammals, and large terrestrial mammals display the greatest MMAX and each of these groups has the highest PV among vertebrate groups, while reptiles and small terrestrial mammals had the lowest PV and MMAX. By contrast, marine turtles have exceptional MMAX but do not possess high PV. We suggest that PV is an important mechanism enabling both dispersal and migratory capacity, and affects genetic structure, but that other life history characteristics also need to be considered.",

Further, administration of CRA into avitellogenic crabs produced higher amounts of Retinoid X Receptor, Ecdysteroid Receptor, E75 and vitellogenin mRNAs in the hepatopancreas. Mandibular organ and Y-organ explants isolated from avitellogenic crabs secreted more of methyl farnesoate and ecdysteroids respectively when incubated with CRA.

Our results showed that cold and heat stress induced a temperature-dependent increase in mortality rate. ROS production increased significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) after both cold and heat stress. However, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT and GSH-Px, were greatly enhanced only after heat stress. In addition, MDA content and MMP increased significantly under both cold and heat stress. The up-regulation of Hsp70 transcripts was only detected after acute stress at 35\u202f\u00b0C. However, p38-MAPK phosphorylation levels increased after both cold and heat stress. In addition, a moderate activation of caspase-3 was found after mussels were exposed to 8\u202f\u00b0C and 42\u202f\u00b0C stress. Our results suggest that both extreme cold and heat stress could induce ROS production in the gill tissue of P. viridis, which might result in lipid peroxidation and mitochondria dysfunction. Antioxidative enzymes and Hsp70 might be important in the heat stress response of animals, whereas p38-MAPK might be crucial in the acute response to both cold and heat stress. However, caspase-3 activation might be very weak under both cold and heat stress.",

Ala-Pro-Gly-Trp-NH2 (APGWamide), a neuromediator expressed in the neural ganglia of mollusks, controls sexual maturation and reproduction. To clarify the role of APGWamide in sexual behavior regulation and gamete cell maturation in mollusks, we cloned the cDNA of APGWamide precursor (Hdh-APGWamide) and examined the spatiotemporal expression of the transcript in the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The 222-amino acid sequence of the precursor deduced from the cDNA sequence showed typical features of gastropod APGWamide precursors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Hdh-APGWamide is classified with other gastropod APGWamide precursors, which form a separate branch from those of the bivalves. Hdh-APGWamide mRNA was highly expressed in the neural ganglia in both sexes. In females, the three ganglia (pleuro-pedal ganglion, PPG; branchial ganglion, and cerebral ganglion) showed similar expression in immature and mature animals, whereas in males, the level in the PPG only was higher at maturity (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

The mechanism underlying the automaticity of vertebrate myogenic hearts involves cells (pacemaker cells), which have a distinct set of ion channels that include hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and T-type calcium ion channels. We hypothesized that these ion channels also underlie the automatic myogenic heartbeat of Daphnia magna. The drugs, ZD7288 and mibefradil dihydrochloride, block HCN and T-type calcium ion channels respectively. Application of these drugs, in separate experiments, show that they inhibit the heartbeat of Daphnia magna in a dose-dependent manner. Calculation of the percent difference between the heart rate of pretreatment (before drug application) and heart rate following drug application (post-treatment) allowed us to graph a dose-response curve for both ZD7288 and mibefradil, revealing that ZD7288 produces a greater effect on decreasing heart rate. This indicates the HCN ion channels play a foremost role in generating Daphnia magna heartbeat.

Using an inbred strain, the W-strain, we crowded the W-strain with seven other Lymnaea strains/populations as well as with Helisoma.

     "abstract": "Understanding the physiological responses of fishes to salinity changes and aquatic hypoxia is essential for the conservation of marine species. Salinity changes affect the osmotic gradient across the gill epithelium, while hypoxia increases gill ventilation and the flow of water over the gills. Both processes affect the diffusive movement of ions and water across the gill epithelium, and the rate of active ion transport required for maintaining osmotic homeostasis. Consequently, salinity and hypoxia may affect the energetic cost of osmoregulation, and consequently the energy available for other physiological functions such as migration, growth, and reproduction. Historically, studies have assessed the costs of osmoregulation and ventilation in fishes via standard metabolic rate (SMR); however, few studies have used a multi-stressor approach that fully accounts for the osmorespiratory compromise. Here, we determined the combined effects of salinity and hypoxia on SMR, routine metabolic rate (RMR), and plasma ion concentrations in red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) acclimated to salinities ranging from freshwater to hypersalinity. Surprisingly, there was no significant change in any parameter as a consequence of salinity or hypoxia, including the relatively extreme scenario of combined hypersalinity and hypoxia exposure. We conclude that changes in the osmotic gradient across the gill epithelium and the flow of water over the gills have a negligible effect on the whole animal energy budget of S. ocellatus, suggesting that the cost of osmoregulation is a minor component of basal metabolism regardless of oxygenation status.",

Intraperitoneal injections of morphine changed the ventilation pattern from a typical intermittent/periodic pattern with a few or several breaths in ventilatory bouts to single breaths and prolonged the apnoea, such that respiratory frequency was depressed, while tidal volume was elevated. Furthermore, the duration of inspiration and especially expiration was prolonged. The resulting decrease in minute ventilation was attended by a lowering of the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (especially for 20\u202fmg\u202fkg\u22121 dose) indicating CO2 retention with a long time constant for approaching the new steady state. The changes in ventilation pattern and gas exchange reached a new stable level approximately 3\u202fh after the morphine injection and did not significantly affect steady state O2 uptake, i.e. O2 consumption.

Previous studies have demonstrated that surfclams in this geographic range show signs of physiological stress, suggested to be a result of increasing ocean temperatures. In this study, we examined the effect of 2 temperature regimes (19\u202f\u00b0C and 23\u202f\u00b0C) on surfclam physiology. These temperatures were chosen because they represent maximal (23\u202f\u00b0C) and minimal (19\u202f\u00b0C) temperatures prevailing in New York clamming areas during summer. Results demonstrated enhanced energy metabolism and significant reductions in filtration rate, scope for growth, and immune functions in clams exposed to the warmer temperature treatment. Although net energy gains remained positive in both treatments under our experimental conditions, the findings suggest that temperature stress is involved in the recent observations of surfclams in poor condition. The impact of elevated temperatures on phytoplankton quantity/quality and other environmental variables in combination with the direct impact on surfclam filtration and metabolic rates could lead to a negative energy balance. While some uncertainties remain about population-scale impacts of overall warming trends, we fear that future increases in temperature may lead to the collapse of the Atlantic surfclam between New York and Virginia, especially within inshore regions.",

     "abstract": "The brain is a highly demanding organ in terms of energy requirements, and precise regulatory mechanisms must operate to ensure adequate energy delivery to maintain normal neuronal activity. Of the energy-promoting substrates present in the circulation, glucose is preferred by the brain, and as with all other substrates, its utilization depends on the presence of humoral factors such as hormones including growth hormone (GH). Glucose enters the cells though specific transport proteins. Among all transporter families and subtypes described to date, the most studied ones are the glucose transporters (GLUTs). The aim of this study is to determine a possible relationship between GH and GLUTs. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of GH-transgenesis and recombinant GH injections upon GLUT expression in the brain of male zebrafish. Overall, the results demonstrated that increasing the GH concentrations above the normal level, via transgenesis or injection, in the fish may impair energy uptake by the brain. This appeared to occur through downregulation of most of the analyzed GLUTs.",

     "abstract": "Mammalian torpor is a phenotype characterized by a controlled decline of metabolic rate, generally followed by a reduction in body temperature. During arousal from torpor, both metabolic rate and body temperature rapidly returns to resting levels. Metabolic rate reduction experienced by torpid animals is triggered by active suppression of mitochondrial respiration, which is rapidly reversed during rewarming process. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the maximal activity of key enzymes related to electron transport system (complexes I, III and IV) in six tissues of torpid, arousing and euthermic Chilean mouse-opossums (Thylamys elegans). We observed higher maximal activities of complexes I and IV during torpor in brain, heart and liver, the most metabolically active organs in mammals. On the contrary, higher enzymatic activities of complexes III were observed during torpor in kidneys and lungs. Moreover, skeletal muscle was the only tissue without significant differences among stages in all complexes evaluated, suggesting no modulation of oxidative capacities of electron transport system components in this thermogenic tissue. In overall, our data suggest that complexes I and IV activity plays a major role in initiation and maintenance of metabolic suppression during torpor in Chilean mouse\u2013opossum, whereas improvement of oxidative capacities in complex III might be critical to sustain metabolic machinery in organs that remains metabolically active during torpor.",

     "abstract": "Marine bony fish poses the unique ability to hydrate from imbibed seawater. They accomplish this, in part, by the precipitation of inorganic carbonate mineral in their intestine, which lowers luminal osmotic pressure and allows for water uptake. It has recently been described that in the Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) this Ca(Mg)CO3 precipitation occurs under the regulation of an organic matrix. To date no investigations have aimed to determine if this phenomenon applies more generally to marine fish. Here, intestinally derived precipitates were collected from gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), white grunt (Haemulon plumieri), European flounder (Platichthys flesus), as well as Gulf toadfish, and their matrices were extracted. The ability of these matrices to regulate CaCO3 production was determined using an in vitro calcification assay, which revealed that the matrix derived from each of the tested species increased precipitation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it at higher concentrations in full agreement with the earlier studies on toadfish. Matrix extracted from European flounder precipitates was then analyzed by mass spectrometry, leading to the identification of over 50 unique proteins. When the identities of these proteins were compared to previous investigation of toadfish precipitate matrix, nearly 35% were found to overlap between the flounder and toadfish analyses, suggesting conserved mechanisms of precipitation control. The effects of using different sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solutions during precipitate purification on the resulting organic matrix are also discussed.",

Hatchery-reared animals in turbulence regimes were compared to siblings reared in quiet water, and to wild animals, using noninvasive assessments of the development of the foot muscle. The objective was to learn if the turbulence-reared phenotype mimicked laboratory-targeted aspects of the wild phenotype, that is, reflex behavior, swim tunnel performance, and resting oxygen consumption (MO2). No group exhibited different MO2. MO2 values for all of the compared groups of animals followed the power law, with an exponent of 0.69, consistent with this relationship throughout the animal kingdom. Turbulence-induced exercise did not affect the righting reflex or the tail withdrawal reflex, standard behavioral tests that involve the foot muscle, compared to quiet water-reared siblings. Wild individuals had significantly shorter time-to-right than all hatchery reared animals, however, wild animals did not perform better in flume tests. That turbulence-reared hatchery- or wild animals lacked superior flume performance suggests that this species may shelter from intertidal wave energy to remain near its optimal feeding areas.",

     "abstract": "Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) are a family of antioxidant enzymes present in all domains of life. To date, the diversity and function of peroxiredoxins within animals have only been studied in a few model species. Thus, we sought to characterize peroxiredoxin diversity in cnidarians and to gain insight into their function in one cnidarian\u2013the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Phylogenetic analysis using all six known PRX subfamilies (PRX1\u20134, PRX5, PRX6, PRXQ/AHPE1, TPX, BCP-PRXQ) revealed that like bilaterians, cnidarians contain representatives from three subfamilies (PRX1\u20134, PRX5, PRX6). Within the PRX1\u20134 subfamily, cnidarian sequences fall into two clades: PRX4, and a cnidarian-specific clade, which we term CNID-PRX. This phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the three PRX subfamilies present in Bilateria were also present in the last common ancestor of the Cnidaria and Bilateria, and further that diversification of the PRX1\u20134 subfamily has occurred within the cnidarian lineage. We next examined the impact of decreased salinity, increased temperature, and peroxide exposure on the expression of four prx genes in N. vectensis (cnid-prx, prx4, prx5, and prx6). These genes exhibited unique expression patterns in response to these environmental stressors. Expression of prx4 decreased with initial exposure to elevated temperature, cnid-prx increased with exposure to elevated temperatures as well as with hydrogen peroxide exposure, and expression of all prxs transiently decreased with reduced salinity. Predicted subcellular localization patterns also varied among PRX proteins. Together these results provide evidence that peroxiredoxins in N. vectensis serve distinct physiological roles and lay a groundwork for understanding how peroxiredoxins mediate cnidarian developmental processes and environmental responses.",

The follicle's ability to respond effectively to the induction of maturation and ovulation, resulting in viable eggs, depends on the oocyte stage at the time of induction. We hypothesized that variation in the expression of key hormone receptors in the ovary and size of oocyte lipid droplets are associated with changes in oocyte stage. Thus, we induced ovarian follicle maturation using a priming dose of fish pituitary extract followed by the administration of a 17\u03b1, 20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) injection. Females were then strip-spawned, the eggs were fertilized in vitro, incubated and larval survival was recorded at 3\u202fdays post hatch (dph). The expression of gonadotropin receptors (fshr, lhcgr1 and lhcgr2) and estrogen receptors (esr1, esr2a, esr2b, gpera and gperb) was quantified and the size of oocyte lipid droplets measured. Larval survival at 3 dph was used to differentiate high- and low-quality egg batches. Results showed significantly higher abundance of lhcgr1 and esr2a at priming for high-quality egg batches whereas fshr and gperb transcripts were significantly higher at DHP injection for low-quality egg batches. Therefore, high levels of lhcgr1 and esr2a may be important for attaining follicular maturational competence, while high fshr and gperb mRNA levels may indicate inadequate maturational competence. Furthermore, lipid droplet size at DHP and in ovulated eggs was significantly smaller in high-quality egg batches than in low-quality, which indicates that droplet size may be a useful marker of follicular maturational stage.",

Expression of the epithelial calcium channel was not affected by temperature or salinity, but had significantly higher expression in the freshwater ecotype. The combination of low temperature and low salinity had non-additive effects on the expression of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Fish exposed to the combination of low temperature and low salinity had expression levels similar to fish exposed to either factor in isolation. Expression of Na+,K+-ATPase \u03b1-subunit was greater in fish exposed to low temperature and low salinity than in fish exposed to the factors separately, and this effect was the most pronounced in the marine ecotype. We also examined the interactive effects of salinity and temperature on gill morphology in the marine ecotype, and observed non-additive effects. Low temperature increased the size of the interlamellar cell mass in fish held at 11\u202fppt, but not at 0.3\u202fppt, and the effect of low salinity was in the opposite direction in fish at high and low temperatures. These data demonstrate interactive effects of temperature and salinity and highlight that overwintering in cold freshwater was likely a physiological challenge for marine stickleback as they colonized freshwater following the last glaciation.",

In the present study, we investigate how the transcript and protein abundance of specific ion-transporter isoforms relate to each other during smolt development and seawater acclimation, and how each correlates to seawater tolerance. We show that during smolt development both mRNA and protein abundance of gill Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11a subunit (NKA\u03b11a) decreased but the decrease in the mRNA was five-times greater than that of the protein. Gill NKA\u03b11b mRNA levels increased only slightly (1.5-fold) throughout development whereas protein abundance increased 30-fold at its peak. Gill Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) increased at the mRNA and protein level (5- and 12-fold) in smolts. The abundance of a gill ion-transporter's mRNA and protein changed in the same direction through development and after seawater transfer, but the changes were not always strongly correlated: NKA\u03b11a (r\u202f=\u202f0.768), NKA\u03b11b (r\u202f=\u202f0.40), and NKCC1 (r\u202f=\u202f0.898). The maintenance of plasma chloride concentration correlated most strongly with the abundance of NKA\u03b11a mRNA, and the ratio of NKA\u03b11b to NKA\u03b11a mRNA and protein. Growth performance after seawater transfer correlated most strongly with the abundance of NKA\u03b11b protein and the ratio of NKA\u03b11b to NKA\u03b11a protein. Our results indicate that the abundance of ion-transporter mRNA and protein do not always correlate well and a decrease in the abundance of gill NKA\u03b11a mRNA and increase in NKA\u03b11b protein are strong predictors of seawater tolerance and growth performance after seawater transfer.",

Aquaculture emerges as a unique way to conserve this species, but very little biological information is available, limiting the production of this endangered species. To understand and generate more knowledge about this species, liver transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly was performed for E. marginatus by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Sequences obtained were used as a tool to validate the presence of key genes relevant to lipid metabolism, and their expression was quantified by qPCR. Moreover, we investigated the influence of supplementing different dietary fatty acids on hepatic lipid metabolism. The results showed that the different fatty acids added to the diet dramatically changed the gene expression of some key enzymes associated with lipid metabolism as well as hepatic fatty acid profiles. Elongase 5 gene expression was shown to influence intermediate hepatic fatty acid elongation in all experimental groups. Hepatic triglycerides reflected the diet composition more than hepatic phospholipids, and were characterized mainly by the high percentage of 18:3n3 in animals fed with a linseed oil rich diet. Results for the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids suggest a self-regulatory potential for retention and oxidation processes in liver, since in general the tissues did not directly reflect these fatty acid diet compositions. These results indicated that genes involved in lipid metabolism pathways might be potential biomarkers to assess lipid requirements in the formulated diet for this species.",

We investigated the effects of fish size, hypoxia, exercise and acute temperature increase on diffusive water flux rates and net sodium loss rates in juvenile rainbow trout. Trout weighing 13\u201350\u202fg were used to determine the effects of fish size under normoxia. Thereafter 25\u201350\u202fg trout were selected to assess the effects of different hypoxia levels (3.15, 5.25 and 8.40\u202fKPa), time course of hypoxia (1\u202fh 8.40\u202fKPa, 3\u202fh 8.40\u202fKPa, 1\u202fh 8.40\u202fKPa\u202f+1\u202fh normoxic recovery, and 1\u202fh 8.40\u202fKPa\u202f+\u202f3\u202fh normoxic recovery), strenuous exercise (5\u202fmin) and acute temperature challenge (transfer from 8\u202f\u00b0C to 13\u202f\u00b0C or to 18\u202f\u00b0C). Small fish (13\u202fg) had higher diffusive water flux rates than larger fish, turning over >100% of their fractional body water pool per hour against 34% per hour for 50\u202fg fish. Hypoxic exposure exerted a biphasic effect, increasing the diffusive water flux rate at 8.40\u202fKPa and 5.25\u202fKPa, while returning it to control levels at 3.15\u202fKPa. All the levels of hypoxia increased net Na+ loss. One hour hypoxia (8.40\u202fKPa) increased diffusive water flux rate while prolonged 3\u202fh hypoxia (8.40\u202fKPa), and short or prolonged normoxic recovery returned diffusive water flux rates to control levels. All the treatments over the time course of hypoxia and normoxic recovery increased net Na+ loss rates. Strenuous exercise increased both the diffusive water flux and net Na+ loss rates. Acute temperature rise increased diffusive water flux rates, with Q10 values of 4.03 for 8 to 13\u202f\u00b0C and 2.16 for 8 to 18\u202f\u00b0C, but the net Na+ loss rate did not change. There was no significant correlation between diffusive water flux rate and net Na+ loss rates at different hypoxia levels, over the course of hypoxia and normoxic recovery, or during acute temperature stress. In contrast, we observed a significant correlation between diffusive water flux and net Na+ loss rates following exercise. Overall, diffusive water flux and sodium loss were regulated differently during acute temperature challenge and hypoxia, while following exercise the two parameters were regulated in a similar fashion.",

Here we report the identification and characterization of a full-length cDNA encoding a putative LpR from the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. The deduced amino acid sequence of NlLpR possesses the conserved structural motifs of LDLR family members, and displays a high degree of similarity with sequences from other insect LpRs. NlLpR is transcribed throughout oogenesis with its maximum level on day 7 after adult female emergence. NlLpR is highly expressed in the fat body and ovary, with relative low levels in the head, epidermis and midgut. Knockdown of NlLpR using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) led to decreased triacylglycerol (TAG) content, retarded development of ovaries and decreased fecundity. Further functional analyses revealed that NlLpR works through nutritional signaling pathway-dependent activation of S6 kinase to regulate vitellogenin (Vg) biosynthesis during vitellogenesis and oocyte development. Disrupting of ecdysone receptor (EcR) expression and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) topical application demonstrated that NlLpR is regulated by ecdysone at transcript level. These results suggest that LpR is essential for Vg synthesis in the fat body and lipid uptake by developing oocytes, thus playing a critical role in insect reproduction.",

In conclusion, the concomitant changes in plasma androgen levels and pituitary ar1 expression during gametogenesis suggest a specific role for androgens in pituitary hormone regulation of reproduction in sablefish. Further, our data highlight the importance of E2 during final stages of maturation in this species, which may regulate the transcription of pituitary lhb in a paracrine fashion.",

A recent transcriptome study showed that NPY expression was altered when turkey breast muscle satellite cells were incubated at low or high temperatures, suggesting NPY may mediate temperature effects on satellite cells. However, to date minimal information exists describing the expression and function of NPY in satellite cells. The objective of this study was to determine how temperature impacts NPY and NPY receptor gene expression in satellite cells isolated from turkeys and chickens with differing genetic lineages. Two broiler and two turkey breast muscle satellite cell lines were incubated at 35, 38 or 41\u202f\u00b0C during proliferation and differentiation. In both turkey lines, NPY, and receptors NPY2R and NPY5R expression increased at elevated temperatures after 72\u202fh of proliferation. During differentiation NPY and NPY5R expression increased in both turkey lines with higher temperatures, whereas NPY2R was minimally affected by temperature. In contrast, in both chicken cell lines there were few significant differences for NPY and NPY receptor expression across temperature during proliferation. During differentiation, the temperature effect was different in the two chicken cell lines. In the BPM8 chicken line, there were few differences in NPY and NPY receptors across temperature; whereas elevated temperatures increased NPY, NPY2R, and NPY5R expression in the 708 line. The differences between turkey and chicken lines suggest NPY has species specific satellite cell functions in response to heat stress.",

Our in vitro study of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) was designed to examine whether Mel and AFMK would respond to cortisol while a glucocorticoid is added to the incubation medium. The concentrations of cortisol in the incubation medium mimic plasma cortisol levels seen in fish exposed to different types of stresses such as handling, confinement, high density, food-deprivation or air-exposure. We measured Mel and AFMK in skin explants and culture media using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. We also analysed melanosome response (dispersion/aggregation) in the explants subjected to the different treatments. Cortisol stimulated the release of Mel and AFMK from skin explants in a dose-dependent manner. Melanosome dispersion and a darkening of the skin explants were observed after incubation with cortisol. This study is the first to demonstrate the interrelationship between cortisol and Mel/AFMK in fish skin. Our data strongly suggest that the cutaneous stress response system (CSRS) is present in fish. The question remains whether Mel, AFMK or cortisol are synthetized locally in fish skin and/or transported by the bloodstream. The presence of the CSRS should be taken into account during elaboration of new indicators of fish welfare both in aquaculture and in the wild.",

This widespread issue is affecting the composition of crustacean zooplankton communities, as the presence and abundance of several calcium-rich daphniid species are declining, while two other daphniids, D. catawba and D. ambigua, that apparently tolerate low calcium environments, are prospering. The physiological basis for low calcium tolerance of these daphniids is unknown. In this study the presence of one Ca-rich (D. pulicaria) and one Ca-poor (D. ambigua) daphniid species in Canadian Shield lakes is assessed in relation to lake water Ca levels. The occurrence of D. ambigua was independent of Ca levels in Ontario lakes, whereas D. pulicaria was more likely to occur in lakes with relatively more Ca. In the laboratory, D. ambigua maintained lower levels of hemolymph Ca2+ across a range of low Ca levels (0.7 to 7\u202fmg l\u22121) compared with D. pulicaria. The hemolymph pH remained steady across this Ca gradient in D. ambigua while it was significantly more acidic in D. pulicaria in the two lowest Ca treatments. While Ca2+ uptake was observed adjacent to the surface of D. ambigua individuals, Ca2+ loss was observed for D. pulicaria assayed under moderately high Ca levels. Based on these observations we propose that D. ambigua is able to survive in low Ca lakes by maintaining low free ionic Ca2+ levels in the hemolymph which minimizes the Ca gradient across the body wall in low Ca water thus limiting overall Ca loss and facilitating Ca2+ uptake.",

The expression and activity of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), V-type H+-ATPase (VHA) and carbonic anhydrase (CA), as well as expression levels of genes encoding two HCO3\u2212 and three peptide transporters (nbc1, slc26a6, slc15a1a, slc15a1b and slc15a2) were measured in three intestinal sections of these two species, grown in freshwater and brackish/sea-water. Overall, the spatial distribution along the intestine of the genes examined in this study was similar between the two species, with the exception of tcaIV. The salinity response, on the other hand, varied greatly between these species. In O. mossambicus, there was a salinity-dependent increased expression of most of the examined genes (except slc26a6 and slc15a2), while in O. niloticus the expression of most genes did not change, or even decreased (tcaIV, nbc1 and slc15a1b). This study highlighted differences in the intestinal response to salinity acclimation between closely- related species that differ in their salinity tolerance. O. mossambicus, which has a high salinity tolerance, showed expression patterns and responses similar to marine species, and differed from the low-salinity-tolerance O. niloticus, which showed a response that differed from the accepted models, that are based on marine and diadromous fishes.",

We hypothesized that: 1) chronic as opposed to acute hypoxic incubation will alter hematological respiratory variables in embryos of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus), and 2) alterations first appearing in the embryo will persist into hatchlings through into adulthood. To test these hypotheses, we first developed an embryo-to-adult profile of normal hematological development by measuring hematocrit (Hct), red blood cell concentration ([RBC]), hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, as well plasma osmolality. Hct, [RBC] and [Hb] in normoxic-incubated birds (controls) steadily increased from ~22%, ~1.6\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202f\u03bcL\u22121 and ~7\u202fg% in day 12 embryos to almost double the values at maturity in adult birds.

In hatchlings and adults, hypoxic incubation caused no significant modification to any variables.

The specific objectives were to evaluate the effects of: (1) osmotic pressure and refrigerated storage (4\u202f\u00b0C) on activation of free sperm, (2) osmotic pressure, ions, and pH on dissociation of spermatozeugmata, and (3) CaCl2 concentration and pH on sperm membrane integrity.

The PpelOT/VP-like mRNA was 626\u202fbp long and it encoded the preprohormones containing 158 amino acids. This preprohormone consisted of a signal peptide, an active nonapeptide (CFITNCPPG) followed by the dibasic cleavage site (GKR), and the neurophysin domain. Sequence alignment of the PpelOT/VP-like peptide with those of other animals revealed strong molecular conservation. Phylogenetic analysis of encoded proteins revealed that the PpelOT/VP-like peptide was clustered within the group of crustacean OT/VP-like peptide. Analysis by RT-PCR revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts in the eyestalk, brain, ventral nerve cord (VNC), ovary, intestine and gill. The in situ hybridization demonstrated the cellular localizations of the transcripts in the central nervous system (CNS) and ovary tissues. In the eyestalk, the mRNA expression was observed in the neuronal clusters 1\u20135 but not in the sinus gland complex. In the brain and the VNC, the transcripts were detected in all neuronal clusters but not in the glial cell. In the ovary, the transcripts were found in all stages of oocytes (Oc1, Oc2, Oc3, and Oc4). In addition, synthetic PpelOT/VP-like peptide could inhibit steroid release from the ovary. The knowledge gained from this study will provide more understanding on neuro-endocrinological controls in this crab species.",

     "abstract": "The maternal allocation of carotenoids to eggs has been widely documented and manipulated. However, it is often assumed that the sole adaptive value of this allocation is to increase offspring fitness. Because carotenoids can be pro-oxidants or antioxidants depending on their concentrations and their chemical environment (i.e. presence of other antioxidants), dams may need to dispose of excess carotenoids upon depletion of other antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage. Additionally, the amount of carotenoids deposited in eggs may be dependent on male traits such as quality and coloration. We evaluated these two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for carotenoid allocation to eggs and assessed paternal effects by supplementing male and female brown anole lizards, Anolis sagrei, with dietary carotenoids or with a combination of carotenoids and vitamin C. We found significant differences in the antioxidant capacities of fertilized and unfertilized eggs produced by female lizards, but the treatment did not affect the antioxidant capacity or carotenoid content of eggs. However, the carotenoid concentration of unfertilized eggs from carotenoid-supplemented females was significantly higher than eggs from the control group. Male coloration and body size did not affect the antioxidant capacity or carotenoid content of the eggs. Carotenoids may be allocated to unfertilized eggs to offset oxidative damage to the dam, with a neutral effect on offspring, rather than to solely provide antioxidant benefits to offspring as has been widely assumed.",

     "abstract": "The energy savings experienced by fish swimming in a school have so far been investigated in an near-idealised experimental context including a relatively laminar water flow. The effects of explicitly turbulent flows and different group sizes are yet to be considered. Our repeated-measures study is a first step in addressing both of these issues: whether schooling is more energetically economical for fish when swimming in a quantified non-laminar flow and how this might be moderated by group size. We measured tail beat frequency (tbf) in sea bass swimming in a group of 3 or 6, or singly. Video data enabled us to approximately track the movements of the fish during the experiments and in turn ascertain the water flow rates and turbulence levels experienced for each target individual. Although the fish exhibited reductions in tbf during group swimming, which may indicate some energy savings, these savings appear to be attenuated, presumably due to the water turbulence and the movement of the fish relative to each other. Surprisingly, tbf was unrelated to flow rate when the fish were swimming singly or in a group of three, and decreased with increasing flow rates when swimming in a group of six. However, the fish increased tbf in greater turbulence at all group sizes. Our study demonstrates that under the challenging and complex conditions of turbulent flow and short-term changes in school structure, group size can moderate the influences of water flow on a fish's swimming kinematics, and in turn perhaps their energy costs.The energy savings that sea bass experience from schooling are affected by flow speed or turbulence, moderated by group size",

Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared by direct transesterification with KOH and analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector. Sixteen total FAs ranging in chain length from eight to 22 carbon atoms were identified. Linear discriminant analysis separated the bees based on their FA composition. Andrena was characterized by relatively high concentrations of polyunsaturated FAs, Bombus by high monounsaturated FAs and Megachilids (Megachile and Osmia) by relatively high amounts of saturated FAs. These differences in FA composition may in part be explained by variation in the diets of these bees. Because tongue (proboscis) length may be used as a proxy for the types of flowers bees may visit for nectar and pollen, we compared FA composition among Bombus that differed in proboscis length (but have similar thermal ecology). A clear separation in FA composition within Bombus with varying proboscis lengths was found using linear discriminant analysis. Further, comparing the relationship between each genus by cluster analysis revealed aggregations by genus that were not completely separated, suggesting potential overlap in dietary acquisition of FAs.",

Previous studies demonstrate that metabolic rates are repeatable under constant conditions but potentially less so in more variable environments. We measured the standard (=\u00a0minimum) metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope (=\u00a0interval between standard and maximum rates) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) after 5\u00a0weeks acclimation to each of three consecutive test temperatures (10, 13, and then 16\u00a0\u00b0C) that simulated the warming conditions experienced throughout their first summer of growth. We found that metabolic rates are repeatable over a period of months under changing thermal conditions: individual trout exhibited consistent differences in all three metabolic traits across increasing temperatures. Initial among-individual differences in metabolism are thus likely to have significant consequences for fitness-related traits over key periods of their life history.",

Its mRNA and protein levels in vitellogenic ovaries are higher than those in non-vitellogenic ovaries. In the vitellogenic ovary, both mRNA and protein expression of Maj-CFSH-ov are localized to oogonia and previtellogenic oocytes that occupy a small portion of vitellogenic ovaries, but not to the major developing oocytes. A vitellogenesis-inhibiting peptide of M. japonicus (Pej-SGP-I) reduced the expression of vitellogenin in incubated ovarian fragments, but not that of Maj-CFSH-ov. These results indicate that M. japonicus possesses two CFSH isoforms that are derived from distinct tissues, the central X-organ/sinus gland complex and peripheral ovaries.

Two cDNAs encoding salmon SNAP-25 were isolated and sequenced (SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b). These cDNAs encoded proteins with 204 amino acid residues, which showed marked homology with each other (97%). The protein and nucleotide sequences demonstrated a high level of homology between salmon SNAP-25s and those of other teleost species.

The expression levels of snap25a in the olfactory blub were higher during seaward migration than in upriver and post-upriver migrations, reflecting synaptogenesis in the olfactory nervous system, and snap25b in the telencephalon was increased during upriver period.

Spiny dogfish and little skates, species with no reported ability for synthesis, exhibited decreases in plasma and liver TMAO, respectively. Our findings are contrary to previous starvation studies demonstrating constant levels of TMAO for up to 56\u00a0days in elasmobranchs. Further, the previously reported synthetic capacity of these species did not correlate with their ability to conserve TMAO and cannot be used to predict a species reliance on dietary contributions for prolonged maintenance. It is possible that all species rely to a degree on absorption of TMAO from the diet or that alternate synthetic or regulatory pathways play a larger role than previously thought.",

     "abstract": "Antarctic marine ectothermal animals may be affected more than temperate species by rising temperatures due to ongoing climate change. Their specialisation on stable cold temperatures makes them vulnerable to even small degrees of warming. Thus, addressing the impacts of warming on Antarctic organisms and identifying their potentially limited capacities to respond is of interest.The objective of the study was to determine changes in metabolite profiles related to temperature acclimation. In a long-term experiment adult fish of two Antarctic sister species Notothenia rossii and Notothenia coriiceps were acclimated to 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0\u00b0C for three months. Impacts and indicators of acclimation at the cellular level were determined from metabolite profiles quantified in gill tissue extracts using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, the metabolite profiles of the two con-generic species were compared.NMR spectroscopy identified 37 metabolites that were present in each sample, but varied in their absolute concentration between species and between treatments. A decrease in amino acid levels indicated an increased amino acid catabolism after incubation to 5\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, long term warming initiated shifts in organic osmolyte concentrations and modified membrane structure observed by altered levels of phospholipid compounds. Differences in the metabolite profile between the two notothenioid species can be related to their divergent lifestyles, especially their different rates of motor activity. Increased levels of the Krebs cycle intermediate succinate and a higher reduction of amino acid concentrations in warm-acclimated N. rossii showed that N. rossii is more affected by warming than N. coriiceps.",

     "abstract": "Hemigrapsus crenulatus is a key species of coastal and estuarine ecosystems in the Southeastern Pacific and New Zealand. Since the gravid females-and their embryos-develop under conditions of variable salinity, we propose that low external salinity will be met with an increase in energy expenditures in order to maintain osmoregulation; subsequently, the use of energy reserves for reproduction will be affected. In this study, we investigate in H. crenulatus whether 1) the biomass and energy content of embryos is influenced by salinity experienced during oogenesis and embryogenesis and 2) how variation in the biomass and energy content of embryos affects larval energetic condition at hatching. Here at low salinity (5\u00a0PSU), egg-bearing females experienced massive and frequent egg losses, and therefore the development of their eggs during embryogenesis was not completed. In turn, at intermediate and high salinity (15 and 30\u00a0PSU) embryogenesis was completed, egg development was successful, and larvae were obtained. Consistently, larvae hatched from eggs produced and incubated at high salinity (30\u00a0PSU) were larger, had higher dry weight, and had increased carbon content and energy than larvae hatched from eggs produced at intermediate salinity (15\u00a0PSU). From these results, it is seen that the size and biomass of early life stages of H. crenulatus can be affected by environmental salinity experienced during oogenesis and embryogenesis, and this variation can then directly affect the energetic condition of offspring at birth. Therefore, this study reveals a \u201ccascade effect\u201d modulated by salinity during the early ontogeny.",

However, knowledge of anuran hatching mechanisms is limited and based largely on aquatic-breeding species without known plasticity in hatching timing. Generally, hatching gland cells produce a hatching enzyme that degrades the vitelline membrane. We investigated hatching and its regulation in terrestrial embryos of hourglass treefrogs, Dendropsophus ebraccatus, which accelerate hatching to escape dehydration. We specifically tested if changes in hatching gland cell development or hatching enzyme gene expression are associated with accelerated hatching. We measured perivitelline chamber size of well-hydrated eggs over development as an indicator of breakdown of the vitelline membrane and found that the size of the perivitelline chamber increased steadily until hatching, suggesting gradual hatching enzyme release and vitelline membrane degradation. Hatching gland cells peaked in abundance and began regression substantially prior to hatching, but we found no developmental differences in the abundance or surface area of hatching gland cells between dry and well-hydrated embryos. Hatching enzyme gene expression also peaked early in development then declined, with no difference between hydration treatments. In D. ebraccatus breakdown of the vitelline membrane appears gradual, mediated by hatching enzyme release starting long before hatching. However, hatching acceleration is not associated with ontogenetic changes in hatching gland cell development or hatching enzyme gene expression. This hatching process contrasts with that of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, which appear to release enzyme acutely at hatching, yet both species are capable of hatching to escape acute threats.",

The results show that a higher intake in antioxidants favoured compensatory growth, but this came at a cost in terms of increased oxidative damage. Increased intake of antioxidants also resulted in changes in the activity of enzymatic antioxidant defences and increased protein oxidative damage in both brain and blood. In addition, food deprivation caused increased protein oxidative damage in brain. Our findings show that the beneficial effects of dietary antioxidants on growth may be offset by hidden detrimental effects and that different early life events affect different components of oxidative status of a given tissue.",

The intestine was determined to have the capacity to digest maltose into glucose along the entirety of the tract, including the foregut. Glucose uptake was biphasic and consisted of a high-affinity, low-capacity concentration-dependent component conforming to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km 0.37\u00a0mM, Jmax 8.48\u00a0nmol/cm2/h) as well as a diffusive component. There was no observed difference in glucose flux rate along the length of the intestine, similar to other nutrients investigated in the hagfish intestine. A reduced sodium (<\u00a01\u00a0mM) environment did not result in a change in glucose uptake rates, likely due to a functional redundancy of glucose transporters. There was no observed effect of phloretin, yet the sodium glucose-linked transporter (SGLT)-specific inhibitor phlorizin significantly reduced glucose uptake at all concentrations tested (0.0001\u20131\u00a0mM). Additionally, the glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitor cytochalasin b significantly reduced glucose transport rates. The effects of these pharmacological inhibition experiments suggest the presence of multiple types of glucose transport proteins. This study clarifies the uptake strategies used by hagfish to acquire glucose at the intestine and provides insight into the evolution of such transport systems in early-diverging vertebrates.",

We describe an assay for determining metHb reductase activity in intact RBCs in physiological saline at normal Pco2 and pH. After initial loading of oxygenated RBCs with nitrite (partly oxidizing Hb to metHb), the nitrite is removed by three washes of the RBCs in nitrite-free physiological saline to enable the detection of RBC metHb reductase activity in the absence of counteracting oxidation. This assay was used to compare metHb reduction in rainbow trout and carp RBCs under both oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions. Washing resulted in effective wash-out of nitrite to low and safe values (~\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcM). The subsequent decline in [metHb] with time followed first-order kinetics, allowing characterization of metHb reductase activity through the first order rate constant k. In oxygenated RBCs at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, the k values for rainbow trout and carp were slightly below or above 0.01\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01, respectively; which is double the value reported for mammals at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. We conclude the higher metHb reductase activity in fish offsets their higher Hb autoxidation and higher likelihood of encountering elevated nitrite. Deoxygenation significantly raised the rates of RBC metHb reduction, and more so in rainbow trout than in carp. The temperature sensitivity of metHb reduction in rainbow trout RBCs was high (Q10 ~\u00a02.8) and instrumental in handling increased Hb autoxidation with temperature.",

Although both species have rather similar biological characteristics, they differ in their invasion patterns. ALB shows numerous, but local, outbreaks in urban areas of North-East America, Western and Central Europe, whereas CLB has colonized a large part of Northern Italy. Temperature is pivotal in setting distribution limits of ectotherms. Low temperature may be limiting for larvae since they are the main overwintering stage for both species. To investigate whether differential cold tolerance may contribute to setting the respective limits of the range invaded by each species, we monitored larval metabolic rate before and after exposure to a one-week ecologically relevant moderate cold stress (\u2212\u00a02/+2\u00a0\u00b0C, 14/10\u00a0h). We tested two distinctive fluctuating regimes before the cold exposure to check whether larval acclimation significantly altered their cold tolerance. Survival was high in all conditions for both species. Visual examination showed temporary locomotor inactivity during the stress but respiration rates were not altered after the stress suggesting that larvae could rapidly resume their initial metabolic activity. The respiration rate was globally higher in ALB than in CLB. Together, these results tend to indicate that both species have similar tolerance to the moderate cold stress tested, but also that ALB may be better at maintaining metabolic activity at cold than CLB. These observed differences could affect phenology in both species and in turn their establishment potential.",

The Malpighian tubules and rectum are likely targets for such transport modifications, and recent transcriptomic studies indicate shifts in Na+-K+ ATPase (NKA) and V-ATPase expression in these tissues following cold acclimation. Here we quantify the effect of cold acclimation (one week at 12\u00a0\u00b0C) on active transport in the ionoregulatory organs of adult Gryllus pennsylvanicus field crickets. We compared primary urine production of warm- and cold-acclimated crickets in excised Malpighian tubules via Ramsay assay at a range of temperatures between 4 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. We then compared NKA and V-ATPase activities in Malpighian tubule and rectal homogenates from warm- and cold-acclimated crickets via NADH-linked photometric assays. Malpighian tubules of cold-acclimated crickets excreted fluid at lower rates at all temperatures compared to warm-acclimated crickets. This reduction in Malpighian tubule excretion rates may be attributed to increased NKA activity that we observed for cold-acclimated crickets, but V-ATPase activity was unchanged. Cold acclimation had no effect on rectal NKA activity at either 21\u00a0\u00b0C or 6\u00a0\u00b0C, and did not modify rectal V-ATPase activity. Our results suggest that an overall reduction, rather than enhancement of active transport in the Malpighian tubules allows crickets to maintain hemolymph water balance during cold exposure, and increased Malpighian tubule NKA activity may help to defend and/or re-establish ion homeostasis.",

Available empirical data concerning biological response of freshwater fish to climate change remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the physiological and biochemical responses of two Iberian freshwater fish species (Squalius carolitertii and the endangered S. torgalensis), inhabiting different climatic conditions, to projected future scenarios of warming (+\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C) and acidification (\u0394pH\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.4). Herein, metabolic enzyme activities of glycolytic (citrate synthase - CS, lactate dehydrogenase - LDH) and antioxidant (glutathione S-transferase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) pathways, as well as the heat shock response (HSR) and lipid peroxidation were determined. Our results show that, under current water pH, warming causes differential interspecific changes on LDH activity, increasing and decreasing its activity in S. carolitertii and in S. torgalensis, respectively. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of warming and acidification caused an increase in LDH activity of S. torgalensis, comparing with the warming condition. As for CS activity, acidification significantly decreased its activity in S. carolitertii whereas in S. torgalensis no significant effect was observed. These results suggest that S. carolitertii is more vulnerable to climate change, possibly as the result of its evolutionary acclimatization to milder climatic condition, while S. torgalensis evolved in the warmer Mediterranean climate. However, significant changes in HSR were observed under the combined warming and acidification (S. carolitertii) or under acidification (S. torgalensis). Our results underlie the importance of conducting experimental studies and address species endpoint responses under projected climate change scenarios to improve conservation strategies, and to safeguard endangered freshwater fish.",

Sequence of the 9-aa insert in ipGR1 (WRARQNTHG) is unique compared to other teleost fish GRs. Amino acid sequence alignment of the two channel catfish GRs, revealed 55% sequence identity between them, with a high degree of sequence conservation (82%) in the DNA binding and ligand binding domains. Real-time PCR indicated that ipGR1 and ipGR2 were expressed in all tissues evaluated. Channel catfish GR1 was predominantly expressed in the gills, nearly 25-fold higher than in the liver. GR1 expression was higher than GR2 expression in gills, intestine, head kidney and heart (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This \u201cCO2 chemoreflex\u201d has been interpreted to dominate control of resting arterial PCO2/pH (PaCO2/pHa) by monitoring PaCO2/pHa and altering ventilation through negative feedback. However, PaCO2/pHa varies little in mammals as ventilation tightly couples to metabolic demands, which may minimize chemoreflex control of PaCO2. The purpose of this synthesis is to (1) interpret data from experimental models with meager CO2 chemoreflexes to infer their role in ventilatory control of steady-state PaCO2, and (2) identify physiological causes of respiratory acidosis occurring normally across vertebrate classes. Interestingly, multiple rodent and amphibian models with minimal/absent CO2 chemoreflexes exhibit normal ventilation, gas exchange, and PaCO2/pHa. The chemoreflex, therefore, plays at most a minor role in ventilatory control at rest; however, the chemoreflex may be critical for recovering PaCO2 following acute respiratory acidosis induced by breath-holding and activity in many ectothermic vertebrates. An apparently small role for CO2 feedback in the genesis of normal breathing contradicts the prevailing view that central CO2/pH chemoreceptors increased in importance throughout vertebrate evolution. Since the CO2 chemoreflex contributes minimally to resting ventilation, these CO2 chemoreceptors may have instead decreased importance throughout tetrapod evolution, particularly with the onset and refinement of neural innovations that improved the matching of ventilation to tissue metabolic demands. This distinct and elusive \u201cmetabolic ventilatory drive\u201d likely underlies steady-state PaCO2 in air-breathers.

Decades of genetic selection have resulted in significant dissimilarities in metabolism and growth between breeds, in particular fast-growing broilers and highly productive layers. A chicken develops the capacity to elevate metabolism in response to decreases in ambient temperature upon hatching, including well-developed methods of regulating thermogenesis. However, a differential timing between incipient endothermic capacities of broiler and layer strains exists. Although both broiler and layer chicks show the hallmark rapid attainment of endothermic capacity of precocial birds, endothermic capacity of broilers matures faster than that of layers. Here we characterized changes in morphology and mitochondria physiology during the developmental transition as the animals become endothermic. Changes in body mass occurred at a faster rate in broilers, with hatching embryos showing significant increases over embryonic body mass, while layers did not exhibit significant differences in mass until after hatch. Heart and liver both exhibited rapid growth upon hatching that occurred with little change in body mass in both breeds. Skeletal and cardiac mitochondrial respiration capacity in broilers increased from the embryonic stage through hatching. Oxidative phosphorylation was more tightly coupled to ATP production in broilers than layer muscles during external pipping. By selecting for faster growth and higher meat yield, the physiological transition from ectothermy to endothermy was also affected: differences in whole-animal, tissue, and organelle responses are evident in these two divergent breeds of chicken.",

Energetic support for such demands comes from a variety of natural prey items in the wild and can come from manufactured pelletized feed in captivity. This study quantified postprandial metabolism, commonly referred to as specific dynamic action (SDA), over time in adult mahi-mahi (706\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0g; 38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0cm FL) in response to satiation feeding using three different natural and manufactured diets.

Ingested meal energy did not differ significantly across groups (473\u00a0\u00b1\u00a045\u00a0kJ), nor did the duration of SDA (36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0h). Satiation feeding levels ranged from 2.9\u201316.2% bodyweight depending on the diet. Peak SDA and SDA magnitude were both significantly decreased in response to dry pelletized diet compared to the natural forage diets, despite equivalent energy consumption. Swim performance and maximum metabolic rate were not impacted significantly in satiation fed fish compared to unfed fish, supporting the evidence that mahi-mahi are able to maintain multiple metabolic demands at one time without compromising performance.",

Fish were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) fed at low stocking density (LSD-F; 5\u00a0kg\u00b7m\u2212\u00a03); (2) fed at high stocking density (HSD-F, 40\u00a0kg\u00b7m\u2212\u00a03); (3) food-deprived at LSD (LSD-FD); and (4) food-deprived at HSD (HSD-FD). After 21\u00a0days, samples from plasma, liver, hypothalamus, pituitary and head-kidney were collected. Both stressors (FD and HSD) induced a chronic stress situation, as indicated by the elevated cortisol levels, the enhancement in corticotrophin releasing hormone (crh) expression and the down-regulation in corticotrophin releasing hormone binding protein (crhbp) expression. Changes in plasma and liver metabolites confirmed a metabolic adjustment to cope with energy demand imposed by stressors. Changes in avt and it gene expression, as well as in their specific receptors (avtrv1a, avtrv2 and itr) at central (hypothalamus and pituitary) and peripheral (liver and head-kidney) levels, showed that vasotocinergic and isotocinergic pathways are involved in physiological changes induced by FD or HSD, suggesting that different stressors are handled through different stress pathways in S. aurata.",

Their ability to cope with these unstable habitats is undeniable, but it is still not clear how and to what extent salinity acclimation mechanisms are affected at temperatures higher than in the sea. In this study, juvenile sea bass were pre-acclimated to seawater (SW) at 18\u00a0\u00b0C (temperate) or 24\u00a0\u00b0C (warm) for 2\u00a0weeks and then transferred to fresh water (FW) or SW at the respective temperature. Transfer to FW for two weeks resulted in decreased blood osmolalities and plasma Cl\u2212 at both temperatures. In FW warm conditions, plasma Na+ was ~\u00a015% lower and Cl\u2212 was ~\u00a032% higher than in the temperate-water group. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity measured at the acclimation temperature (Vapparent) did not change according to the conditions. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity measured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C (Vmax) was lower in warm conditions and increased in FW compared to SW conditions whatever the considered temperature. Mitochondrion-rich cell (MRC) density increased in FW, notably due to the appearance of lamellar MRCs, but this increase was less pronounced in warm conditions where MRC's size was lower. In SW warm conditions, pavement cell apical microridges are less developed than in other conditions. Overall gill morphometrical parameters (filament thickness, lamellar length and width) differ between fish that have been pre-acclimated to different temperatures. This study shows that a thermal change affects gill plasticity affecting whole-organism ion balance two weeks after salinity transfer.",

Consumption of amylose starch in concentrations 0.25\u201310% did not affect D. melanogaster development, whereas 20% starch delayed pupation and reduced the number of larvae that reached the pupal stage. Starch levels in larval food, but not in adult food, determined levels of triacylglycerides in eight-day-old adult flies. Rearing on diet with 20% starch led to shorter lifespan and a higher content of triacylglycerides in the bodies of adult flies as compared with the same parameters in flies fed on 4% starch diet. Food supplementation with 10\u00a0mM metformin partly attenuated the negative effects of high starch concentrations on larval pupation and decreased triacylglyceride levels in adult flies fed on 20% starch. Long-term consumption of diets supplemented with metformin and starch decreased lifespan of the insects, compared with the diet supplemented with starch only. The data show that in Drosophila high starch consumption may induce a fat fly phenotype and metformin may partially prevent it.",

Individuals who preferred the rear of the school had smaller coefficients of variation in position under the two treatments, but this behavior was not correlated with any parameters for metabolic rates. Inter-school social interaction level, as indicated by total chase times, was not affected by either water velocity or food appearance. Although aerobic capacity and food stimulus did not influence the spatial position of individuals within schools, individual qingbo had spatial positional preferences within schools between different water speeds.",

     "abstract": "Secondarily marine tetrapods have evolved adaptations to maintain their osmotic balance in a hyperosmotic environment. During the transition to a marine habitat, the evolution of a euryhaline physiology likely encompassed successive changes in behavior and physiology that released organisms from regular access to fresh water. Deciphering these key steps is a complicated task. In this study, we investigated a species of freshwater natricine snake in which some populations are known to use marine environments. We experimentally subjected 30 adult Dice snakes (Natrix tessellata) from a population inhabiting the Black Sea coast to three salinities corresponding to freshwater (~\u00a00.1\u2030), brackish water (~\u00a015.0\u2030), and full-strength seawater (~\u00a034.0\u2030) in order to investigate their physiological (variation of body mass, osmolality) and behavioral (activity, drinking behavior) responses to salinity. Our results show that coastal Dice snakes from the study population are relatively tolerant to salinity close to that recorded in the Black Sea, but that prolonged exposure to full-strength seawater increases osmolality, stimulates thirst, decreases the activity of snakes and may ultimately jeopardize survival. Collectively with previously published data, our results strongly suggest specific physiological adaptations to withstand hyperosmolality rather than to reduce intake of salt, in coastal populations or species of semi-aquatic snakes. Future comparative investigations of Dice snakes from populations restricted to freshwater environment might reveal the functional traits and the behavioral and physiological responses of coastal N. tessellata to life in water with elevated salinity.",

     "abstract": "Fluctuating incubation temperatures may have significant effects on fish embryogenesis; yet most laboratory-based studies use constant temperatures. For species that experience large, natural seasonal temperature changes during embryogenesis, such as lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), seasonal temperature regimes are likely optimal for development. Anthropogenic activities can increase average and/or variability of natural incubation temperatures over large (e.g. through climate change) or smaller (e.g. thermal effluent discharge) geographic scales. To investigate this, we incubated lake whitefish embryos under constant (2, 5, or 8\u00a0\u00b0C) and fluctuating temperature regimes. Fluctuating temperature regimes had a base temperature of 2\u00a0\u00b0C with: 1) seasonal temperature changes that modeled natural declines/inclines; 2) tri-weekly +\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C, 1\u00a0h temperature spikes; or 3) both seasonal temperature changes and temperature spikes. We compared mortality to hatch, morphometrics, and heart rate at three developmental stages. Mortality rate was similar for embryos incubated at constant 2\u00a0\u00b0C, constant 5\u00a0\u00b0C, or with seasonal temperatures, but was significantly greater at constant 8\u00a0\u00b0C. Embryos incubated constantly at >\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C had reduced body growth and yolk consumption compared to embryos incubated with seasonal temperature changes. When measured at the common base temperature of 2\u00a0\u00b0C, embryos incubated at constant 2\u00a0\u00b0C had lower heart rates than embryos incubated with both seasonal temperature changes and temperature spikes. Our study suggests that incubating lake whitefish embryos with constant temperatures may significantly alter development, growth, and heart rate compared to incubating with seasonal temperature changes, emphasizing the need to include seasonal temperature changes in laboratory-based studies.",

     "abstract": "During anoxia, proper energy maintenance is essential in order to maintain neural operation. Starvation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved indicator of cellular energy status, in a cascade which modulates ATP production and consumption. We investigated the role of energetic status on anoxia tolerance in Drosophila and discovered that starvation or AMPK activation increases the speed of locomotor recovery from an anoxic coma. Using temporal and spatial genetic targeting we found that AMPK in the fat body contributes to starvation-induced fast locomotor recovery, whereas, under fed conditions, disrupting AMPK in oenocytes prolongs recovery. By evaluating spreading depolarization in the fly brain during anoxia we show that AMPK activation reduces the severity of ionic disruption and prolongs recovery of electrical activity. Further genetic targeting indicates that glial, but not neuronal, AMPK affects locomotor recovery. Together, these findings support a model in which AMPK is neuroprotective in Drosophila.",

     "abstract": "The yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, has three genes that code for proteins with sequence similarity to vertebrate Na+-K+-Cl\u2212 cotransporters (NKCCs) of the solute-linked carrier 12 superfamily of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs). We hypothesized that these mosquito NKCC orthologues have diverged to perform distinct roles in salt secretion and absorption. In phylogenetic analyses, one protein (aeNKCC1) groups with a Drosophila melanogaster NKCC that mediates salt secretion whereas two others (aeCCC2 and aeCCC3) group with a Drosophila transporter that is not functionally characterized. The aeCCC2 and aeCCC3 genes probably result from a tandem gene duplication in the mosquito lineage; they have similar exon structures and are consecutive in genomic DNA. Predicted aeCCC2 and aeCCC3 proteins differ from aeNKCC1 and vertebrate NKCCs in residues from the third transmembrane domain known to influence ion and inhibitor binding. Quantitative PCR revealed that aeNKCC1 and aeCCC2 were approximately equally expressed in larvae and adults, whereas aeCCC3 was approximately 100-fold more abundant in larvae than in adults. In larval tissues, aeCCC2 was approximately 2-fold more abundant in Malpighian tubules compared to anal papillae. In contrast, aeCCC3 was nearly 100-fold more abundant in larval anal papillae compared to Malpighian tubules, suggesting a role in absorption. Western blots with polyclonal antibodies against isoform-specific peptides revealed stronger aeCCC2 immunoreactivity in adults versus larvae, whereas aeCCC3 immunoreactivity was stronger in larvae versus adults. The differential expression pattern of aeCCC2 and aeCCC3, and their sequence divergence in transmembrane domains, suggests that they may have different roles in transepithelial salt transport.",

     "abstract": "The chemoreceptors involved in oxygen sensing in teleost fish are neuroepithelial cells (NECs) in the gills, and are analogous to glomus cells in the mammalian carotid body. Purinergic signalling mechanisms involving the neurotransmitters, ATP and adenosine, have been identified in mediating hypoxic signalling in the carotid body, but these pathways are not well understood in the fish gill. The present study used a behavioural assay to screen for the effects of drugs, that target purinergic and adenosine receptors, on the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) in order to determine if the receptors on which these drugs act may be involved in hypoxic signalling. The purinergic receptor antagonist, PPADS, targets purinergic P2X2/3 receptors and inhibited the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia (IC50\u00a0=\u00a018.9\u00a0\u03bcM). The broad-spectrum purinergic agonist, ATP\u03b3S, elicited a hyperventilatory response (EC50\u00a0=\u00a0168\u00a0\u03bcM). The non-specific adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, inhibited the hyperventilatory response to hypoxia, as did the specific A2a receptor antagonist, SCH58261 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0220\u00a0nM). These results suggest that P2X2/3 and A2a receptors are candidates for mediating hypoxic hyperventilation in zebrafish. This study highlights the potential of applying chemical screening to ventilatory behaviour in zebrafish to further our understanding of the pathways involved in signalling by gill NECs and oxygen sensing in vertebrates.",

Following up on a previous study, cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus) were sectioned to further characterize their role in controlling pulsatile urea excretion and 5-HT release within the gill. In contrast to an earlier study, nerve sectioning did not result in a change in urea pulse frequency. Total urea excretion, average pulse size, total nitrogen excretion, and percent ureotely were reduced the first day post-surgery in nerve-sectioned fish but recovered by 72\u00a0h post-surgery. Nerve sectioning also had no effect on toadfish urea transporter (tUT), 5-HT transporter (SERT), or 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression or 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) abundance in the gill, all of which were found consistently across the three gill arches except 5-HIAA, which was undetectable in the first gill arch.

     "abstract": "Molting is induced in decapod crustaceans via multiple leg autotomy (MLA) or eyestalk ablation (ESA). MLA removes five or more walking legs, which are regenerated and become functional appendages at ecdysis. ESA eliminates the primary source of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), which suppress the production of molting hormones (ecdysteroids) from the molting gland or Y-organ (YO). Both MLA and ESA are effective methods for molt induction in Gecarcinus lateralis. However, some G. lateralis individuals are refractory to MLA, as they fail to complete ecdysis by 12\u00a0weeks post-MLA; these animals are in the \u201cblocked\u201d condition. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA levels of neuropeptide and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling genes in YO, eyestalk ganglia (ESG), thoracic ganglion (TG), and brain of intact and blocked animals. Six of the seven neuropeptide signaling genes, three of four mTOR signaling genes, and Gl-elongation factor 2 (EF2) mRNA levels were significantly higher in the ESG of blocked animals. Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH mRNA levels were higher in the TG and brain of blocked animals and levels increased in both control and blocked animals in response to ESA. By contrast, mRNA levels of Gl-EF2 and five of the 10 MIH signaling pathway genes in the YO were two to four orders of magnitude higher in blocked animals compared to controls. These data suggest that increased MIH and CHH synthesis in the ESG contributes to the prevention of molt induction by MLA in blocked animals. The up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO of blocked animals suggests that the YO is more sensitive to MIH produced in the ESG, as well as MIH produced in brain and TG of ESA animals. Both the up-regulation of MIH signaling genes in the YO and of Gl-MIH and Gl-CHH in the ESG, TG, and brain appear to contribute to some G. lateralis individuals being refractory to MLA and ESA.",

In vivo life cycle parameters (e.g. cumulative offspring and life span) were observed in response to 25 and 35\u00a0psu compared to 15\u00a0psu. In addition, to investigate whether high salinity induces oxidative stress, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione S-transferase activity (GST) were measured in a salinity- (15, 25, and 35\u00a0psu; 24\u00a0h) and time-dependent manner (3, 6, 12, 24\u00a0h; 35\u00a0psu). Furthermore composition of fatty acid (FA) and lipid metabolism-related genes (e.g. elongases and desaturases) were examined in response to different salinity conditions. As a result, retardation in cumulative offspring and significant increase in life span were demonstrated in the 35\u00a0psu treatment group compared to the control (15\u00a0psu). Furthermore, ROS level and GST activity have both demonstrated a significant increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the 35\u00a0psu treatment. In general, the quantity of FA and mRNA expression of the lipid metabolism-related genes was significantly decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in response to high saline condition with exceptions for both GST-S4 and S5 demonstrated a significant increase in their mRNA expression.

The exercise training significantly improved twitch tension, cardiac pumping capacity and the contraction rate when compared to controls (CT). Inhibition of the NCX function, replacing Na+ by Li+ in the physiological solutions, diminished cardiac contractility in the EX group, reduced all analyzed parameters under both high and low stimulation frequencies. The SR blockage, using 10\u00a0\u03bcM ryanodine, caused ~\u00a050% tension reduction in CT at most analyzed frequencies while in EX, reductions (34\u201354%) were only found at higher frequencies.

In this study, a Rieske domain oxygenase, the enzyme that acts as cholesterol 7,8-dehydrogenase by converting cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol in the first step of the ecdysteroid biosynthesis was characterized in black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. A full-length cDNA of P. monodon's Rieske domain oxygenase Neverland (PmNvd) was successfully cloned. The expression of PmNvd was dominantly found in the Y-organ, and changed during molting period. The PmNvd mRNA level was low in intermolt and early premolt stages, then dramatically increased in the mid premolt stage suggesting its role in molt regulation. The function of PmNvd in the molting process was investigated by RNAi approach. Silencing of PmNvd transcript in shrimp by specific double-stranded RNA (dsNvd) led to prolonged molt duration with abnormal molting progression, i.e. the molting process got stuck at early premolt stage. In addition, 20-hydroxyecdysone titer in the hemolymph of dsNvd-injected shrimp was significantly reduced compared with that in NaCl-injected shrimp. These evidences suggested a crucial role of PmNvd in molt progression, particularly during the initiation of premolt phase via the regulation of ecdysteroid production.",

     "abstract": "As the first biochemical step of olfactory reception and recognition, odorant binding proteins (OBPs) have been demonstrated to be essential. Considering functional diversities of OBPs within a single species, we here extended the characterization of two other OBPs from Spodoptera exigua, belonging to insect Classic OBPs. With a combination of transcriptome and Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE) approaches, two OBP genes in S. exigua were identified, namely SexiOBP1 and OBP7. Expression pattern analysis revealed that both of them exhibited a distinct expression pattern, where OBP1 was broadly and highly expressed in several tissues including antennae of adults whereas OBP7 was abundant only in the antennae of both sexes, strongly indicative of olfactory roles. Further, binding assays showed that the two SexiOBPs shared a common odorant-response spectrum with considerable affinities to host odorants of acetophenone, farnesol and \u03b2-ionone (Ki\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM). Specially, OBP1 could strongly bind an insect attractant \u03b2-caryophyllene (Ki\u00a0=\u00a02.76\u00a0\u03bcM) released by maize. Intriguingly, the major sex pheromone of S. exigua, Z9,E12-14:Ac, was the best ligand for OBP7 with Ki value of 7.58\u00a0\u03bcM. Ligand structural analysis revealed that the two SexiOBPs were capable of accommodating different types of ligands in shape and size, possibly implying the plasticity of binding pockets. Ultimately, comparison of binding properties among 10 SexiOBPs including the two OBPs in this study implied a cross-talk in functions, i.e. different OBPs are also suitable to accept some common odorants except for unique ligands. Taken together, this study has provided evidence for their involvements in seeking and orientation of host plants, and meanwhile indicates functional conservation and differences between OBP1 and OBP7 from S. xigua.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia is common in aquatic environments and has substantial effects on development, metabolism and survival of aquatic organisms. To understand the physiological effects of hypoxia and its dependence on temperature, metabolic rate ( M \u0307 O 2 ) and cardiorespiratory function were studied in response to acute hypoxia (21\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u00a0kPa) at different measurement temperatures (Ta; 4, 8 and 12\u00a0\u00b0C) in Salmo salar alevins that were incubated under normoxic conditions (PO2\u00a0=\u00a021\u00a0kPa) or following hypoxic acclimation (PO2\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0kPa) as well as two different temperatures (4\u00a0\u00b0C or 8\u00a0\u00b0C). Hypoxic acclimation lead to a developmental delay manifested through slower yolk absorption. The general response to acute hypoxia was metabolic depression (~\u00a060%). Hypoxia acclimated alevins had higher M \u0307 O 2 s when measured in normoxia than alevins acclimated to normoxia. M \u0307 O 2 s were elevated to the same degree (~\u00a030% per 4\u00a0\u00b0C change) irrespective of Ta. Under severe, acute hypoxia (~\u00a05\u00a0kPa) and irrespective of Ta or acclimation, M \u0307 O 2 s were similar between most groups. This suggests that despite different acclimation regimes, O2 transport was limited to the same degree. While cardiorespiratory function (heart-, ventilation rate) was unchanged in response to acute hypoxia after normoxic acclimation, hypoxic acclimation led to cardiorespiratory changes predominantly in severe hypoxia, indicating earlier onset and plasticity of cardiorespiratory control mechanisms. Although M \u0307 O 2 in normoxia was higher after hypoxic acclimation, at the respective acclimation PO2, M \u0307 O 2 was similar in normoxia and hypoxia acclimated alevins. This is indicative of metabolic compensation to an intrinsic M \u0307 O 2 at the acclimation condition in hypoxia-acclimated alevins after re-exposure to normoxia.",

     "abstract": "Many fishes perform quick and sudden swimming maneuvers known as fast-starts to escape when threatened. In pulse-type weakly electric fishes these responses are accompanied by transient increases in the rate of electric signal production known as novelty responses. While novelty responses may increase an individual's information about their surroundings, they are aerobically powered and may come at a high energetic cost when compared to fast-starts, which rely primarily on anaerobic muscle. The juxtaposition between two key aspects of fast-starts in these fishes \u2013 the aerobic novelty response and the anaerobic swimming performance \u2013 makes them an interesting model for studying effects of hypoxia on escape performance and sensory information acquisition. We acclimated the hypoxia-tolerant African mormyrid Marcusenius victoriae to either high or low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels for 8\u00a0weeks, after which fast-starts and novelty responses were quantified under both high (normoxic) and low-DO (hypoxic) test conditions. Hypoxia-acclimated fish exhibited higher maximum curvature than normoxia-acclimated fish. Displacement of normoxia-acclimated fish was not reduced under acute hypoxic test conditions. Novelty responses were given upon each startle, whether or not the fish performed a fast-start; however, novelty responses associated with fast-starts were significantly stronger than those without, suggesting a functional link between fast-start initiation and the motor control of the novelty response. Overall, hypoxia-acclimated individuals produced significantly stronger novelty responses during fast-starts. We suggest that increased novelty response strength in hypoxia-acclimated fish corresponds to an increased rate of sensory sampling, which may compensate for potential negative effects of hypoxia on higher-level processing.",

In this study, we examined the direct actions of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) on hypothalamic expression of kisspeptin and other key factors involved in reproductive function of half-smooth tongue sole. As a first step, a partial-length cDNA of kiss2 was identified from the brain of tongue sole and kiss2 transcript levels were shown to be widely expressed in various tissues, notably in the ovary. Then, the actions of sex steroids on kiss2 and other reproduction-related genes were evaluated using a primary hypothalamus culture system. Our results showed that neither kiss2 nor its receptor kiss2r mRNA levels were significantly altered by sex steroids. Moreover, sex steroids did not modify hypothalamic expression of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (gnih) and its receptor gnihr mRNAs, either. However, E2 markedly stimulated both gnrh2 and gnrh3 mRNAs levels. Overall, this study provides insights into the role of sex steroids in the reproductive function of Pleuronectiform teleosts.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 1-wk. fasting in 5-wk. old ducklings (Cairina moschata) from whole-body resting metabolic rate and body temperature to metabolic phenotype of tissues and mitochondrial coupling efficiency. At the level of whole organism, the mass-specific metabolic rate of ducklings was decreased by 40% after 1-wk. of fasting, which was associated with nocturnal Tb declines and shallow diurnal hypothermia during fasting. At the cellular level, fasting induced a large reduction in liver, gastrocnemius (oxidative) and pectoralis (glycolytic) muscle masses together with a fuel selection towards lipid oxidation and ketone body production in liver and a lower glycolytic phenotype in skeletal muscles. At the level of mitochondria, fasting induced a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation activities and an up-regulation of coupling efficiency (+\u00a030% on average) in liver and skeletal muscles. The present integrative study shows that energy conservation in fasted ducklings is mainly achieved by an overall reduction in mitochondrial activity and an increase in mitochondrial coupling efficiency, which would, in association with shallow hypothermia, increase the conservation of endogenous fuel stores during fasting.",

     "abstract": "Brain mass has been suggested to determine a mammal's energy expenditure. This potential dependence is examined in 48 species of bats. A correlation between characters may be direct or derived from shared correlations with intervening factors without a direct interaction. Basal rate of metabolism in these bats increases with brain mass: large brains are more expensive than small brains, and both brain mass and basal rate increase with body mass. Basal rate and brain mass also correlate with food habits in bats. Mass-independent basal rate weakly correlates with mass-independent brain mass, the correlation only accounting for 12% of the variation in basal rate, which disappears when the combined effects of body mass and food habits are deleted. The correlation between basal rate and brain mass seen in this and other studies usually accounts for <\u00a010% of the variation in basal rate and often <\u00a04%, even when statistically significant, a minimalist explanation for the level the basal rate. This correlation probably reflects the intermediacy of secondary factors, as occurred with food habits in bats.

     "abstract": "Nutritional deprivation or desiccation can influence thermal tolerance by impacting the insects' ability to evaporatively cool, maintain cell membrane integrity and conduct protective or repair processes. Recovery from chilling is also linked to the re-establishment of iono- and osmo-regulatory homeostasis. Here, using Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata, Diptera: Tephritidae), we manipulated water and nutrient availability to test the mechanistic expectation that changes in whole organism lipid and water content can elicit variation in cold or heat tolerance (scored as chill coma recovery time and heat knockdown time). We measured body condition (body water and lipid content) as well as heat shock protein 70 gene (hsp70) and protein (HSP70) levels. A significant reduction in body water content with water restriction did not translate into differences in chill coma recovery. When nutrient restriction was coupled with water deprivation, this resulted in a significant reduction (\u2212\u00a054%) of heat knockdown time in females but male flies were unaffected. There was no evidence for an hsp70 or HSP70 response under any of the stress treatments and therefore no correlation with heat or cold tolerance. Heat hardening decreased all hsp levels. Therefore, although body water and total body lipid content differed between the treatment groups, the contribution of these factors to thermal tolerance was inconsistent with mechanistic expectations in heat knockdown time and insignificant for chill coma recovery. These results therefore highlight that the effects of resource restriction on thermal limits in insects are mechanistically more complex than previous models of stress resistance have suggested.",

     "abstract": "To evaluate potential involvement of clathrin in endocytosis of vitellogenin (Vtg) by teleost oocytes, cDNAs encoding clathrin heavy chain (cltc) were cloned from ovaries of cutthroat trout. Quantitative PCR revealed three types of cltc (cltc-a1, cltc-a2, cltc-b) to be expressed in 10 different tissues including the ovary. The cltc-a1 alone exhibited a significant decrease in ovarian expression during vitellogenesis; this was correlated with a corresponding decrease in transcripts encoding the major Vtg receptor (Vtgr). No development-related changes in ovarian cltc-a2 or cltc-b transcript levels were observed. In situ hybridization revealed a strong ctlc signal in pre-vitellogenic oocytes, but not in vitellogenic oocytes. Western blotting using a rabbit antiserum (a-Cltc) raised against a recombinant Cltc preparation detected a polypeptide band with an apparent mass of ~\u00a0170\u00a0kDa in vitellogenic ovary extracts. Immunohistochemistry using a-Cltc revealed Cltc to be uniformly distributed throughout the ooplasm of perinucleolus stage oocytes, translocated to the periphery of lipid droplet stage oocytes, and localized to the oolemma during vitellogenesis. These patterns of cltc/Cltc distribution and abundance during oogenesis, which are identical to those previously reported for vtgr/Vtgr in this species, constitute the first empirical evidence that cltc-a1/Cltc-a1 is involved in Vtg endocytosis via the Vtgr in teleost fish.",

     "abstract": "The metabolic thermogenesis plays important roles in thermoregulation, and it may be also involved in body fat regulation. The thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is largely affected by ambient temperature, but it is unclear if the roles in body fat regulation are dependent on the temperature. In the present study, uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1)-based BAT thermogenesis, energy budget and body fat content were examined in the striped hamsters fed high fat diet (HF) at cold (5\u00a0\u00b0C) and warm (30\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures. The effect of 2, 4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a chemical uncoupler, on body fat was also examined. The striped hamsters showed a notable increase in body fat following the HF feeding at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. The increased body fat was markedly elevated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, but was significantly attenuated at 5\u00a0\u00b0C compared to that at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. The hamsters significantly increased energy intake at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, but consumed less food at 30\u00a0\u00b0C relative to those at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. Metabolic thermogenesis, indicated by basal metabolic rate, UCP1 expression and/or serum triiodothyronine levels, significantly increased at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, but decreased at 30\u00a0\u00b0C compared to that at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. A significant decrease in body fat content was observed in DNP-treated hamsters relative to the controls. These findings suggest that the roles of metabolic thermogenesis in body fat regulation largely depend on ambient temperature. The cold-induced enhancement of BAT thermogenesis may contribute the decreased body fat, resulting in a lean mass. Instead, the attenuation of BAT thermogenesis at the warm may result in notable obesity.",

     "abstract": "Sex is determined by temperature during embryogenesis in snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina. Previous studies in this species show that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induces ovarian development at temperatures that normally produce males or mixed sex ratios. The feminizing effect of DHT is associated with increased expression of FoxL2, suggesting that androgens regulate transcription of FoxL2. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the proximal promoter (1.6\u00a0kb) and coding sequence for snapping turtle FoxL2 (tFoxL2) in frame with mCherry to produce a fluorescent reporter. The tFoxL2-mCherry fusion plasmid or mCherry control plasmid were stably transfected into mouse KK1 granulosa cells. These cells were then treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100\u00a0nM DHT to assess androgen effects on tFoxL2-mCherry expression. In contrast to the main hypothesis, DHT did not alter expression of the tFoxL2-mCherry reporter. However, normal serum increased expression of tFoxL2-mCherry when compared to charcoal-stripped serum, indicating that the cloned region of tFoxL2 contains cis regulatory elements. We also used the tFoxL2-mCherry plasmid as an expression vector to test the hypothesis that DHT and tFoxL2 interact to regulate expression of endogenous genes in granulosa cells. While tFoxL2-mCherry and DHT had independent effects on mouse FoxL2, FshR, GnRHR, and StAR expression, tFoxL2-mCherry potentiated low concentration DHT effects on mouse aromatase expression. Further studies will be required to determine whether synergistic regulation of aromatase by DHT and FoxL2 also occurs in turtle gonads during the sex-determining period, which would explain the feminizing effect of DHT in this species.",

Juvenile qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis) were reared individually with two levels of food resources (satiation or limited) with either continuous feeding (CF) or starvation-refeeding (SR). In the CF experiment, SMR increased when individuals were fed either the satiation or limited diets, but no difference was found in average specific growth rate somatic growth (SGR) between the two food availabilities. The relationship between flexibility in SMR and SGR, feeding efficiency (FE) and food intake (FI) was positive in the satiation group but not in the limited food group. In the SR experiment, the initial SMR of individuals was negatively correlated with the SGR during starvation. During refeeding, the starved individuals increased both body mass and SMR under both food availabilities. Individuals with a greater increase in SMR were fed more and also had greater SGR and FE under the satiation diet, but these results were not observed under the limited diet. The average FE under the limited diet was greater than that under the satiation diet, causing there to be no significant difference in final body mass between the diet treatments at the end of refeeding. Our study suggested that SMR flexibility can allow individuals to maximize their potential growth performance in an environment with changing food availability, and the benefits from greater flexibility in SMR could be offset by their maintenance metabolism under environmental stress.",

Apoptosis was measured by the TUNEL technique, the expression of FAS and FASL and the caspase-3 activity. A previous dose of 0.5\u00a0g\u00a0GLN/kg of b.w. was necessary to show its protector effect and a dose of 1\u00a0g/kg of b.w. could restore the intestinal Ca2+ absorption after MEN treatment. GLN alone did not modify the protein expression of calbindin D28k and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, but blocked the inhibitory effect of the quinone. GLN avoided changes in the intestinal redox state provoked by MEN such as a decrease in the GSH content, and increases in the superoxide anion and in the SOD and CAT activities. GLN abrogated apoptotic effects caused by MEN in intestinal mucosa, as indicated by the reduction of TUNEL (+) cells and the FAS/FASL/caspase-3 pathway.

However, when an aerial refuge was provided and dissolved oxygen was progressively decreased, crayfish emersed at a PO2 of 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0kPa, suggesting a relatively high tolerance to hypoxia. Closed-box respirometry delineated a Pcrit, the point at which crayfish transition from oxyregulating to oxyconforming, of 6.0\u00a0kPa. Simultaneous measurement of heart rate showed no changes across the PO2 range. In response to 6-h exposures to fixed dissolved oxygen levels (normoxia, 19.3\u00a0kPa; moderate hypoxia, 3.5\u00a0kPa; and severe hypoxia, 1.7\u00a0kPa), P. zealandicus showed a haemolymph PO2 that declined with the magnitude of hypoxia, and while plasma pH declined in severe hypoxia, there were no changes in plasma PCO2. Plasma glucose concentrations fell, and plasma lactate increased in both hypoxic groups. There were no changes in tissue glucose or lactate concentrations.

We used mass-flow respirometry to measure resting metabolic rate (RMR), evaporative water loss (EWL) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in two populations of a small (10\u201312\u00a0g) Afrotropical bird, the Cape White-eye (Zosterops virens), in summer and in winter. In total, 51 freshly wild-caught adult Cape White-eyes were measured overnight. Altitude was included as a source of variation in the best approximating models for body mass, whole-animal RMR, RER, whole-animal standard EWL and whole-animal basal EWL. RER was significantly lower in winter, suggesting a greater proportion of lipid oxidation at lower ambient temperatures (Ta). Cape White-eyes were 0.8\u00a0g heavier at the higher altitude site and 0.5\u00a0g heavier in winter, suggesting they may have increased their metabolic machinery to cope with cooler temperatures. EWL was generally significantly lower in winter than in summer, suggesting that birds may increase EWL with increasing Ta, as the need for evaporative cooling increases. Our results support the argument that the subtle and complex effects of altitude (and ambient temperature) should be taken into account in studies on avian metabolic rate.Of the numerous studies known to affect avian metabolic rate, altitude is one of the least studied. Although trends are not always clear, generally, at higher altitudes, avian metabolic rate increases.There were statistically significant seasonal and altitudinal differences in various physiological parameters of Cape White-eyes. These results highlight the importance of accounting for altitude in studies of avian metabolic rate.",

The present investigation evaluates the short- (hours) and long-term (days) time courses of responses of two palaemonid shrimps from separate yet overlapping osmotic niches, Palaemon northropi (marine) and Macrobrachium acanthurus (diadromous, fresh water), to differential salinity challenges at distinct levels of structural organization: (i) transcriptional, analyzing quantitative expression of gill mRNAs that encode for subunits of the Na+/K+-ATPase and V(H+)-ATPase ion transporters; (ii) translational, examining the kinetic behavior of gill Na+/K+-ATPase specific activity; and (iii) systemic, accompanying consequent adjustment of hemolymph osmolality. Palaemon northropi is an excellent hyper-hypo-osmoregulator in dilute and concentrated seawater, respectively. Macrobrachium acanthurus is a strong hyper-regulator in fresh water and hypo-regulates hemolymph osmolality and particularly [Cl\u2212] in brackish water. Hemolymph hyper-regulation in fresh water (Macrobrachium acanthurus) and dilute seawater (Palaemon northropi) is underlain by augmented expression of both the gill Na+/K+-ATPase and V(H+)-ATPase. In contrast, in neither species is hypo-regulation sustained by changes in Na+/K+-ATPase mRNA expression levels, but rather by regulating enzyme specific activity. The integrated time course of Na+/K+- and V(H+)-ATPase expression and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the gills of these palaemonid shrimps during acclimation to different salinities reveals versatility in their levels of regulation, and in the roles of these ion transporting pumps in sustaining processes of hyper- and hypo-osmotic and chloride regulation.",

     "abstract": "Digestive physiology is considered to be under circadian control, but there is little evidence in teleost fish. The present study explored the rhythmicity and plasticity to feeding schedules of enzymatic digestion in a candidate aquaculture fish, the permit (Trachinotus falcatus). The first experiment identified the rhythms of digestive factors throughout the light-dark (LD) cycle. Gastric luminal pH and pepsin activity showed significant daily variation albeit not rhythmic. These dynamic changes were likewise observed in several digestive enzymes, in which the activities of intestinal protease, chymotrypsin and lipase exhibited significant daily rhythms. In the second experiment, the existence of feed anticipatory activity in the digestive factors was investigated by subjecting the fish to either periodic or random feeding. Anticipatory gastric acidification prior to feeding was identified in periodically fed fish. However, pepsin activity did not exhibit such anticipation but a substantial postprandial increase was observed. Intestinal protease, leucine aminopeptidase and lipase anticipated periodic mealtime with elevated enzymatic activities. Plasma melatonin and cortisol demonstrated robust daily rhythms but feeding time manipulations revealed no significant impact. Plasma ghrelin level remained constant during the LD cycle and appeared to be unaffected by differing feeding regimes as well. Taken together, the digestive factors of permit were highly dynamic during the LD cycle. Periodic feeding entrained digestive physiology and mediated anticipatory gastric acidification and intestinal enzymatic activities. This knowledge will be essential in developing feeding protocols and husbandry-related welfare strategies that will further advance this candidate finfish as an aquaculture species.",

     "abstract": "The autonomic stress response, often referred to as the \u2018fight-or-flight\u2019 response, is a highly conserved physiological reaction to stress in vertebrates that occurs via a decrease in parasympathetic (PNS) activity, which promotes self-maintenance \u2018rest and digest\u2019 processes, and an increase in sympathetic (SNS) activity, which prepares an animal for danger (\u2018fight-or-flight\u2019). Though the PNS and SNS both innervate most organs, they often control different tissues and functions within those organs (though the pacemaker of the heart is controlled by both). Moreover the PNS and SNS are regulated independently. Yet until now, most studies of autonomic stress responses in non-model species focused only on the SNS response. We used external electrocardiogram loggers to measure heart rate and heart rate variability indexes that reflect PNS and SNS activity in a seabird, the Streaked Shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas), during the stress of handling, and during recovery in the nest burrow or during restraint in a cloth bag. We show for the first time in a free-living animal that the autonomic stress response is mediated primarily by a rapid decrease in PNS activity: handling stress induced a large and long-lasting depression of PNS \u2018rest-and-digest\u2019 activity that required two hours to recover. We also found evidence for a substantially smaller and shorter-lasting SNS \u2018fight-or-flight\u2019 response. Confinement in a cloth bag was less stressful for birds than handling, but more stressful than recovering in nest burrows. We show that quantifying autonomic activity from heart rate variability is effective for non-invasively studying stress physiology in free-living animals.",

     "abstract": "The melanocortin system is a complex neuroendocrine signaling mechanism involved in numerous physiological processes in vertebrates, including pigmentation, steroidogenesis and metabolic control. This review focuses at one of its most fascinating function in fish, its regulatory role in the control of pigmentation, in which the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r), its agonist \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone (\u03b1-Msh), and the endogenous antagonist agouti signaling protein (Asip1) are the main players. Functional control of Mc1r, which is highly expressed in fish skin and whose activation stimulates melanin production and melanosome dispersion in fish melanophores, is considered a key mechanism for vertebrate pigment phenotypes. The \u03b1-Msh peptide, the most documented Mc1r agonist involved in pigmentation, is produced in the pituitary gland, activating melanin synthesis by binding to Mc1r in fish melanophores. Finally, Asip1 is the putative factor for establishing the evolutionarily conserved dorso-ventral pigment pattern found across vertebrates. However, we are just starting to understand how other melanocortin system components are acting in this complex regulatory network.",

However, the subtype of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) involved in regulating these genes in skeletal muscle is not yet well defined. In this study, the effects of intraperitoneal injection of adrenaline and three \u03b21\u20133-AR selective agonists on chick skeletal muscle metabolism were examined, to evaluate the functions of \u03b2-AR subtypes. Adrenaline decreased atrogin-1/MAFbx mRNA levels accompanied by an increase in PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels. However, among the three selective agonists, only the \u03b21-AR agonist, dobutamine, increased PGC-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels, while the \u03b22-AR agonist, clenbuterol, suppressed atrogin-1/MAFbx mRNA levels.

     "abstract": "Urea is an essential osmolyte for marine cartilaginous fishes. Adult elasmobranchs and holocephalans are known to actively produce urea in the liver, muscle and other extrahepatic organs; however, osmoregulatory mechanisms in the developing cartilaginous fish embryo with an undeveloped urea-producing organ are poorly understood. We recently described the contribution of extraembryonic yolk sac membranes (YSM) to embryonic urea synthesis during the early developmental period of the oviparous holocephalan elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii). In the present study, to test whether urea production in the YSM is a general phenomenon among oviparous Chondrichthyes, we investigated gene expression and activities of ornithine urea cycle (OUC) enzymes together with urea concentrations in embryos of the elasmobranch cloudy catshark (Scyliorhinus torazame). The intracapsular fluid, in which the catshark embryo develops, had a similar osmolality to seawater, and embryos maintained a high concentration of urea at levels similar to that of adult plasma throughout development. Relative mRNA expressions and activities of catshark OUC enzymes were significantly higher in YSM than in embryos until stage 32. Concomitant with the development of the embryonic liver, the expression levels and activities of OUC enzymes were markedly increased in the embryo from stage 33, while those of the YSM decreased from stage 32. The present study provides further evidence that the YSM contributes to embryonic urea homeostasis until the liver and other extrahepatic organs become fully functional, and that urea-producing tissue shifts from the YSM to the embryonic liver in the late developmental period of oviparous marine cartilaginous fishes.",

Understanding the mechanisms controlling the production of ribosomal building blocks during artificially induced oocyte maturation could be particularly interesting. Transcription levels of ribosomal biogenesis associated genes could be used as markers to monitor oogenesis. Eels from the Albufera Lagoon were injected with carp pituitary extract for 15\u00a0weeks and ovaries in previtellogenic (PV) stage (non-injected), in early-, mid-, late-vitellogenesis (EV, MV, LV), as well as in migratory nucleus stage (MN) were analysed. 5S rRNA and related genes were highly transcribed in ovaries with PV oocytes. As oocytes developed, transcriptional levels of genes related to 5S rRNA production (gtf3a), accumulation (gtf3a, 42sp43) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (rpl5, rpl11) and the 5S/18S rRNA index decreased (PV\u00a0>\u00a0EV\u00a0>\u00a0MV\u00a0>\u00a0LV\u00a0>\u00a0MN). On the contrary, 18S rRNA was at its highest at MN stage while ubtf1 in charge of activating RNA-polymerase I and synthesising 18S rRNA behaved as 5S related genes. Individuals that did not respond (NR) to the treatment showed 5S/18S index values similar to PV females, while studied genes showed EV/LV-like transcription levels. Therefore, NR females fail to express the largest rRNAs, which could thus be taken as markers of successful vitellogenesis progression. In conclusion, we have proved that the transcriptional dynamics of ribosomal genes provides useful tools to characterize induced ovarian development in European eels. In the future, such markers should be studied as putative indicators of response to hormonal treatments and of the quality of obtained eel oocytes.",

To date, very few measurements of glucose recycling have been reported in fish. Thus, to determine the extent of glucose recycling following a glycemic challenge, juvenile seabass were given an intraperitoneal glucose load (2\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) enriched with [U-13C]glucose. 13C NMR analysis of plasma glucose 13C-isotopomers was used to determine the fractional contributions of glucose derived directly from the load versus that from glucose recycling at 48\u00a0h after the load. Both fed and 21-day fasted fish (20 per condition) were studied. In fasted fish, 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% of plasma glucose was directly derived from the load while 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% was derived from glucose recycling. In fed fish, the load accounted for 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% of plasma glucose levels while glucose recycling contributed 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%. 13C NMR analysis of plasma lactate revealed 13C-isotopomers corresponding to the expected C3-intermediates of peripheral [U-13C]glucose catabolism indicating that circulating lactate was a key intermediate in glucose carbon recycling under these conditions. In conclusion, glucose recycling was shown to contribute a significant portion of plasma glucose levels in both fed and fasted seabass 48\u00a0h after an intraperitoneal glucose challenge and circulating lactate was shown to be an intermediate of this pathway.",

Here we investigated, in vitro, the uncoupling effect of increasing doses of fatty acids in pectoralis muscle intermyofibrillar mitochondria isolated, either from terrestrial never-immersed or experimentally cold water immersed pre-fledging king penguins or from sea-acclimatized fledged penguins. Mitochondria exhibited much greater palmitate-induced uncoupling respiration and higher maximal oxidative capacity after acclimatization to marine life. Such effects were not reproduced experimentally after repeated immersions in cold water, suggesting that the plasticity of mitochondrial characteristics may not be primarily driven by cold exposure per se but by other aspects of sea acclimatization.",

Isc was reduced equally in the epithelium exposed to 1.6\u00a0mg O2/L on both sides and when the apical side was oxygenated and the basolateral side solely exposed to hypoxia.

Isc inhibition under hypoxia and reduced 86Rb+ (K+) fluxes across apically located K+ channels were caused preferentially by reversible inhibition of basolaterally located and ouabain sensitive Na+,K+-ATPase mediated electrogenic transport. Reversible inhibition of Isc is discussed as decline in active transport energy supply down regulating metabolic processes and saving energy during oxygen deprivation.In response to a 4\u00a0day exposure of Carcinus to 2.0\u00a0mg O2/L, hemolymph Na+ and Cl\u2212 concentration decreased, i.e. hyperosmoregulation was weakened.

Embryonic sea turtles have been studied to understand the maturation of metabolic function, but these studies have not addressed the cardiovascular system. Although prior studies have been pivotal in characterizing development, and factors that influence it, the development of cardiovascular function, which supplies metabolic function, is unknown in sea turtles. During our investigation we focused on quantifying how cardiovascular morphological and functional parameters change, to provide basic knowledge of development in the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Embryonic mass, as well as mass of the heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and brain increased during turtle embryo development. Although heart rate was constant during this developmental period, arterial pressure approximately doubled. Further, while embryonic olive ridley sea turtles lacked cholinergic tone on heart rate, there was a pronounced beta adrenergic tone on heart rate that decreased in strength at 90% of incubation. This beta adrenergic tone may be partially originating from the sympathetic nervous system at 90% of incubation, with the majority originating from circulating catecholamines. Data indicates that olive ridley sea turtles share traits of embryonic functional cardiovascular maturation with the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) but not the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina).",

     "abstract": "The nucleotide sequence of a sardine preprocalcitonin precursor has been determined from their ultimobranchial glands in the present study. From our analysis of this sequence, we found that sardine procalcitonin was composed of procalcitonin amino-terminal cleavage peptide (N-proCT) (53 amino acids), CT (32 amino acids), and procalcitonin carboxyl-terminal cleavage peptide (C-proCT) (18 amino acids). As compared with C-proCT, N-proCT has been highly conserved among teleosts, reptiles, and birds, which suggests that N-proCT has some bioactivities. Therefore, both sardine N-proCT and sardine CT were synthesized, and their bioactivities for osteoblasts and osteoclasts were examined using our assay system with goldfish scales that consisted of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. As a result, sardine N-proCT (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) activated osteoblastic marker enzyme activity, while sardine CT did not change. On the other hand, sardine CT (10\u2212\u00a09 to 10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) suppressed osteoclastic marker enzyme activity, although sardine N-proCT did not influence enzyme activity. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of osteoblastic markers such as type 1 collagen and osteocalcin were also promoted by sardine N-proCT (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) treatment; however, sardine CT did not influence their expressions. The osteoblastic effects of N-proCT lack agreement. In the present study, we can evaluate exactly the action for osteoblasts because our scale assay system is very sensitive and it is a co-culture system for osteoblasts and osteoclasts with calcified bone matrix. Both CT and N-proCT seem to influence osteoblasts and osteoclasts and promote bone formation by different actions in teleosts.",

     "abstract": "Changes in free amino acids (FAA) were investigated in the potentially important live feed and neritic copepod species Acartia tonsa during naupliar development. Total content of FAA in A. tonsa nauplii was around 17% of dry weight at first development stage, and declined to 6% for later stages. Relative to body-volume and biomass, the FAA content indicated possible volume-dependent changes. However, changes in FAA with osmolytic activity could not account for this decline in FAA content, but suggests that the decline reflected degradation of residual FAAs from the embryonic stage. Glutamic acid revealed the largest change in relative abundance during naupliar development and declined from 29.0% at first nauplius stage to 7.1% at later stages. The high FAA pool in early naupliar stages may be necessary for naupliar development due to an absence of feeding at first development stages. The high FAA content in early nauplii indicates that A. tonsa is a valuable source for nutritional energy for first-feeding fish larvae and should be further exploited for aquaculture purposes. Enhancements to FAA abundances in nauplii through manipulation of maternal diets could be of future interest, as copepod nauplii can contain a substantial pool of FAAs at first development stage.",

However, little is known about how animals adjust the relationships between immunity and body condition, and between innate and acquired immunity to optimize survival over winter and reproductive success during the breeding stage. Here, we measured indices of body condition (size-corrected mass [SCM], and hematocrit [Hct]), constitutive innate immunity (plasma total complement hemolysis activity [CH50]) and acquired immunity (plasma immunoglobulin A [IgA]), plus heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios, in male Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) during the wintering and the breeding stages. We found that birds during the wintering stage had higher IgA levels than those from the breeding stage. Two indices of body condition were both negatively correlated with plasma CH50 activities, and positively with IgA levels in wintering birds, but this was not the case in the breeding birds. However, there was no correlation between CH50 activities and IgA levels in both stages. These results suggest that the relationships between body condition and immunity can vary across life-history stage, and there are no correlations between innate and acquired immunity independent of life-history stage, in male Eurasian tree sparrows. Therefore, body condition indices predict immunological state, especially during the non-breeding stage, which can be useful indicators of individual immunocompetences for understanding the variations in innate and acquired immunity in free-living animals.",

     "abstract": "Increasing urbanization is responsible for road-related pollutants and causes an unprecedented increase in light and noise pollution, with potential detrimental effects for individual animals, communities and ecosystems. These stressors rarely act in isolation but studies dissecting the effects of these multiple stressors are lacking. Moreover, studies on urban stressors have mainly focused on adults, while exposure in early-life may be detrimental but is largely ignored. To fill this important knowledge gap, we studied if artificial light at night, anthropogenic noise and road-related pollution (using distance from roads as a proxy) explain variation in oxidative status in great tit nestlings (Parus major) in an urban population. Artificial light at night, anthropogenic noise and distance from roads were not associated with variation of the nine studied metrics of oxidative status (superoxide dismutase-SOD-, glutathione peroxidase-GPX, catalase-CAT-, non-enzymatic total antioxidant capacity-TAC-, reduced glutathione-GSH-, oxidized glutathione-GSSG-, ratio GSH/GSSG, protein carbonyls and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances-TBARS). Interestingly, for all oxidative status metrics, we found that there was more variation in oxidative status among individuals of the same nest compared to between different nests. We also showed an increase in protein carbonyls and a decrease of the ratio GSH/GSSG as the day advanced, and an increase of GPX when weather conditions deteriorated. Our study suggests that anthropogenic noise, artificial light at night and road-related pollution are not the most important sources of variation in oxidative status in great tit nestlings. It also highlights the importance of considering bleeding time and weather conditions in studies with free-living animals.",

It is a composite of mechanical and chemical digestion, nutrient transport and protein synthesis. How these individual events contribute to the overall SDA has not been worked out fully for any organism. The mechanical events associated with the SDA were investigated in Dungeness crabs, Cancer magister. Following consumption of a meal, oxygen consumption (MO2) remained elevated for several hours. When the crabs were presented with fish scent there was a 2 fold increase in MO2, which rapidly decreased once the stimulus was removed. Crabs were then offered fish in a perforated tube. There was a rapid increase in MO2 associated with handling which returned to pre-treatment levels within an hour of removal of the tube. Finally the crabs were fed a piece of foam that had been soaked in fish water to determine the costs of mechanical digestion. The mechanical breakdown of the meal accounted for 29.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3% of the overall SDA. Since food handling produced a large increase in MO2, it was reinvestigated using crabs that had one or both claws removed. Although there were no statistically significant differences as a function of claw removal there was a consistent trend in the data. The maximum MO2, scope, duration and SDA increased from animals with 0 claws through 1 claw to 2 claws. The results showed that the mechanical portion of the SDA can account for a significant portion of the overall budget in decapod crustaceans.",

We demonstrated that central injection of amylin into chicks affected feeding and related behaviors via the hypothalamus and brainstem, although the molecular mechanisms remained elusive. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying anorexigenic effects of amylin in 7 day-old Japanese quail. Food but not water intake was reduced after intracerebroventricular amylin injection, and the behavior analysis indicated that this was associated with decreased food pecks and preening. Whole hypothalamus and hypothalamic nuclei including the arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) and lateral hypothalamic area (LH) were extracted from quail at 1\u00a0h post-injection for total RNA isolation. Real time PCR was performed to quantify mRNA abundance of amylin receptors, appetite-associated neuropeptides and monoamine-synthesis-related enzymes. Central amylin injection increased the mRNA abundance of calcitonin receptor (CALCR), receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the hypothalamus and individual hypothalamic nuclei. Relative quantities of CALCR and POMC mRNA were greater in the ARC of the amylin- than vehicle-treated group. Thus, amylin-mediated effects on food intake may involve POMC, monoamine synthesis, and amylin receptor 1 (a complex of CALCR and RAMP1) in the ARC. Together, these data provide novel insights on the hypothalamic-specific molecular mechanisms of amylin-induced food intake.",

     "abstract": "The estuarine crab Hemigrapsus crenulatus is a key benthic species of estuarine and intertidal ecosystems of the South Pacific, habitats that experience wide fluctuations in salinity. The physiological strategies that allow this crab to thrive under variable salinities, and how they change during the benthic stages of their life cycle, were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion and the regulatory capacity of Na+ through the normal range of environmental salinities (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) were evaluated in three size classes, ranging from juveniles to adults. In all sizes, the oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion and regulatory capacity of Na+ decreased as salinity increased, with the highest values at 5 and the lowest values at 30 salinity. Bigger crabs showed a higher capacity to regulate Na+, as well as higher respiration and excretion rates compared to smaller crabs, suggesting that they are better equipped to exploit areas of the estuary with low salinity. Regardless of its size, H. crenulatus is a strong hyper regulator in diluted media (i.e. 5\u201320) while a conformer at salinities higher than 20. The regulatory capacity of Na+ was positively related with oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates. These relationships between sodium regulation, respiration and excretion are interpreted as adaptive physiological mechanisms that allow H. crenulatus to maintain the osmotic and bioenergetic balance over a wide range of environmental salinities.",

     "abstract": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key neuropeptide regulating reproduction in humans and other vertebrates. Recently, GnRH-like cDNAs and peptides were reported in marine mollusks, implying that GnRH-mediated reproduction is an ancient neuroendocrine system that arose prior to the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes. Here, we evaluated the reproductive control system mediated by GnRH in the Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai. We cloned a prepro-GnRH cDNA (Hdh-GnRH) from the pleural-pedal ganglion (PPG) in H. discus hannai, and analyzed its spatiotemporal gene expression pattern. The open reading frame of Hdh-GnRH encodes a protein of 101 amino acids, consisting of a signal peptide, a GnRH dodecapeptide, a cleavage site, and a GnRH-associated peptide. This structure and sequence are highly similar to GnRH-like peptides reported for mollusks and other invertebrates. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that Hdh-GnRH mRNA was more strongly expressed in the ganglions (PPG and cerebral ganglion [CG]) than in other tissues (gonads, gills, intestine, hemocytes, muscle, and mantle) in both sexes. In females, the expression levels of Hdh-GnRH mRNA in the PPG and branchial ganglion (BG) were significantly higher at the ripe and partial spent stages than at the early and late active stages. In males, Hdh-GnRH mRNA levels in the BG showed a significant increase in the partial spent stage. Unexpectedly, Hdh-GnRH levels in the CG were not significantly different among the examined stages in both sexes. These results suggest that Hdh-GnRH mRNA expression profiles in the BG and possibly the PPG are tightly correlated with abalone reproductive activities.",

Metabolic fuel consumption is often estimated using the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), which has lipid and carbohydrate boundaries, but does not differentiate between protein and mixed fuel catabolism at intermediate values. Because lipids have relatively low \u03b413C values, measurements of stable carbon isotopes in breath may help distinguish between catabolism of protein and mixed fuel that includes lipid. We measured breath \u03b413C and RER concurrently in arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) during steady-state torpor at ambient temperatures from \u2212\u00a02 to \u2212\u00a026\u00a0\u00b0C. As predicted, we found a correlation between RER and breath \u03b413C values; however, the range of RER in this study did not reach intermediate levels to allow further resolution of metabolic substrate use with the addition of breath \u03b413C measurements. These data suggest that breath \u03b413C values are 1.1\u2030 lower than lipid tissue during pure lipid metabolism. From RER, we determined that arctic ground squirrels rely on nonlipid fuel sources for a significant portion of energy during torpor (up to 37%). The shift toward nonlipid fuel sources may be influenced by adiposity of the animals in addition to thermal challenge.",

Long-distance movements are limited, leading to genetic differentiation between inland and coastal populations.

Alligator gar from inland and coastal populations were reared in a similar environment and exposed to temperature (10, 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and salinity (0, 20\u00a0ppt) extremes to determine whether iono- and osmoregulatory ability differed between populations. There were few differences in osmoregulatory ability between populations, with similar gill, blood and gastrointestinal tract osmoregulatory parameters. Blood plasma osmolality, ion concentrations, intestinal pH and bicarbonate base concentrations, intestinal fluid osmolality, ion concentrations and gill Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity were similar between populations. Notably, gar from both populations did not osmoregulate well at low temperature and high salinity, with elevated plasma osmolality and ion concentrations, low gill NKA, and little evidence of gastrointestinal tract contribution to ionic and base regulation based on a lack of intestinal fluid and low base content. Therefore, the hypothesis that coastal gar would have improved osmotic regulatory ability in saline environments as compared to inland alligator gar was not supported, suggesting physiological capacity may be retained in primitive species possibly due to its importance to their persistence through time.",

Oxygen consumption, cortisol release, group dispersion and group swimming activity were measured before, during and after the challenge. Sensitivity and resilience for each measure were extracted from temporal responses and analyzed using multivariate statistics. The two fish lines displayed significant differences in their cortisol response, translating differences in the stress axis sensitivity to the stressor.

     "abstract": "The activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the most important physiological processes in coping with any deviation in an organism's homeostasis. This activation and the secretion of glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone, allow organisms to cope with perturbations and return to optimal physiological functioning as quickly as possible. In this study, we examined the HPA axis activation in common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) as a response to a natural toxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX). This neurotoxin is found in high levels in the Rough-skinned Newt (Taricha granulosa), which is a prey item for these snakes. To consume this toxic prey, these snakes have evolved variable resistance. We hypothesized that the more resistant individuals would show a lower HPA axis response than less resistant individuals, as measured by corticosterone (CORT) and bactericidal ability, which is a functional downstream measurement of CORT's activity. We determined \u201cresistance level\u201d for tetrodotoxin from each individual snake by determining the dose which reduced race speed by 50%. Individuals were injected them with an increasing amount of tetrodotoxin (10, 25, and 50 MAMUs) to determine this value. Thirty minutes after every injection, we gathered blood samples from each snake. Our results show that, while there were no significant differences among individual CORT levels in a dose-dependent manner, female snakes did have a larger stress response when compared to both males and juveniles. Different life-histories could explain why females were able to mount a higher HPA axis response. However, TTX had no downstream effects on bactericidal ability, although juveniles had consistently lower values than adults. Our research shows a possible dichotomy between how each sex manages tetrodotoxin and gives way for a more comprehensive analysis of tetrodotoxin in an ecological context.",

No marked behavioral or physiological adjustments were observed in response to hypoxia (e.g., hemoglobin, feeding rate, movement frequency, gene expression did not change to a significant degree), possibly indicating a high tolerance level in this species.

     "abstract": "Some insect taxa from polar or temperate habitats have shown cross-tolerance for multiple stressors but tropical insect taxa have received less attention. Accordingly, we considered adult flies of a tropical drosophilid-Zaprionus indianus for testing direct as well as cross-tolerance effects of rapid heat hardening (HH), desiccation acclimation (DA) and starvation acclimation (SA) after rearing under warmer and drier season specific simulated conditions. We observed significant direct acclimation effects of HH, DA and SA; and four cases of cross-tolerance effects but no cross-tolerance between desiccation and starvation. Cross-tolerance due to heat hardening on desiccation showed 20% higher effect than its reciprocal effect. There is greater reduction of water loss in heat hardened flies (due to increase in amount of cuticular lipids) as compared with desiccation acclimated flies. However, cross-tolerance effect of SA on heat knockdown was two times higher than its reciprocal. Heat hardened and desiccation acclimated adult flies showed substantial increase in the level of trehalose and proline while body lipids increased due to heat hardening or starvation acclimation. However, maximum increase in energy metabolites was stressor specific i.e. trehalose due to DA; proline due to HH and total body lipids due to SA. Rapid changes in energy metabolites due to heat hardening seem compensatory for possible depletion of trehalose and proline due to desiccation stress; and body lipids due to starvation stress. Thus, observed cross-tolerance effects in Z. indianus represent physiological changes to cope with multiple stressors related to warmer and drier subtropical habitats.",

     "abstract": "Sexual selection has been widely explored from numerous perspectives, including behavior, ecology, and to a lesser extent, energetics. Hormones, and specifically androgens such as testosterone, are known to trigger sexual behaviors. Their effects are therefore of interest during the breeding period. Our work investigates the effect of testosterone on the relationship between cellular bioenergetics and contractile properties of two skeletal muscles involved in sexual selection in tree frogs. Calling and locomotor abilities are considered evidence of good condition in Hyla males, and thus server as proxies for male quality and attractiveness. Therefore, how these behaviors are powered efficiently remains of both physiological and behavioral interest. Most previous research, however, has focused primarily on biomechanics, contractile properties or mitochondrial enzyme activities. Some have tried to establish a relationship between those parameters but to our knowledge, there is no study examining muscle fiber bioenergetics in Hyla arborea. Using chronic testosterone supplementation and through an integrative study combining fiber bioenergetics and contractile properties, we compared sexually dimorphic trunk muscles directly linked to chronic sound production to a hindlimb muscle (i.e. gastrocnemius) that is particularly adapted for explosive movement. As expected, trunk muscle bioenergetics were more affected by testosterone than gastrocnemius muscle. Our study also underlines contrasted energetic capacities between muscles, in line with contractile properties of these two different muscle phenotypes. The discrepancy of both substrate utilization and contractile properties is consistent with the specific role of each muscle and our results are elucidating another integrative example of a muscle force-endurance trade-off.",

     "abstract": "In vertebrates, aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT; EC 2.3.1.87) is a time-keeping enzyme in melatonin (Mel) biosynthesis. Uniquely in fish, there are several AANAT isozymes belonging to two AANAT subfamilies, AANAT1 and AANAT2, which are encoded by distinct genes. The different substrate preferences, kinetics and spatial expression patterns of isozymes indicate that they may have different functions. In the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), there are three genes encoding three AANAT isozymes. In this study, for the first time, the levels of aanat1a, aanat1b and aanat2 mRNAs are measured by absolute RT-qPCR in the brain, eye, skin, stomach, gut, heart and kidney collected at noon and midnight. Melatonin levels are analysed by HPLC with fluorescence detection in homogenates of the brain, eye, skin and kidney. The levels of aanats mRNAs differ significantly within and among organs. In the brain, eye, stomach and gut, there are day/night variations in aanats mRNAs levels. The highest levels of aanat1a and aanat1b mRNAs are in the eye. The extremely high expressions of these genes which are reflected in the highest Mel concentrations at this site at noon and midnight strongly suggest that the eye is an important source of the hormone in the three-spined sticklebacks. A very low level of aanat2 mRNA in all organs may suggest that AANAT1a and/or AANAT1b are principal isozymes in the three-spine sticklebacks. A presence of the isozymes of defined substrate preferences provides opportunity for control of acetylation of amines by modulation of individual aanat expression and permits the fine-tuning of indolethylamines and phenylethylamines metabolism to meet the particular needs of a given organ.",

     "abstract": "Carry-over effects in migratory birds are likely mediated by physiological processes that are activated in response to environmental variation. Such processes affect body condition and/or reproductive success, and can include corticosterone (CORT) because this hormone responds to environmental stressors and influences energy balance. Few studies have considered how CORT levels during non-breeding relate to a broader physiological profile during subsequent breeding, and fewer still have considered measures other than body condition. To explore CORT's potential role in carry-over effects, we investigated the relationship between CORT and foraging ecology of northern gannets (Morus bassanus) during the non-breeding period, and tested for associations between these factors and variation in a suite of physiological and biochemical metrics during subsequent breeding. Northern gannets are the largest seabird top predator in the North Atlantic and were among the hardest hit by the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. We used light-level geolocators to confirm winter origins of individuals in our study. No interrelationships were found among levels of CORT from feathers grown during non-breeding (CORTf) and variation in foraging ecology, measured by stable isotopes of carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b415N) from the same feathers. CORTf was correlated negatively with hematocrit and positively with triglyceride measured during subsequent incubation, and explained more variation in these variables than did body mass during incubation. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that energy management, measured using CORTf, during non-breeding carries over to influence physiological measures other than body condition. Gannets that previously wintered within the Gulf of Mexico in the years following the Deepwater Horizon oil blowout had higher levels of CORTf compared to birds that wintered along the Atlantic coast, suggesting an increased energetic cost associated with visiting the Gulf of Mexico. Our results indicate that CORT during non-breeding is associated with a broader physiological profile during subsequent breeding than previously reported in birds.",

CD treatment decreases the abundance of hair bundles (by 85%) while significantly impairing predation. The remaining hair bundles are \u2018CD-resistant.\u2019 Surprisingly, the morphology and F-actin content of resistant hair bundles are comparable to those of untreated controls. However, the resistant hair bundles fail to respond normally to the N-acetylated sugar, NANA, by elongating. Instead, they remain at resting length. Immediately after CD treatment, when only CD-resistant hair bundles are present, nematocyst discharge is normal into targets touched to tentacles in the absence of vibrations (i.e., baseline) but fails to increase normally in the presence of nearby vibrations at 56\u00a0Hz, a key frequency. After CD treatment, the abundance of hair bundles recovers to control levels within three hours. At 2\u00a0h after CD treatment, when CD-resistant and CD-sensitive hair bundles are both present, but a full-recovery is not yet complete, somewhat enhanced discharge of nematocysts occurs into targets touched to tentacles in the presence of nearby vibrations at 56\u00a0Hz (at least as compared to the response of CD-treated animals to contact with test probes in the absence of vibrations). Additionally, at 2\u00a0h after CD-treatment, prey capture recovers to normal. Thus, two populations of hair bundles may be present on tentacles of sea anemones: those that are CD-resistant and those that are CD-sensitive. The functions of these hair bundles may be distinct.",

However, AMPK\u03b12 expression in muscle, liver and brain all decreased significantly during the first 2\u00a0h, then returned to the basal value at 24\u00a0h. Unlikely, tissue AMPK\u03b12 expression of fish receiving saline solution increased significantly during the whole sampling period. Additionally, high-carbohydrate diet enhanced its expression in liver and muscle, but not that in brain.

Here, organic matrix was extracted from precipitates produced by Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) and the matrix proteins were fractionated by their charge using strong anion exchange chromatography. The precipitation regulatory abilities of the individual fractions were then analyzed using a recently developed in vitro calcification assay, and the protein constituents of each fraction were determined by mass spectrometry. The different fractions were found to have differing effects on both the rate of carbonate mineral production, as well as the morphology of the crystals that form.

In this way, a comparative study of resistance to evaporative water loss, rehydration rates and sensitivity of locomotor performance to variations on hydration level and temperature was performed for five species of Bufonidae toads (Rhinella granulosa, R. jimi, R. ornata, R. schneideri and R. icterica) inhabiting different Brazilian biomes. The hypotheses tested were that, when compared to species inhabiting mesic environments, species living at hot and dry areas would show: (1) greater resistance to evaporative water loss, (2) higher rates of water uptake, (3) lower sensitivity of locomotor performance to dehydration and (4) lower sensitivity of locomotor performance at higher temperatures and higher sensitivity of locomotor performance at lower temperatures. This comparative analysis showed relations between body mass and interspecific variation in rehydration rates and resistance to evaporative water loss in opposite directions. These results might represent a functional compensation associated with relatively lower absorption areas in larger toads and higher evaporative areas in smaller ones. Moreover, species from the semi-arid Caatinga showed locomotor performance less sensitive to dehydration but highly affected by lower temperatures, as well greater resistance to evaporative water loss, when compared to the other species from the mesic Atlantic Forest and the savannah-like area called Cerrado. These results suggest adaptation patterns to environmental conditions.",

This movement of water creates a challenge for the regulation of cell volume. The cells of freshwater decapods require a high regulatory capacity to deal with hyposmotic stresses, given the need to face dilution of the haemolymph during their moult cycles. This study investigated the variation in the expression of water channels (aquaporins) along the moult cycle of a freshwater palaemonid shrimp, focusing on their role in cell volume regulation. Moults in Palaemonetes argentinus have been investigated along three stages of its moult cycle: intermoult, late pre-moult and recent post-moult. For the evaluation of tissue volume regulation, the weight of isolatedmuscle, subjected to isosmotic and hyposmotic salines, was followed for 60\u00a0min. The expression of AQP during the different moult stages was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Muscle from the three moult stages in isosmotic conditions showed the same pattern of tissue volume regulation. When muscle from animals in pre-moult and intermoult were submitted to hyposmotic stress they swell, followed by volume regulation, while in post-moult the regulation is compromised. The difference in volume regulatory control between pre-moult and post-moult may be related to a possible regulation of water channels, as AQP expression was equal at these stages. This study presents novel findings for crustaceans in general, in the demonstration that AQP expression changes during the moult cycle of a decapod crustacean, together with the regulation of cell volume with the participation of AQPs.",

Among sex-related genes, cyp19a, encoding cytochrome P450 aromatase, exhibits significant sex-dimorphic expression pattern and plays an important role in fish gonadal differentiation and development. The present study investigated the expression levels and promoter methylation dynamics of cyp19a and its regulators (nr5a2 and nr0b1), and sex-steroid hormone levels during flounder gonadal differentiation under the treatments of high temperature and estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2). The results showed that levels of flounder cyp19a expression and estradiol-17\u03b2 were repressed by high temperature treatment during this period. The up-regulation of nr5a2 by E2 treatment may be related to the all-female formation, and up-regulation of nr0b1 by high temperature treatment may be associated with masculinization. Co-transfection assay indicated that nr5a2 and nr0b1 were antagonist regulators of cyp19a. Furthermore, cyp19a promoter exhibited significant demethylation phenomenon at early stage of ovarian differentiation. While, high temperature could repress the demethylation process, resulting in hypermethylation maintenance in cyp19a promoter. The hypermethylation promoter was able to suppress cyp19a expression by blocking the nr5a2-mediated transactivation activity in vitro. The DNA methylation of epigenetic modification in cyp19a promoter might be the vital way linking environmental factors and gonadal differentiation in flounder.",

     "abstract": "The regulation of energy in fish, like most vertebrates, is a complex process that involves a number of brain and peripheral hormones. These signals include anorexigenic (e.g. cholecystokinin (CCK) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)) as well as orexigenic (e.g. orexin and neuropeptide Y (NPY)) peptides. Platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, are freshwater viviparous fish for which little is known about the endocrine mechanisms regulating feeding. In order to elucidate the role of these peptides in the regulation of feeding of platyfish, we examined the effects of peripheral injections of CCK and orexin on feeding behavior and food intake. Injections of CCK decreased both food intake and searching behavior, while injections of orexin increased searching behavior but did not affect food consumption. In order to better characterize these peptides, we examined their mRNA tissue distribution and assessed the effects of a 10-day fast on their brain and intestine expressions in both males and females. CCK, CART, NPY and orexin all show widespread distributions in brain and several peripheral tissues, including intestine and gonads. Fasting induced decreases in both CCK and CART and an increase in orexin mRNA expressions in the brain and a decrease in CCK expression in the intestine, but did not affect either expressions of NPY. There were no significant sex-specific differences in either the behavioral responses to injections or the expression responses to fasting. The widespread distribution and the fasting-induced changes in expression of these peptides suggest that they might have several physiological roles in platyfish, including the regulation of feeding.",

Results showed that Px reduced night-time plasma melatonin levels. Gene expression analyses demonstrated a sensitivity of the Gnih system to Px in March, with a reduction in sbgnih in the mid-hindbrain, a region with bilateral connections to the pineal organ. In August, kiss2 levels increased in Px animals but not in controls. Significant differences in expression were observed for diencephalic sbgnih, sbgnihr, kissr3 and tegmental gnrh2 between seasons. Recordings of locomotor activity following surgery revealed a change from light-synchronised to free-running rhythmic behavior. Altogether, the Gnih and Kiss2 sensitivity to Px and seasonal differences observed for Gnih and its receptor, Gnrh2, and the receptor for Kiss2 (Kissr3), suggested they could be mediators involved in the relay between environment and seasonal reproduction.",

Lobster specific growth rate and specific feed consumption displayed a unimodal response with temperature, peaking at 21.5\u00a0\u00b0C. Lobster standard, routine and maximum metabolic rates, and aerobic scope all increased exponentially up to maximum non-lethal temperature. Optimum temperature for growth did not correspond to that for maximum aerobic scope suggesting that aerobic scope is not an effective predictor of the thermal optimum of spiny lobsters. Plateauing of specific feed consumption beyond 21.5\u00a0\u00b0C suggests that temperature dependent growth of lobsters is limited by capacity to ingest or digest sufficient food to meet increasing maintenance metabolic demands at high temperatures. The nutritional condition of lobsters was not influenced by temperature and feed conversion ratio was improved at lower temperatures. These findings add to a growing body of evidence questioning the generality of aerobic scope to describe the physiological thermal boundaries of aquatic ectotherms and suggest that feed intake plays a crucial role in regulating performance at thermal extremes.",

     "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis, through corticosteroid secretion, is an integral mechanism regulating internal homeostasis when vertebrates are faced with a stressor. However, continued HPI-axis stimulation can produce homeostatic overload, where corticosteroids are detrimental to organismal function. This overload condition may play an important role in mediating predator-prey interactions, because chronically/previously stressed animals may have higher rates of predator-induced mortality. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this observation are unknown. Using fish as models, we hypothesized that chronic stress would increase predation susceptibility owing to a poor physiological state (e.g. homeostatic overload) with corresponding sub-optimal changes in predator-avoidance behaviour. As cortisol is also required in low quantities to help regulate basic metabolic functions in fish, we expected that a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (GR; e.g. homeostatic failure) may produce similar effects. Schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus) were given intraperitoneal implants of cocoa butter impregnated with nothing (sham; 5\u00a0ml/kg body weight (BW)), cortisol (50\u00a0mg/kg BW) or the GR antagonist RU486 (100\u00a0mg/kg BW). At 24-h post-implantation, fish were tethered to the seafloor and observed for behavioural metrics associated with predation. Blood samples were collected from a subset of fish to assess the physiological consequences of the implants. Cortisol- and RU486-implanted fish both had significantly higher plasma cortisol concentrations than sham fish, with blood glucose and plasma urea being elevated only in the former. Further, anti-predator behaviours and predation mortality did not differ significantly among treatments. Despite changes in physiological state, predation susceptibility was unaffected, a finding that may reflect the complex relationships linking the physiology and behaviour of an organism as well as potential tethering artefacts.",

Here, 15 ball pythons (Python regius) were induced and maintained with isoflurane for 60\u00a0min at one of three ventilation protocols (30, 125, or 250\u00a0ml\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 body mass) while an arterial catheter was inserted, and ventilation was then continued on 100% oxygen at the specified rate until voluntary extubation. Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured, and arterial blood samples collected at 60, 80, 180\u00a0min and 12 and 24\u00a0h after intubation. In all three groups, there was evidence of a metabolic acidosis, and snakes maintained at 30\u00a0ml\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 experienced an additional respiratory acidosis, while the two other ventilation protocols resulted in normal or low arterial PCO2.

The effect of hypoxia on MnHb expression was investigated, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting showed that MnHb was expressed almost exclusively in the gill. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a significant increase in expression after 6\u00a0h of hypoxia, and levels peaked at 24\u00a0h due to oxidative stress. Exposure of cultured prawns to the stress inducer H2O2 significantly up-regulated the expression of MnHb in a dose-dependent manner.

The complete Mnper cDNA measures 4283\u00a0bp in length with an open reading frame encoding 1292 amino acids, including functional domains such as PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS), cytoplasmic localization domain (CLD), TIM interaction site (TIS), and nuclear localization signal (NLS). The deduced Mntim protein comprises1540 amino acids with functional domains such as PER interaction site (PIS), NLS, and CLD. Tissue distribution analyses showed that the two genes were highly expressed in the eyestalk and brain in both males and females, as well as being expressed in the ovary. The expression profiles of Mnper and Mntim were determined in the eyestalk, brain, and ovary under simulated breeding season and non-breeding season conditions. The expression profiles of both Mnper and Mntim appeared to be unaffected in the eyestalk. However, the expression of both genes exhibited significant seasonal variations in the brain, and thus we assumed the brain to be their functional location. The expression profiles under different simulated seasons and the variations during different ovarian stages indicate that both genes might be involved with female reproduction. Especially the mRNA levels in the brain varied greatly during these stages indicating that the clock function in the brain is closely related to ovarian development and female reproduction. And the reproductive roles of clock genes need to be elucidated.",

     "abstract": "As a ubiquitous signaling molecule, nitric oxide (NO) exerts various important effects on the cardiovascular system and is involved in the regulation of vascular tone and myocardial metabolism in vertebrates. Lungfishes are closely related to tetrapods and provide an interesting possibility to understand the transition from water to land. Lungfishes are endowed with both systemic and pulmonary circulations, and their incompletely divided ventricle allows for blood to bypass either circuit. Lungfishes inhabit ephemeral waterbodies that may enforce prolonged aestivation during drought, throughout which nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression is upregulated. To better understand the physiological relevance of NO on cardiovascular regulation in this transitory group, we measured vascular reactivity to muscarinic agonist acetylcholine, \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine and isoproterenol, respectively), or the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on four vessel segments\u2014efferent branchial arteries, gill artery, ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery\u2014from the African lungfish, Protopterus aethiopicus. In a simultaneous study, we measured oxygen consumption and twitch force in myocardial preparations in the presence and absence of an NOS inhibitor (asymmetric dimethylarginine; ADMA). Only the ductus arteriosus vasodilated in response to SNP. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation, whereas acetylcholine and phenylephrine vasoconstricted all vessel segments. NOS inhibition decreased myocardial force relative to oxygen consumption, indicating a lowered efficiency. We provide novel evidence that NO affects the vasculature of lungfish that may be derived from perivascular nitrergic nerves limited to the ductus arteriosus. Our data also suggests that NO exerts a tonic dampening of myocardial oxygen consumption which may be particularly important during aestivation.",

     "abstract": "Osmoregulation in fish is a complex process that requires the orchestrated cooperation of many tissues. In fish facing hyperosmotic environments, the intestinal absorption of some monovalent ions and the secretion of bicarbonate are key processes to favor water absorption. In the present study, we showed that bicarbonate levels in the intestinal fluid are several fold higher in seawater than in freshwater acclimated tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). In addition, we analyzed gene expression of the main molecular mechanisms involved in HCO3\u2013 movements i.e. slc26a6, slc26a3, slc4a4 and v-type H-ATPase sub C in the intestine of tilapia acclimated to both seawater and freshwater. Our results show an anterior/posterior functional regionalization of the intestine in tilapia in terms of expression patterns, which is affected by environmental salinity mostly in the anterior and mid intestine. Analysis of bicarbonate secretion using pH-Stat in tissues mounted in Ussing chambers reveals high rates of bicarbonate secretion in tilapia acclimated to seawater from anterior intestine to rectum ranging between ~\u00a0900 and ~\u00a01700\u00a0nmol\u00a0HCO3\u2013\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01. However, a relationship between the expression of slc26a6, slc26a3, slc4a4 and the rate of bicarbonate secretion seems to be compromised in the rectum. In this region, the low expression of the bicarbonate transporters could not explain the high bicarbonate secretion rates here described. However, we postulate that the elevated v-type H-ATPase mRNA expression in the rectum could be involved in this process.",

This study sought to estimate the effects of simulated longline capture on the behavior, energy use, and physiological stress of juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). Captive sharks equipped with acceleration biologgers were subjected to 1\u00a0h of simulated longline capture. Swimming behaviors were identified from acceleration data using a machine-learning algorithm, energetic costs were estimated using accelerometer-calibrated relationships and respirometry, and physiological stress was quantified with point-of-care blood analyzers. During capture, sharks exhibited nine-fold increases in the frequency of burst swimming, 98% reductions in resting, and swam as often as unrestrained sharks. Aerobic metabolic rates during capture were 8% higher than for unrestrained sharks, and accounted for a 57.7% increase in activity costs when excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was included. Lastly, sharks exhibited significant increases in blood lactate and glucose, but no change in blood pH after 1\u00a0h of capture. Therefore, these results provide preliminary insight into the behavioral and energetic responses of sharks to capture, and have implications for mitigating sub-lethal consequences of capture for sharks as commercial longline bycatch.",

Birds have long been used as a model for the investigation of circadian rhythm in human neurobiology. In the present study, we examined the effects of continuous light and the combination of white and blue light on the expression of clock genes (Bmal1, Cry1, and Per3) in the central and peripheral tissues in chicks. Seventy two day-old male chicks were weighed, allocated to three groups and maintained under three light schedules: 12\u00a0h white light-12\u00a0h dark-cycles group (control); 24\u00a0h white light group (WW group); 12\u00a0h white light-12\u00a0h blue light-cycles group (WB group). The mRNA levels of clock genes in the diencephalon were significantly different between the control and WW groups. On the other hand, the alteration in the mRNA levels of clock genes was similar between the control and WB groups. Similar phenomena were observed in the liver and skeletal muscle (biceps femoris).

Additionally, exposure to low level of O2 after birth reduces the thermogenesis as well. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia over the third week of incubation affects the thermoregulation of juvenile chicks at an age when thermogenesis is already expected to be well-developed. To this end, we measured body temperature (Tb) and oxygen consumption ( V \u0307 0 2 ) under acute hypoxia or different ambient temperatures (Ta) of 1 and 10\u00a0day-old chicks that have been exposed to 21% O2 for entire incubation (Nx) or to 15% O2 in the last week of incubation (Hx). We also assessed the thermal preference under normoxia or acute hypoxia of the older chicks from both incubation groups in a thermocline. Hypoxia over incubation reduced growth but did not affect the cold-induced thermogenesis in hatchlings. Regarding the juvenile Hx, present data indicate a catch up growth with higher resting V \u0307 0 2 , a thermal preference for warmer Tas and a possible higher thermal conductance.

Costs of protein synthesis were determined in summer acclimatised G. oceanicus from Svalbard (79\u00b0N) at 5\u00a0\u00b0C and from Scotland (58\u00b0N) at 13\u00a0\u00b0C.

In the present study we aimed to evaluate gas exchange and pulmonary breathing pattern in L. paradoxa at different temperatures (25 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and different inspired O2 levels (21, 12, 10, and 7%). Normoxic breathing pattern consisted of isolated ventilatory cycles composed of an expiration followed by 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 buccal inspirations. Both expiratory and inspiratory tidal volumes reached a maximum of about 35\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01, indicating that L. paradoxa is able to exchange nearly all of its lung air in a single ventilatory cycle. At both temperatures, hypoxia caused a significant increase in pulmonary ventilation ( V \u0307 E ), mainly due to an increase in respiratory frequency. Durations of the ventilatory cycle and expiratory and inspiratory tidal volumes were not significantly affected by hypoxia. Expiratory time (but not inspiratory) was significantly shorter at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and at all O2 levels. While a small change in oxygen consumption ( V \u0307 O 2 ) could be noticed, the carbon dioxide release ( V \u0307 CO 2 , P\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) and air convection requirement ( V \u0307 E / V \u0307 O 2 , P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) were significantly affected by hypoxia (7% O2) at both temperatures, when compared to normoxia, and pulmonary diffusion capacity increased about four-fold due to hypoxic exposure.

Knock-down of LsHPX1 in nauplius larvae decreased the swimming activity of emerging copepodids.

In contrast, prolonged anoxia at 5\u00a0\u00b0C significantly reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity by 55%, which was largely driven by a 50% reduction of the number of Na+-K+-ATPase units without a change in the activity of existing Na+-K+-ATPase pumps or \u03b1-subunit composition. These findings are consistent with the \u201cchannel arrest\u201d hypothesis to reduce turtle brain Na+-K+-ATPase activity during prolonged, but not short-term anoxia, a change that likely helps them overwinter under low temperature, anoxic conditions.",

Under standard rearing conditions, we found similar survival and median lifespans in Canton-S (50\u00a0days) and w1118 (54\u00a0days) strains, however, w1118 flies maintained stable body mass for up to 43\u00a0days, whereas Canton-S flies gained body mass at young age, followed by a gradual decline.

Old Canton-S files, however, exhibited unchanged boundary preference and reduced recovery speed from anoxia relative to young flies.

We previously reported that the amount of dietary carbohydrates, protein and lipids modulates the expression of these peptides in goldfish in vivo. In the present work, we aimed to characterize the effects of single nutrients on ghrelin and nesfatin-1 in the intestine and hepatopancreas. First, immunolocalization of ghrelin and NUCB2/nesfatin-1 in goldfish hepatopancreas cells was studied by immunohistochemistry. Second, the effects of 2 and 4\u00a0hour-long exposures of cultured intestine and hepatopancreas sections to glucose, l-tryptophan, oleic acid, linolenic acid (LNA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on ghrelin and nesfatin-1 gene and protein expression were studied. Co-localization of ghrelin and NUCB2/nesfatin-1 in the cytoplasm of goldfish hepatocytes was found. Exposure to glucose led to an upregulation of preproghrelin and a downregulation of nucb2/nesfatin-1 in the intestine. l-Tryptophan mainly decreased the expression of both peptides in the intestine and hepatopancreas. Fatty acids, in general, downregulated NUCB2/nesfatin-1 in the intestine, but only the longer and highly unsaturated fatty acids inhibited preproghrelin. EPA exposure led to a decrease in preproghrelin, and an increase in nucb2/nesfatin-1 expression in hepatopancreas after 2\u00a0h. These results show that macronutrients exert a dose- and time-dependent, direct regulation of ghrelin and nesfatin-1 in the intestine and hepatopancreas, and suggest a role for these hormones in the digestive process and nutrient metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Studies in teleosts suggest that progestins have crucial functions during early spermatogenesis. However, the role of the different progestin receptors in these mechanisms is poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the expression pattern and hormonal regulation of the classical nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr) in the gilthead seabream at three different stages of spermatogenesis: the resting (postspawning) phase, onset of spermatogenesis, and spermiation. Immunolocalization experiments using a seabream specific Pgr antibody revealed that the receptor was expressed in Sertoli and Leydig cells, and also in a subset of spermatogonia type A, throughout spermatogenesis. Short-term treatment of testis explants with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) increased pgr mRNA expression at all stages, while the progestin 17\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20\u03b2P) had the opposite effect. At the resting stage, Sertoli cell Pgr expression was positively correlated with the occurrence of proliferating spermatogonia type A in the tubules, and both processes were incremented in vitro by E2 likely through the estrogen receptor alpha (Era) expressed in Sertoli and Leydig cells. In contrast, treatment with 17,20\u03b2P downregulated Pgr expression in somatic cells. The androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) upregulated pgr expression in Leydig cells and promoted the proliferation of mostly spermatogonia type B, but only during spermiation. No relationship between the changes in the cell type-specific expression of the Pgr with the entry into meiosis of germ cells was found. These data suggest a differential steroid regulation of Pgr expression during seabream spermatogenesis and the potential interplay of the E2/Era and 17,20\u03b2P/Pgr pathways for the maintenance of spermatogonial renewal rather than entry into meiosis.",

The nitrite reductase activity is modulated by the allosteric equilibrium between the R and T structures of Hb that also determines oxygen affinity. In the present study we investigated nitrite reductase activity and O2 affinity in Hbs from ten different vertebrate species under identical conditions to disclose interspecific variations and allow an extended test for a correlation between the rate constant for nitrite reduction and O2 affinity. We also tested plastic changes in Hb properties via addition of T-structure-stabilizing organic phosphates (ATP and GTP). The decay in deoxyHb during its reaction with nitrite was exponential-like in ectotherms (Atlantic hagfish, carp, crucian carp, brown trout, rainbow trout, cane toad, Indian python and red-eared slider turtle), while it was sigmoid in mammals (harbor porpoise and rabbit). Typically, hypoxia-tolerant species showed a faster reaction than intolerant species. Addition of ATP and GTP decreased O2 affinity and slowed the rate of nitrite reduction in a concentration-dependent manner. The initial second order rate constant of the deoxyHb-mediated nitrite reduction showed a strong curvilinear correlation with oxygen affinity among all ectothermic vertebrates, and the relationship also applied to plastic variations of Hb properties via organic phosphates. The relationship predicts high nitrite reductase activity in hypoxic tolerant species with high Hb-O2 affinity and reveals that the decrease in erythrocyte ATP and/or GTP during acclimation to hypoxia in ectotherms increases the erythrocyte NO generating capacity.",

Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) has been shown to act on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and on the pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release and synthesis in vertebrates, including sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. In the present study we investigated the effects of rearing temperature during the thermosensitive period (5\u201360\u00a0days post-fertilization, dpf) on the expression of the GnIH gene (gnih) and its receptor (gnihr). Animals were maintained under two different conditions, low temperature (LT, 15\u00a0\u00b0C) or high temperature (HT, 21\u00a0\u00b0C), throughout the thermosensitive period and sampled from 5 to 360\u00a0dpf at mid-light (ML) and mid-dark (MD). Our results showed significant effects of temperature on gnih and gnihr expression during the thermosensitive period, with higher transcript levels under LT condition. Some differences were also evident after the completion of the sex differentiation process. Moreover, we revealed daily variations in the developmental expression of gnih and gnihr, with higher diurnal mRNA levels at early stages (until 25\u00a0dpf), and a shift to higher nocturnal expression levels at 300\u2013360\u00a0dpf, which corresponded with the beginning of the winter (reproductive season). To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first study reporting the effects of rearing temperature on the transcription of gnih system genes, as well as its daily variations during the development of a fish species.",

Calcium transport activity of the chorioallantois increases in the final stages of development coincident with rapid embryonic growth and skeletal ossification. We excised embryos from viviparous Zootoca vivipara females at a stage prior to significant calcium accumulation and incubated them ex utero with and without calcium to test the hypothesis that chorioallantois calcium transport activity depends on developmental stage and not calcium availability. We measured calcium uptake by monitoring incubation media calcium content and chorioallantois expression of calbindin-D28K, a marker for transcellular calcium transport. The pattern of calcium flux to the media differed by incubation condition. Eggs in 0\u00a0mM calcium exhibited little variation in calcium gain or loss. For eggs in 2\u00a0mM calcium, calcium flux to the media was highly variable and was directed inward during the last 3\u00a0days of the experiment such that embryos gained calcium. Calbindin-D28K expression increased under both incubation conditions but was significantly higher in embryos incubated with 2\u00a0mM calcium. We conclude that embryos respond to calcium availability, yet significant calcium accumulation is developmental stage dependent. These observations suggest the chorioallantois exhibits a degree of functional plasticity that facilitates response to metabolic or environmental fluctuations.",

The recent characterization of the vertebrate magnesium transporter solute carrier 41a1 (SLC41a1) in the kidney of a euryhaline fish has provided a glimpse of possible moieties involved in piscine magnesium regulation. The present study obtained a novel SLC41a1 coding sequence for Carassius auratus and demonstrated ubiquitous expression in all tissues examined. Transcriptional regulation of SLC41a1 in response to dietary and environmental magnesium concentrations was observed across tissues. Specifically, decreased environmental magnesium correlated with decreased expression of SLC41a1 in the intestine, whereas the gill and kidney were unaffected. Dietary magnesium restriction correlated with decreased expression of SLC41a1 in the intestine and gill, while again no effects were detected in the kidney. Finally, elevated dietary magnesium correlated with increased expression of SLC41a1 in the kidney, while expression in the intestine and gill remained stable. Plasma magnesium was maintained in all treatments, and dietary assimilation efficiency increased with decreased dietary magnesium. Consumption of a single meal failed to impact SLC41a1 expression, and transcript abundance remained stable over the course of digestion in all treatments. Transcriptional regulation occurred between 7 and 14\u00a0days following dietary and environmental manipulations and short-term regulation (e.g. <\u00a024\u00a0h) was not observed. Overall the data supports transcriptional regulation of SLC41a1 reflecting a possible role in magnesium loss or secretion across tissues in fish.",

The potential costs of tail autotomy include shifts in energy allocation and metabolic rates, especially in juveniles, which invest their energy primarily in somatic growth. We compared the metabolic rates and followed the growth of juvenile males with and without regenerating tails in the Madagascar ground gecko (Paroedura picta), a nocturnal ground-dwelling lizard. Geckos with intact tails and those that were regrowing them grew in snout-vent-length at similar rates for 22\u00a0weeks after autotomy. Tail regeneration had a negligible influence on body mass-corrected metabolic rate measured at regular intervals throughout the regenerative process. We conclude that fast-growing juveniles under the conditions of unrestricted food can largely compensate for costs of tail loss and regeneration in their somatic growth without a significant impact on the total individual body mass-corrected metabolic rate.",

Basal metabolic rate (BMR) \u2013i.e., the minimum rate of energy necessary to maintain thermal homeostasis in endotherms\u2013 is a highly informative measure to increase our understanding, because it is determined under highly standardized conditions. In this study we evaluate the relationship between taxa- and mass-independent (residual) BMR and ten environmental factors for 34 subterranean rodent species. Both conventional and phylogenetically informed analyses indicate that ambient temperature is the major determinant of residual BMR, with both variables inversely correlated. By contrast, other environmental factors that have been shown to affect residual BMR in endotherms, such as habitat productivity and rainfall, were not significant predictors of residual BMR in this group of species. Then, the results for subterranean rodents appear to support a central prediction of the obligatory heat model (OHM), which is a mechanistic model aimed to explain the evolution of residual BMR. Specifically, OHM proposes that during the colonization of colder environments, individuals with greater masses of metabolically expensive tissues (and thus with greater BMR) are favored by natural selection due to the link between greater masses of metabolically expensive tissues and physiological capacities. This way, natural selection should establishes a negative correlation between ambient temperature and both internal organ size and residual BMR.",

A preliminary study confirmed that identical volumes of diploid and triploid erythrocytes (which equates to a smaller number of larger cells for triploids compared to diploids) did not differ in total protein synthesis rates. After chronic (100\u00a0d) acclimation of fish to 5, 15 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, triploid erythrocytes had lower HSP70, HSP90, heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and ubiquitin (free and total) levels than diploids in both species. Furthermore, Atlantic salmon erythrocytes showed significantly higher protein breakdown (based on conjugated ubiquitin levels) in triploids than diploids after acute heat stress in vitro, but no significant difference was detected between ploidies after acute cold stress. These results indicate that: 1) triploid erythrocytes synthesize more total protein per cell than diploids as a result of increased cell size; 2) triploids have sufficient total HSP levels for survival under low stress conditions; and 3) the lower basal titres of HSPs in triploids may be a handicap when combating acute stress. Taken together, this suggests that triploids are limited in their ability to withstand thermal stress because of a reduced ability to maintain proteostasis under stressful conditions.",

The present study examines whether heat resistance of electrical excitability of cardiac myocytes is modified by seasonal thermal acclimatization in roach (Rutilus rutilus), a eurythermal teleost species. To this end, temperature dependencies of ventricular action potentials (APs), and atrial and ventricular K+ currents were measured from winter-acclimatized (WiR) and summer-acclimatized (SuR) roach. Under patch-clamp recording conditions, ventricular APs could be triggered over a wide range of temperatures (4\u201343\u00a0\u00b0C) with prominent changes in resting membrane potential (RMP), AP duration and amplitude. In general, APs of SuR were slightly more tolerant to high temperatures than those of WiR, e.g. the break point temperature (TBP) of RMP was 37.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00b0C in WiR and 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C in SuR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Of the two major cardiac K+ currents, the inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) was particularly heat resistant in both SuR (TBP 39.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00b0C) and WiR (TBP 40.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00b0C) ventricular myocytes. The delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) was not as heat resistant as IK1. Surprisingly, IKr of WiR tolerated heat better (TBP 31.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u00b0C) than IKr of SuR (TBP 24.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). IKr (Erg2) channel transcripts of both atrial and ventricular myocytes were up-regulated in WiR. IK1 (Kir2) channel transcripts were not affected by seasonal acclimatization, although ventricular IK1 current was up-regulated in summer. Collectively, these findings show that thermal tolerance limits of K+ currents in isolated myocytes between seasonally acclimatized roach are much less pronounced than the heat sensitivity of ECG variables in intact fish.",

We also examined oxygen affinity, sensitivity to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) and nitrite reductase activity of the hemoglobin (Hb) to search for possible adaptive variations in these functional properties. We found levels of plasma and red blood cells nitrite similar to those reported for terrestrial mammals, but unusually high concentrations of red blood cell SNO in bottlenose dolphin, walrus and beluga whale, suggesting enhanced SNO-dependent signaling in these species. Purified Hbs showed similar functional properties in terms of oxygen affinity and sensitivity to DPG, indicating that reported large variations in blood oxygen affinity among diving mammals likely derive from phenotypic variations in red blood cell DPG levels. The nitrite reductase activities of the Hbs were overall slightly higher than that of human Hb, with the Hb of beluga whale, capable of longest dives, having the highest activity.

In response to acute stress, increased total plasma CORT is a ubiquitous phenomenon while T levels can decrease, or remain unchanged. Since CORT and T bind competitively with CBG in birds, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and consequences of their dynamic interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we studied the dynamic changes of total CORT, T, and CBG, and estimated free and bound CORT and T in response to capture stress in male Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) across the nest building, egg-laying, and nestling stages. We predicted that free, bound and total hormone concentrations would increase for CORT and decrease for T in response to acute stress, and the relative magnitude of these changes would vary with life history stage. We found that baseline and stressed-induced CORT values did not vary across breeding sub-stages. However, total and bound CORT increased with stress while free remained unchanged. Baseline levels of total, free and bound T were highest during the nest building and it was the only stage in which all measures of T were affected by stress. Regardless of breeding stage or restraint stress, we did not detect a significant correlation between CORT and T. CBG was found to be mostly unoccupied by steroid hormones under stress and stress-free conditions and this likely provided an adequate buffer for changes in free levels of CORT and T during unpredictable environmental perturbations.",

     "abstract": "The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), a worldwide destructive pest, is more heat tolerant than other wheat aphids, and it has developed resistance to different insecticides. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play an important role in coping with environmental stresses. To investigate Hsp transcriptional responses to heat and insecticide stress, four full-length Hsp genes from R. padi (RpHsp60, RpHsc70, RpHsp70-1, and RpHsp70-2) were cloned. Four RpHsps were expressed during all R. padi developmental stages, but at varying levels. The mRNA levels of RpHsps were increased under thermal stress and reached maximal induction at a lower temperature (36\u00a0\u00b0C) in the alate morph than in the apterous morph (37\u00a0\u00b0C or 38\u00a0\u00b0C). RpHsp expressions under heat stress suggest that RpHsp70-1 and RpHsp70-2 are inducible in both apterous and alate morphs, RpHsc70 is only heat-inducible in apterous morph, and RpHsp60 exhibits poor sensitivity to heat stress. The pretreatment at 37\u00a0\u00b0C significantly increase both the survival rate and the RpHsps expression level of R. padi at subsequent lethal temperature. Under exposure to two sublethal concentrations (LC10 and LC30) of beta-cypermethrin, both RpHsp70-1 and RpHsp70-2 expressions were induced and reached a maximum 24\u00a0h after exposure. In contrast, expression of RpHsp60 was not induced by either sublethal concentration of beta-cypermethrin. Moreover, the responses of RpHsp70-1 and RpHsp70-2 to heat shock were more sensitive than those to beta-cypermethrin. These results suggest that induction of RpHsp expression is related to thermal tolerance, and that RpHsp70-1 and RpHsp70-2 are the primary genes involved in the response to both heat and pesticide stress.",

Immunolocalization of Ssk and mesh in the midgut and Malpighian tubules indicated that both proteins are concentrated at regions of cell-cell contact between epithelial cells. Transcript abundance of ssk and mesh was higher in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of brackish water (BW, 30% SW) reared A. aegypti larvae when compared with freshwater (FW) reared animals. Therefore, [3H]polyethylene glycol (MW 400\u00a0Da, PEG-400) flux was examined across isolated midgut and Malpighian tubule preparations as a measure of their paracellular permeability. It was found that PEG-400 flux was greater across the midgut of BW versus FW larvae while the Malpighian tubules of BW-reared larvae had reduced PEG-400 permeability in conjunction with increased Cl\u2212 secretion compared to FW animals. Taken together, data suggest that Ssk and mesh are found in smooth SJs (sSJs) of larval A. aegypti and that their abundance alters in association with changes in epithelial permeability when larvae reside in water of differing salt content. This latter observation suggests that Ssk and mesh play a role in the homeostatic control of salt and water balance in larval A. aegypti.",

Additionally, the extent to which these profiles are coordinated across physiological systems within individuals remains an important question in understanding how stressors can differentially affect aspects of an individual's physiology. Here, we present data from wild populations of the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) on both baseline and stress-induced biomarkers: plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentration, plasma glucose concentration, and whole blood heterophil:lymphocyte ratio. Using a standardized restraint protocol with individuals from populations in disparate portions of this species' range \u2013 the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California and the plains of Iowa \u2013 we collected blood plasma samples at nine time points over three days. Both CORT and glucose response curves differed between georegions, with Iowa snakes attaining higher glucose concentration and maintaining elevated CORT and glucose levels for a longer duration. Additionally, both the total amount and proportional increases of CORT and glucose were lower in larger and therefore older snakes, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in stress perception or response. Within-individual correlation among the three physiological indicators was significant at the time of capture, absent after 3\u00a0h in captivity, and partially restored after 3\u00a0days in captivity, demonstrating the effect of stress on the relationships among these physiological systems. Together, these results provide further evidence for the great physiological flexibility of ectothermic tetrapods in maintaining homeostasis across a range of factors.",

Among these resources, dietary antioxidants, acquired by females and transferred to the eggs during egg formation, can greatly affect the development and survival of the embryo and chick. In crested penguins, incubation starts after the second and last egg is laid and, as opposed to many other bird species, this egg hatches first, thereby enhancing the survival of the chick. Here, we assessed whether antioxidant and isotopic composition could underlie these differences between eggs within clutches of southern rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome). The second-laid egg had higher total antioxidant capacity than the first-laid egg, although this was not due to higher antioxidant concentration but to its higher mass. This suggests that resources are allocated by females at a constant rate in both eggs within clutches. Accordingly, we found a strong correlation for isotopic compositions between eggs suggesting that resources were allocated similarly to each egg within the clutch. Overall, we found little evidence for a significant role of antioxidant and isotopic compositions to explain differences in terms of embryo/chick development between eggs in crested penguins. However, since our results suggest a constant rate of antioxidant transfer from females to eggs, limiting the mass of the first-laid egg might represent a strategy for females to spare antioxidant defences and preserve self-maintenance.",

We evaluated the influence of cortisol treatment on mRNA expression of Nos1 and Nos2 in gill, kidney and middle intestine of both freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) acclimated rainbow trout and found both tissue- and salinity-dependent effects. Nos2 expression was down-regulated in the gill by cortisol injection in both FW and SW trout. This was substantiated by incubating gill tissue with cortisol ex vivo. Similarly, cortisol injection significantly down-regulated Nos2 expression in kidney of SW fish but not in FW fish. In the middle intestine, Nos2 expression was up-regulated by cortisol injection in FW but unchanged in SW fish. Nos1 expression was up-regulated by cortisol injection in FW kidney and down-regulated in SW kidney, whereas it was unaffected in gill and middle intestine of FW and SW fish. Our data provide the first evidence that cortisol may influence NO production in fish by regulating Nos expression. Indeed, the down-regulation of Nos2 expression by cortisol in the gill may prevent the inhibitory effect of NO on NKA activity thereby furthering the stimulatory effect of cortisol on ion-transport.",

The fatty acid compositions of neutral and polar lipids, respectively involved in energy storage and cell membrane structure, were explored and compared in four tissues (red and white muscles, liver and gonads), according to biological (size, sex and maturity) and environmental (season and area) factors. The liver and the red muscle were the fattest tissues (i.e., higher levels of storage lipids) in all species and polar lipids were the lowest in the white muscle. Species and tissue types explained most differences in fatty acid compositions, while environmental factors had limited effects, except in the hepatic cell membrane where fatty acid composition varied with monsoons. Docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) was the major fatty acid in both polar and neutral lipid fractions, especially in muscles. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) were in higher proportion in neutral than in polar lipids. Arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and 22:6n-3, together with docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-6) and stearic acid (18:0), showed preferential accumulation in polar lipids. 20:4n-6 was particularly involved in cell membranes of ovary and white muscle. Overall, an important inter-individual variability in fatty acid compositions of structural lipids was found within tissue types despite considering biological factors that are most likely to influence this type of lipids.

In this work, the effects of AKG-supplemented diets on selected physiological responses and metabolic processes, including metabolism of reactive oxygen species, was assessed in larvae and adult (both 2 and 24\u00a0days old) Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary supplementation with AKG resulted in dose-dependent effects on larval development, body composition and antioxidant status of third instar larvae. Larvae and young (2\u00a0days post-eclosion) adult females fed on AKG shared similar metabolic changes such as higher total protein levels, lower triacylglyceride levels and higher values for oxidative stress indices, namely lipid peroxides and low molecular mass thiols. The latter indicated the development of oxidative stress which, in turn, may induce adaptive responses that can explain the higher resistance of AKG-fed young females to heat shock and hydrogen peroxide exposure. In contrast to young flies, middle-aged females (24\u00a0days) on AKG-containing diet possessed higher total protein, glucose and triacylglyceride levels, whereas oxidative stress parameters were virtually the same as compared with control females of the same age. In parallel, females fed an AKG-supplemented diet showed lower fecundity, higher heat shock resistance but no change in oxidative stress resistance at middle age which in combination with levels of protein, glucose, and triacylglycerides can be considered as potentially beneficial AKG effects for aging organisms. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on age-matched AKG influence on animals' organism which shows that Drosophila may be used as a model for previous quick study in cost-efficient manner age-related AKG effects in mammals and humans.",

The fish were anesthetized to collect samples of blood, stomach and midgut at 4-hour intervals over a period of 24\u00a0h. Fish fed at ML showed a diurnal locomotor activity (74% of the total daily activity occurring during the light phase) and synchronization to the feeding schedule, as this group showed anticipation to the feeding time. Fish fed at MD showed a disruption in the pattern of locomotor activity and became less diurnal (59%). Alkaline protease activity in the midgut showed daily rhythm with the achrophase at the beginning of the dark phase in both ML and MD groups. Acid protease and amylase did not show significant daily rhythms. Plasma glucose showed a daily rhythm with the achrophase shifted by 12\u00a0h in the ML and MD groups. These results revealed that the feeding time and light cycle synchronize differently the daily rhythms of behavior, digestive physiology and plasma metabolites in the Nile tilapia, which indicate the plasticity of the circadian system and its synchronizers.",

It was found that leucine (Leu), phenylalanine and lysine were significantly decreased in the embryonic brain and liver.

It was found that in ovo injection of l-Leu, but not of l-Ileu or l-Val, caused a significant decline in body temperature at hatching and increased food intake and body weight gain in broiler chicks. Interestingly, in ovo injection of l-Leu resulted in the acquisition of thermotolerance under high ambient temperature (35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for 180\u00a0min) in comparison with the control thermoneutral temperature (28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C for 180\u00a0min). These results indicate that the free amino acid concentrations during embryogenesis were altered by TM. l-Leu administration in eggs caused a reduction in body temperature at hatching, and afforded thermotolerance in heat-exposed young chicks, further suggesting that l-Leu may be one of the key metabolic factors involved in controlling body temperature in embryos, as well as in producing thermotolerance after hatching.",

Therefore, the present study investigated the main intestinal changes of long-term acclimation of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) to 5, 15, 38 and 55\u00a0ppt. Through the measurement of short-circuit current (Isc) in Ussing chambers and biochemical approaches, we described a clear anterior/posterior functional regionalization of the intestine in response to salinity. The use of specific inhibitors in Ussing chamber experiments, revealed that the bumetanide-sensitive Na+/K+/Cl\u2212 co-transporters are the main effectors of Cl\u2212 uptake in both anterior intestine and rectum. Additionally, the use of the anion exchanger specific inhibitor, DIDS, showed a salinity/region dependency of anion exchanger function. Moreover, we also described ouabain-sensitive Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Bafilomycin A1-sensitive H+-ATPase activities (HA), which displayed changes related to salinity and intestinal region. However, the most striking result of the present study is the description of an omeprazole-sensitive H+/K+-ATPase (HKA) in the rectum of Senegalese sole. Its activity was consistently measurable and increased at lower salinities, reaching rates even higher than those of the NKA. Together our results provide new insights into the changing role of the intestine in response to external salinity in teleost fish. The rectal activity of HKA offers an alternative/cooperative mechanism with the HA in the final processing of intestinal water absorption by apical titration of secreted bicarbonate.",

     "abstract": "The physiological effects of high environmental ammonia (HEA) exposure have been well documented in many aquatic species. In particular, it has recently been demonstrated that exposure to ammonia in fish leads to a similar hyperventilatory response as observed during exposure to hypoxia. In littoral crabs, such as the green crab (Carcinus maenas), exposure to severe hypoxia triggers an emersion response whereby crabs escape hypoxia to breathe air. We hypothesized that exposure to HEA in green crabs would lead to a similar behavioural response which is specific to ammonia. Using an experimental arena containing a rock bed onto which crabs could emerse, we established that exposure to HEA (4\u00a0mmol/l NH4HCO3) for 15\u00a0min triggers emersion in crabs. In experiments utilizing NaHCO3 controls and NH4HCO3 injections, we further determined that emersion was triggered specifically by external ammonia and was independent of secondary acid-base or respiratory disturbances caused by HEA. We then hypothesized that emersion from HEA provides a physiological benefit, similar to emersion from hypoxia. Exposure to 15\u00a0min of HEA without emersion (no rock bed present) caused significant increases in arterial haemolymph total ammonia (Tamm), pH, and [HCO3\u2212]. When emersion was allowed, arterial haemolymph Tamm and [HCO3\u2212] increased, but no alkalosis developed. Moreover, emersion decreased haemolymph partial pressure of NH3 relative to crabs which could not emerse. Overall, we demonstrate a novel behavioural response to HEA exposure in crabs which we propose may share similar mechanistic pathways with the emersion response triggered by hypoxia.",

Phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggested that FoxO1a and FoxO1b were derived from paralogous genes that could be originated from teleost-specific genome duplication (TSGD) event. Analysis of the exon\u2013intron structures clarified that grass carp FoxO1a and FoxO1b comprise 3 coding exons and contain a extra intron compared with human and mouse FoxO1. Both FoxO1a and FoxO1b mRNAs were expressed in a wide range of tissues, but the abundance of each FoxO1 mRNA showed the tissue- dependent expression patterns. Time-course analysis of FoxO1 expressions indicated that the level of FoxO1a mRNA reached almost maximal level at day 2, while that of FoxO1b mRNA reached almost maximal level at day 4 during grass carp primary preadipocyte differentiation. In insulin-inhibited adipocyte lipolysis, only FoxO1a showed a significant decrease in adipocyte, indicating that two FoxO1 isoforms may serve somewhat different roles in the regulation of lipolysis by insulin. These results suggested that grass carp FoxO1a and FoxO1b may play different roles in tissues, and their expression levels were differently modulated by insulin in adipocyte.",

Results indicated that Senegalese sole post-larvae are able to maintain absorption and retention capacities independently of feeding rate and nutritional status.

Unique properties of milk composition have been observed. Southern reedbuck milk seems to have a complex casein composition, similar to that of sheep. Milk composition varies between species. Although some differences may be ascribed to biological condition, such as stage of lactation, or ecological factors, such as availability of certain nutrients, the contribution by evolutionary history is not well documented and the emphasis is usually on the composition of the macro nutrients. Phylogenetic comparisons often lack representatives of multiple species of taxonomic groups and sub-groups. To date phylogenetic comparisons of milk composition have been carried out by using data from different publications. The problem with this approach is that the ecological factors cannot be completely ruled out. A statistical phylogenetic comparison by PCA between 15 species representing 7 different suborders, families or subfamilies of African Artiodactyla was carried out. The phylogenetic properties showed that the milk composition of the Bovinae, represented here by the subfamilies Bovini and Tragelaphini, differs from the other taxonomic groups, in that the Alcelaphinae had a high milk fat content of the medium chain length fatty acids C8\u2013C12 (>\u00a017% of total fatty acids) and the Hippotraginae high amounts of oligosaccharides (>\u00a00.4%).",

     "abstract": "Knowledge of thermal stress biology for most tropical fish species in reef ecosystems under climate change is still quite limited. Thus, the objective of this study was to measure the time-course changes of thermal stress biomarkers in the commercially exploited coral reef fish Amphiprion ocellaris, during a laboratory simulated event of increased temperature. Heat shock protein 70\u00a0kDa (Hsp70) and total ubiquitin (Ub) were determined in the muscle (lethal method) and in the fin (non-lethal alternative method) under two temperature treatments (control \u2013 26\u00a0\u00b0C and elevated temperature \u2013 30\u00a0\u00b0C) throughout one month with weekly samplings. Results suggest that biomarker basal levels are tissue-specific and influence the degree of response under temperature exposure. Responses were highly inducible in the muscle but not in fin tissue, indicating that the latter is not reliable for monitoring purposes. Thermal stress was observed in the muscle after one week of exposure (both biomarkers increased significantly) and Ub levels then decreased, suggesting the animals were able to acclimate by maintaining high levels of Hsp70 and through an effective protein turnover. In addition, the results show that mortality rates did not differ between treatments. This indicates that A. ocellaris is capable of displaying a plastic response to elevated temperature by adjusting the protein quality control system to protect cell functions, without decreasing survival. Thus, this coral reef fish species presents a significant acclimation potential under ocean warming scenarios of +\u00a04\u00a0\u00b0C. Monitoring of thermal stress through a non-lethal method, fin-clipping, although desirable proved to be inadequate for this species.",

     "abstract": "Ecological diversification into thermally divergent habitats can push species toward their physiological limits, requiring them to accommodate temperature extremes through plastic or evolutionary changes that increase persistence under the local thermal regime. One way to withstand thermal stress is to increase production of heat shock proteins, either by maintaining higher baseline abundance within cells or by increasing the magnitude of induction in response to heat stress. We evaluated whether environmental variation was associated with expression of three heat shock protein genes in two closely-related species of woodland ant, Aphaenogaster picea and A. rudis. We compared adult workers from colonies collected from 25 sites across their geographic ranges. Colonies were maintained at two different laboratory temperatures, and tested for the independent effects of environment, phylogeny, and acclimation temperature on baseline and heat-induced gene expression. The annual maximum temperature at each collection site (Tmax) was not a significant predictor of either baseline expression or magnitude of induction of any of the heat shock protein genes tested. A phylogenetic effect was detected only for basal expression of Hsp40, which was lower in the most southern populations of A. rudis and higher in a mid-range population of possible hybrid ancestry. In contrast, a higher acclimation temperature significantly increased baseline expression of Hsc70-4, and increased induction of Hsp40 and Hsp83. Thus, physiological acclimation to temperature variation appears to involve modulation of the heat shock response, whereas other mechanisms are likely to be responsible for evolutionary shifts in thermal performance associated with large-scale climate gradients.",

Here we report that rearing the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, on media supplemented with selected inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis throughout the larval, pupal and adult life led to major alterations in selected oxidative and antioxidative parameters of wax moth and its ectoparasitoid, Bracon hebetor. The highest dietary dexamethasone (Dex), esculetin (Esc) and phenidone (Phe) led to increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and to elevated catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities in all developmental stages of host larvae. Dietary Phe resulted in increased MDA levels, and CAT activity in G. mellonella adults by about 4-fold and about 2-fold, respectively. The Phe effect on GST activity in all stages of the wax moth was expressed in a dose-dependent manner, increased to 140\u00a0nmol/mg protein/min in larvae. MDA levels were increased by over 30-fold in adult wasps reared on Dex- and Esc-treated hosts. CAT and GST activities were increased in adult parasitoids reared on Esc-and Phe-treated hosts. GST activity of Dex-treated parasitoid larvae increased from about 4 to over 30\u00a0nmol/mg protein/min. Dietary Phe led to increased GST activity, by about 25-fold, in adult wasps. These data indicate that chronic inhibition of eicosanoid biosynthesis leads to increased oxidative stress, strongly supporting our hypothesis. The significance of this work lies in understanding the roles of eicosanoids in insect biology. Aside from other well-known eicosanoids actions, we propose that eicosanoids mediate reductions in oxidative stress.",

Experimental data provide a useful description of fish response to thermal stress at both zootechnical and molecular level. Although no mortality has been observed, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-based metabolomics confirms the marked sensitivity of this fish species to low water temperature, and explains some key molecular events associated to fish response to cold. Increase in hepatosomatic index is associated to liver fat accumulation, as a consequence of lipid mobilization from muscle and other extrahepatic tissues, and metabolic rearrangements linked to homeoviscous adaptation of cellular membranes are observed. Following primary responses to descending temperature from 18\u00a0\u00b0C to 11\u00a0\u00b0C, the energetic metabolism (insulin signaling, glycolysis) is first clearly affected; then, at constant low water temperature (11\u00a0\u00b0C), the most perturbed metabolic pathways are related to methionine cycle in liver, while osmoregulatory function is exerted by TMAO in muscle. Water temperature recovery from 11\u00a0\u00b0C to 18\u00a0\u00b0C stimulates gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis activities at hepatic level, although the rate of a thermo-compensatory response seems to be slower than that of the cooling phase. The obtained results are intended to guide novel high-performance feed formulations for gilthead sea bream reared during winter.",

Here we examined potential maternal influences on metabolic rates (MR) of offspring in an estuarine turtle, the diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin). Females and their eggs were collected from the field and the eggs incubated in the laboratory for subsequent measurement of MR of females, late-stage embryos, newly-hatched individuals that were nutritionally dependent on yolk, and older hatchlings that had depleted their yolk reserves and thus were independent of energetic contributions from the female. Female identity significantly affected MR of yolk-dependent hatchlings but, after yolk was depleted, MR of offspring converged and no longer reflected the maternal influence. Offspring from different females also differed in size, which influenced offspring MR and growth, but there was no correlation between female MR or size and offspring traits. MR of the older, yolk-independent hatchlings was lower overall than yolk-dependent hatchlings but correlated positively with growth rates and prior developmental rate (e.g. negatively correlated with time to hatching). Unlike another turtle species (snapping turtles), in which maternally-related differences in offspring MR were retained after yolk depletion, the maternal influence on offspring MR in diamondback terrapins is limited to early hatchling development and growth. The transient nature of the maternal effect, which was present only during the period that hatchlings were metabolizing yolk, suggests that variation among females in the composition of yolk deposited in eggs could be responsible for the differences observed in this study.",

Here, we characterize the kisspeptin system in the pejerrey, Odontesthes bonariensis, a fish with strong temperature-dependent sex determination. We reconstructed the phylogenetic history of the two ligands (kiss1 and kiss 2) and two receptors (kissr2 and kissr3) in pejerrey in the context of recent classifications of bony fishes, determined their tissue distribution and documented the early expression pattern of these ligands and receptors. Phylogenetic analysis of these gene families clearly resolved the percomorph clade and grouped pejerrey with Beloniformes. Paralogous sets of genes putatively arising from the teleost-specific genome duplication event (3R) were not detected. Kisspeptins and their receptors showed a wide tissue distribution in adult pejerrey, including tissues not related to reproduction. In larvae reared at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, the four kisspeptin elements were expressed in the head from week 1 to week 8 of life, with no differences in transcript levels. Larvae kept at a female-producing temperature (17\u00a0\u00b0C) did not show statistically significant differences in the transcript levels of all analyzed genes during the sex determination/differentiation period; however, in those larvae raised at male producing temperature (29\u00a0\u00b0C), kiss2 levels were increased at week 4 after hatching. These results showed that all members of the kisspeptin system are expressed at this early period, and the increase of kiss2 transcripts at week 4 could be interpreted as it would be related to the differentiation of the brain-pituitary axis in male development.",

The horse has some unique peculiarities in calcium homeostasis compared to other species including a high absorptive capacity for calcium in the intestine, high plasma calcium concentrations, high renal excretion, and low plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. So far, knowledge about the underlying mechanisms and the regulation of intestinal calcium absorption is still limited concerning this species. Several studies have documented that intestinal calcium transport in horses is not as dependent on vitamin D as in other species. However, published data on other potential regulatory mechanisms are still lacking. In the present study, paracellular and transcellular transport mechanisms for intestinal calcium transport along the intestinal axis were identified in horses using the Ussing chamber technique. Furthermore, the expression of respective transport proteins including transient receptor potential vanilloid member 6, calbindin-D9k and calcium ATPase type 1 in line with the determined calcium flux rates was documented. In respect to regulation of transepithelial calcium transport, novel regulatory proteins for maintaining calcium homeostasis such as B-box and SPRY-domain containing protein and calmodulin were investigated for the first time in equine intestinal tissues in this study.

No changes in erythrocyte or muscle amino acid accumulation rates were noted, but the patterns of plasma amino acid accumulation were suggestive of regulation. Contrary to expectations, glycine transport across the skin in vitro was enhanced in the lowest exposure salinity, but no other salinity-dependent changes were demonstrated.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) form shoals living in freshwater systems with low visibility, show a robust positive rheotaxis, and respond to geomagnetic fields. Here, we investigated whether a static magnetic field in the Earth-strength range influenced the rheotactic threshold of zebrafish in a swimming tunnel. The direction of the horizontal component of the magnetic field relative to water flow influenced the rheotactic threshold of fish as part of a shoal, but not of fish tested alone. Results obtained after disabling the lateral line of shoaling individuals with Co2\u00a0+ suggest that this organ system is involved in the observed magneto-rheotactic response.

White leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at one of 25\u201330% relative humidity, 55\u201360% relative humidity, and 85\u201390% relative humidity. Embryos were sampled at days 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 to examine embryo and kidney mass, glomerular characteristics, body fluid osmolalities, hematological properties, and whole embryo oxygen consumption. Low and especially high RH elevated mortality, which was reflected in a 10\u201320% lower embryo mass on D18. Low RH altered several glomerular characteristics by day 18, including increased numbers of glomeruli per kidney, increased glomerular perfusion, and increased total glomerular volume, all indicating potentially increased functional kidney capacity. Hematological variables and plasma and amniotic fluid osmolalities remained within normal physiological values. However, the allantoic, amniotic and cloacal fluids had a significant increase in osmolality at most developmental points sampled. Embryonic oxygen consumption increased relative to control at both low and high relative humidities on Day 18, reflecting the increased metabolic costs of osmotic stress. Major differences in both renal structure and performance associated with changes in incubation humidity occurred after establishment of the metanephric kidney and persisted into late development, and likely into the postnatal period.

While much is known about the specific mechanisms employed by teleosts, almost nothing is known about the basal fishes, such as white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) which may offer insight into the evolution of osmo- and ionoregulation in fishes. We investigated Na+ uptake in juvenile white sturgeon in the presence and absence of transporter inhibitors. We found that sturgeon acclimated to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0l\u2212\u00a01 Na+ have Na+ uptake kinetics typical of teleosts and that a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) is the predominant transporter for Na+ uptake.

It was hypothesized that during exposure to hypercarbia Na+ uptake would increase at CO2 tensions at which fish were capable of pHe regulation but decrease at higher tensions when they were preferentially regulating pHi. We found that Na+ uptake did not increase at 1.5\u00a0kPa PCO2, but at 6\u00a0kPa PCO2 Na+ uptake was reduced by 95% while low water pH equivalent to 6\u00a0kPa PCO2 reduced Na+ uptake by 71%. Lastly, we measured net acid flux during hypercarbia, which indicates that net acid flux is not associated with Na+ uptake.

To test whether digestion affect swimming performance and the relationships of digestion with metabolism and behavior in an active forager, we investigated the postprandial metabolic response, spontaneous swimming activities, critical swimming speed (Ucrit), and fast-start escape performance of both fasted and digesting (3\u00a0h after feeding to satiation) juvenile rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus). Feeding to satiation elicited a 50% increase in the oxygen consumption rate, which peaked at 3\u00a0h after feeding and returned to the prefeeding state after another 3\u00a0h. However, approximately 50% and 90% of individuals resumed feeding behavior at 2 and 3\u00a0h postfeeding, respectively, although the meal size varied substantially. Digestion showed no effect on either steady swimming performance as suggested by the Ucrit or unsteady swimming performance indicated by the maximum linear velocity in fast-start escape movement. However, digesting fish showed more spontaneous activity as indicated by the longer total distance traveled, mainly through an increased percentage of time spent moving (PTM). A further analysis found that fasting individuals with high swimming speed were more inclined to increase their PTM during digestive processes. The present study suggests that as an active forager With a small meal size and hence limited postprandial physiological and morphological changes, the swimming performance of rose bitterling is maintained during digestion, which might be crucial for its active foraging mode and anti-predation strategy.",

In the present study, we tested this hypothesis in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis). We expected that immune responses would be increased by short photoperiod but suppressed by low temperature.Thirty-four adult female hamsters were randomly divided into the long day (16\u00a0L:8D) and short day (8\u00a0L:16D) groups, which were further assigned into the warm (23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) and the cold (5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) groups, respectively. We found that body mass was not affected by photoperiod or temperature. Contrary to our expectation, short day reduced phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response indicative of cellular immunity and the levels of immunoglobin (Ig) M. It had no effect on total body fat mass, thymus and spleen masses, white blood cells (WBC) and Ig G titers. As expected, cold stress decreased total body fat mass, WBC, Ig G and Ig M titers. However, it did not influence the masses of thymus and spleen and PHA responses. The levels of blood glucose, serum leptin and corticosterone were all not affected by temperature or photoperiod except that corticosterone levels were increased by short days. No significant correlations were detected among the levels of blood glucose, serum leptin, corticosterone and all the detected immunological parameters. Taken together, short photoperiod suppressed both cellular and humoral immunity in striped hamsters, which did not support the winter immunoenhancement hypothesis. Cold stress reduced humoral immunity and WBC, which might account for the highest mortality in winter in this species. Blood glucose, leptin and corticosterone could not interpret the changes of immunity in hamsters.",

     "abstract": "Although it is well-known that retrograde transport of urine fills the caeca of birds with fluid and small particles, the function of avian caeca is still not fully understood. We measured mean retention times (MRT) of solute (cobalt-EDTA, Co), small particle (<\u00a02\u00a0mm, chromium-mordanted fibre, Cr) and large particle (8\u00a0mm, cerium-marked fibre, Ce) markers in geese (Anser anser) and turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) fed alfalfa pellets ad libitum. Intake did not differ between species. Turkeys had longer MRT for all markers (Co: 10.4 vs. 3.2\u00a0h; Cr 23.3 vs. 2.9\u00a0h; Ce 9.5 vs. 2.1\u00a0h), achieved a higher fibre digestibility, and had a higher calculated dry matter gut fill. Thus, geese and turkeys correspond to the typical dichotomy of good fliers vs. poor fliers/flightless species in avian herbivores. Because uric acid is fermented much faster by microbes than fibre, the ultimate cause of short-MRT digesta retention in avian caeca as in geese is possibly rather uric acid than fibre fermentation. The numerical differences between marker MRT in geese correspond to a colonic separation mechanism that delays the excretion of fluids more than small and again more than large particles. In contrast to geese, turkeys excreted solid and liquid (caecal) faeces. Liquid faeces contained less fibre and more crude protein than solid faeces and accounted for the excretion of 7, 25 and 34% of Ce, Co and Cr markers. Marker excretion patterns and MRT for liquid faeces (Co 15 vs. Cr 50\u00a0h) suggest that small particles did not simply move in parallel to fluids, but were retained selectively by being trapped in colonic digesta upon expulsion from caeca, with subsequent repeated retrograde transport into caeca with the next batch of urine. Given the absence of coprophagy in birds (in contrast to small mammalian herbivores), such a delay of small (microbial) particle escape from the caeca appears reasonable.",

Furthermore, nothing is still known in decapods crustaceans about the role of histamine as primary chemical messenger for modulation of main components of digestive process (i.e. proteases). We determined biochemical characteristics and investigated the effect of histamine injections; of histamine in vitro and of acclimation of individuals to low and high salinity on trypsin and aminopeptidase-N (APN) activities in the hepatopancreas of the euryhaline crab Cyrtograpsus angulatus (Dana 1851). Trypsin activity was maximal at pH\u00a07.4 and at 45\u00a0\u00b0C. APN activity increased from pH\u00a06.6 to 7.6\u20139.0 and was maintained high at 37\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C. Both activities exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent Km: trypsin\u00a0=\u00a00.36\u00a0mM; APN\u00a0=\u00a00.07\u00a0mM). The injection of 10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M histamine decreased trypsin activity (about 40%) in hepatopancreas while did not affect APN activity. Similarly, in vitro 10-4\u00a0M histamine decreased trypsin activity (about 52%) in hepatopancreas but not APN activity. Trypsin activity in the hepatopancreas was not affected by acclimation of crabs to low (10\u00a0psu) or high (40\u00a0psu) environmental salinity while APN activity was increased (about 200%) in 10\u00a0psu. The results show the differential modulation of trypsin and APN by distinct cues and point to histamine as modulator of intracellular trypsin by direct action on the hepatopancreas.",

Since these cyclic changes in the environment are constant and predictable, they have affected biological evolution through selecting the occurrence of biological rhythms in the physiology of all living organisms, from prokaryotes to mammals. Biological clocks confer organisms an adaptive advantage as they can synchronize their behavioral and physiological processes to occur at a given moment of time when effectiveness and success would be greater and/or the cost and risk for organisms would be lower. Among environmental synchronizers, light has been mostly widely studied to date. However, other environmental signals play an important role in biological rhythms, especially in aquatic animals like fish. This review focuses on current knowledge about the role of nonphotic synchronizers (temperature, food and tidal cycles) on biological rhythms in fish, and on the entrainment of the fish circadian system to these synchronizers.",

     "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a superfamily of molecular chaperones with important roles in protein homeostasis and other cellular functions. Amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds have a shsp gene called hsp30, which was also referred to as hspb11 or hsp25 in some fish and bird species. Hsp30 genes, which are not found in mammals, are transcribed in response to heat shock or other stresses by means of the heat shock factor that is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded protein. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that representative HSP30s from different classes of non-mammalian vertebrates were distinct from other sHSPs including HSPB1/HSP27. Studies with amphibian and fish recombinant HSP30 determined that they were molecular chaperones since they inhibited heat- or chemically-induced aggregation of unfolded protein. During non-mammalian vertebrate development, hsp30 genes were differentially expressed in selected tissues. Also, heat shock-induced stage-specific expression of hsp30 genes in frog embryos was regulated at the level of chromatin structure. In adults and/or tissue culture cells, hsp30 gene expression was induced by heat shock, arsenite, cadmium or proteasomal inhibitors, all of which enhanced the production of unfolded/damaged protein. Finally, immunocytochemical analysis of frog and chicken tissue culture cells revealed that proteotoxic stress-induced HSP30 accumulation co-localized with aggresome-like inclusion bodies. The congregation of damaged protein in aggresomes minimizes the toxic effect of aggregated protein dispersed throughout the cell. The current availability of probes to detect the presence of hsp30 mRNA or encoded protein has resulted in the increased use of hsp30 gene expression as a marker of proteotoxic stress in non-mammalian vertebrates.",

Repeatedly subjecting 25\u00b0C-acclimated painted turtles to 2\u00a0h of anoxic stress every other day for 19\u00a0days (10 submergence bouts total) caused resting levels of liver glycogen to decrease by 17% and liver citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome oxidase (COX) activities to increase by 33% and 112%, respectively. When the repeatedly submerged turtles were studied during a subsequent anoxic stress test, liver COX and CS activities decreased during anoxia to the same levels of na\u00efve turtles, which were unchanged, and remained there throughout metabolic recovery. There were no effects of the repeated anoxia treatment on any of the other measured variables, which included lactate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase activities in liver, skeletal muscle, and ventricle, blood acid-base status, hemoglobin, hematocrit and plasma ion (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl) and metabolite concentrations (lactate, glucose, free-fatty acids), before, during, or after the anoxic stress test. We conclude that although painted turtles can show a physiological reaction to repeated anoxic stress, the changes appear to have no measurable effect on anaerobic physiological performance or ability to recover from anoxia.",

This study aimed to clone two GPR54 genes (gpr54-1 and gpr54-2) from the brain of the sapphire devil Chrysiptera cyanea, a tropical damselfish, and to study their involvement in reproduction. The partial sequences of the sapphire devil gpr54-1 cDNA (1059\u00a0bp) and gpr54-2 cDNA (1098\u00a0bp) each had an open reading frame encoding a protein of 353 and 366 amino acids, respectively, both of which had structural features of a G-protein-coupled receptor. The expression of gpr54-1 mRNA was observed in the diencephalon and telencephalon, and gpr54-2 mRNA was found in the optic tectum of sapphire devil. When gpr54-1 and gpr54-2 mRNA levels were examined in the brain of sapphire devil by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), they were found to increase during late vitellogenesis and post-spawning. Treatment of fish with estradiol-17\u03b2 (\u03952) resulted in an increase in gpr54-1 and gpr54-2 expression in the brain of sapphire devil.

Since the use of carbohydrates is an economic and sustainable alternative for a protein-sparing effect, the study of how this macronutrient affects the welfare of carnivorous species must be studied. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of different types and levels of carbohydrates on common dentex oxidative status. Nine isonitrogenous (43%) and isoenergetic (22\u00a0MJ\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) diets were formulated combining three types (pregelatinized starch-PS, dextrin-Dx and maltodextrin-Mx) and three levels (12, 18 and 24%) of carbohydrates. The activities of catalase-CAT, superoxide dismutase-SOD, glutathione peroxidase-GPX, glutathione reductase-GR and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase-G6PDH, SOD isoenzymatic profile, lipid peroxidation-LPO and protein oxidation-PO were determined in liver and white muscle. SOD and CAT were not affected. GPX in liver and white muscle and GR in liver increased at higher inclusion carbohydrates levels. The lowest levels of GR and G6PDH in both tissues and LPO in liver were observed in maltodextrin groups. No significant effects by carbohydrate source were observed in liver PO and white muscle LPO. Regarding carbohydrate level effect, 18% and 24% dietary inclusion level decreased LPO in white muscle and PO in liver. LPO in liver was also decreased at 24% inclusion level. Altogether, results indicate the use of carbohydrates as an alternative energy source does not produce negative effects on oxidative status of common dentex, on the contrary, even contribute to their oxidative protection.",

     "abstract": "Thyroid hormones are involved in many developmental and physiological processes, including osmoregulation. The regulation of the thyroid system by environmental salinity in the euryhaline gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) is still poorly characterized. To this end seabreams were exposed to four different environmental salinities (5, 15, 40 and 55\u00a0ppt) for 14\u00a0days, and plasma free thyroid hormones (fT3, fT4), outer ring deiodination and Na+/K+-ATPase activities in gills and kidney, as well as other osmoregulatory and metabolic parameters were measured. Low salinity conditions (5\u00a0ppt) elicited a significant increase in fT3 (29%) and fT4 (184%) plasma concentrations compared to control animals (acclimated to 40\u00a0ppt, natural salinity conditions in the Bay of C\u00e1diz, Spain), while the amount of pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone subunit \u03b2 (tshb) transcript abundance remained unchanged. In addition, plasma fT4 levels were positively correlated to renal and branchial deiodinase type 2 (dio2) mRNA expression. Gill and kidney T4-outer ring deiodination activities correlated positively with dio2 mRNA expression and the highest values were observed in fish acclimated to low salinities (5 and 15\u00a0ppt). The high salinity (55\u00a0ppt) exposure caused a significant increase in tshb expression (65%), but deiodinase gene expression (dio1 and dio2) and activity did not change and were similar to controls (40\u00a0ppt). In conclusion, acclimation to different salinities led to changes in the peripheral regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism in seabream. Therefore, thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of ion transport and osmoregulatory physiology in this species. The conclusions derived from this study may also allow aquaculturists to modulate thyroid metabolism in seabream by adjusting culture salinity.",

The present study assessed the effects of hypoxic conditions (17% O2) during the plateau phase on embryonic metabolic rate, cardiovascular parameters, and development up to hatching. The study was divided into 2 experiments: (1) Control; 17% O2 for 6\u00a0h/d on E16\u2013E18 (6H), and 17% O2 for 12\u00a0h/d on E16\u2013E18 (12H), and (2) Control; 12H, and 17% O2 continuously for 72\u00a0h on E16\u2013E18, (72H). Hypoxic embryos exhibited a significant increase in heart rate and an upward trend starting on E17 in hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. We observed a decrease in metabolism in 12H and 72H embryos during the plateau period; their oxygen consumption as well as yolk consumption were lower compared to Control and they hatched with a significantly lower body temperature, indicating lower heat production. There was no evidence of adaptation or long-term effects of exposure to 17% O2 for 6\u00a0h/d. Exposure to 72\u00a0h of hypoxic conditions led to significant physiological changes and had a detrimental influence on embryonic development and growth. In contrast, exposure to 12\u00a0h/d produced moderate hypoxic changes, which helped the embryo to cope with the stress without significant influences on its growth and development. The decrease in metabolism may represent a metabolic adaptation through a decrease in resting metabolic rate and lower heat production. Such alterations may affect post-hatch performance and energy allocation between maintenance and growth, especially under stress when there is increased oxygen demand.",

     "abstract": "Many organisms face energetic trade-offs between defense against parasites and other host processes that may determine overall consequences of infection. These trade-offs may be particularly evident during unfavorable environmental conditions or energetically demanding life history stages. Amphibian metamorphosis, an ecologically important developmental period, is associated with drastic morphological and physiological changes and substantial energetic costs. Effects of the trematode parasite Echinostoma trivolvis have been documented during early amphibian development, but effects during later development and metamorphosis are largely unknown. Using a laboratory experiment, we examined the energetic costs of late development and metamorphosis coupled with E. trivolvis infection in wood frogs, Lithobates [=\u00a0Rana] sylvaticus. Echinostoma infection intensity did not differ between tadpoles examined prior to and after completing metamorphosis, suggesting that metacercariae were retained through metamorphosis. Infection with E. trivolvis contributed to a slower growth rate and longer development period prior to the initiation of metamorphosis. In contrast, E. trivolvis infection did not affect energy expenditure during late development or metamorphosis. Possible explanations for these results include the presence of parasites not interfering with pronephros degradation during metamorphosis or the mesonephros compensating for any parasite damage. Overall, the energetic costs of metamorphosis for wood frogs were comparable to other species with similar life history traits, but differed from a species with a much shorter duration of metamorphic climax. Our findings contribute to understanding the possible role of energetic trade-offs between parasite defense and host processes by considering parasite infection with simultaneous energetic demands during a sensitive period of development.",

Data of HR (with subcutaneous electrodes) and V \u0307 O 2 (by an open-flow methodology) were collected simultaneously on chicken embryos close to end-incubation. Over the last four days of incubation (E16\u2013E20) differences in HR contributed about 30% of the differences in resting V \u0307 O 2 among embryos. At E20, progressive cooling from 38 to 8\u00a0\u00b0C decreased V \u0307 O 2 entirely because of the decrease in HR, with minimal compensation of the \u2018not-HR\u2019 component. The same pattern during cooling occurred in younger embryos (age E16), in E20 embryos simultaneously exposed to hypoxia (15% O2) and in E20 normoxic embryos which were incubated in hypoxia (15% O2). Differently, in E20 embryos in normothermia, progressive hypoxia (15%, 10% or 5% O2) lowered V \u0307 O 2 largely because of the reduction in the \u2018not-HR\u2019 component. We conclude that at end incubation during hypometabolism the changes in HR contribute very differently to the decrease in V \u0307 O 2 , from about the totality of it during cold to only about 10\u201320% during hypoxia, depending on its severity. It follows that during cold-hypometabolism, but not during hypoxic hypometabolism, the changes in HR are a good index of the changes in V \u0307 O 2 . The close relationship between V \u0307 O 2 and HR during cold-hypometabolism may permit estimates of the changes in V \u0307 O 2 from the changes in HR in infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.",

This study explored the effects of environmental salinity on apical morphologies of ionocytes and the expression of villin homologs in the gills of milkfish acclimated to either seawater (SW) or fresh water (FW). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the ionocytes in the gill filaments of SW and FW milkfish, respectively, cellular apical morphologies were hole-type and squint-type. The flat-type ionocytes were observed in the gill lamellae of FW milkfish. Furthermore, apical surfaces of some lamellar ionocytes exhibited microvilli. Villin 1 is a microvilli marker expressed in the epithelial cells of various vertebrates. In the phylogenetic tree of villin 1 homologs, primitive teleosts exhibit villin 1-like (VILL) and villin 1 proteins. Two mRNA sequences, villin 1 and VILL, were identified from the milkfish transcriptome by next generation sequencing. Low but constant expression of villin 1 (gene and protein) was observed in the gills for both SW and FW fish. VILL gene and protein expression levels in the gills were higher in FW fish, compared to SW fish. Double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that VILL protein was present in some lamellar ionocytes of FW milkfish, but not in the filament ionocytes of either FW or SW milkfish. Taken together, these findings indicated that the VILL expression of ionocytes is hypoosmotic-dependent. The VILL might be involved in the formation of microvilli in the lamellar ionocytes for hyperosmoregulation of the milkfish.",

Correspondingly, the giraffe should have an unstratified rumen content and an even rumen papillation pattern. Digesta samples were collected from along the digestive tract of 27 wild-caught giraffes kept in bomas for up to 2\u00a0months, and 10 giraffes kept in zoological gardens throughout their lives. Samples were analysed for concentration of dry matter, fibre fractions, volatile fatty acids and NH3, as well as mean particle size and pH. There was no difference between the dorsal and ventral rumen region in any of these parameters, indicating homogenous rumen content in the giraffes. In addition to the digesta samples, samples of dorsal rumen, ventral rumen and atrium ruminis mucosa were collected and the papillary surface enlargement factor was determined, as a proxy for content stratification. The even rumen papillation pattern observed also supported the concept of an unstratified rumen content in giraffes. Zoo giraffes had a slightly more uneven papillation pattern than boma giraffes. This finding could not be matched by differences in physical characteristics of the rumen content, probably due to an influence of fasting time ante mortem on these parameters.",

Reptilian embryos can be subjected to natural hypoxia due to nesting strategy, and recent studies have been important in establishing the phenotypic responses of several species to low developmental oxygen. In particular, the cardiovascular responses of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) to low developmental oxygen have been detailed, including a substantial cardiac enlargement that may support a higher mass specific metabolic rate. However, embryo mass-specific metabolic demands of hypoxic incubated alligator embryos have not been measured. In this study, alligator eggs were incubated in 10% O2 (H) or 21% O2 (N) environments for the entire course of embryonic development. Acute metabolic measures in 21% and 10% O2 were taken for both H and N groups. We hypothesized that acute 10% O2 exposure has no impact on metabolic rate of embryonic alligators, and that metabolic rate is unaffected by chronic hypoxic incubation when studied in embryos measured at 21% O2. Our findings suggest phenotypic changes resulting from hypoxic incubation early in incubation, in particular relative cardiac enlargement, enable embryonic alligators to sustain metabolic rate during acute hypoxic exposure.",

     "abstract": "Estradiol (E2) can bind to nuclear estrogen receptors (ESR) or membrane estrogen receptors (GPER). While mammals possess two nuclear ESRs and one membrane GPER, the European eel, like most other teleosts, has three nuclear ESRs and two membrane GPERs, as the result of a teleost specific genome duplication. In the current study, the expression of the three nuclear ESRs (ESR1, ESR2a and ESR2b) and the two membrane GPERs (GPERa and GPERb) in the brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis of the European eel was measured, throughout spermatogenesis.The eels were first transferred from freshwater (FW) to seawater (SW), inducing parallel increases in E2 plasma levels and the expression of ESRs. This indicates that salinity has a stimulatory effect on the E2 signalling pathway along the BPG axis.Stimulation of sexual maturation by weekly injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induced a progressive decrease in E2 plasma levels, and different patterns of expression of ESRs and GPERs in the BPG axis. The expression of nuclear ESRs increased in some parts of the brain, suggesting a possible upregulation due to a local production of E2. In the testis, the highest expression levels of the nuclear ESRs were observed at the beginning of spermatogenesis, possibly mediating the role of E2 as spermatogonia renewal factor, followed by a sharply decrease in the expression of ESRs. Conversely, there was a marked increase observed in the expression of both membrane GPERs throughout spermatogenesis, suggesting they play a major role in the final stages of spermatogenesis.",

In the tibia, the scolopidial subgenual organ (~\u00a040 scolopidial sensilla), distal organ (~\u00a020 scolopidial sensilla), and distal tibial chordotonal organ (~\u00a07 scolopidial sensilla) are present. We study the sensitivity of tibial sensory organs in all leg pairs to vibration stimuli as sensory thresholds by recording summed action potentials from Nervus cruris in the femur. The tibia was stimulated with a minishaker delivering vibrational stimuli. Because different experimental procedures may affect the vibration sensitivity, we here analysed possible effects of different experimental conditions: (1) the stimulus direction delivered in either horizontal or vertical direction to the leg; (2) recording responses only from the subgenual organ complex after ablation of the distal tibial chordotonal organ, and (3) the attachment of the leg to the minishaker by plastilin, beeswax-colophony, or freely standing legs. The tibial scolopidial organs give summed responses to vibration stimuli with highest sensitivity between 500 and 1000\u00a0Hz for all leg pairs. In the different experimental series, we find that (1) thresholds were influenced by stimulation direction with lower thresholds in response to vertical vibrations, (2) ablating the distal tibial chordotonal organ by cutting the distal-most tibia did not change the summed sensory thresholds significantly, and (3) the attachment material between legs and the minishaker (plastilin or beeswax-colophony mixture) did not significant influence the sensory thresholds against free-standing tarsi. The distal tibial chordotonal organ is a connective chordotonal organ attached to a tendon and is likely a proprioceptive organ. These results emphasise that vibrational thresholds are mainly direction-sensitive. Thus, the direction of stimulus delivery during electrophysiological recordings is relevant for comparisons of vibratory sensory thresholds.",

Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT; EC 2.3.1.15) catalyzes the addition of fatty acyl CoA to the sn-1 position of glycerol-3-phosphate, in what is considered the rate-limiting step in phospholipid biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial volume density increases in oxidative skeletal muscle but not liver of Gasterosteus aculeatus (threespine stickleback) in response to cold acclimation. We hypothesized that maximal activity of GPAT would increase in oxidative skeletal muscle but not liver during cold acclimation, coinciding with mitochondrial biogenesis. GPAT activity was measured in liver and oxidative skeletal (pectoral adductor) muscle of threespine stickleback acclimated to 8\u00a0\u00b0C or 20\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, mRNA levels of enzymes involved in phospholipid synthesis, including cytidine diphosphodiacylglycerol synthase-1 (CDS1), CDS2, GPAT1, GPAT2 and 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase-2 (AGPAT2), were quantified in liver and pectoral muscle of stickleback harvested during cold acclimation. GPAT activity and transcript levels of AGPAT2 increased in response to cold acclimation in pectoral muscle but not liver. Transcript levels of GPAT1 increased in liver but not pectoral muscle. Overall our results suggest that the activity of GPAT, and possibly AGPAT as well, increase during cold acclimation and may contribute to mitochondrial phospholipid biosynthesis required for mitochondrial biogenesis.",

The Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC), a SLC12A family protein that transports Na+, K+ and 2Cl\u2212 into cells, is essential for cell ionic and osmotic regulation. To better understand the role of NKCC in the molt osmoregulation, we cloned and characterized a NKCC gene from the mud crab, Scylla paramamosain (designated as SpNKCC). The predicted SpNKCC protein is well conserved, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that this protein was clustered with crustacean NKCC. Expression of SpNKCC was detected in all the tissues examined but was highest in the posterior gills. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that posterior gills had a thick type of epithelium for ion regulation while the anterior gills possessed a thin phenotype related to gas exchange. During the molting cycle, hemolymph osmolality and ion concentrations (Na+ and Cl\u2212) increased significantly over the postmolt period, remained stable in the intermolt and premolt stages and then decreased at ecdysis. Meanwhile, the expression of SpNKCC mRNA was significantly elevated (26.7 to 338.8-fold) at the ion re-establishing stages (postmolt) as compared with baseline molt level. This pattern was consistent with the coordinated regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b1-subunit (NKA \u03b1), carbonic anhydrase cytoplasmic (CAc) isoform and Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) genes in the posterior gills. These data suggest that SpNKCC may be important in mediating branchial ion uptake during the molt cycle, especially at the postmolt stages.",

Although some studies have focused on the interaction between CCK and trypsin in marine fish larvae, little is known about the circadian patterns of the regulatory mechanism involving these two digestive components. In this study, we took advantage of the characteristic change from a diurnal to a nocturnal feeding habit that occurs in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) post-larvae, to conduct an experiment where larvae and postlarvae were submitted to three different feeding regimes from mouth opening: continuous feeding, diurnal feeding and nocturnal feeding. The aim was to establish different daily feeding scenarios to uncover the operating mechanisms of CCK and tryptic enzyme activity over the 24-hour\u00a0cycle to better understand the regulation of digestion in developing fish larvae. Results show a prevalence of simultaneous and opposing trends of CCK level and tryptic activity as a function of the postprandial time. This finding supports the existence of a regulatory loop between these two digestive components in pre- and post-metamorphic Senegal sole larvae. In addition, CCK level was also modulated by the gut content, tending to be lower when the gut is full and higher when is being emptied. Furthermore, larvae were able to synchronize digestive functions to very different feeding regimes, although it seems to be important having a diurnal feeding phase during pre-metamorphic stages for a proper development.",

     "abstract": "The larvae of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti normally inhabit freshwater (FW) where they face dilution of body fluids by osmotic influx of water. In response, the physiological actions of the anal papillae result in ion uptake while the Malpighian tubules and rectum work in concert to excrete excess water. In an apparent paradox, the anal papillae express aquaporins (AQPs) and are sites of water permeability which, if AQPs are expressed by the epithelium, apparently exaggerates the influx of water from their dilute environment. Recently, naturally breeding populations of A. aegypti were found in brackish water (BW), an environment which limits the osmotic gradient. Given that salinization of FW is an emerging environmental issue and that these larvae would presumably need to adjust to these changing conditions, this study investigates the expression of AQPs in the anal papillae and their response to rearing in hypo-osmotic and near isosmotic conditions. Transcripts of all six Aedes AQP homologs were detectable in the anal papillae and the transcript abundance of three AQP homologs in the papillae was different between rearing conditions. Using custom made antibodies, expression of two of these AQP homologs (AQP4 and AQP5) was localized to the syncytial epithelium of the anal papillae. Furthermore, the changes in transcript abundance of these two AQPs between the rearing conditions, were manifested at the protein level. Results suggest that AQP4 and AQP5 play an important physiological role in larval responses to changes in environmental salinity.",

Fracture risk is related to a decrease in bone strength, which can be affected by bone metabolism and the quality of the bone. To investigate the cause of the increased fracture rate in patients with diabetes through analyses of bone metabolism and bone matrix protein properties, we used goldfish scales as a bone model for hyperglycemia. Using the scales of seven alloxan-treated and seven vehicle-treated control goldfish, we assessed bone metabolism by analyzing the activity of marker enzymes and mRNA expression of marker genes, and we measured the change in molecular weight of scale matrix proteins with SDS-PAGE. After only a 2-week exposure to hyperglycemia, the molecular weight of \u03b1- and \u03b2-fractions of bone matrix collagen proteins changed incrementally in the regenerating scales of hyperglycemic goldfish compared with those of euglycemic goldfish. In addition, the relative ratio of the \u03b3-fraction significantly increased, and a \u03b4-fraction appeared after adding glyceraldehyde\u2014a candidate for the formation of advanced glycation end products in diabetes\u2014to isolated type 1 collagen in vitro. The enzymatic activity and mRNA expression of osteoblast and osteoclast markers were not significantly different between hyperglycemic and euglycemic goldfish scales. These results indicate that hyperglycemia is likely to affect bone quality through glycation of matrix collagen from an early stage of hyperglycemia. Therefore, non-enzymatic glycation of collagen fibers in bone matrix may lead to the deterioration of bone quality from the onset of diabetes.",

     "abstract": "Leptin directly regulates kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamus and gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary, making it a central player in the onset of mammalian puberty. Recently, we identified two leptin genes (lepa and lepb) and a single leptin receptor (lepr) in the marine perciform fish chub mackerel; however, the expression of these genes did not correlate with the expression of important reproductive genes or ovarian stage during female puberty. Here, we expand upon these initial observations by evaluating the expression of lepa, lepb, and lepr during pubertal transition and under differential feeding conditions in the male chub mackerel. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that lepa was primarily expressed in the liver of pubertal and gonadal recrudescence adults, as well as in the brain of adult fish; lepb was primarily expressed in the brain of all fish tested; and lepr was widely expressed in a variety of tissues. qRT-PCR analyses revealed significant increases in the hepatic expression of lepa in accordance with testicular stage, whereas pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh\u03b2) expression increased in unison with hepatic lepa. In contrast, expression of both brain lepa and lepb dramatically decreased during pubertal transition, with brain kisspeptin 1 (kiss1) expression strongly correlating with leptin expression patterns. In pre-pubertal males, lepa, lepb, and lper gene expression in the brain, pituitary gland, and liver decreased in fish given a high feed diet, relative to the controlled feeding group. Taken together, these results indicate high sexual specificity of leptin expression, suggesting a possible role for leptin signaling in endocrine and neuroendocrine functions during spermatogenesis in the pubertal male chub mackerel.",

     "abstract": "The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is reported to be anoxia-tolerant and if the tolerance mechanism is similar to that of the anoxia-tolerant painted turtle, GABA should play an important role. A potentially confounding factor investigating the role of GABA in anoxia tolerance are reports that GABA has both inhibitory and excitatory effects within L. stagnalis central ganglion. We therefore set out to determine if seasonality or photoperiod has an impact on: 1) the anoxia-tolerance of the intact pond snail, and 2) the response of isolated neuroganglia cluster F neurons to exogenous GABA application. L. stagnalis maintained on a natural summer light cycle were unable to survive any period of anoxic exposure, while those maintained on a natural winter light cycle survived a maximum of 4\u00a0h. Using intracellular sharp electrode recordings from pedal ganglia cluster F neurons we show that there is a photoperiod dependent shift in the response to GABA. Snails exposed to a 16\u00a0h:8\u00a0h light:dark cycle in an environmental chamber (induced summer phenotype) exhibited hyperpolarizing inhibitory responses and those exposed to a 8\u00a0h:16\u00a0h light:dark cycle (induced winter phenotype) exhibited depolarizing excitatory responses to GABA application. Using gramicidin-perforated patch recordings we also found a photoperiod dependent shift in the reversal potential for GABA. We conclude that the opposing responses of L. stagnalis central neurons to GABA results from a shift in intracellular chloride concentration that is photoperiod dependent and is likely mediated through the relative efficacy of cation chloride co-transporters. Although the physiological ramifications of the photoperiod dependent shift are unknown this work potentially has important implications for the impact of artificial light pollution on animal health.",

Embryonic energy utilization under different temperatures is an important area of research in light of the changing global climate. Therefore, we examined percent lipid content and fatty acid profiles of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) throughout embryonic development at three incubation temperatures. We sampled fertilized eggs and embryos at gastrulation, eyed and fin flutter stages following chronic incubation at temperatures of 1.8, 4.9 and 8.0\u00a0\u00b0C. Hatchlings were also sampled following incubation at temperatures of 3.3, 4.9 and 8.0\u00a0\u00b0C. Fertilized eggs had an initial high percentage of dry mass composed of lipid (percent lipid content; ~\u00a029%) consisting of ~\u00a020% saturated fatty acids (SFA), ~\u00a032% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), ~\u00a044% polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and 4% unidentified. The most abundant fatty acids were 16:0, 16:1, 18:1(n-9c), 20:4(n-6), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). This lipid profile matches that of other cold-water fish species. Percent lipid content increased during embryonic development, suggesting protein or other yolk components were preferentially used for energy. Total percentage of MUFA decreased during development, which indicated MUFA were the primary lipid catabolized for energy during embryonic development. Total percentage of PUFA increased during development, driven largely by an increase in 22:6(n-3). Temperature did not influence percent lipid content or percent MUFA at any development stage, and had inconsistent effects on percent SFA and percent PUFA during development. Thus, lake whitefish embryos appear to be highly adapted to low temperatures, and do not alter lipids in response to temperature within their natural incubation conditions.",

Sperm motility was measured using a CASA system, intracellular K+ and pH were measured by flow cytometry, and sperm head area was measured by ASMA: Automated Sperm Morphometry Analyses. Sperm motility was notably inhibited by the removal of K+ from the seminal plasma and by treatment with the K+ ionophore valinomycin. This therefore indicates that a reduction of K+ levels in the quiescent stage inhibits further motility. The normal decrease in sperm head area induced by seawater activation was altered by the removal of K+ from the seminal plasma, and an increase in the pHi in the quiescent stage was also induced. Intracellular pH (pHi) was quantitatively measured for the first time in European eel spermatozoa, being 7.2 in the quiescent stage and 7.1 post-activation. Intracellular and external pH levels influenced sperm motility both in the quiescent stage and at activation. The alkalinization of the pHi (by NH4Cl) inhibited sperm motility activation, while acidification (by Na-acetate) did not have any effect. Our results indicate that a pH gradient between the sperm cell and the seminal plasma is necessary for sperm motility activation. The presence of the ion K+ in the seminal plasma (or in the extender medium) is necessary in order to maintain sperm volume, intracellular pH and sperm motility.",

The impact of Bd varies, with some species being more susceptible to infection than others. Recent evidence has shown that Bd can have sub-lethal effects, whereby increases in stress hormones have been associated with infection. Could this increased stress response, which is a physiological adaptation that provides an increased resilience against Bd infection, potentially be a trade-off with important life-history traits such as reproduction? We studied this question in adult male frogs of a non-declining species (Litoria wilcoxii). Frogs were sampled for (1) seasonal hormone (testosterone and corticosterone), color and disease profiles, (2) the relationship between disease infection status and hormone levels or dorsal color, (3) subclinical effects of Bd by investigating disease load and hormone level, and (4) reproductive and stress hormone relationships independent of disease. Testosterone levels and color score varied seasonally (throughout the spring/summer months) while corticosterone levels remained stable. Frogs with high Bd prevalence had significantly higher corticosterone levels and lower testosterone levels compared to uninfected frogs, and no differences in color were observed. There was a significant positive correlation between disease load and corticosterone levels, and a significant negative relationship between disease load and testosterone. Our field data provides novel evidence that increased physiological stress response associated with Bd infection in wild frogs, could suppress reproduction by down-regulating gonadal hormones in amphibians, however the impacts on reproductive output is yet to be established.",

In this study, we have analysed the oxidative status of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), which has recently been found as the longest living vertebrate animal known to science with a lifespan of at least 272\u00a0years. As compared to other species, the Greenland shark had body mass-corrected values of muscle glutathione peroxidase and red blood cells protein carbonyls (metric of protein oxidative damage) above 75 percentile and below 25 percentile, respectively. None of the biochemical metrics of oxidative status measured in either skeletal muscle or red blood cells were correlated with maximum lifespan of species. We propose that the values of metrics of oxidative status we measured might be linked to ecological features (e.g., adaptation to cold waters and deep dives) of this shark species rather to its lifespan.",

     "abstract": "Mammals of the Neotropics are characterized by a marked annual cycle of activity, which is accompanied by several physiological changes at the levels of the whole organism, organs and tissues. The physiological characterization of these cycles is important, as it gives insight on the mechanisms by which animals adjust adaptively to seasonality. Here we studied the seasonal changes in blood biochemical parameters in the relict South American marsupial Dromiciops gliroides (\u201cmonito del monte\u201d or \u201clittle mountain monkey\u201d), under semi-natural conditions. We manipulated thermal conditions in order to characterize the effects of temperature and season on a battery of biochemical parameters, body mass and adiposity. Our results indicate that monitos experience an annual cycle in body mass and adiposity (measured as leptin levels), reaching a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer. Blood biochemistry confirms that the nutritional condition of animals is reduced in summer instead of winter (as generally reported). This was coincident with a reduction of several biochemical parameters in summer, such as betahydroxybutyrate, cholesterol, total protein concentration and globulins. Monitos seem to initiate winter preparation during autumn and reach maximum body reserves in winter. Hibernation lasts until spring, at which time they use fat reserves and become reproductively active. Sexual maturation during summer would be the strongest energetic bottleneck, which explains the reductions in body mass and other parameters in this season. Overall, this study suggests that monitos anticipate the cold season by a complex interaction of photoperiodic and thermal cues.",

In this study, transcripts for orexin, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART), cholecystokinin (CCK) and leptin were isolated in pacu. Orexin, CCK and leptin have widespread mRNA distributions in brain and periphery, CART is limited to the brain. To examine the role of these peptides in the regulation of feeding and energy status, mRNA expression levels were compared between fed and fasted fish and around feeding time. Both orexin and CART brain expressions were affected by fasting and displayed periprandial changes, suggesting a role in both short- and long-term regulation of feeding. CCK intestinal expression decreased in fasted fish and displayed periprandial changes, suggesting CCK acts as a peripheral satiety factor. Leptin was not affected by fasting but displayed periprandial changes, suggesting a role as a short-term regulator. To examine if these peptides are affected by diet, brain and gut expressions were assessed in fish fed with different diets containing soy protein concentrate. Food intake, weight gain and expressions of orexin, CART, CCK and leptin were little affected by replacement of fish protein with soy protein, suggesting that pacu is able to tolerate and grow well with a diet rich in plant material. Overall, our results suggest that orexin, CART, CCK and leptin are involved in the physiology of feeding of pacu and that their expressions are little affected by plant-based diets.",

Plasma osmolality was significantly elevated in cold acclimated fish and, by TEM, gill ionocytes from cold acclimated fish had significantly shorter mitochondria.

No mortality was observed in both population of Cornu aspersum, while Helix pomatia exhibited higher mortality than Helix lucorum. PO2 dropped within the first 10\u00a0days of exposure to elevated temperature in all species, although in Cornu aspersum this decrease was significantly lower. No significant reduction in the enzymatic activities of all glycolytic enzymes studied, as well as of citrate synthase (CS) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was observed in the more thermal tolerant species C. aspersum from both populations studied. Significant reductions of enzymatic activity of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and d-Lactate dehydrogenase (d-LDH) was observed in Helix lucorum and Helix pomatia. The observed inter-specific differences seem to be in accordance with the life cycle characteristics of each species and may be attributed to climatic differences among habitats within their distribution range.",

Sustained exercise at 15, 30 and 45\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 in a swim tunnel caused significant increases in fAB and fH, from approximately 5\u00a0breaths\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01 and 60\u00a0heartbeats\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 at the lowest speed, to over 60\u00a0breaths\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01 and 100\u00a0beats\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 at the highest, respectively. There was a progressive decline in the degree of variation in fH, around each AB, as fAB increased with exercise intensity. Total autonomic blockade abolished all variation in fH during exercise, and around each AB, but fAB responses were the same as in untreated animals. Cardiac responses were exclusively due to modulation of inhibitory cholinergic tone, which varied from >\u00a0100% at the lowest speed to <\u00a010% at the highest. Cholinergic blockade had no effect on fAB compared to untreated fish. Excitatory \u03b2-adrenergic tone was approximately 20% and did not vary with swimming speed, but its blockade increased fAB at all speeds, compared to untreated animals.

     "abstract": "As human populations continue to expand, increases in coastal development have led to the alteration of much of the world's mangrove habitat, creating problems for the multitude of species that inhabit these unique ecosystems. Habitat alteration often leads to changes in habitat complexity and predation risk, which may serve as additional stressors for those species that rely on mangroves for protection from predators. However, few studies have been conducted to date to assess the effects of these specific stressors on glucocorticoid (GC) stress hormone levels in wild fish populations. Using the checkered puffer as a model, our study sought to examine the effects of physical habitat complexity and predator environment on baseline and acute stress-induced GC levels. This was accomplished by examining changes in glucose and cortisol concentrations of fish placed in artificial environments for short periods (several hours) where substrate type and the presence of mangrove roots and predator cues were manipulated. Our results suggest that baseline and stress-induced GC levels are not significantly influenced by changes in physical habitat complexity or the predator environment using the experimental protocol that we applied. Although more research is required, the current study suggests that checkered puffers may be capable of withstanding changes in habitat complexity and increases in predation risk without experiencing adverse GC-mediated physiological effects, possibly as a result of the puffers' unique morphological and chemical defenses that help them to avoid predation in the wild.",

In comparison with the first-elicited current, the current elicited by the second flash not only presents an expected smaller peak current, depending on the time between flashes, but it also displays a different latency and decay time constant. Recovery of the first flash values of these current parameters depends on the circadian time at which the experiments are conducted, and on the presence of pigment-dispersing hormone.

We tested cold or desiccation triggered changes in the accumulation or utilization of two energy metabolites (trehalose and proline) in Drosophila immigrans flies reared under season specific environmental conditions. Such D.immigrans populations were subjected to different durations of cold (0\u00a0\u00b0C) or desiccation stress (5% RH) or dual stress. We found stress induced effects of cold vs desiccation on the levels of trehalose as well as for proline. Different durations of cold stress led to accumulation of trehalose while desiccation stress durations revealed utilization of trehalose. In contrast, there was accumulation of proline under desiccation and utilization of proline with cold stress. Since accumulation levels were higher than utilization of each energy metabolite, the effects of dual stress showed additive effect. However, there was no utilization of total body lipids under cold or desiccation stress. We observed significant season specific differences in the amount of energy metabolites but the rate of metabolism did not vary across seasons. Stress triggered changes in trehalose and proline suggest possible link between desiccation and cold tolerance. Finally, stress specific (cold or desiccation) compensatory changes in the levels of trehalose and proline suggest possible energetic homeostasis in D.immigrans living under harsh climatic conditions of montane localities.",

Little is known about temperature tolerance in this species and with a rapidly changing global climate, it becomes increasingly important to define the thermal tolerance of this species to better predict population distribution. Using a modified critical thermal maximum test (CTMax), the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of heating rate (0.1, 0.2 and 0.25\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01) on the thermal tolerance, associated hematological responses, and oxygen consumption in juvenile sturgeon. In addition, transcripts associated with physiological stress and heat shock (i.e., heat shock proteins) were also measured. Heating rate did not alter the CTMax values of shortnose sturgeon. Neither heating rate nor thermal stress affected plasma sodium and chloride levels, nor the expression of transcripts that included catalase, glucocorticoid receptor, heat shock protein70 (hsp70), heat shock protein 90\u03b1 (hsp90\u03b1) and cytochrome P450 1a (cyp1a). However, regardless of heating rate, thermal stress increased both plasma potassium and lactate concentrations.

The reports were based, however, on indirect analyses performed on logarithmic transformations of the original data. I re-examined values for FMR and body mass for 114 species of mammal by the conventional approach to allometric analysis (to illustrate why the approach is unreliable) and by linear and nonlinear regression on untransformed variables (to illustrate the power and versatility of newer analytical methods). The best of the regression models fitted directly to untransformed observations is a three-parameter power equation with multiplicative, lognormal, heteroscedastic error and an allometric exponent of 0.82. The mean function is a good fit to data in graphical display. The significant intercept in the model may simply have gone undetected in prior analyses because conventional allometry assumes implicitly that the intercept is zero; or the intercept may be a spurious finding resulting from bias introduced by the haphazard sampling that underlies \u201cexploratory\u201d analyses like the one reported here. The aforementioned issues can be resolved only by gathering new data specifically intended to address the question of scaling of FMR with body mass in mammals.

     "abstract": "In decapod crustaceans, molting is controlled by the pulsatile release of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) from neurosecretory cells in the X-organ/sinus gland (XO/SG) complex in the eyestalk ganglia (ESG). A drop in MIH release triggers molting by activating the molting gland or Y-organ (YO). Post-transcriptional mechanisms ultimately control MIH levels in the hemolymph. Neurotransmitter-mediated electrical activity controls Ca2\u00a0+-dependent vesicular release of MIH from the SG axon terminals, which may be modulated by nitric oxide (NO). In green shore crab, Carcinus maenas, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) protein and NO are present in the SG. Moreover, C. maenas are refractory to eyestalk ablation (ESA), suggesting other regions of the nervous system secrete sufficient amounts of MIH to prevent molting. By contrast, ESA induces molting in the blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis. Double-label immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to localize and quantify MIH and NOS proteins and transcripts, respectively, in the ESG, brain, and thoracic ganglion (TG) of C. maenas and G. lateralis. In ESG, MIH- and NOS-immunopositive cells were closely associated in the SG of both species; confocal microscopy showed that NOS was localized in cells adjacent to MIH-positive axon terminals. In brain, MIH-positive cells were located in a small number of cells in the olfactory lobe; no NOS immunofluorescence was detected. In TG, MIH and NOS were localized in cell clusters between the segmental nerves. In G. lateralis, Gl-MIH and Gl-crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) mRNA levels were ~\u00a0105-fold higher in ESG than in brain or TG of intermolt animals, indicating that the ESG is the primary source of these neuropeptides. Gl-NOS and Gl-elongation factor (EF2) mRNA levels were also higher in the ESG. Molt stage had little or no effect on CHH, NOS, NOS-interacting protein (NOS-IP), membrane Guanylyl Cyclase-II (GC-II), and NO-independent GC-III expression in the ESG of both species. By contrast, MIH and NO receptor GC-I beta subunit (GC-I\u03b2) transcripts were increased during premolt and postmolt stages in G. lateralis, but not in C. maenas. MIH immunopositive cells in the brain and TG may be a secondary source of MIH; the release of MIH from these sources may contribute to the difference between the two species in response to ESA. The MIH-immunopositive cells in the TG may be the source of an MIH-like factor that mediates molt inhibition by limb bud autotomy. The association of MIH- and NOS-labeled cells in the ESG and TG suggests that NO may modulate MIH release. A model is proposed in which NO-dependent activation of GC-I inhibits Ca2\u00a0+-dependent fusion of MIH vesicles with the nerve terminal membrane; the resulting decrease in MIH activates the YO and the animal enters premolt.",

To dissect how this lizard mediate metabolism to adapt various season, the preferred body temperature (Tb), standard metabolic rate (SMR), mitochondrial respiration rates and activities of four metabolic enzymes in this species were tested in different seasons (spring, summer, and autumn). The results showed that the preferred Tb was the lowest in spring and the highest in summer. SMR, maximal mitochondrial respiration rates in liver and skeletal muscle were the highest in spring. Similarly, higher activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities of liver and skeletal muscle were observed in spring.

     "abstract": "The doubly-labelled water (DLW) method provides the ability to measure the energy expenditure of free-living animals based only on the injection of two isotopes in water (one of oxygen and one of hydrogen) and traditionally the collection of 2 blood samples. We review here the fundamental basis of how the method works, and highlight how the choice of the appropriate calculation equation can have a large impact on the resultant estimates, particularly in species where the difference between the isotope elimination constants is small. This knowledge is not new, but is worth reiterating given the potential for error by making the wrong choice. In particular, it is important to remember that for mammals weighing less than 5\u00a0kg, and birds weighing less than 2\u00a0kg, the single pool models perform best in validation studies, while in mammals above 15\u00a0kg the two-pool models perform best. Above 2\u00a0kg in birds and between 5 and 15\u00a0kg in mammals, however, the model superiority is uncertain. Even where the choice based on body mass would appear clear, the decision may need to be tempered by species specific information regarding potential additional sources for hydrogen turnover, such as de novo lipogenesis or methanogenesis. Recent advances in the technique have included attempts to make the method less invasive by using innovative methods for dosing and sample collection. In addition, the advent of laser spectroscopy, as a replacement technology for mass spectrometry, may open up many new opportunities in the field. These potentially include direct sampling of breath in the field and tracking background isotope drift using 17oxygen levels.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic costs are central to individual energy budgets, making estimates of metabolic rate vital to understanding how an organism interacts with its environment as well as the role of species in their ecosystem. Despite the ecological and commercial importance of fishes, there are currently no widely adopted means of measuring field metabolic rate in fishes. The lack of recognized methods is in part due to the logistical difficulties of measuring metabolic rates in free swimming fishes. However, further development and refinement of techniques applicable for field-based studies on free swimming animals would greatly enhance the capacity to study fish under environmentally relevant conditions. In an effort to foster discussion in this area, from field ecologists to biochemists alike, we review aspects of energy metabolism and give details on approaches that have been used to estimate energetic parameters in fishes. In some cases, the techniques have been applied to field conditions; while in others, the methods have been primarily used on laboratory held fishes but should be applicable, with validation, to fishes in their natural environment. Limitations, experimental considerations and caveats of these measurements and the study of metabolism in wild fishes in general are also discussed. Potential novel approaches to FMR estimates are also presented for consideration. The innovation of methods for measuring field metabolic rate in free-ranging wild fish would revolutionize the study of physiological ecology.",

     "abstract": "The generalized energy budget for fish (i.e., Energy Consumed\u00a0=\u00a0Metabolism\u00a0+\u00a0Waste\u00a0+\u00a0Growth) is as relevant today as when it was first proposed decades ago and serves as a foundational concept in fish biology. Yet, generating accurate measurements of components of the bioenergetics equation in wild fish is a major challenge. How often does a fish eat and what does it consume? How much energy is expended on locomotion? How do human-induced stressors influence energy acquisition and expenditure? Generating answers to these questions is important to fisheries management and to our understanding of adaptation and evolutionary processes. The advent of electronic tags (transmitters and data loggers) has provided biologists with improved opportunities to understand bioenergetics in wild fish. Here, we review the growing diversity of electronic tags with a focus on sensor-equipped devices that are commercially available (e.g., heart rate/electrocardiogram, electromyogram, acceleration, image capture). Next, we discuss each component of the bioenergetics model, recognizing that most research to date has focused on quantifying the activity component of metabolism, and identify ways in which the other, less studied components (e.g., consumption, specific dynamic action component of metabolism, somatic growth, reproductive investment, waste) could be estimated remotely. We conclude with a critical but forward-looking appraisal of the opportunities and challenges in using existing and emerging electronic sensor-tags for the study of fish energetics in the wild. Electronic tagging has become a central and widespread tool in fish ecology and fisheries management; the growing and increasingly affordable toolbox of sensor tags will ensure this trend continues, which will lead to major advances in our understanding of fish biology over the coming decades.",

The purpose of this article is to review the importance of making physiological measurements on diving animals in field settings, while acknowledging the challenges and highlighting some solutions. The most extreme divers are great candidates for study, especially in a comparative and mechanistic context. However, physiological data are also required of a wide range of species for problems relating to other disciplines, in particular ecology and conservation biology. Physiological data help with understanding and predicting the outcomes of environmental change, and the direct impacts of anthropogenic activities. Methodological approaches that have facilitated the development of field-based diving physiology include the isolated diving hole protocol and the translocation paradigm, and while there are many techniques for remote observation, animal-borne biotelemetry, or \u201cbiologging\u201d, has been critical. We discuss issues related to the attachment of instruments, the retrieval of data and sensing of physiological variables, while also considering negative impacts of tagging. This is illustrated with examples from a variety of species, and an in-depth look at one of the best studied and most extreme divers, the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri).

     "abstract": "Animals' abilities to fly long distances and dive to profound depths fascinate earthbound researchers. Due to the difficulty of making direct measurements during flying and diving, many researchers resort to modeling so as to estimate metabolic rate during each of those activities in the wild, but those models can be inaccurate. Fortunately, the miniaturization, customization and commercialization of biologgers has allowed researchers to increasingly follow animals on their journeys, unravel some of their mysteries and test the accuracy of biomechanical models. I provide a review of the measurement of flying and diving metabolic rate in the wild, paying particular attention to mass loss, doubly-labelled water, heart rate and accelerometry. Biologgers can impact animal behavior and influence the very measurements they are designed to make, and I provide seven guidelines for the ethical use of biologgers. If biologgers are properly applied, quantification of metabolic rate across a range of species could produce robust allometric relationships that could then be generally applied. As measuring flying and diving metabolic rate in captivity is difficult, and often not directly translatable to field conditions, I suggest that applying multiple techniques in the field to reinforce one another may be a viable alternative. The coupling of multi-sensor biologgers with biomechanical modeling promises to improve precision in the measurement of flying and diving metabolic rate in wild animals.",

     "abstract": "Infrared thermography is a non-invasive technique that measures mid to long-wave infrared radiation emanating from all objects and converts this to temperature. As an imaging technique, the value of modern infrared thermography is its ability to produce a digitized image or high speed video rendering a thermal map of the scene in false colour. Since temperature is an important environmental parameter influencing animal physiology and metabolic heat production an energetically expensive process, measuring temperature and energy exchange in animals is critical to understanding physiology, especially under field conditions. As a non-contact approach, infrared thermography provides a non-invasive complement to physiological data gathering. One caveat, however, is that only surface temperatures are measured, which guides much research to those thermal events occurring at the skin and insulating regions of the body. As an imaging technique, infrared thermal imaging is also subject to certain uncertainties that require physical modelling, which is typically done via built-in software approaches. Infrared thermal imaging has enabled different insights into the comparative physiology of phenomena ranging from thermogenesis, peripheral blood flow adjustments, evaporative cooling, and to respiratory physiology. In this review, I provide background and guidelines for the use of thermal imaging, primarily aimed at field physiologists and biologists interested in thermal biology. I also discuss some of the better known approaches and discoveries revealed from using thermal imaging with the objective of encouraging more quantitative assessment.",

     "abstract": "The recently introduced technique of measuring corticosterone in feathers currently provides the longest-term measure of corticosterone in birds. This review examines the strengths, weaknesses, and unresolved technical issues of the feather corticosterone technique. Feather corticosterone's major strengths are that it provides: a retrospective assessment of corticosterone physiology, including information from absent (unseen) or dead (e.g. museum specimens) individuals; a long-term measure of corticosterone exposure over the period of feather growth (days\u2013weeks), integrating both baseline and responses to stressors; and flexible, minimally-invasive, sampling. However, researchers considering this technique should be aware of its limitations. Feather corticosterone only reflects hormone exposure during feather growth and, when sampling during molt, corticosterone titers and ecological conditions may not be representative of the majority of the annual cycle. Synchronization of molt is often unknown for a population, requiring assumptions when making inter-individual comparisons. Additionally, unresolved technical issues include: assessing whether corticosterone is the only hormone measured by assays; determining deposition dynamics to fully understand connections between feather and plasma corticosterone titers; studying the longevity and stability of corticosterone in the feather; establishing the impact of feather size and color on corticosterone deposition; and understanding the causes and implications of corticosterone variation along the length of the feather. Notwithstanding the above limitations and technical challenges, determining corticosterone titers in feathers is proving to be a useful technique for exploring some ecological and physiological correlates in individual birds. Given the unique perspective that feather corticosterone offers, we suggest that this measure complement, not replace, plasma measurements.",

     "abstract": "Biomineral chemistry is frequently used to infer life history events and habitat use in fishes; however, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we have taken a multidisciplinary approach to review the current understanding of element incorporation into biomineralized structures in fishes. Biominerals are primarily composed of calcium-based derivatives such as calcium carbonate found in otoliths and calcium phosphates found in scales, fins and bones. By focusing on non-essential life elements (strontium and barium) and essential life elements (calcium, zinc and magnesium), we attempt to connect several fields of study to synergise how physiology may influence biomineralization and subsequent inference of life history. Data provided in this review indicate that the presence of non-essential elements in biominerals of fish is driven primarily by hypo- and hyper-calcemic environmental conditions. The uptake kinetics between environmental calcium and its competing mimics define what is ultimately incorporated in the biomineral structure. Conversely, circannual hormonally driven variations likely influence essential life elements like zinc that are known to associate with enzyme function. Environmental temperature and pH as well as uptake kinetics for strontium and barium isotopes demonstrate the role of mass fractionation in isotope selection for uptake into fish bony structures. In consideration of calcium mobilisation, the action of osteoclast-like cells on calcium phosphates of scales, fins and bones likely plays a role in fractionation along with transport kinetics. Additional investigations into calcium mobilisation are warranted to understand differing views of strontium, and barium isotope fractionation between calcium phosphates and calcium carbonate structures in fishes.",

     "abstract": "Molecular processes that either regulate ovarian atresia or are consequences of atresia are poorly understood in teleost fishes. We hypothesized that feed restriction that perturbs normal ovarian growth and induces follicular atresia would alter ovarian gene expression patterns. Previtellogenic, two-year old coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were subjected to prolonged fasting to induce atresia or maintained on a normal feeding schedule that would promote continued ovarian development. To identify genes that were specifically up- or down-regulated during oocyte growth in healthy, growing fish compared to fasted fish, reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA libraries were generated using ovaries from fed and fasted animals. Differential expression of genes identified by SSH was confirmed with quantitative PCR. The SSH library representing genes elevated in ovaries of fed fish relative to those of fasted fish contained steroidogenesis-related genes (e.g., hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase), Tgf-beta superfamily members (e.g., anti-Mullerian hormone) and cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins (e.g., type I keratin s8). Overall, these genes were associated with steroid production, cell proliferation and differentiation, and ovarian epithelialization. The library representing genes elevated in ovaries of fasted fish relative to fed fish contained genes associated with apoptosis (e.g., programmed cell death protein 4), cortical alveoli (e.g., alveolin), the zona pellucida (e.g., zona pellucida protein c), and microtubules (e.g., microtubule associated protein tau). Elevated expression of this suite of genes was likely associated with the initiation of atresia and/or a reduced rate of follicle development in response to fasting. This study revealed ovarian genes involved in normal early secondary oocyte growth and potential early markers of atresia.",

Previously, the only sHSPs that have been studied in detail in the model frog system, Xenopus laevis, were members of the HSP30 family and HSPB1 (HSP27). We now report the analysis of X. laevis HSPB6, an ortholog of mammalian HSPB6. X. laevis HSPB6 cDNA encodes a 168 aa protein that contains an \u03b1-crystallin domain, a polar C-terminal extension and some possible phosphorylation sites. X. laevis HSPB6 shares 94% identity with a X. tropicalis HSPB6, 65% with turtle, 59% with humans, 49% with zebrafish and only 50% and 43% with X. laevis HSPB1 and HSP30C, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that X. laevis HSPB6 grouped more closely with mammalian and reptilian HSPB6s than with fish HSPB6. X. laevis recombinant HSPB6 displayed molecular chaperone properties since it had the ability to inhibit heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. Immunoblot analysis determined that HSPB6 was present constitutively in kidney epithelial cells and that heat shock treatment did not upregulate HSPB6 levels. While treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, resulted in a 2-fold increase in HSPB6 levels, exposure to cadmium chloride produced a slight increase in HSPB6. These findings were in contrast to HSP70, which was enhanced in response to all three stressors. Finally, immunocytochemical analysis revealed that HSPB6 was present in the cytoplasm in the perinuclear region with some in the nucleus.",

In the tissues, wild oysters used more glycogen to promote metabolic activities by increasing the level of AEC (adenylate energy charge). The results suggest that farmed oysters might have limited ability to cope with heat stress due to low energy reserve and glycolysis activity for HSP synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence on differential responses between wild and farmed oysters to temperature and salinity changes, leading to a better understanding on the pattern of distribution for invading oyster species in the marine environment and the adaptation of marine invertebrates to the threat of climate change.",

For comparison, a second group of embryos/larvae reared in hard water (2.2\u00a0mM Na+, higher pH and [Ca2\u00a0+]) were also included in the experiment but were fluxed in soft water, only. Unidirectional rates of Na+ uptake increased throughout development and were significantly higher in embryos/larvae reared in soft water. However, the mechanisms of Na+ uptake in both groups of larvae were not significantly different, either in larvae immediately post-hatch or later in development: the broad spectrum Na+ channel blocker amiloride inhibited 85\u201390% of uptake and the Nhe-inhibitor EIPA also caused near maximal inhibitions of Na+ uptake. These data indicated Na+ uptake was Nhe-mediated in soft water. A role of Nhe3b (but not Nhe2 or Nhe3a) in Na+ uptake in soft water was also supported through gene expression analyses: expression of nhe3b increased throughout development in whole embryos/larvae in both groups and was significantly higher in those reared in soft water. This pattern of expression correlated well with measurements of Na+ uptake. Together these data indicate that in part, rainbow trout embryos/larvae reared in low Na+ soft water maintained Na+ homeostasis by an EIPA sensitive component of Na+ uptake, and support a primary role for Nhe3b.",

Some of them play a part in sperm maturation, including carbonic anhydrase which is responsible for modulating the pH of seminal plasma, and warm temperature acclimation protein, which may play an important role in the final maturation of this species, due to the warm temperature of their spawning ground (in the Sargasso Sea).Sperm samples were classified into three motility categories depending on the percentage of motile cells, I: 0\u201325%, II: 25\u201350% and III: >\u00a050%. Different protein profiles were observed depending on the sperm motility categories, specifically, with the apolipoproteins and complement C3. Higher numbers of proteins from the apolipoprotein family were registered at lower motilities; whereas the complement C3-like family was higher in the samples with the highest percentage of motile cells. These results suggest that the proteins linked to the transportation of lipids (apolipoprotein) and to the immune system (complement C3) may carry out their functions at different stages of spermatogenesis. Using SDS-PAGE analysis, 13 bands were identified, most of which migrated between 20 to 60\u00a0kDa. In the last weeks of treatment significant increases were observed in the percentage of motile spermatozoa, curvilinear velocity and beat cross frequency. This improvement in sperm quality coincided with a higher amount of proteins located at 19\u00a0KDa, therefore, this protein could be involved in sperm motility of the European eel.",

We recently demonstrated that PTTH is also present in adult Rhodnius prolixus and is released by adult brains in vitro with a clear daily rhythm during egg development. Here, we employ a well-established in vitro bioassay, to show that the daily rhythm of PTTH release by brains in vitro is under circadian control since it persists in aperiodic conditions with a free running period of around 24\u00a0h that is temperature compensated. Prolonged exposure (3\u00a0weeks) of insects to continuous constant light (LL) completely eliminated PTTH release. Subsequent transfer of such insects from LL to constant darkness (DD) rapidly induced rhythmic PTTH release, indicating that the circadian rhythm of PTTH release is induced by photic cues. Western analysis identified PTTH in the adult hemolymph, suggesting that PTTH acts as a functional neurohormone in the adult insect. Dot blot analysis revealed that PTTH levels in the hemolymph also cycled with a daily rhythm that persisted in DD and was synchronous with the rhythm of PTTH release by brains in vitro. We conclude that the previously documented photosensitive clock in the brain regulates rhythmic PTTH release and thus generates the rhythm seen in the hemolymph. These results emphasize the importance of rhythmic PTTH release in the adult insect and support a role for PTTH in adult physiology and possibly within the adult circadian system.",

     "abstract": "During the breeding season, male anuran amphibians produce advertisement calls. Androgens play a permissive role in the activation of calling activity, which is often positively correlated to androgen plasma levels and testes mass. Additionally, calling effort is also correlated to corticosterone plasma levels (hereinafter referred to as CORT), which is associated with the mobilization of energy substrates to sustain the high energy flux associated with this activity. However, high CORT also has many immunosuppressive effects and might interfere with reproduction. Consequently, CORT might mediate a compromise between reproductive effort and immunocompetence in anurans. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between calling rate, immunocompetence, and CORT in Hypsiboas albopunctatus, a midsize anuran occurring in South America. To understand these relationships, we conducted focal observations of calling behavior, followed by blood collection for CORT measurements and evaluation of some immune parameters. Our results showed that individuals with larger testes had higher calling rates, and those with higher calling rates showed lower cell-mediated immune response (swelling response to phytohaemagglutinin), although these relationships were not mediated by CORT. Furthermore, males calling early in the evening showed high CORT, and individuals with lower body condition index had higher CORT. We conclude that calling activity shows a cost in terms of cellular immune response in H. albopunctatus, but this compromise does not appear to be mediated by glucocorticoid plasma levels.",

Conversely, the specimens exposed to the low frequency band treatment showed significantly higher values of the following biochemical stress parameters measured in their plasma and tissues: glucose, total proteins, total haemocyte number (THC), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) expression, and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.The responses observed in the mussels exposed to low frequency sweeps enable us to suppose a biological and ecological role for this sound, which contains the main frequencies produced by both shipping traffic and the acoustic emissions of fish.",

To investigate the effects of random food deprivation (FD) and refeeding on energy metabolism and behavior in Apodemus chevrieri, we acclimated adult males to FD for 4\u00a0weeks, then refed them ad libitum for 4\u00a0weeks (FD-Re group). During the period of FD, animals were fed ad libitum for 4 randomly assigned days each week, and deprived of food the other 3\u00a0days. A control group was fed ad libitum for 8\u00a0weeks. At 4 and 8\u00a0weeks we measured body mass, thermogenesis, serum leptin levels, body composition, gastrointestinal tract morphology, behavior and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression. At 4\u00a0weeks, food intake, gastrointestinal mass, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) mRNA expressions increased and thermogenesis, leptin levels, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) expressions decreased in FD compared with controls. FD also showed more resting behavior and less activity than the controls on ad libitum day. There were no differences between FD-Re and controls at 8\u00a0weeks, indicating significant plasticity. These results suggested that animals can compensate for unpredictable reduction in food availability by increasing food intake and reducing energy expended through thermogenesis and activity. Leptin levels, NPY, AgRP, POMC, and CART mRNA levels may also regulate energy metabolism. Significant plasticity in energy metabolism and behavior was shown by A. chevrieri over a short timescale, allowing them to adapt to food shortages in nutritionally unpredictable environments.",

To test how H-R modulates mitochondrial function at different temperatures we measured the effects of H-R on isolated fish liver mitochondrial oxidation rates over a wide temperature range (5\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C). Subsequently, the mechanisms underlying H-R induced mitochondrial responses were examined. H-R inhibited the complex I (CI) maximal (state 3) and stimulated the basal (state 4) mitochondrial oxidation rates with temperature enhancing both effects. As a result, the thermal sensitivity (Q10) for CI maximal respiration was reduced while that for basal respiration was increased by H-R. H-R reduced both the coupling and phosphorylation efficiencies more profoundly at high temperature suggesting that mitochondria were more resistant to H-R at low temperature. The H-R induced mitochondrial impairments were associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and proton leak, dissipation of membrane potential, and loss of structural integrity of the organelles. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanisms of H-R induced mitochondrial morphofunctional disruption and shows that the moderation of effects of H-R on oxidative phosphorylation by temperature depends on the functional state.",

The requirements of protein synthesis and Na+-K+-ATPase for ATP in the cells were monitored by the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the presence of corresponding inhibitors from the peak of metabolic depression (January\u2013February) to the time of recovery from it (March\u2013April) and spawning (May). Integrity of lamprey liver cells was estimated by catalytic activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in blood plasma. In January\u2013February, the share of ATP necessary for protein synthesis was 20\u201322%, whereas before spawning it decreased to 8\u201311%. Functioning of Na+-K+-pump required 22% of cellular ATP at the peak of metabolic depression, but 38% and 62% of ATP in March\u2013April and May, respectively. Progression of prespawning period was accompanied by 3.75- and 1.6-fold rise of ALT and AST activities in blood plasma, respectively, whereas de Ritis coefficient decreased from 2.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34 to 0.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08, what indicates severe damage of hepatocyte membranes. Thus, the adaptive strategy of lamprey hepatocytes to develop metabolic depression under conditions of energy limitation is the selective production of proteins necessary for spawning, most probably vitellogenins. As spawning approaches, the maintenance of transmembrane ion gradients, membrane potential and cell volume to prevent premature cell death becomes the priority cell function.",

The aims of this study were to assess and predict the vulnerability of brindle and red lobsters to extended emersion exposure using pre- and post-emersion data which included 28 haemolymph biochemical parameters and 5 behaviour traits.No effect of lobster shell colour on haemolymph biochemistry, behaviour traits and their vulnerability to emersion was found. A combined survival of 97% after 40\u00a0h and 57% after 64\u00a0h in a first experiment, and 37% after 64\u00a0h in a second experiment, was observed. Behaviour traits (i.e., righting response, tail flips and three reflex behaviours) were poor indicator of survival. Haemolymph parameters were either unaffected by emersion (e.g., Brix index, protein and lipids), affected by emersion but not associated with mortality (e.g., total haemocyte counts, calcium, magnesium, bicarbonate, glucose and uric acid), or associated with mortality following a recovery period (e.g., pH, the sodium to potassium ratio, urea, and the activity of amylase). A build-up of anaerobic end-products and nitrogenous waste most likely resulted in the mortality. A model based on lobster size and the pre-emersion concentration of haemolymph bicarbonate and haemocyanin was found to be a useful indicator of future survival. This study provides promising leads towards the development of a blood based vulnerability test for live crustacean prior transport.",

The magnitude of winter energy drain depends on the species-specific capacity to seasonally modify the minimal maintenance costs. We examined seasonal variation of minimum oxygen consumption between two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. Oxygen consumption was measured in both species during their active season (daily temperature range\u00a0=\u00a012\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C) and wintering period (4\u00a0\u00b0C) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C. The seasonal reduction in metabolic rates differed between species and experimental temperatures. Wintering newts reduced their metabolic rates at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C in I. alpestris, but only at 8\u00a0\u00b0C in L. vulgaris. Both species reduced the thermal sensitivity of oxygen consumption during wintering. Theoretical calculations of winter depletion of caloric reserves under various thermal conditions revealed that seasonal metabolic reduction is more effective in I. alpestris than in L. vulgaris, and its effectiveness will increase with the proportion of warmer days during wintering period. The variation in winter metabolic reduction between sympatric newt species potentially contributes to their distribution patterns and population dynamics under climate change.",

Gene expression related to cyclooxygenase activity was especially responsive to the dietary PUFA supply and parasite challenge, indicating a role for prostanoid eicosanoids in immunity and reproduction. Vitellogenin gene expression was induced upon parasite exposure in all food treatments, suggesting infection-related interference with the host's reproductive system.

Cells and tissues may then respond with volume regulation mechanisms, which involve transport of ions and water into and/or out of the cells, through ion transporters, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase and NKCC. The goal of this study was to relate the cell volume regulation capacity of echinoderm intestinal cells Na+/K+-ATPase and NKCC activities, in three echinoderm species: Holothuria grisea, Arbacia lixula, and Echinometra lucunter. Isolated cells of these species displayed some control of their cell volume upon exposure to anisosmotic media (isolated intestinal cells, calcein fluorescence as indicator of volume change), with a distinct higher capacity shown by H. grisea, which did not swell even upon 50% hyposmotic shock. The holothuroid cells showed indirect evidence (effect of furosemide) of the participation of NKCC in this process, with a secretory function, and of a secondary role by the NKA (effect of ouabain). Other mechanisms are probably responsible for this function in the urchins. Variable expression of these transporters, and others not examined here, may to some extent account for the variability in cell volume regulation capacity in echinoderm cells.",

This study compared effects of gonadotropins, human insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1), and cAMP/protein kinase A signaling (forskolin) on E2 production and levels of mRNAs encoding steroidogenic proteins and gonadotropin receptors using midvitellogenic (MV) and late/postvitellogenic (L/PV) ovarian follicles of rainbow trout. Fsh, Lh and forskolin, but not IGF1, increased testosterone and E2 production in MV and L/PV follicles. Fsh increased steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (star; MV), 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/\u03945\u00a0\u2212\u00a04 isomerase (hsd3b; MV) and P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a; MV) transcript levels. Lh increased star mRNA levels (MV, L/PV) but reduced cyp19a1a transcripts in L/PV follicles. At both follicle stages, IGF1 reduced levels of hsd3b transcripts. In MV follicles, IGF1 decreased P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (cyp11a1) transcripts but increased cyp19a1a transcripts. In MV follicles only, forskolin increased star and hsd3b transcripts. Forskolin reduced MV follicle cyp11a1 transcripts and reduced cyp19a1a transcripts in follicles at both stages. Fsh and Lh reduced fshr transcripts in L/PV follicles. Lh also reduced lhcgr transcripts (L/PV). IGF1 had no effect on gonadotropin receptor transcripts. Forskolin reduced MV follicle fshr transcript levels and reduced lhcgr transcripts in L/PV follicles. These results reveal hormone- and stage-specific transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic protein and gonadotropin receptor genes and suggest that the steroidogenic shift at the completion of vitellogenesis involves loss of stimulatory effects of Fsh and Igfs on cyp19a1a expression and inhibition of cyp19a1a transcription by Lh.",

In mammals, hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Prior work has shown that mourning doves have high levels of antioxidants and isolated vessels have low endogenous oxidative stress. Therefore, the hypothesis was that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of isolated avian arteries would not be impaired following acute exposure to high glucose. Isolated small resistance cranial tibial arteries (c. tibial) were cannulated and pressurized in a vessel chamber then incubated with either normal or high glucose (20\u00a0mM vs. 30\u00a0mM) for 1\u00a0h at 41\u00a0\u00b0C. Vessels were then pre-constricted to 50% of resting inner diameter with phenylephrine (PE) followed by increasing doses of acetylcholine (ACh; 10\u2212\u00a09 to 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M, 5\u00a0min per step). Percent vasodilation was measured by tracking the inner diameter with edge-detection software. Contrary to our hypothesis, ACh-induced vasodilation was impaired with acute exposure to high glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). The impairment was not related to increased osmolarity since vasodilation of arteries exposed to an equimolar combination of 20\u00a0mM d-glucose and 10\u00a0mM l-glucose was not different from controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.273). Rather, the impaired vasodilation was attributed to oxidative stress since superoxide levels were elevated 168\u00a0\u00b1\u00a042% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and pre-exposure of arteries to the superoxide dismutase mimetic tiron (10\u00a0mM) improved vasodilation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Therefore, isolated arteries from doves do not have endogenous mechanisms to prevent impaired vasodilation resulting from high glucose-mediated increases in oxidative stress.",

COX activity and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) mRNA expression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) were significantly down-regulated under the warm conditions. COX activity of BAT, liver, heart and muscle were significantly negatively correlated with body fat content, and the correlation between UCP1 expression and body fat content tended to be negative. These findings suggest that the decrease in the energy spent on metabolic thermogenesis plays an important role in the fat accumulation.

Similarly, both species had elevated hemolymph Na+ during exposure to elevated pCO2, and this returned to control levels for A. plicata but remained elevated for L. siliquoidea once the pCO2 stimuli was removed. Changes in hemolymph Ca2\u00a0+ and Cl\u2212 in response to elevated pCO2 were also observed, but these changes were species-specific. Additional physiological responses to elevated pCO2 (e.g., changes in hemolymph glucose and Mg2\u00a0+) were consistent with a stress response in both species. This study demonstrates the importance of considering inter-specific differences in the response of organisms to stress, and also that responses to elevated pCO2 may be transient and can recover once the stress is removed.",

     "abstract": "Dietary antioxidants have been shown to confer a variety of benefits through their ability to counter oxidative stress, including increased immunocompetence and reduced susceptibility to both infectious and non-infectious diseases. However, little is known about the effects of dietary antioxidants on immune function in larval amphibians, a group experiencing worldwide declines driven by factors that likely involve altered immunocompetence. We investigated the effects of dietary antioxidants (quercetin, vitamin E, and \u03b2-carotene) on two components of the immune system, as well as development and growth. Lithobates pipiens tadpoles fed diets with supplemental \u03b2-carotene or vitamin E exhibited an enhanced swelling response as measured with a phytohemagglutinin assay (PHA), but there was no induced antibody response. Effects were often dose-dependent, with higher antioxidant levels generally conferring stronger swelling that possibly corresponds to the innate immune response. Our results indicate that the antioxidant content of the larval amphibian diets not only had a detectable effect on their immune response capability, but also promoted tadpole growth (mass gain), although developmental stage was not affected. Given that many environmental perturbations may cause oxidative stress or reduce immunocompetence, it is critical to understand how nutrition may counter these effects.",

We assessed the long-term effects of high-glucose stimuli, exerted at the larval stage, on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility and metabolic utilization and gene expression of seabream juveniles, challenged with a high-carbohydrate intake. During early development, a group of larvae (control, CTRL) were kept under a rich-protein-lipid feeding regime whereas another group (GLU) was subjected to high-glucose stimuli, delivered intermittently over time. At juvenile stage, triplicate groups (IBW: 2.5\u00a0g) from each fish nutritional background were fed a high-protein (59.4%) low-carbohydrate (2.0%) diet before being subjected to a low-protein (43.0%) high-carbohydrate (33.0%) dietary challenge for 36-days. Fish from both treatments increased by 8-fold their initial body weight, but neither growth rate, feed intake, feed and protein efficiency, nutrient retention (except lipids) nor whole-body composition were affected (P\u00a0\u02c3\u00a00.05) by fish early nutritional history. Nutrient digestibility was also similar among both groups. The metabolic fate of 14C-starch and 14C-amino acids tracers was estimated; GLU juveniles showed higher absorption of starch-derived glucose in the gut, suggesting an enhanced digestion of carbohydrates, while amino acid use was not affected. Moreover, glucose was less used for de novo synthesis of hepatic proteins and muscle glycogen from GLU fish (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Our metabolic data suggests that the early glucose stimuli may alter carbohydrate utilization in seabream juveniles.",

Despite its benefits, the use of OPs in agricultural activities can also have negative effects since the excessive use of these substances can represent a major contamination problem for water bodies and organisms that inhabit them. The aim of this paper was to evaluate oxidative damage in lipids and proteins of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed acutely to diazinon (0.97, 1.95 and 3.95\u00a0ppm) for 12 or 24\u00a0h. The evaluation of oxidative damage was determined by quantifying lipid hydroperoxides (Fox method) and oxidized proteins (DNPH method). The data from this study suggest that diazinon induces a concentration-dependent oxidative damage in proteins, but not lipids, of the liver and gills of Nile tilapia. Furthermore, the treatment leads to a decrease in the concentration of total proteins, which can have serious consequences in cell physiology and fish development.",

The response in the SML was compared with recognized target organs through the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBRv2) and a slight addition to the method was proposed. Crude oil was extremely toxic and elicited a clear induction of ROS in the SML, as in the brain, liver and muscle. By the exposure to crude, a significant change in the activities of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) as well as on lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and carbonyl protein (RCO) levels was detected. Also, increases in the activity of EROD were found. The general IBRv2 proposed in this study (gIBRv2) showed that oil causes the higher oxidative response in the SML (60.049) under different concentrations of petroleum, which was greater in the brain (56.749), muscle (56.561) and liver (55.775). The results of the study revealed an organ-specific antioxidant defense response that was dependent on the load of petroleum. These results contributed to the understanding of the complexity of oxidative stress response in fish exposed to crude oil using the Skin Mucus Layer as a target for environmental monitoring studies.",

How cellular-level responses to metal pollution influence whole-organism and population-level traits is poorly understood. We tested whether exposure to single metals (zinc and cadmium) and to metal mixtures (water in equilibrium with sediment from a highly polluted lake) alters two ecologically-relevant traits in freshwater clams, locomotion and reproduction. Fingernail clams (Musculium spp.) from unimpacted habitats were exposed to single metals and the metal mixture for up to 49\u00a0days. The single metal doses (\u2264\u00a05\u00a0mg/L Zn and \u2264\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcg/L Cd) were not toxicologically meaningful as clam survival, burial, and climbing activity did not differ across treatments. Water in equilibrium with the lake sediment contained cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. Clams exposed to this metal mixture had decreased climbing activity but no change in burial activity. Metal-exposed clams had lower fecundity (number of shelled juveniles extruded by adult clams) and patterns in metal accumulation corresponded with lake sediment dose and clam activity. In contrast to the functional traits, stress protein expression and whole-clam glycogen content did not vary across treatment groups. These results indicate that fingernail clams of the genus Musculium are appropriate for development as sentinel species for metal pollution and can serve as a model for determining how metal pollution alters metabolic allocation patterns in freshwater organisms.",

Molluscs produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to changes in the environment and pollution. These ROS induce oxidative damage in biomolecules. The main objective of this study was to evaluate pollution in the estuary and the subsequent oxidative stress in C. corteziensis oysters during the 2010 production cycle. For this aim, we performed monthly samplings in the oyster farms from January to May. We took water samples to quantify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and metal content; also, we evaluated oxidative damage (lipoperoxidation, lipidic hydroperoxides, protein oxidation) and enzyme activity (CAT, SOD, GPx, GST and AChE) in oyster gills. The results show the presence of Cu, Fe, Mn, naphthalene, benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, benz[a]pyrene and benzo[k]fluoranthene. On the other hand, AChE activity was not inhibited, which suggests that organophosphorus pollutants or carbamates were absent. Regarding oxidative stress, oysters from the estuary had oxidative damage in lipids, not proteins, and altered antioxidant enzyme activity, when compared to control organisms. Interestingly, we did not observe any correlation between the pollutants and the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in this study. Thus, we cannot rule out that a synergistic effect between the environmental variables and the pollutants is causing the oxidative stress in these oysters.",

Total Fe content and labile Fe pool were higher in the DG of the subtidal compared to the intertidal population. However, no significant differences between populations were seen on the Fe atoms content of the isolated ferritin. Ascorbyl radical content was 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 and 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0pmol/mg FW in the DG of the intertidal and subtidal animals, respectively.

This phenomenon was also observed during freezing exposure, severe dehydration, aerial exposure of water-breathing animals and estivation. However, as far as we know, there is no analysis available of the prevalence of POS among animal species. A major problem is the very definition of POS, since many animal species show both increases and decreases of antioxidants during low oxygen stress and estivation. Therefore, we established three different criteria; from inclusive to restrictive and analyzed how widespread the POS phenomenon is in the animal kingdom. We analyzed all available papers in several databases about the modulation of antioxidant defenses during oxygen deprivation or estivation. Based on the magnitude of change (as % change) during the specific low oxygen stresses or estivation, we classified each species as POS-positive, POS-negative or POS-neutral, considering the three different criteria. The prevalence of POS-positive animals (102 species from 8 phyla) was stress-dependent: in estivation and dehydration it was 91\u2013100%, while in hypoxia it was 37.5\u201353%, depending on the criteria. In the case of air exposure, anoxia and freezing the proportions of POS-positive species were 54\u201377%, 64\u201377% and 75\u201386%, respectively. Overall, the prevalence of POS was 58 to 68% when all stresses and all species were analyzed together. The results indicate the key importance of POS as a survival strategy of animals exposed to freezing, dehydration and estivation, and, to a lesser extent, to oxygen deprivation itself (i.e. hypoxia and anoxia).",

The objective of this study was to examine the relationships among maternal and egg cortisol, and maternal and offspring oxidative stress to provide insight into the potential intergenerational effects of stressor exposure in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Antioxidant concentration and oxidative stress were measured in maternal tissues (plasma, brain, heart and liver) as well as offspring developmental stages (pre-fertilization, 24\u00a0h post-fertilization, eyed, and hatch), and were compared to both naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated (via cortisol egg bath) levels of cortisol in eggs. Oxygen radical absorptive capacity of tissues from maternal sockeye salmon was measured spectrophotometrically and was not correlated with maternal or egg cortisol concentrations. Also, naturally-occurring and experimentally-elevated cortisol levels in eggs (to mimic maternal stress) did not affect oxidative stress or antioxidant capacity of the offspring. We conclude that the metrics of maternal stress examined in sockeye salmon (i.e., maternal/egg cortisol, maternal oxidative stress) are independent of each other, and that egg cortisol content does not influence offspring oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Northern elephant seals experience conditions that increase oxidative stress (OS), including extended fasting, ischemia and hypoxia during breath-holds, and immune responses during colonial breeding. Increased OS is suggested by increases in tissue and plasma concentrations of pro-oxidant enzymes NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase (XO). Serum cortisol concentrations were positively associated with XO concentrations and damage markers. Elephant seals exhibit robust anti-oxidant responses as evidenced by increases in anti-oxidant enzymes in plasma and tissues. These responses were sufficient to prevent oxidative damage during breath-holds and extended fasts in juveniles. However, high rates of energy expenditure during breeding were associated with increased evidence for oxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA in adults. We integrated investigations of the fasting metabolome and muscle and blubber transcriptomes into our oxidative stress studies. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of fasting seals identified 227 known metabolites in plasma, including those related to glutathione and purine metabolism. Changes in plasma metabolites suggested that glutathione biosynthesis increased during fasting in weaned pups but not in lactating females. We produced the first reference sequence for elephant seals by RNA sequencing of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue transcriptomes and de novo transcriptome assembly. We annotated muscle and adipose transcripts and identified thousands of genes, including potential mediators of OS. This resource provides elephant seal-specific gene sequences, complements existing metabolite and protein expression studies and provides tools for examining cellular responses to OS in a variety of contexts. We examined changes in tissue gene expression in response to experimental elevation of plasma cortisol. Responses included downregulation of Negative Regulator of Reactive Oxygen Species (NRROS) in muscle, a regulator that limits reactive oxygen species production by tissues. These tools provide novel views of the cellular and systemic mechanisms that enable seals to tolerate high levels of OS.",

     "abstract": "In most animals, the acquisition of the essential trace metal iron (Fe) is achieved by the gut, but in hagfishes, the skin is a nutrient absorbing epithelium, and thus may also play a role in Fe uptake. In the current study, the absorption of Fe, as Fe(II), across the intestinal and cutaneous epithelia of Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus cirrhatus) was investigated. Both epithelia absorbed Fe, with saturation at lower tested concentrations, superseded by a diffusive component at higher Fe exposure concentrations. Affinity constants (Km) of 9.4 and 137\u00a0\u03bcM, and maximal Fe transport rates (Jmax) of 0.81 and 0.57\u00a0nmol\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01 were determined for the skin and the gut, respectively. This characterises the skin as a relatively high-affinity Fe transport epithelium. The majority of the absorbed Fe in the skin remained in the tissue, whereas in the gut, most absorbed Fe was found in the serosal fluid, suggesting distinct mechanisms of Fe handling between the two epithelia. To determine if reduced dissolved oxygen altered Fe transport, hagfish were subjected to hypoxia for 24\u00a0h, before Fe transport was again assessed. Hypoxia had no effect on Fe transport across gut or skin, likely owing to the relative lack of change in haematological variables, and thus an unaltered Fe demand under such conditions. These data are the first to kinetically characterise the absorption of a nutritive trace metal across the epithelia of hagfish and add to the growing understanding of the role of the skin in nutritive transport in this group.",

We investigated three species forming estivation chambers when soils dry out (Aporrectodea tuberculata, Aporrectodea icterica and Aporrectodea longa) and one species that does not estivate during drought (Lumbricus rubellus). Worms subjected to drought conditions (< \u22122\u00a0MPa) substantially increased the concentration of FAAs and in particular alanine that was significantly upregulated in all tested species. Alanine was the most important FAA reaching 250\u2013650\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01 dry weight in dehydrated Aporrectodea species and 300\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01 dry weight in L. rubellus.

Species forming estivation chambers (Aporrectodea spp.) did not show a better ability to conserve body water than the non-estivating species (L. rubellus) at the same drought level. These results suggest that the accumulation of alanine is an important adaptive trait in drought tolerance of earthworms in general.",

It was previously shown that in the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the silencing of SelM by RNAi decreased peroxidase activity in gill. In this work, we report the structure of the SelM gene (LvSelM) and its relative expression in hepatopancreas and gill after 24\u00a0h of hypoxia followed by 1\u00a0h of reoxygenation. The gene is composed by four exons interrupted by tree introns. In gills and hepatopancreas, SelM expression increased after 24\u00a0h of hypoxia followed by 1\u00a0h of reoxygenation, while peroxidases activity diminished in hepatopancreas but increased in gills. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration was higher in hepatopancreas in response to hypoxia for 6\u00a0h and did not change after 24 of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation; conversely, no change was detected in gill. SelM appears to be a key enzyme in gill oxidative stress regulation, since the higher expression is associated with an increase in peroxidases activity while maintaining H2O2 concentration. In contrast, in hepatopancreas there is a higher expression after hypoxia and reoxygenation for 24\u00a0h, but peroxidases activity was lower and the change in H2O2 occurred after 6\u00a0h of hypoxia and this level was maintained during reoxygenation.",

     "abstract": "Observations from the present study provide the first characterization of the GH-IGF axis in Shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus, an ancestral fish species. An initial characterization of steady-state IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression in multiple tissues was conducted using real-time RT-qPCR. Overall, the tissues had significantly different profiles of IGF-I gene expression, with the highest IGF-I expression observed in the liver. The highest IGF-II gene expression was also observed in the liver, with minimal or no detection in muscle. A comparison between IGF-I and IGF-II expression within individual tissues revealed higher levels of IGF-II than IGF-I mRNA in the spleen, stomach and trunk kidney, and higher levels of relative IGF-I mRNA expression in the intestine and muscle. The GH-IGF axis was further elucidated by observing the effects of exogenous GH on IGF-I and IGF-II expression in liver and muscle tissue. The results revealed a significant dose-dependent response of both hepatic IGF-I and IGF-II, and muscle IGF-I mRNA expression following rbGH administration. At the highest rbGH concentration (240\u00a0\u03bcg/g BW), IGF-I mRNA levels in liver and muscle peaked significantly at 48\u00a0h, indicating both hepatic and muscle IGF-I expression to be stimulated by GH. Hepatic IGF-II expression was also stimulated 48\u00a0h following rbGH administration. Expression of IGF-II mRNA was not inducible in the muscle. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exogenous GH on IGF expression in ancestral vertebrate species, and as such, this research provides valuable insight into the evolution of the somatotropic axis in vertebrates.",

Specifically, studies on the digestive physiology of frugivorous and nectarivorous birds are important for elucidating their preference patterns in the wild and the selective pressures they exert on fruit pulp and nectar. In this study, digesta transit times and digestive efficiencies of three species of birds, the Cape white-eyes (Zosterops virens), red-winged starlings (Onychognathus morio) and speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus) were investigated on equicaloric glucose or sucrose artificial fruit diets. Three concentrations, approximating the natural range of sugar concentrations in sugary, bird-dispersed fruits were used: low (6.6%), medium (12.4%) and high (22%). Digesta transit times of birds increased with an increase in concentration for all diets but were generally higher on glucose diets. Intake rates, on the other hand, decreased with an increase in sugar concentration. All species of birds failed to maintain a constant assimilated energy intake on glucose diets but mousebirds and white-eyes maintained it on sucrose diets. Apparent assimilation efficiencies of glucose diets for all species were comparable and typical of those found in other frugivorous birds. However, assimilation efficiencies for sucrose diets differed widely with red-winged starlings displaying very low assimilation efficiencies and as a consequence; they lost significant body mass on all sucrose diets. These results demonstrate the importance of digestive physiology in explaining fruit selection patterns in frugivorous birds and how a seemingly trivial physiological trait can have dire ecological consequences.",

     "abstract": "Previous works on European sea bass have determined that long-term exposure to restrictive feeding diets alters the rhythms of some reproductive/metabolic hormones, delaying maturation and increasing apoptosis during gametogenesis. However, exactly how these diets affect key genes and hormones on the brain\u2013pituitary\u2013gonad (BPG) axis to trigger puberty is still largely unknown. We may hypothesize that all these signals could be integrated, at least in part, by the kisspeptin system. In order to capture a glimpse of these regulatory mechanisms, kiss1 and kiss2 mRNA expression levels and those of their kiss receptors (kiss1r, kiss2r) were analyzed in different areas of the brain and in the pituitary of pubertal male sea bass during gametogenesis. Furthermore, other reproductive hormones and factors as well as the percentage of males showing full spermiation were also analyzed. Treated fish fed maintenance diets provided evidence of overexpression of the kisspeptin system in the main hypophysiotropic regions of the brain throughout the entire sexual cycle. Conversely, Gnrh1 and gonadotropin pituitary content and plasma sexual steroid levels were downregulated, except for Fsh levels, which were shown to increase during spermiation. Treated fish exhibited lower rates of spermiation as compared to control group and a delay in its accomplishment. These results demonstrate how the kisspeptin system and plasma Fsh levels are differentially affected by maintenance diets, causing a retardation, but not a full blockage of the reproductive process in the teleost fish European sea bass. This suggests that a hormonal adaptive strategy may be operating in order to preserve reproductive function in this species.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated differences in thermotolerance between two wing morphs of Nilaparvata lugens, the most serious pest of rice across the Asia. To reveal the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the differential thermal resistance abilities between two wing morphs, a full-length of transcript encoding heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) was cloned, and its expression patterns across temperature gradients were analyzed. The results showed that the expression levels of NlHsc70 in macropters increased dramatically after heat shock from 32 to 38\u00a0\u00b0C, while NlHsc70 transcripts in brachypters remained constant under different temperature stress conditions. In addition, NlHsc70 expression in the macropters was significantly higher than that in brachypters at 1 and 2\u00a0h recovery from 40\u00a0\u00b0C heat shock. There was no significant difference in NlHsc70 mRNA expression between brachypters and macropters under cold shock conditions. Therefore, NlHsc70 was indeed a constitutively expressed member of the Hsp70 family in brachypters of N. lugens, while it was heat-inducible in macropters. Furthermore, the survival rates of both morphs injected with NlHsc70 dsRNA were significantly decreased following heat shock at 40\u00a0\u00b0C or cold shock at 0\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. These results suggested that the up-regulation of NlHsc70 is possibly related to the thermal resistance, and the more effective inducement expression of NlHsc70 in macropters promotes a greater thermal tolerance under temperature stress conditions.",

In experiment 1, shrimps maintained under a 12:12\u00a0h light/dark (LD) photoperiod were allowed to self-feed using feeders connected to a photoelectric cell, while locomotor activity was recorded with a second photocell. On day 30, animals were subjected to constant darkness (DD) for 12\u00a0days to check the existence of endogenous circadian rhythms. In the experiment 2, shrimps were exposed to both a 12:12\u00a0h LD photoperiod and a fixed meal schedule in the middle of the dark period (MD, 01:00\u00a0h). On day 20, shrimps were exposed to DD conditions and the same fixed feeding. On day 30, they were maintained under DD and fasted for 7\u00a0days. The results revealed that under LD, shrimps showed a clear nocturnal feeding pattern and locomotor activity (81.9% and 67.7% of total daily food-demands and locomotor activity, respectively, at nighttime).

Maximum metabolic rate (MMR) was elevated at 28 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C relative to 24\u00a0\u00b0C. Aerobic scope (AS) increased between 24 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C, then declined to a level comparable to 24\u00a0\u00b0C, but increased dramatically 34\u00a0\u00b0C, the latter driven by the drop in SMR in the warmest treatment. Critical swim speed (Ucrit) was highest at intermediate temperature treatments, and was positively related to AS between 24 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C; however, at 34\u00a0\u00b0C, the increase in AS did not correspond to an increase in Ucrit, suggesting a performance cost at the highest temperature.",

Desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii, ~\u00a020\u00a0g) appear to be an exception as they have been described as homeothermic. However, we hypothesized that they can use torpor because we observed reversible decreases of body temperature (Tb) in fasted hamsters. To test this hypothesis we (i) randomly exposed fasted summer-acclimated hamsters to ambient temperatures (Tas) ranging from 5 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C or (ii) supplied them with different rations of food at Ta 23\u00a0\u00b0C. All desert hamsters showed heterothermy with the lowest mean Tb of 31.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b0C (minimum, 29.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and 31.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0\u00a0\u00b0C (minimum, 29.0\u00a0\u00b0C) when fasted at Ta of 23\u00a0\u00b0C and 19\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Below Ta 19\u00a0\u00b0C, the lowest Tb and metabolic rate increased and the proportion of hamsters using heterothermy declined. At Ta 5\u00a0\u00b0C, nearly all hamsters remained normothermic by increasing heat production, suggesting that the heterothermy only occurs in moderately cold conditions, perhaps to avoid freezing at extremely low Tas. During heterothermy, Tbs below 31\u00a0\u00b0C with metabolic rates below 25% of those during normothermia were detected in four individuals at Ta of 19\u00a0\u00b0C and 23\u00a0\u00b0C. Consequently, by definition, our observations confirm that fasted desert hamsters are capable of shallow daily torpor. The negative correlation between the lowest Tbs and amount of food supply shows that heterothermy was mainly triggered by food shortage. Our data indicate that summer-acclimated desert hamsters can express fasting-induced shallow daily torpor, which may be of significance for energy conservation and survival in the wild.",

We identified four transcripts encoding Cldn tight junction proteins in the tilapia gill transcriptome: cldn10c, cldn10e, cldn28a and cldn30. A tissue distribution experiment found cldn10c and cldn10e expression levels in the gill to be 100-fold higher than any other tissues examined. cldn28a and cldn30 levels in the gill were 10-fold greater than levels in other tissues. Expression of these genes in Mozambique tilapia was examined during acclimation to fresh water (FW), seawater (SW), and in response to hormone treatments. Transfer of tilapia from FW to SW elevated cldn10c and cldn10e, while cldn28a and cldn30 were stimulated following transfer from SW to FW. In hypophysectomized tilapia transferred to FW, pituitary extirpation induced reduced expression of cldn10c, cldn10e and cldn28a; these effects were mitigated equally by either prolactin or cortisol replacement. In vitro experiments with gill filaments showed that cortisol stimulated expression of all four cldns examined, suggesting a direct action of cortisol in situ. Our data indicate that elevated cldn10c and cldn10e expression is important during acclimation of tilapia to SW possibly by conferring ion specific paracellular permeability. On the other hand, expression of cldn28a and cldn30 appears to contribute to reorganization of branchial epithelium during FW acclimation. Hormone treatment experiments showed that particular FW- and SW-induced cldns are controlled by cortisol and prolactin.",

We also found that female lizards had a higher panting threshold than male lizards, while sex had no effect on gaping threshold and loss of righting response. Body size affected the temperature at which lizards lost the righting response, with larger lizards losing the response at lower temperatures than smaller lizards when exposed to hypoxic conditions.

In this study, we investigated the effects of orexin-A on GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels and the intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating orexin-A activity in the hepatocytes of grouper. Our results demonstrate that intraperitoneal injection of orexin-A increased the expression of GLUT4 in the liver, and this effect was significantly enhanced by co-injection of glucose. Treatment of primary cultured hepatocytes with either orexin-A or glucose alone had no effect on the expression of GLUT4, while co-treatment with orexin-A and glucose significantly increased the expression of GLUT4. This stimulatory effect was partially blocked by inhibitors to ERK1/2, JNK or p38 MAPK and was further blocked by an orexin receptor antagonist, which indicates that orexin-A could stimulate the expression of GLUT4 in a glucose dependent manner in primary hepatocytes via ERK1/2, JNK and p38 signaling.

The Halloween genes encoding the enzymes mainly involved in the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids are well studied in insects but not in crustaceans. Given the importance of Halloween genes in ecdysteroids biosynthesis, we have previously reported the cDNA cloning of disembodied (Dib) in P. trituberculatus. Here, cDNA sequences of another two Halloween genes, Spook (Spo) and Shadow (Sad), were further identified and characterized. The predicted amino acid sequences for these two Halloween genes of Portunus trituberculatus were compared to those of several other arthropods, and several typical domains of the cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (CYP) were identified. Similar to the tissue distribution of Dib, the Spo and Sad also showed high specificity to the YO. RNA interference (RNAi) of these 3 genes indicated they all play essential role in ecdysteroids biosynthesis. To investigate the relationships of the Halloween genes to the eyestalk neuropeptides such as molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), effects of eyestalk ablation (ESA) on the expression of Dib, Spo and Sad were detected. Expression of Dib and Sad, but not Spo, was significantly induced by ESA. The result indicated that the inhibition of MIH in ecdysteroids biosynthesis may be partly through the transcriptional regulation of certain Halloween genes, such as Dib and Sad, while the Spo might not be the target for MIH signal.",

We measured body mass, critical swimming speed (Ucrit), resting metabolic rate (RMR), active metabolic rate (AMR) and metabolic scope (MS) twice (28\u00a0days apart) in both temperature groups. Fish acclimated to 25\u00a0\u00b0C showed a 204% higher specific growth rate (SGR) than those acclimated to 15\u00a0\u00b0C due to a 97% higher feeding rate (FR) and a 46% higher feed efficiency (FE). Among individuals, SGR was positively correlated with the FR and FE at both low and high temperatures. All measured variables (Ucrit, RMR and AMR) related to swimming except MS showed a high repeatability after adjusting for body mass (mass-independent). Fish acclimated to 25\u00a0\u00b0C had a 40% higher Ucrit compared with 15\u00a0\u00b0C acclimated fish, which was at least partially due to an improved metabolic capacity. AMR showed a 97% increase, and MS showed a 104% parallel increase with the higher acclimation temperature. Residual (mass-independent) Ucrit was positively correlated with residual RMR, AMR and MS, except for the residual RMR at high temperature. When acclimated to the lower temperature, both the residual and absolute Ucrit were negatively correlated with FR and FE and, hence, with SGR, suggesting a functional trade-off between growth and locomotion in fish acclimated to low temperatures. However, when acclimated to the higher temperature, this trade-off no longer existed; absolute Ucrit was positively correlated with SGR because individuals with rapid growth exhibited greatly increased body mass. The higher metabolic capacity at 25\u00a0\u00b0C showed a positive effect on both swimming performance and growth rate (because of improved digestive efficiency) under the high-temperature condition, which we did not anticipate. Overall, these results indicate that temperature alters the relationship between growth and swimming performance of juvenile common carp.

In contrast, 5\u00a0\u03bcg 18\u03b2GA-fed fish exhibited elevated 11\u03b2-hsd2 and CR mRNA abundance versus 50\u00a0\u03bcg 18\u03b2GA-fed, and reduced MRC apical area as well as some differences in TJ protein mRNA abundance versus control fish. Data suggest that 18\u03b2GA, at low levels, may be adaptogenic in trout and might help to ameliorate ionoregulatory perturbation following IPW exposure. This seems to occur, in part, through 18\u03b2GA-induced alterations in the biochemistry and physiology of the gill.",

     "abstract": "Two cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) isoforms, CFTRa and CFTRb, were cloned in Japanese eel and their structures and functions were studied in different osmoregulatory tissues in freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) eels. Molecular phylogenetic results suggested that the CFTR duplication in eels occurred independently of the duplication event in salmonid. CFTRa was expressed in the intestine and kidney and downregulated in both tissues in SW eels, while CFTRb was specifically expressed in the gill and greatly upregulated in SW eels. Structurally, the CFTR isoforms are similar in most functional domains except the regulatory R domain, where the R domain of CFTRa is similar to that of human CFTR but the R domain of CFTRb is unique in having high intrinsic negative charges and fewer phosphorylation sites, suggesting divergence of isoforms in terms of gating properties and hormonal regulation. Immunohistochemical results showed that CFTR was localized on the apical regions of SW ionocytes, suggesting a Cl\u2212 secretory role as in other teleosts. In intestine and kidney, however, immunoreactive CFTR was mostly found in the cytosolic vesicles in FW eels, indicating that Cl\u2212 channel activity could be low at basal conditions, but could be rapidly increased by membrane insertion of the stored channels. Guanylin (GN), a known hormone that increases CFTR activity in mammalian intestine, failed to redistribute CFTR and to affect its expression in eel intestine. The results suggested that GN-independent CFTR regulation is present in eel intestine and kidney.",

In shrimp, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and fructose bisphosphatase (FBP) are up-regulated in hypoxia. We hypothesized that HIF-1 is involved in the regulation of PFK and FBP genes in shrimp hepatopancreas under hypoxia. Long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) intramuscular injection was utilized to silence simultaneously both HIF-1 subunits, and then, we measured the relative expression of PFK and FBP, as well as their corresponding enzymatic activities in hypoxic shrimp hepatopancreas. The results indicated that HIF-1 participates in the up-regulation of PFK transcripts under short-term hypoxia since the induction caused by hypoxia (~\u00a01.6 and ~\u00a04.2-fold after 3 and 48\u00a0h, respectively) is significantly reduced in the dsRNA animals treated. Moreover, PFK activity was significantly ~\u00a02.8-fold augmented after 3\u00a0h in hypoxia alongside to an ~\u00a01.9-fold increment in lactate. However, when animals were dsRNA treated, both were significantly reduced. On the other hand, FBP transcripts were ~\u00a05.3-fold up-regulated in long-term hypoxic conditions (48\u00a0h). HIF-1 is involved in this process since FBP transcripts were not induced by hypoxia when HIF-1 was silenced. Conversely, the FBP activity was not affected by hypoxia, which suggests its possible regulation at post-translational level. Taken together, these results position HIF-1 as a prime transcription factor in coordinating glucose metabolism through the PFK and FBP genes among others, in shrimp under low oxygen environments.",

This study was aimed at characterizing the effects of rearing tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, in a tidally-changing salinity on the GH/IGF axis and growth. Tilapia were raised in fresh water (FW), seawater (SW), or in a tidally-changing environment, in which salinity is switched between FW (TF) and SW (TS) every 6\u00a0h, for 4\u00a0months. Growth was measured over all time points recorded and fish reared in a tidally-changing environment grew significantly faster than other groups. The levels of circulating growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), pituitary GH mRNA, gene expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, and growth hormone receptor 2 (GHR) in the muscle and liver were also determined. Plasma IGF-I was higher in FW and TS than in SW and TF tilapia. Pituitary GH mRNA was higher in TF and TS than in FW and SW tilapia. Gene expression of IGF-I in the liver and of GHR in both the muscle and liver changed between TF and TS fish. Fish growth was positively correlated with GH mRNA expression in the pituitary, and GHR mRNA expression in muscle and liver tissues. Our study indicates that rearing fish under tidally-changing salinities elicits a distinct pattern of endocrine regulation from that observed in fish reared in steady-state conditions, and may provide a new approach to increase tilapia growth rate and study the regulation of growth in euryhaline fish.",

Eyestalk ablation (ESA) activates the YOs, which hypertrophy and increase ecdysteroid secretion. At mid premolt, which occurs 7\u201314\u00a0days post-ESA, the YO transitions to the committed state; hemolymph ecdysteroid titers increase further and the animal reaches ecdysis ~\u00a03\u00a0weeks post-ESA. Two conserved signaling pathways, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), are expressed in the Gecarcinus lateralis YO. Rapamycin, an mTOR antagonist, inhibits YO ecdysteroidogenesis in vitro. In this study, rapamycin lowered hemolymph ecdysteroid titer in ESA G. lateralis in vivo; levels were significantly lower than in control animals at all intervals (1\u201314\u00a0days post-ESA). Injection of SB431542, an activin TGF-\u03b2 receptor antagonist, lowered hemolymph ecdysteroid titers 7 and 14\u00a0days post-ESA, but had no effect on ecdysteroid titers at 1 and 3\u00a0days post-ESA. mRNA levels of mTOR signaling genes Gl-mTOR, Gl-Akt, and Gl-S6k were increased by 3\u00a0days post-ESA; the increases in Gl-mTOR and Gl-Akt mRNA levels were blocked by SB431542. Gl-elongation factor 2 and Gl-Rheb mRNA levels were not affected by ESA, but SB431542 lowered mRNA levels at Days 3 and 7 post-ESA. The mRNA level of an activin TGF-\u03b2 peptide, Gl-myostatin-like factor (Mstn), increased 5.5-fold from 0 to 3\u00a0days post-ESA, followed by a 50-fold decrease from 3 to 7\u00a0days post-ESA. These data suggest that (1) YO activation involves an up regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway; (2) mTOR is required for YO commitment; and (3) a Mstn-like factor mediates the transition of the YO from the activated to the committed state.",

     "abstract": "In teleost fishes, it is well-established that the gill serves as an important ionoregulatory organ in addition to its primary function of respiratory gas exchange. In elasmobranchs, however, the ionoregulatory function of the gills is still incompletely understood. Although two types of ionocytes, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-rich (type-A) cell and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)-rich (type-B) cell, have been found in elasmobranch fishes, these cells were considered to function primarily in acid\u2013base regulation. In the present study, we examined ion-transporting proteins expressed in ionocytes of Japanese-banded houndshark, Triakis scyllium, reared in full-strength seawater (SW) and transferred to diluted (30%) SW. In addition to the upregulation of NKA and Na+/H+ exchanger type 3 (NHE3) mRNAs in the type-A ionocytes, we found that Na+, Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NCC, Slc12a3) is expressed in a subpopulation of the type-B ionocytes, and that the expression level of NCC mRNA was enhanced in houndsharks transferred to a low-salinity environment. These results suggest that elasmobranch gill ionocytes contribute to NaCl uptake in addition to the already described function of acid\u2013base regulation, and that NCC is most probably one of the key molecules for hyper-osmoregulatory function of elasmobranch gills. The existence of two types of ionocytes (NHE3- and NCC-expressing cells) that are responsible for NaCl absorption seems to be a common feature in both teleosts and elasmobranchs for adaptation to a low salinity environment. A possible driving mechanism for NCC in type-B ionocytes is discussed.",

Measured parameters with representative rates of assimilation efficiency were used to calculate scope for growth (SfG) for each treatment. All physiological parameters were negatively affected at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, showing a decrease in feeding rate which coincided with negative growth and gonad development at the end of the acclimation period, and a decrease in respiration rate suggesting metabolic depression. Histology of gonad samples after the acclimation period also showed no gametic material in animals acclimated at 24\u00a0\u00b0C. All animals acclimated at 24\u00a0\u00b0C had negative growth, differing from the calculated SfG which indicated that the animals had sufficient energy for production. The results suggest that calculated SfG in echinoderms should be used together with actual measurements of growth in individuals as, by itself, SfG may underestimate the actual effect of ocean warming when animals are exposed to stressful conditions. Overall, considering the total loss of reproductive output observed in E. chloroticus at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of this species, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem.",

These changes can affect cellular bioenergetics; however, their effects on mitochondria of estuarine mollusks are not well understood. We determined the interactive effects of bicarbonate (0\u201310\u00a0mM) and pH (7.2 and 6.5) on mitochondrial oxygen consumption (\u1e40O2), membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in two common estuarine bivalves \u2014 hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria, and bay scallops Argopecten irradians. In both species, elevated HCO3\u2212 levels suppressed ADP-stimulated (state 3) \u1e40O2 but had little effect on the resting (state 4) respiration. These effects were not mediated by the soluble adenylyl cyclase or cyclic AMP. Effects of the low pH (6.5) on mitochondrial traits were species-specific and depended on the substrate oxidized by the mitochondria. Mild acidosis (pH\u00a06.5) had minimal effects on \u1e40O2 and \u0394\u03c8 of the bivalve mitochondria oxidizing pyruvate but led to increased rates of ROS production in clams (ROS production could not be measured in scallops). In succinate-respiring mitochondria of clams, mild acidosis suppressed \u1e40O2 and increased mitochondrial coupling, while in scallop mitochondria the effects of low pH were opposite. Suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by bicarbonate and/or acidosis may contribute to the metabolic rate depression during shell closure or environmental hypoxia/hypercapnia. These findings have implications for understanding the physiological mechanisms involved in regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics during hypoxia exposure in estuarine bivalves.",

Sperm size (sperm head area) was also measured using an ASMA (Automated Sperm Morphometry Analyses) system, in the different conditions. Intracellular sodium [Na+]i was quantitatively analyzed by first time in the spermatozoa from a marine fish species. Measurement of [Na+]i was done before and after motility activation, by Flow Cytometry, using CoroNa Green AM as a dye. Sperm motility activation induced an increase in [Na+]i, from 96.72\u00a0mM in quiescent stage to 152.21\u00a0mM post-activation in seawater. A significant decrease in sperm head area was observed post-activation in seawater. There was a notable reduction in sperm motility when sodium was removed from the seminal plasma, but not when it was removed from the activation media. Sodium removal was also linked to a significant reduction in sperm head area in comparison to the controls. Our results indicate that the presence of the ion Na+ in the seminal plasma (or in the extender medium) is necessary for the preservation of sperm motility in European eel, probably because it plays a role in maintaining an appropriate sperm cell volume in the quiescent stage of the spermatozoa.",

We compared hypoxia tolerance (hypoxic loss of equilibrium, LOE, and critical O2 tension, Pcrit) and traits that dictate O2 transport and metabolism in pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), and the naturally occurring hybrid in different acclimation environments (wild versus lab-acclimated fish) and at different temperatures. Wild fish generally had lower Pcrit and lower PO2 at LOE in progressive hypoxia than lab-acclimated fish, but time to LOE in sustained hypoxia (PO2 of 2\u00a0kPa) did not vary between environments. Wild fish also had greater gill surface area and higher haematocrit, suggesting that increased O2 transport capacity underlies the environmental variation in Pcrit. Metabolic (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; pyruvate kinase, PK; citrate synthase; cytochrome c oxidase) and antioxidant (catalase and superoxide dismutase) enzyme activities varied appreciably between environments. Wild fish had higher protein contents across tissues and higher activities of LDH in heart, PK in brain, and catalase in brain, liver, and skeletal muscle. Otherwise, wild fish had lower activities for most enzymes. Warming temperature from 15 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C increased O2 consumption rate, Pcrit, PO2 at LOE, and haemoglobin-O2 affinity, and decreased time to LOE, but pumpkinseed had \u2265\u00a02-fold longer time to LOE than bluegill and hybrids across this temperature range. This was associated with higher LDH activities in the heart and muscle, and lower or similar antioxidant enzyme activities in several tissues. However, the greater hypoxia tolerance of pumpkinseed collapsed at 28\u00a0\u00b0C, demonstrating that the interactive effects of hypoxia and warming temperature can differ between species.

To resolve the apparent MYP-Vtg dichotomy in sea stars and to understand the dynamics of candidate yolk protein gene expression during the reproductive cycle, we investigated the molecular structures of sea star Vtg and MYP and quantified their transcript levels during oogenesis. By combining protein sequencing of the predominant proteins in ovulated eggs of Patiriella regularis with ovarian transcriptome sequencing and molecular cloning, we characterized two cDNAs encoding two bona fide Vtgs (PrVtg1 and PrVtg2) and a partial cDNA encoding MYP (PrMYP). PrMYP mRNA was found in low abundance in growing oocytes, possibly as maternal transcripts for translation after ovulation. In contrast, PrVtg transcripts, whose levels varied during the reproductive cycle, were not found in developing oocytes \u2013 rather, they were detected in ovarian follicle cells and pyloric caeca, indicating an extra-oocytic origin. Vtg accumulating in oocytes was stored in the form of cleaved products, which constituted the most abundant yolk polypeptides in ovulated sea star eggs; their levels decreased during early embryonic and larval development.

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the differential thermotolerance abilities of these two morphs, a full-length Hsp gene, NlHsp90 was cloned from N. lugen. Our results showed that the relative expression levels of NlHsp90 in N. lugens females increased with the rise of temperature. Interestingly, NlHsp90 in macropters females could be induced at lower temperature (32\u00a0\u00b0C) than that in brachypters (34\u00a0\u00b0C), and the NlHsp90 mRNA levels in macropters were significantly higher than those in brachypters from 34 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, the maximum expression levels of NlHsp90 were achieved much earlier in macropters, and NlHsp90 mRNA levels in macropters were significantly higher than those in brachypters from 1 to 6\u00a0h of recovery after temperature stress. Furthermore, knockdown of NlHsp90 by dsRNA injection reduced survival in both morphs with a greater reduction in the macropters relative to that of the brachyters. These results indicated that NlHsp90 plays an important role for thermotolerance in N. lugens, and there is difference on induction between two morphs.",

     "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that melatonin (MEL) blocks the inhibition of the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption caused by menadione (MEN). The purpose of this study were to determine whether MEL not only restores but also prevents the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption inhibited either by MEN or BSO, two drugs that deplete glutathione (GSH) in different ways, and to analyze the mechanisms by which MEN and MEL alter the movement of Ca2\u00a0+ across the duodenum. To know this, chicks were divided into four groups: 1) controls, 2) MEN treated, 3) MEL treated, and 4) treated sequentially with MEN and MEL or with MEN and MEL at the same time. In a set of experiments, chicks treated with BSO or sequentially with BSO and MEL or with BSO and MEL at the same time were used. MEL not only restored but also prevented the inhibition of the chick intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption produced by either MEN or BSO. MEN altered the protein expression of molecules involved in the transcellular as well as in the paracellular pathway of the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption. MEL restored partially both pathways through normalization of the O2\u2212 levels. The nitrergic system was not altered by any treatment. In conclusion, MEL prevents or restores the inhibition of the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption caused by different GSH depleting drugs. It might become one drug for the treatment of intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption under oxidant conditions having the advantage of low or null side effects.",

     "abstract": "Increases in swimming ability have a profound influence on larval fish growth and survival by increasing foraging success, predator avoidance and the ability to favorably influence transport. Understanding how development and environmental factors combine to influence swimming performance in aquatic organisms is particularly important during the transition from viscous to inertial environments. We measured the growth, development and ontogenetic changes in critical swimming speed (Ucrit) in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae reared at three temperatures (7, 11, 15\u00a0\u00b0C). Temperature had a significant effect on growth rates (from 0.21 at 7\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.34\u00a0mm\u00b7d\u2212\u00a01 at 15\u00a0\u00b0C), and larval morphology-at-length (increased dry weight (DW), body height and developmental rate at warmer temperatures). Temperature-dependent differences in morphology influenced swimming performance (e.g. the exponential increase in Ucrit with increasing body size was faster at warmer temperatures). Larvae entered the transition to an inertial environment (Reynolds numbers \u2265\u00a0300) at body lengths between 15 (15\u00a0\u00b0C) and 17\u00a0mm (7\u00a0\u00b0C). Inter-individual differences in Ucrit were not related to nutritional condition (RNA\u00b7DNA\u2212\u00a01 or DNA\u00b7DW\u2212\u00a01), but were negatively correlated to length-at-age, suggesting a trade-off between growth rate and locomotor activity. The Ucrit data from this and previously published studies suggest that Atlantic herring pass through four activity phases: 1) yolk-sac (<\u00a00.6\u00a0cm\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01), 2) pre-flexion (0.6\u20133.0\u00a0cm\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01, temperature effect changes with body size), 3) post-flexion (up to 6\u20138\u00a0cm\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01, Q10\u00a0~\u00a01.8\u20132.0), 4) juvenile\u2013adult period (20\u2013170\u00a0cm\u00b7s\u2212\u00a01).",

     "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates and possesses key hypophysiotropic functions. Early studies have shown that DA has a potent inhibitory effect on somatolactin (SL) release in fish. However, the mechanisms responsible for DA inhibition of SL gene expression are largely unknown. To this end, tilapia DA type-1 (D1) and type-2 (D2) receptor transcripts were examined in the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the tilapia pituitary by real-time PCR. In tilapia, DA not only was effective in inhibiting SL mRNA levels in vivo and in vitro, but also could abolish pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)- and salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH)-stimulated SL gene expression at the pituitary level. In parallel studies, the specific D2 receptor agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine could mimic the DA-inhibited SL gene expression. Furthermore, the D2 receptor antagonists domperidone and (\u2212)-sulpiride could abolish the SL response to DA or the D2 agonist quinpirole, whereas D1 receptor antagonists SCH23390 and SKF83566 were not effective in this respect. In primary cultures of tilapia NIL cells, D2 agonist quinpirole-inhibited cAMP production could be blocked by co-treatment with the D2 antagonist domperidone and the ability of forskolin to increase cAMP production was also inhibited by quinpirole. Using a pharmacological approach, the AC/cAMP pathway was shown to be involved in quinpirole-inhibited SL mRNA expression. These results provide evidence that DA can directly inhibit SL gene expression at the tilapia pituitary level via D2 receptor through the AC/cAMP-dependent mechanism.",

Larvae were sampled at 10, 18, 30 and 60\u00a0days post-hatch. In each sampling day, larvae were sampled every 3\u00a0h during a complete 24\u00a0h cycle. The enzyme activity and gene expression exhibited a marked dependent behavior to the light/darkness cycle in all tested ages. The patterns of activity and expression of all tested enzymes were compared to the feeding pattern found in the same larvae, which showed a rhythmic feeding pattern with a strong light synchronization. In the four tested ages, the activities of trypsin, and to a lesser extent lipases and amylase, were related to feeding activity. Molecular expression of the pancreatic enzymes tended to increase during the night, probably as an anticipation of the forthcoming ingestion of food that will take place during the next light period. It follows that the enzymatic activities are being regulated at translational and/or post-translational level. The potential variability of enzyme secretion along the whole day is an important factor to take into account in future studies. A particularly striking consequence of the present results is the reliability of studies based in only one daily sample taken at the same hour of the day, as those focused to assess ontogeny of digestive enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Evaluating the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in insects has provided a number of challenges. Visual observations of endpoints (onset of spasms, loss of righting response, etc.) can be difficult to measure consistently, especially with smaller insects. To resolve this problem, Lighton and Turner (2004) developed a new technique: thermolimit respirometry (TLR). TLR combines real time measurements of both metabolism ( V \u00b7 CO2) and activity to provide two independent, objective measures of CTmax. However, several questions still remain regarding the precision of TLR and how accurate it is in relation to traditional methods. Therefore, we evaluated CTmax of bed bugs using both traditional (visual) methods and TLR at three important metabolic periods following feeding (1\u00a0d, 9\u00a0d, and 21\u00a0d). Both methods provided similar estimates of CTmax, although traditional methods produced consistently lower values (0.7\u20131\u00a0\u00b0C lower than TLR). Despite similar levels of precision, TLR provided a more complete profile of thermal tolerance, describing changes in metabolism and activity leading up to the CTmax, not available through traditional methods. In addition, feeding status had a significant effect on bed bug CTmax, with bed bugs starved 9\u00a0d (45.19[\u00b1\u00a00.20]\u00a0\u00b0C) having the greatest thermal tolerance, followed by bed bugs starved 1\u00a0d (44.64[\u00b1\u00a00.28]\u00a0\u00b0C), and finally bed bugs starved 21\u00a0d (44.12[\u00b1\u00a00.28]\u00a0\u00b0C). Accuracy of traditional visual methods in relation to TLR is highly dependent on the selected endpoint; however, when performed correctly, both methods provide precise, accurate, and reliable estimations of CTmax.",

At 10\u00a0\u00b0C, maturation stopped in the A spermatogonial stage (SPG1), and no further maturation was observed until the temperature was \u2265\u00a015\u00a0\u00b0C. With the aim of explaining these results, the influence of temperature on steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and steroid synthesis was tested. The initial synthesis of androgens (T and 11-KT) increased at SPG1, and was not influenced by temperature. Likewise, the gene expression of the steroidogenic enzymes linked to androgen synthesis (aacyp11a1, aacyp17-I and aa11\u03b2HSD) also increased at SPG1. In contrast, no correlation was seen between the increase in E2 and the aacyp19a1 gene expression peak in the testes, with E2 increasing as a consequence of the seawater acclimation carried out before hormonal treatment, and peaking the aacyp19a1 gene expression at B spermatogonial stage (SPG2). Aacyp21 gene expression was also higher at SPG2, and this stage was only reached when the rearing temperature was \u2265\u00a015\u00a0\u00b0C.In conclusion, androgen synthesis is not dependent on temperature, but further maturation requires higher temperatures in order to induce a change in the steroidogenic pathway towards estrogen and progestin synthesis. This study demonstrates that temperature plays a crucial role in European eel maturation, even perhaps controlling gonad development during the reproductive migration.",

     "abstract": "Regulation of internal ion homeostasis is essential for fishes inhabiting environments where salinities differ from their internal concentrations. It is hypothesized that selection will reduce energetic costs of osmoregulation in a population's native osmotic habitat, producing patterns of local adaptation. Killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, occupy estuarine habitats where salinities range from fresh to seawater. Populations inhabiting an environmental salinity gradient differ in physiological traits associated with acclimation to acute salinity stress, consistent with local adaptation. Similarly, metabolic rates differ in populations adapted to different temperatures, but have not been studied in regard to salinity. We investigated evidence for local adaptation between populations of killifish native to fresh and brackish water habitats. Aerobic scope (the difference between minimum and maximum metabolic rates), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and swimming performance (time and distance to reach exhaustion) were used as proxies for fitness in fresh and brackish water treatments. Swimming performance results supported local adaptation; fish native to brackish water habitats performed significantly better than freshwater-native fish at high salinity while low salinity performance was similar between populations. However, results from metabolic measures did not support this conclusion; both populations showed an increase in resting metabolic rate and a decrease of aerobic scope in fresh water. Similarly, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was higher for both populations in fresh than in brackish water. While swimming results suggest that environmentally dependent performance differences may be a result of selection in divergent osmotic environments, the differences between populations are not coupled with divergence in metabolic performance.",

While our understanding of its impact on their physiological and behavioral responses is increasing, little is known about their reproductive responses under future scenarios of anthropogenic climate change. In this study, we examined the physiological energetics of the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to CO2-induced seawater acidification during gonadal maturation. Three recirculating systems filled with 600 L of seawater were manipulated to three pH levels (8.0, 7.7, and 7.4) corresponding to control and projected pH levels for 2100 and 2300. In each system, temperature was gradually increased ca. 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C per day from 10 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0days and maintained at 20\u00a0\u00b0C for the following 40\u00a0days. Irrespective of seawater pH levels, clearance rate (CR), respiration rate (RR), ammonia excretion rate (ER), and scope for growth (SFG) increased after a 30-day stepwise warming protocol. When seawater pH was reduced, CR, ratio of oxygen to nitrogen, and SFG significantly decreased concurrently, whereas ammonia ER increased. RR was virtually unaffected under acidified conditions. Neither temperature nor acidification showed a significant effect on food absorption efficiency. Our findings indicate that energy is allocated away from reproduction under reduced seawater pH, potentially resulting in an impaired or suppressed reproductive function. This interpretation is based on the fact that spawning was induced in only 56% of the clams grown at pH 7.4. Seawater acidification can therefore potentially impair the physiological energetics and spawning capacity of R. philippinarum.",

American eel (Anguilla rostrata) is well known to harbor distinct ecotypes within a single panmictic population. We examined the expression of genes involved in the regulation of appetite as well as lipid and glycogen among glass eels migrating to different locations on the Canadian east coast and captured at two different periods of upstream migration. Gene expression levels of three reference and five candidate genes were analyzed by real-time PCR with Taqman probes in recently captured wild glass eels. All gene transcripts were detected in glass eels. Of the five candidate genes, bile salt activated and triacylglycerol lipases were respectively 7.65 and 3.25 times more expressed in glass eels from the St. Lawrence estuary than in those from Nova Scotia, and there was no effect related to the two-week difference in capture date. These two genes explained 82.41% of the dissimilarity between the two rivers. In contrast, glycogen phosphorylase, ghrelin, and leptin receptor genes showed no significant differences in gene transcription. These results confirmed at the molecular level an observation that was recently made at the phenotypic level that glass eels from the St. Lawrence estuary have a greater capacity to use lipid reserves to sustain their metabolic needs. These observations add to the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that regional phenotypic variation observed in American eel is determined early in life and that part of this variation is likely under genetic control.",

     "abstract": "In the context of global change, the physiological and hormonal stress responses have received much attention because of their implications in terms of allostasis. However, most studies have focused on glucocorticoids only as the \u201ccommon\u201d response to stressors while neglecting other endocrine axes and hormones (e.g. prolactin, thyroid hormones) that play a crucial role in metabolic adjustments. Interestingly, the responsiveness of all these endocrine axes to stress may depend on the energetic context and this context-dependent stress response has been overlooked so far. In the wild, temperature can vary to a large extent within a short time window and ambient temperature may affect these metabolic-related endocrine axes, and potentially, their responsiveness to an acute stressor. Here, we explicitly tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of a standardized stress protocol on multiple hormonal responses in the rock pigeon (Columbia livia). We tested the effect of an acute restraint stress on (1) corticosterone levels, (2) prolactin levels, and (3) thyroid hormone levels (triiodothyronine, thyroxine) in pigeons that were held either at cool temperature (experimental birds) or at room temperature (control birds) during the stress protocol. Although we found a significant influence of restraint stress on most hormone levels (corticosterone, prolactin, and thyroxine), triiodothyronine levels were not affected by the restraint stress. This demonstrates that stressors can have significant impact on multiple endocrine mechanisms. Importantly, all of these hormonal responses to stress were not affected by temperature, demonstrating that the exposure to cold temperature does not affect the way these hormone levels change in response to handling stress. This suggests that some endocrine responses to temperature decreases may be overridden by the endocrine responses to an acute restraint stress.",

These different temperature regimes pose distinct challenges to locomotion by smelt. Steady swimming performance, red muscle function and muscle myosin content were examined to assess the prediction that cold acclimation by smelt will lead to improved steady swimming performance and that any performance shift will be associated with changes in red muscle function and in its myosin heavy chain composition. Cold acclimated (4\u00a0\u00b0C) smelt had a faster maximum steady swimming speed and swam with a higher tailbeat frequency than warm acclimated (10\u00a0\u00b0C) smelt when tested at the same temperature (10\u00a0\u00b0C). Muscle mechanics experiments demonstrated faster contractile properties in the cold acclimated fish when tested at 10\u00a0\u00b0C. The red muscle of cold acclimated smelt had a shorter twitch times, a shorter relaxation times and a higher maximum shortening velocity. In addition, red muscle from cold acclimated fish displayed reduced thermal sensitivity to cold, maintaining higher force levels at 4\u00a0\u00b0C compared to red muscle from warm acclimated fish. Immunohistochemistry suggests shifts in muscle myosin composition and a decrease in muscle cross-sectional area with cold acclimation. Dot blot analysis confirmed a shift in myosin content. Rainbow smelt do show a significant thermal acclimation response to cold. An examination of published values of maximum muscle shortening velocity in fishes suggests that smelt are particularly well suited to high levels of activity in very cold water.",

A classic example is the maximum duration of dives by breath-hold divers, which scales with M0.25, as predicted from the ratio of oxygen stores (M1.0) to diving oxygen consumption rate (M0.75) \u2014 assuming classic scaling relationships for those physiological processes. However, maximum dive duration in some groups of birds does not have a 0.25 scaling exponent. We re-examined the allometric scaling of maximum dive duration in auks to test whether the discrepancy was due to poor data (earlier analyses included data from many different sources possibly leading to bias), phylogeny (earlier analyses did not account for phylogenetic inertia) or physiology (earlier analyses did not analyze physiological parameters alongside behavioral parameters). When we included only data derived from electronic recorders and after accounting for phylogeny, the equation for maximum dive duration was proportional to M0.33. At the same time, myoglobin concentration in small breath-hold divers was proportional to M0.36, implying that muscle oxygen stores were proportional to M1.36, but diving oxygen consumption rate in wing-propelled divers was only proportional to M0.79. Thus, the 99% confidence interval included the exponent of 0.57 predicted from the observed relationships between oxygen stores and consumption rates. In conclusion, auks are not exceptions to the hypothesis that a trade-off between oxygen stores and oxygen utilization drives variation in maximum dive duration. Rather, the scaling exponent for maximum dive duration is higher than expected due to the higher than expected scaling of muscle oxygen stores to body mass.",

This study aimed to determine whether macronutrients modulate the expression of ghrelin and the nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) encoded nesfatin-1 in goldfish (Carassius auratus). Fish were fed once daily on control, high-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat and very high-fat diets for 7 (short-term) or 28 (long-term) days. The expression of preproghrelin, ghrelin O-acyl transferase (goat), growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1 (ghs-r1) and nucb2/nesfatin-1 mRNAs was quantified in the hypothalamus, pituitary, gut and liver. Short-term feeding with fat-enriched diets significantly increased nucb2 mRNA levels in hypothalamus and liver, preproghrelin, goat and ghs-r1 expression in pituitary, and ghs-r1 expression in gut. Fish fed on a high-protein diet exhibited a significant reduction in preproghrelin and ghs-r1 mRNAs in the liver. After long-term feeding, fish fed on high-carbohydrate and very high-fat diets had significantly increased preproghrelin, goat and ghs-r1 expression in pituitary. Feeding on a high-carbohydrate diet also upregulated goat and ghs-r1 transcripts in gut, while feeding on a high-fat diet elicited the same effect only for ghs-r1 in liver. Nucb2 expression increased in pituitary, while it decreased in gut after long-term feeding of a high-protein diet. Collectively, these results show for the first time in fish that macronutrients differentially regulate the expression of ghrelinergic and NUCB2/nesfatin-1 systems in central and peripheral tissues of goldfish.",

     "abstract": "An important means of physiological adaptation to environmental hypoxia is an increased oxygen (O2) affinity of the hemoglobin (Hb) that can help secure high O2 saturation of arterial blood. However, the trade-off associated with a high Hb\u2013O2 affinity is that it can compromise O2 unloading in the systemic capillaries. High-altitude deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) have evolved an increased Hb\u2013O2 affinity relative to lowland conspecifics, but it is not known whether they have also evolved compensatory mechanisms to facilitate O2 unloading to respiring tissues. Here we investigate the effects of pH (Bohr effect) and temperature on the O2-affinity of high- and low-altitude deer mouse Hb variants, as these properties can potentially facilitate O2 unloading to metabolizing tissues.Our experiments revealed that Bohr factors for the high- and low-altitude Hb variants are very similar in spite of the differences in O2-affinity. The Bohr factors of deer mouse Hbs are also comparable to those of other mammalian Hbs. In contrast, the high- and low-altitude variants of deer mouse Hb exhibited similarly low temperature sensitivities that were independent of red blood cell anionic cofactors, suggesting an appreciable endothermic allosteric transition upon oxygenation. In conclusion, high-altitude deer mice have evolved an adaptive increase in Hb\u2013O2 affinity, but this is not associated with compensatory changes in sensitivity to changes in pH or temperature. Instead, it appears that the elevated Hb\u2013O2 affinity in high-altitude deer mice is compensated by an associated increase in the tissue diffusion capacity of O2 (via increased muscle capillarization), which promotes O2 unloading.",

     "abstract": "Snake venom toxins are related not only in detention, death and the promotion of initial digestion of prey but also due to their different biochemical, structural and pharmacological effects they can result in new drugs. Among these toxins snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs) should be highlighted because they are responsible for inducing changes in physiological functions such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and platelet aggregation. This article presents the first serine protease (SP) isolated from Bothrops brazili: BbrzSP-32. The new SP showed 36\u00a0kDa of relative molecular mass and its absolute mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry as 32,520\u00a0Da. It presents 79.48% identity when compared to other SVSPs and was able to degrade the \u03b1-chain of fibrinogen, in in vitro models, because of this it is considered a SVTLE-A. It showed dose-dependent activity in the process of degradation of fibrin networks demonstrating greater specificity for this activity when compared to its thrombolytic action. BbrzSP-32 demonstrated proteolytic activity on gelatin and chromogenic substrates for serine proteases and thrombin-like enzymes (S-2288 and S-2238 respectively), besides having coagulant activity on human plasma. After pre-incubation with PMSF and benzamidine the coagulant and proteolytic activities on the S-2288 and S-2238 substrates were reduced. BbrzSP-32 shows stability against pH and temperature variations, demonstrating optimum activity between 30 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C and in the pH range 7.5 to 8.5. A new SP with potential biotechnological application was isolated.",

At 3\u00a0h of incubation after LIPUS treatment, osteoclastic markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K mRNA expressions decreased significantly while mRNA expressions of osteoblastic markers, osteocalcin, distal-less homeobox 5, runt-related transcription factor 2a, and runt-related transcription factor 2b, increased significantly. At 6 and 18\u00a0h of incubation, however, both osteoclastic and osteoblastic marker mRNA expression did not change at least present conditions. Using GeneChip analysis of zebrafish scales treated with LIPUS, we found that cell death-related genes were upregulated with LIPUS treatment. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the expression of apoptosis-related genes also increased significantly. To confirm the involvement of apoptosis in osteoclasts with LIPUS, osteoclasts were induced by autotransplanting scales in goldfish. Thereafter, the DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis was detected in osteoclasts using the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) method. The multi-nuclei of TRAP-stained osteoclasts in the scales were labeled with TUNEL. TUNEL staining showed that the number of apoptotic osteoclasts in goldfish scales was significantly elevated by treatment with LIPUS at 3\u00a0h of incubation. Thus, we are the first to demonstrate that LIPUS directly functions to osteoclasts and to conclude that LIPUS directly causes apoptosis in osteoclasts shortly after exposure.",

The effect of temperature on SDA has not been studied in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, Bonnaterre 1788), an active pelagic predator that occupies temperate and subtropical waters. The energetic cost and duration of SDA were calculated by comparing routine and post-prandial oxygen consumption rates.

     "abstract": "In this comparative study, osmoregulatory mechanisms were analyzed in two closely related species of palaemonid shrimp from Brazil, Macrobrachium pantanalense and Macrobrachium amazonicum. A previous investigation showed that all postembryonic stages of M. pantanalense from inland waters of the Pantanal are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water, while this species was not able to hypo-osmoregulate at high salinities. In M. amazonicum originating from the Amazon estuary, in contrast, all stages are able to hypo-osmoregulate, but only first-stage larvae, late juveniles and adults are able to hyper-osmoregulate in fresh water. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these physiological differences have not been known. We therefore investigated the expression patterns of three ion transporters (NKA \u03b1-subunit, VHA B-subunit and NHE3) following differential salinity acclimation in different ontogenetic stages (stage-V larvae, juveniles) of both species. Larval NKA\u03b1 expression was at both salinities significantly higher in M. pantanalense than in M. amazonicum, whereas no difference was noted in juveniles. VHA was also more expressed in larvae of M. pantanalense than in those of M. amazonicum. When NHE3 expression is compared between the larvae of the two species, further salinity-related differences were observed, with generally higher expression in the inland species. Overall, a high expression of ion pumps in M. pantanalense suggests an evolutionary key role of these transporters in freshwater invasion.",

Ammonia excretion was suggested to take place partially via the hypodermis, involving the Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), V-ATPase (VAT), carbonic anhydrase, NHX-3 and a functional microtubule network and at least one Rh-like ammonia transporter RHR-1. In the current study, we show that a second Rh-protein, RHR-2, is highly expressed in the hypodermis, here also in the apical membrane of that tissue. To further characterize the role of RHR-2 in ammonia excretion, a knock-out mutant rhr-2 (ok403), further referred to as \u2206\u00a0rhr-2, was employed. Compared to wild-type worms (N2), this mutant showed a lower rate of ammonia excretion and a lower hypodermal H+ excretion rate. At the same time rhr-1, nka, vat, and nhx-3 showed higher mRNA expression levels when compared to N2. Also, in contrast to N2 worms, \u2206\u00a0rhr-2 did not show enhanced ammonia excretion rates when exposed to a low pH environment, suggesting that RHR-2 represents the apical NH3 pathway that allows ammonia trapping via the hypodermis in N2 worms. A hypothetical model for the mechanism of hypodermal ammonia excretion is proposed on the basis of data in this and previous investigations.",

In the autumn, the intestinal mass (Mi) was 1.0% of body mass and the scaling exponent b\u00a0=\u00a00.92 indicated that Mi was larger in smaller neonates. During arousal from dormancy Mi was 23% smaller; later in spring, Mi increased 60% in relation to the autumn and the exponent b\u00a0=\u00a00.14 indicated that the recovery was disproportionate in smaller tegus. During the autumn, the intestinal villi were greatly elongated; by midwinter, the Hv, SvEp, and VvEp were smaller than during the autumn (59%, 54%, 29%) and were restored to autumn levels during spring. In the active tegus, the maximum activity (Vmax) of enzymes indicated that the enterocytes can obtain energy from different sources, and possess gluconeogenic capacity. During winter, the Vmax of CS, HOAD, GDH, PEPCK was 40\u201350% lower in relation to the autumn and spring, while the Vmax of HK, PK, LDH, AST was unchanged. The hypoglycemia and the mucosal atrophy/ischemia during winter would prevent the enterocytes from using glucose, whereas they could slowly oxidize fatty acids released from body stores and amino acids from the tissue proteolysis to satisfy their needs of energy. Contrastingly, starvation during spring caused severe mass loss (50%); the tissue protein and the VvEp and VvLP did not change while the thickness of the muscular layer increased 51%, which suggested different effects along the length of the organ. In addition, the Vmax of the glycolytic enzymes was lower, indicating that a regulatory mechanism would spare blood glucose for vital organs during unanticipated food restriction.",

The aims of the present experiment are to confirm the identity of the core protein of KSPG, identify a marker of medullary bone metabolism, and determine whether changes in keratan sulfate (KS) concentration in blood are associated with the egg-laying cycle. Using two different isolation techniques- one specific for bone and another for blood- we have identified bone sialoprotein (BSP) to be the core protein of this KSPG. We also determined that the amount of keratan sulfate (KS) in laying hen blood fluctuates in synchrony with the egg-laying cycle, and thus can serve as a specific marker for medullary bone metabolism. During the course of this investigation, we also found FGF-23 (phosphatonin) to be expressed in medullary bone, in synchrony with the egg-laying cycle. Western blotting was used to demonstrate the presence of this peptide in both laying hen blood and medullary bone extracts. The importance of FGF-23 (phosphatonin) and parathyroid hormone in normalizing the dramatic changes in plasma calcium and phosphorus during the 24\u00a0h egg-laying cycle is discussed.",

In the present study, we cloned and characterized leptin B gene (sLEP-B) in mandarin fish, including a 471\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 158-amino acid protein. The three-dimensional (3D) structural model of sLEP-B protein showed a highly conserved of tertiary structure similar to that of other vertebrates. Genomic sequencing results indicated that sLEP-B possessed only one intron. This is the first report of the loss of an intron in LEP-B in Perciformes. The different distribution patterns of sLEPs suggest different physiological roles of these two genes. The presence of HNF3\u03b2, a liver-enriched transcription factor, only in sLEP-A indicated abundant expression and metabolic function of sLEP-A in the liver. In an in vivo experiment, the expressions of brain sLEP-A and sLEP-B were observed to increase after a meal. During the short-term fasting, the expressions of sLEPs in mandarin fish brain were decreased significantly. A persistent and significant increase in hepatic sLEP-A expression supported a relationship between leptin and food intake in mandarin fish. These results suggest that sLEP-A plays an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis in this carnivorous fish, and sLEP-B is probably a specialized gene responsible for the central nervous system (CNS) control of energy regulation.",

The mRNA expression of Odfxyd11 and Odnka-\u03b1 was elevated 48\u00a0h post-hypoosmotic transfer. Moreover, FXYD11 protein and NKA activity were upregulated 12\u00a0h after transfer to FW.

To clarify the FXYD11 mechanisms involved in modulating NKA activity via their interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was further applied to O. dancena gills. The results revealed that the levels of protein\u2013protein interaction between branchial NKA and FXYD11 increased acutely 12\u00a0h after the transfer from BW to FW. However, immediate upregulation of NKA activity 1\u00a0h following post-exposure to SW, without the elevation of protein\u2013protein interaction levels, was found.

     "abstract": "The gut sac is a long-standing, widely used in vitro preparation for studying solute and water transport, and calculation of these fluxes requires an accurate assessment of volume. This is commonly determined gravimetrically by measuring the change in mass over time. While convenient this likely under-estimates actual net water flux (Jv) due to tissue edema. We evaluated whether the popular in vivo volume marker [14C]-PEG 4000, offers a more representative measure of Jv in vitro. We directly compared these two methods in five teleost species (toadfish, flounder, rainbow trout, killifish and tilapia). Net fluid absorption by the toadfish intestine based on PEG was significantly higher, by almost 4-fold, compared to gravimetric measurements, compatible with the latter under-estimating Jv. Despite this, PEG proved inconsistent for all of the other species frequently resulting in calculation of net secretion, in contrast to absorption seen gravimetrically. Such poor parallelism could not be explained by the absorption of [14C]-PEG (typically <\u00a01%). We identified a number of factors impacting the effectiveness of PEG. One was adsorption to the surface of sample tubes. While it was possible to circumvent this using unlabelled PEG 4000, this had a deleterious effect on PEG-based Jv. We also found sequestration of PEG within the intestinal mucus. In conclusion, the short-comings associated with the accurate representation of Jv by gut sac preparations are not overcome by [14C]-PEG. The gravimetric method therefore remains the most reliable measure of Jv and we urge caution in the use of PEG as a volume marker.",

     "abstract": "A complementary DNA (cDNA) that encodes the vitellogenin receptor (VgR) in the oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense, was cloned using expressed sequence tag analysis and a rapid amplification of cDNA ends approach. The coding region consists of 5920 base pairs (bp) that encode a 1902 amino acid protein, with a predicted molecular mass of 209\u00a0kDa. The coding region is flanked by a 45\u00a0bp 5\u02b9-untranslated region (UTR) and a 166\u00a0bp 3\u02b9-UTR. The deduced amino acid sequence of the M. nipponense VgR cDNA had typically conserved domains, such as an extracellular, lipoprotein-binding domain, epidermal growth factor-like and O-glycosylation domains, a transmembrane domain and a short C-terminal, cytosolic tail. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) indicated that Mn-VgR is highly expressed in the female ovary. Expression analysis by qPCR demonstrated the larval and ovarian developmental stage-specific expression pattern. As the ovaries developed, the expression level of Mn-VgR gradually increased during the reproductive cycle (stage I), to reach a peak in stage III. Levels then dropped as a new development cycle was entered after reproduction molting. Eyestalk ablation led to a significant increase in the expression of Mn-VgR during the ovarian development stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), when compared with the eyestalk-intact group. The investigation revealed that eyestalk ablation initially affected Mn-VgR expression and then influenced vitellogenesis. In adult females, VgR RNA interference (RNAi) dramatically delayed the maturation of the ovary, in accordance with the gonad somatic index. In addition, Mn-VgR RNAi led to vitellin depletion in the oocytes and the accumulation of vitellin in the hepatopancreas.",

     "abstract": "Immune defense involves inflammatory reactions in which immune cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to fight pathogens. ROS may however cause damage to the host if they are not balanced by antioxidant defenses. Therefore, one should expect individuals undergoing an immune reaction to use antioxidants to prevent oxidative stress. Antioxidants are vital compounds that provide important protection against oxidative damage of embryos and newly hatched chicks. Thus, during egg laying a female that contracted an infection may face a trade-off between the allocation of antioxidants into self-maintenance and into her offspring via the eggs. In our study we investigated whether immunized females face this trade-off and consequently modify the antioxidant allocation into the eggs and whether this allocation affects offspring performance. We injected female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with lipopolysaccharide prior to egg laying while some females were left unimmunized. We removed the second egg of each clutch, while we allowed the other eggs to hatch. We assessed oxidative stress in females 24\u00a0h after immunization, yolk antioxidant capacity of the second egg of the clutch and survival success of the offspring until adulthood. Compared to controls, immunized females had higher oxidative damage, but similar plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant levels. The treatment did not affect yolk antioxidants, clutch size, laying date and offspring survival. However, we found a positive correlation between yolk antioxidant capacity and offspring survival, irrespective of the treatment. Our study suggests that our immune challenge may not have changed female strategy of antioxidant allocation between self-maintenance and offspring survival.",

     "abstract": "Due to their large metabolic responses to digestion (specific dynamic action, SDA), snakes represent an interesting animal group to identify the underlying mechanisms for the postprandial rise in metabolism. The SDA response results from the energetic costs of many different processes ranging over prey handling, secretions by the digestive system, synthesis of enzymes, plasticity of most visceral organs, as well as protein synthesis and nitrogen excretion. The contribution of the individual mechanisms, however, remains elusive. Gastric acid secretion has been proposed to account for more than half of the SDA response, while other studies report much lower contributions of the gastric processes. To investigate the energetic cost of gastric acid secretion, ball pythons (Python regius) were fed meals with added amounts of bone meal (up to 25\u00a0g\u00a0bone\u00a0meal\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 snake) to achieve a five-fold rise in the buffer capacity of the meals. Direct measurements within the stomach lumen showed similar reduction in gastric pH when buffer capacity was increased, but we found no effects on the rise in oxygen consumption over the first three days of digestion. There was, however, a slower return of oxygen consumption to resting baseline. We conclude that gastric acid secretion only contributes modestly to the SDA response and propose that post-absorptive processes, such as increased protein synthesis, are likely to underlie the SDA response.",

     "abstract": "Climate change and urbanisation of watercourses affect water temperatures and current flow velocities in river systems on a global scale. This represents a particularly critical issue for migratory fish species with complex life histories that use rivers to reproduce. Salmonids are migratory keystone species that provide substantial economical value to ecosystems and human societies. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of environmental stressors on their reproductive success is critical in order to ensure their continued abundance during future climatic change. Salmonids are capital breeders, relying entirely on endogenous energy stores to fuel return migration to their natal spawning sites and reproduction upon arrival. Metabolic rates and cost of transport en-route increase with temperature and at extreme temperatures, swimming is increasingly fuelled anaerobically, resulting in an oxygen debt and reduced capacity to recover from exhaustive exercise. Thermally challenged salmonids also produce less viable gametes, which themselves are affected by water temperature after release. Passage through hydrological barriers and temperature changes both affect energy expenditure. As a result, important energetic tradeoffs emerge between extra energy used during migration and that available for other facets of the reproductive cycle, such as reproductive competition and gamete production. However, studies identifying these tradeoffs are extremely sparse. This review focuses on the specific locomotor responses of salmonids to thermal and hydrological challenges, identifying gaps in our knowledge and highlighting the potential implications for key aspects of their reproduction.",

The duration of the HSR was examined by allowing the fish to recover for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, or 48\u00a0h following a 2\u00a0h HS. In embryos, at the fin flutter stage, only hsp70 mRNA levels were upregulated in response to the various HS treatments. By comparison, all three typically inducible hsps, hsp90\u03b1, hsp70 and hsp47, were upregulated in the YOY juveniles. In both instances the HSR was long lasting, but much more so in embryos where hsp70 mRNA levels continued to increase for 48\u00a0h after a 2\u00a0h HS and remained significantly higher than untreated controls. Collectively our data indicate that both embryo and YOY juvenile lake whitefish have a robust HSR which permits them to survive a 4\u00a0h, 9\u00a0\u00b0C HS. Moreover, both life history stages are capable of triggering a HSR following a moderate 3\u00a0\u00b0C HS which is likely an important protective mechanism against environmental stressors during embryogenesis and early life history stages of lake whitefish.",

     "abstract": "The North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) is a partially euryhaline species of elasmobranch that often enter estuaries where they experience relatively large fluctuations in environmental salinity that can affect plasma osmolality. Previous studies have investigated the effects of altered salinity on elasmobranchs over the long term, but fewer studies have conducted time courses to investigate how rapidly they can adapt to such changes. In this study, we exposed unfed (no exogenous source of nitrogen or TMAO) spiny dogfish to hyper- and hypo-osmotic conditions and measured plasma and tissue osmolytes, nitrogen excretion, and changes in enzyme activity and mRNA levels in the rectal gland over 24\u00a0h. It was shown that plasma osmolality changes to approximately match the ambient seawater within 18\u201324\u00a0h. In the hypersaline environment, significant increases in urea, sodium, and chloride were observed, whereas in the hyposaline environment, only significant decreases in TMAO and sodium were observed. Both urea and ammonia excretion increased at low salinities suggesting a reduction in urea retention and possibly urea production. qPCR and enzyme activity data for Na+/K+-ATPase did not support the idea of rectal gland activation following exposure to increased salinities. Therefore, we suggest that the rectal gland may not be a quantitatively important aspect of the dogfish osmoregulatory strategy during changes in environmental salinity, or it may be active only in the very early stages (i.e., less than 6\u00a0h) of responses to altered salinity.",

Then, the feed intake (FI), food conversion efficiency (FCE), specific growth rate (SGR), morphological parameters, resting M \u0307 O2 ( M \u0307 O2rest) and postprandial M \u0307 O2 responses of the experimental fish were measured. Exercise at a low velocity (1 bl s\u2212\u00a01) showed no effect on any growth performance parameter, whereas exercise at a high velocity (2 bl s\u2212\u00a01) exhibited higher FI but similar SGR due to the extra energy expenditure from swimming and consequent decreased FCE. Starvation led to a significant body mass loss, whereas the effect intensified in both exercise groups. Exercise resulted in improved cardio-respiratory capacity, as indicated by increased gill and heart indexes, whereas it exhibited no effect on resting and postprandial metabolism in S. meridionalis. The starved fish displayed significantly larger heart, gill and digestive tract indexes compared with the feeding fish, suggesting selective maintenance of cardio-respiratory and digestive function in this fish species during starvation. However, starved fish still exhibited impaired digestive performance, as evidenced by the prolonged duration and low postprandial metabolic increase, and this effect was further exacerbated in both the 1 and 2 bl s\u2212\u00a01 exercise groups. These data suggest the following: (1) aerobic exercise produced no improvement in growth performance but may have led to the impairment of growth under insufficient food conditions; (2) the mass of different organs and tissues responded differently to aerobic exercise and starvation due to the different physiological roles they play; and (3) aerobic exercise had no effect on the postprandial metabolic response under a \u201cnormal feeding\u201d situation, whereas it may have resulted in the impairment of the digestive capacity when food availability was low due to the competition of energy and oxygen under unfavorable conditions in juvenile S. meridionalis.",

     "abstract": "Some small mammals limit energy expenditure during winter conditions through torpor bouts, which are characterized by a decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate. Individuals arise periodically from torpor to restore critical functions requiring euthermia. Although most of the species involved do not feed during hibernation and rely on body reserves to fulfil energy requirements (fat-storing species), others hoard food in a burrow (food-storing species) and can feed during interbout euthermy. Whereas fat-storing species undergo a marked atrophy of the digestive tract, food-storing species have to maintain a functional digestive system during hibernation. Our study aimed to evaluate the absorption capacities of a food-storing species, the European hamster, throughout the annual cycle. In vivo intestinal perfusions were conducted in different groups of hamsters (n\u00a0=\u00a05) during the different life periods, namely before hibernation, in torpor, during interbout euthermy, and during summer rest. The triglyceride, non-esterified free fatty acid, starch, glucose and protein composition of the perfusate was evaluated before and after the 1\u00a0h perfusion of a closed intestinal loop. Triglyceride, starch and protein hydrolysis rates were similar in hibernating (torpid and euthermic) and non-hibernating hamsters. Intestinal absorption of free fatty acid was also similar in all groups. However, glucose uptake rate was higher during hibernation than during the summer. In contrast with fat-storing species, the intestinal absorption capacities of food-storing species are fully maintained during hibernation to optimize nutrient assimilation during short interbout euthermy. In particular, glucose uptake rate is increased during hibernation to restore glycaemia and ensure glucose-dependent pathways.",

     "abstract": "Scent detection in an aquatic environment is dependent on the movement of water. We set out to determine the mechanisms for moving water through the olfactory organ of guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae, Chondrichthyes) with open nasal cavities. We found at least two. In the first mechanism, which we identified by observing dye movement in the nasal region of a life-sized physical model of the head of Rhinobatos lentiginosus mounted in a flume, olfactory flow is generated by the guitarfish's motion relative to water, e.g. when it swims. We suggest that the pressure difference responsible for motion-driven olfactory flow is caused by the guitarfish's nasal flaps, which create a region of high pressure at the incurrent nostril, and a region of low pressure in and behind the nasal cavity. Vortical structures in the nasal region associated with motion-driven flow may encourage passage of water through the nasal cavity and its sensory channels, and may also reduce the cost of swimming. The arrangement of vortical structures is reminiscent of aircraft wing vortices. In the second mechanism, which we identified by observing dye movement in the nasal regions of living specimens of Glaucostegus typus, the guitarfish's respiratory pump draws flow through the olfactory organ in a rhythmic (0.5\u20132\u00a0Hz), but continuous, fashion. Consequently, the respiratory pump will maintain olfactory flow whether the guitarfish is swimming or at rest. Based on our results, we propose a model for olfactory flow in guitarfishes with open nasal cavities, and suggest other neoselachians which this model might apply to.",

     "publication date": "02-2016",
     "abstract": "Over the last decade, numerous studies have investigated the role of oxygen in setting thermal tolerance in aquatic animals, and there has been particular focus on arthropods. Arthropods comprise one of the most species-rich taxonomic groups on Earth, and display great diversity in the modes of ventilation, circulation, blood oxygen transport, with representatives living both in water (mainly crustaceans) and on land (mainly insects). The oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis proposes that the temperature dependent performance curve of animals is shaped by the capacity for oxygen delivery in relation to oxygen demand. If correct, oxygen limitation could provide a mechanistic framework to understand and predict both current and future impacts of rapidly changing climate.In arthropods, most studies testing the OCLTT hypothesis have considered tolerance to thermal extremes. These studies likely operate from the philosophical viewpoint that if the model can predict these critical thermal limits, then it is more likely to also explain loss of performance at less extreme, non-lethal temperatures, for which much less data is available. Nevertheless, the extent to which lethal temperatures are influenced by limitations in oxygen supply remains unresolved. Here we critically evaluate the support and universal applicability for oxygen limitation being involved in lethal temperatures in crustaceans and insects.The relatively few studies investigating the OCLTT hypothesis at low temperature do not support a universal role for oxygen in setting the lower thermal limits in arthropods. With respect to upper thermal limits, the evidence supporting OCLTT is stronger for species relying on underwater gas exchange, while the support for OCLTT in air-breathers is weak. Overall, strongest support was found for increased anaerobic metabolism close to thermal maxima. In contrast, there was only mixed support for the prediction that aerobic scope decreases near critical temperatures, a key feature of the OCLTT hypothesis. In air-breathers, only severe hypoxia (<\u00a02\u00a0kPa) affected heat tolerance. The discrepancies for heat tolerance between aquatic and terrestrial organisms can to some extent be reconciled by differences in the capacity to increase oxygen transport. As air-breathing arthropods are unlikely to become oxygen limited under normoxia (especially at rest), the oxygen limitation component in OCLTT does not seem to provide sufficient information to explain lethal temperatures. Nevertheless, many animals may simultaneously face hypoxia and thermal extremes and the combination of these potential stressors is particularly relevant for aquatic organisms where hypoxia (and hyperoxia) is more prevalent. In conclusion, whether taxa show oxygen limitation at thermal extremes may be contingent on their capacity to regulate oxygen uptake, which in turn is linked to their respiratory medium (air vs. water).Fruitful directions for future research include testing multiple predictions of OCLTT in the same species. Additionally, we call for greater research efforts towards studying the role of oxygen in thermal limitation of animal performance at less extreme, sub-lethal temperatures, necessitating studies over longer timescales and evaluating whether oxygen becomes limiting for animals to meet energetic demands associated with feeding, digestion and locomotion.",

As such, there is increasing interest in determining how wild animals adapt and respond to environmental stressors.

This study tested whether baseline and maximum (stress-induced) whole-body cortisol concentrations varied in relation to habitat quality and season using wild central mudminnows (Umbra limi) collected from two connected streams differing in habitat quality in each of four seasons. Overall, baseline and maximum cortisol levels did not differ significantly between the two systems but there was evidence of a seasonal effect. Baseline cortisol levels in the fall and summer were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) lower than those in winter and spring and maximum cortisol levels in the summer were significantly lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than those in the spring. Inconsistent with the prevailing paradigm, our results indicate that habitat quality does not always influence baseline GCs or the stress response. In contrast, baseline and maximum GCs in this species do vary seasonally.

However, because the gas concentrations change progressively during closure, the animal inspires air with a progressively increasing CO2 concentration and decreasing O2 concentration. These changes will eventually affect gas exchange causing the O2 and CO2 stores within the animal to change. Because of the higher solubility/capacitance of CO2 in the tissues of the body, V \u02d9 CO2 will be more affected than V \u02d9 O2, and we hypothesize therefore that RER will become progressively underestimated as closure time is prolonged. This hypothesis was addressed by a combination of experimental studies involving closed respirometry on ball pythons (Python regius) as well as mathematical models of gas exchange. We show that increased closed duration of the respirometer reduces RER by up to 13%, and these findings may explain previous reports of RER values being below 0.7. Our model reveals that the maximally possible reduction in RER is determined by the storage capacity of the body for CO2 (product of size and specific capacitance) relative to the respirometer storage capacity. Furthermore, modeling also shows that pronounced ventilatory and circulatory response to hypercapnia can alleviate the reduction in RER.",

     "abstract": "Temperature influences the life history and metabolic parameters of insects. Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri is a tropical and subtropical pest. ACP invaded new regions around the world and threatened the citrus industry as a vector for Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. ACP is widely distributed and can survive high (up to 45\u00a0\u00b0C) and low temperatures (as low as \u2212\u00a06\u00a0\u00b0C). The precise mechanism of temperature tolerance in ACP is poorly understood. We investigated adult survival, cellular energy balance, gene expression, and nucleotide and sugar-nucleotide changes under the effect of different temperature regimes (0\u00a0\u00b0C to 45\u00a0\u00b0C with 5\u00a0\u00b0C intervals). The optimum temperatures for survival were 20 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Low temperatures of 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0\u00b0C caused 50% mortality after 2 and 4\u00a0days respectively, while one day at high temperature (40\u00a0\u00b0C and 45\u00a0\u00b0C) caused more than 95% mortality. The lowest quantity of ATP (3.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0ng/insect) and the maximum ATPase enzyme activities (57.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6\u00a0\u03bcU/insect) were observed at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Correlation between ATP quantities and ATPase activity was negative. Gene expression of hsp 70, V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A and ATP synthase \u03b1 subunit matched these results. Twenty-four nucleotides and sugar-nucleotides were quantified using HPLC in ACP adults maintained at low, high, and optimum temperatures. The nucleotide profiles were different among treatments. The ratios between AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP were significantly decreased and positively correlated to adults survival, whereas the adenylate energy charge was increased in response to low and high temperatures. Exploring energy metabolic regulation in relation with adult survival might help in understanding the physiological basis of how ACP tolerates newly invaded regions.",

Salinity of the euthanasia bath affected plasma Mg2+ and Na+ concentrations as well as osmolality, with higher concentrations in fish euthanized in saltwater.

We examined the effects of wintertime fasting and seasonality on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a regulator of metabolism, and its target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) on the species. Twelve farmed raccoon dogs (eleven females/one male) were divided into two groups: half were fasted for ten weeks in December\u2013March (winter fasted) and the others were fed ad libitum (winter fed). A third group (autumn fed, eight females) was fed ad libitum and sampled in December. Total AMPK, ACC and their phosphorylated forms (pAMPK, pACC) were measured from hypothalamus, liver, intra-abdominal (iWAT) and subcutaneous white adipose tissues (sWAT). The fasted animals lost 32% and the fed 20% of their body mass. Hypothalamic AMPK expression was lower and pACC levels higher in the winter groups compared to the autumn fed group. Liver pAMPK was lower in the winter fasted group, with consistently decreased ACC and pACC. AMPK and pAMPK were down-regulated in sWAT and iWAT of both winter groups, with a parallel decline in pACC in sWAT. The responses of AMPK and ACC to fasting were dissimilar to the effects observed previously in non-seasonal mammals and hibernators. Differences between the winter fed and autumn fed groups indicate that the functions of AMPK and ACC could be regulated in a season-dependent manner. Furthermore, the distinctive effects of prolonged fasting and seasonal adaptation on AMPK\u2013ACC pathway could contribute to the wintering strategy of the raccoon dog.",

     "abstract": "Temperate ectotherms are expected to benefit from climate change (e.g., increased activity time), but the impacts of climate warming during the winter have mostly been overlooked. Milder winters are expected to decrease body condition upon emergence, and thus to affect crucial life-history traits, such as survival and reproduction. Mild winter temperature could also trigger a state of chronic physiological stress due to inadequate thermal conditions that preclude both dormancy and activity. We tested these hypotheses on a typical temperate ectothermic vertebrate, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). We simulated different wintering conditions for three groups of aspic vipers (cold: ~\u00a06\u00a0\u00b0C, mild: ~\u00a014\u00a0\u00b0C and no wintering: ~\u00a024\u00a0\u00b0C) during a one month long period. We found that mild wintering conditions induced a marked decrease in body condition, and provoked an alteration of some hormonal mechanisms involved in emergence. Such effects are likely to bear ultimate consequences on reproduction, and thus population persistence. We emphasize that future studies should incorporate the critical, albeit neglected, winter season when assessing the potential impacts of global changes on ectotherms.",

     "abstract": "Dietary shifting, for example from insects to fruits, is a common mechanism used in migratory songbirds to accumulate fat to fuel migratory flights. We examined a potential underlying cause of dietary shifting in yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata) by comparing energy and protein intake goals of birds during fall migration and winter. We offered captive warblers pairs of three diets differing in macronutrient composition in both the fall and winter. Using the principles of the geometric framework of nutrition we evaluated protein and energy intake to determine if consumption of the diet pairs was adjusted to meet an energy or protein intake target, and if the target differed seasonally. Regardless of season, the warblers preferred the diet with the lowest protein content and highest carbohydrate content. Total energy intake was maintained relatively constant during migration, at around 60\u00a0kJ/day, regardless of diet combination, and at about 50\u00a0kJ/day during winter. This suggests that warblers consume macronutrients available to them without protein limitations to reach their total energy intake target. When the diet combination offered allows, the warblers mixed their diet intake to consume roughly 0.5\u00a0g/day of protein, regardless of season, which suggested a constant protein target. Our findings suggest that songbirds prefer to alter non-protein energy intake proportionally to meet changing energy demand, rather than an overall increase in macronutrient intake. Additionally, they have the ability to shift their diet based on availability, resulting in high flexibility in their macronutrient intakes to maintain energy intake.",

Field observations on the annual activity cycle of C. trizona olympica revealed that snails' activity was restricted mainly between the end of May and September, when the higher temperatures were recorded, while first matings were recorded in July and the last ones in mid September indicating a restricted favorable time period for reproduction. The activities of enzymes of intermediate metabolism showed a periodic seasonal pattern of change which seems to be closely related to the pattern of annual changes of air temperature and most of them exhibited higher activities during the coldest and warmest periods of the year. Moreover the data indicate a distinct differentiation of fuel oxidation during arousal and reproductive periods with lipid oxidation, apart from carbohydrates, contributing significantly to ATP turnover during reproductive activity. The higher enzymatic activities, determined in the tissues of C. trizona olympica than the corresponding ones determined in the tissues of the land snail species living at low altitudes, might indicate higher sensitivity of the intermediate metabolism and ATP turnover in C. trizona olympica to changes in environmental factors.

Fish performance, body composition and intestinal nutrient absorption capacity were not affected by dietary glutamine levels. Hepatic and intestinal glutaminase (GlNase), glutamine synthetase (GSase), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase activities were also unaffected by dietary glutamine supplementation. In the intestine GlNase activity was higher and GSase/GlNase ratio was two-fold lower than in the liver, suggesting a higher use of glutamine for energy production by the intestine than by the liver. The liver showed higher catalase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, while the intestine presented higher glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities and oxidised glutathione content, which seems to reveal a higher glutathione dependency of the intestinal antioxidant response. Total and reduced glutathione contents in liver and intestine and superoxide dismutase activity in the intestine were enhanced by dietary glutamine, though lipid peroxidation values were not affected. Overall, differences between liver and intestine glutamine metabolism and antioxidant response were identified and the potential of dietary glutamine supplementation to gilthead sea bream's antioxidant response was elucidated.",

Recently, orexin has been shown to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis and emerging evidences identify it as a stress modulator in mammals. However, the regulation of orexin system by stress itself remains unclear. Here, we investigate the effects of heat, 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stress on the hepatic expression of orexin (ORX) and its related receptors (ORXR1/2) in avian species. Using in vivo and in vitro models, we found that heat stress significantly down-regulated ORX and ORXR1/2 mRNA and protein abundances in quail liver and LMH cells. H2O2, however, decreased ORX protein and increased ORX mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The absence of correlation between orexin mRNA and protein levels suggests that H2O2 treatment modulates post-transcriptional mechanisms. 4-HNE had a biphasic effect on orexin system expression, with a significant up-regulation at low doses (10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM) and a significant down-regulation at a high dose (30\u00a0\u03bcM).

However, the metabolic actions of T3 in fish are still not fully elucidated. We therefore tested the effects of T3 on Sparus aurata energy metabolism and osmoregulatory system, a hyperthyroid-induced model that was chosen. Fish were implanted with coconut oil depots (containing 0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0T3/g body weight) and sampled at day 3 and 6 post-implantation. Plasma levels of free T3 as well as glucose, lactate and triglyceride values increased with increasing doses of T3 at days 3 and 6 post-implantation. Changes in plasma and organ metabolite levels (glucose, glycogen, triglycerides, lactate and total \u03b1 amino acid) and enzyme activities related to carbohydrate, lactate, amino acid and lipid pathways were detected in organs involved in metabolism (liver) and osmoregulation (gills and kidney). Our data implicate that the liver uses amino acids as an energy source in response to the T3 treatment, increasing protein catabolism and gluconeogenic pathways. The gills, the most important extruder of ammonia, are fuelled not only by amino acids, but also by lactate. The kidney differs significantly in its substrate preference from the gills, as it obtained metabolic energy from lactate but also from lipid oxidation processes. We conclude that in S. aurata lipid catabolism and protein turnover are increased as a consequence of experimentally induced hyperthyroidism, with secondary osmoregulatory effects.",

To investigate the regulation of the reproductive processes in this species by the pituitary gonadotropins follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones (Fsh and Lh, respectively), we developed a highly sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Lh measurements. Quantification of the Fsh and Lh plasma levels in cultured sole using the Lh ELISA developed here, and a previously developed ELISA for Fsh, indicated that in both males and females circulating Fsh steadily increased during autumn and winter and prior to the major spawning in spring, whereas an Lh surge occurred specifically during spawning. The increase in Fsh was associated with a rise of plasma levels of the steroid hormones testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2), but that of Lh was concomitant with a strong decline of the levels of E2 in females and of 11-KT in males, possibly reflecting a rapid steroidogenic shift promoting the final maturation of gametes. Comparison of the plasma levels of gonadotropins and steroids between wild and F1 fish during autumn and spring revealed that F1 males showed significantly lower plasma Lh titres compared to wild males, whereas the levels of T and 11-KT were similar or more elevated in the F1 fish. These data suggest that an impaired Lh secretion during spawning, and perhaps altered Lh-mediated mechanisms in the testis, may be underlying causes for the low reproductive performance of Senegalese sole F1 males.",

Coronary arterial blood flow was generally forward, but there was a brief retrograde flow during a ventricular contraction. Blood pressure was significantly changed in all conditions. Acetylcholine decreased coronary forward flow, but this response was confounded by the concomitant lowered work of the ventricles due to decreased heart rate and blood pressure. Coronary forward flow was poorly correlated with heart rate and mean arterial pressure across treatments.

     "abstract": "Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of an energetically costly brain in the genus Homo. Some of these hypotheses are based on the correlation between climatic factors and brain size recorded for this genus during the last millions of years. In this study, we propose a complementary climatic hypothesis that is based on the mechanistic connection between temperature, thermoregulation, and size of internal organs in endothermic species. We hypothesized that global cooling during the last 3.2 my may have imposed an increased energy expenditure for thermoregulation, which in the case of hominids could represent a driver for the evolution of an expanded brain, or at least, it could imply the relaxation of a negative selection pressure acting upon this costly organ. To test this idea, here we (1) assess variation in the energetic costs of thermoregulation and brain maintenance for the last 3.2 my, and (2) evaluate the relationship between Earth temperature and brain maintenance cost for the same period, taking into account the effects of body mass and fossil age. We found that: (1) the energetic cost associated with brain enlargement represents an important fraction (between 47.5% and 82.5%) of the increase in energy needed for thermoregulation; (2) fossil age is a better predictor of brain maintenance cost than Earth temperature, suggesting that (at least) another factor correlated with time was more relevant than ambient temperature in brain size evolution; and (3) there is a significant negative correlation between the energetic cost of brain and Earth temperature, even after accounting for the effect of body mass and fossil age. Thus, our results expand the current energetic framework for the study of brain size evolution in our lineage by suggesting that a fall in Earth temperature during the last millions of years may have facilitated brain enlargement.",

The results showed that mussels exposed to relatively low levels of sulfide (0.1\u00a0mg/L) and moderate heat stress (12\u00a0\u00b0C) exhibited higher TAUT mRNA levels than the control. Although hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress did not significantly change TAUT mRNA levels, slight induction was observed in mussels exposed to low osmolality. Our results indicate that TAUT is involved in the coping mechanism of mussels to various hydrothermal vent stresses.",

     "abstract": "The main object of this study was to evaluate the impact of different levels of vitamin A (VA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) in relation to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on mineralization and gene expression in Atlantic cod larvae (Gadus morhua). First-feeding larvae were fed enriched rotifers from start-feeding until 29\u00a0days post hatch (dph). Larvae in four tanks were fed one of the following diets: control (EPA/ARA ratio: 15.8, 0.9\u00a0\u03bcg VA g\u2212\u00a01), control\u00a0+\u00a0VA (EPA/ARA ratio: 15.8, 7.8\u00a0\u03bcg VA g\u2212\u00a01), High ARA (EPA/ARA ratio: 0.9, 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg VA g\u2212\u00a01) or High ARA\u00a0+\u00a0VA (EPA/ARA ratio: 0.9, 12.0\u00a0\u03bcg VA g\u2212\u00a01). Larvae fed High ARA\u00a0+\u00a0VA were shorter at 29\u00a0dph compared to the other groups and had significantly less mineralized bones when comparing larvae of similar size, showing interaction effects between VA and ARA. Although transcriptomic analysis did not reveal any interaction effects, a higher number of genes were differentially expressed in the high ARA fed larvae compared to control\u00a0+\u00a0VA fed larvae. Furthermore, bglap1, bglap2 and col10a1 were all down-regulated in larvae fed High ARA-diets and to a greater extent than larvae fed VA supplemented diet, indicating an additive effect on mineralization. In conclusion, this study showed that the dietary increase in ARA and VA altered the skeletal metabolism during larval development, most likely through signaling pathways specific for each nutrient rather than an interaction. The present study also demonstrates that VA could affect the larval response to ARA, even within the accepted non-toxic/non-deficient range.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we explored the hypothesis that killifish acclimate to thermal extremes through regulation of genes involved in stress and metabolism. We examined the liver and gonadal transcription of heat shock proteins (hsp70, hsp90a, hsp90b), glucokinase (gck), and high mobility group b1 (hmgb1) protein in wild killifish species from hot springs and rivers using quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, we exposed a river killifish species to a long-term thermal regime of hot spring (37\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C) and examined the liver transcription of the heat shock genes. Our results showed that hot spring killifish showed a significant, strong upregulation of liver hsp90a. Moreover, the testicular transcript levels of hsp90a, hsp90b, and hsp70 were higher in hot spring killifish than the river ones. The results of the common garden experiments showed that the transcripts of hsp70, hsp90b, and hmgb1 were mildly induced (> twofold) at the time when temperature reached to 37\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C, while the transcripts of hsp90a were strongly induced (17-fold increase). The level of hsp90a was dramatically more upregulated when fish were maintained in thermal extreme (42-fold change higher than in ambient temperature). Moreover, a significant downregulation of gck transcripts was observed at the time when temperature was raised to 37\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C (80-fold decrease) and during exposure to long-term thermal extreme (56-fold decrease). It can be concluded that the regulation of heat shock genes particularly hsp90a might be a key factor of the acclimation of fish to high temperature environments like hot springs.",

The sperm motility parameters were evaluated by a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system, and changes in the [Ca2\u00a0+]i fluorescence (and in [Na+]i in some cases) were evaluated by flow cytometry.After sperm motility was activated in a medium containing Ca2\u00a0+ (seawater, SW) the intracellular fluorescence emitted by Ca2\u00a0+ increased 4\u20136-fold compared to the levels in quiescent sperm. However, while sperm activation in a Ca-free media (NaCl\u00a0+\u00a0EDTA) resulted in a percentage of motility similar to seawater, the [Ca2\u00a0+]i levels did not increase at all. This result strongly suggests that increasing [Ca2\u00a0+]i is not a pre-requisite for the induction of sperm motility in European eel sperm. Several sperm velocities (VCL, VSL, VAP) decreased when sperm was activated in the Ca-free activator, thus supporting the theory that Ca2\u00a0+ has a modulatory effect on sperm motility. The results indicate that a calcium/sodium exchanger (NCX) which is inhibited by bepridil and a calcium calmodulin kinase (inhibited by W-7), are involved in the sperm motility of the European eel. Our results indicate that the increase in [Ca2\u00a0+]i concentrations during sperm activation is due to an influx from the external medium, but, unlike in most other species, it does not appear to be necessary for the activation of motility in European eel sperm.",

CH4 production averaged 8 and 72\u00a0L/d, 18 and 19\u00a0L/kg dry matter intake, and 4.0 and 4.2% of gross energy intake for the two species, respectively. When compared with previously reported data on CH4 production in other non-ruminant and ruminant foregut-fermenting as well as hindgut-fermenting species, it is evident that neither the question whether a species is a foregut fermenter or not, or whether it ruminates or not, is of the relevance previously suggested to explain variation in CH4 production between species. Rather, differences in CH4 production between species on similar diets appear related to species-specific differences in food intake and digesta retention kinetics.",

One possible solution is to freeze plasma for transport; however, this assumes that frozen plasma samples will give comparable results to fresh ones. We tested this assumption using plasma samples from three species of birds: chickens (Gallus gallus), ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens), and western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana). Chicken plasma samples lost most or all of their bacterial killing ability after freezing. This did not happen in flycatchers and bluebirds; however, frozen plasma did not produce results comparable to those obtained using fresh plasma. We caution researchers using the BKA to use fresh samples whenever possible, and to validate the use of frozen samples on a species-by-species basis.",

     "abstract": "The Ponto-Caspian amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is one of the most successful invaders in Central European rivers. Contrary to studies on its ecology, ecophysiological studies comparing the species' physiological traits are scarce. In this context, in particular the metabolic activity of the invasive species has rarely been considered and, moreover, the few existing studies on this species report strongly deviating results. The purpose of this study was to assess the metabolic activity and behavior of D. villosus and other common European amphipod species (Gammarus fossarum, Gammarus roeselii) in relation to temperatures covering the thermal regime of the invaded habitats. Based on direct calorimetric measurements of metabolic heat dissipation at three temperature levels (5\u00a0\u00b0C, 15\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C), we found the routine metabolic rate of D. villosus to be significantly lower than that of the other studied gammarid species at the medium temperature level. The estimated resting metabolic rate indicated a similar trend. At 5\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, both routine and resting metabolic rate did not differ between species. Compared to G. fossarum and G. roeselii, D. villosus exhibited lower locomotor activity at the low and medium temperatures (5\u00a0\u00b0C and 15\u00a0\u00b0C). In contrast, its locomotor activity increased at the high experimental temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C). G. fossarum and G. roeselii were apparently more active than D. villosus at all studied temperatures. We conclude that D. villosus has both physiological and behavioral adaptations that lead to a reduction in metabolic energy expenditure, which is assumed to be beneficial and might contribute to its invasive success.",

     "abstract": "Osmoregulation and digestion are energetically demanding, and crabs that move into low salinity environments to feed must be able to balance the demands of both processes. Achieving this balance may pose greater challenges for weak than for efficient osmoregulators. This study examined the rate of oxygen consumption (MO2) of Carcinus maenas (efficient osmoregulator) and Cancer irroratus (weak osmoregulator) as a function of feeding and hyposaline stress. The MO2 increased 2-fold in both species following feeding. The MO2 increased and remained elevated in fasted crabs during acute hyposaline exposure. When hyposaline stress occurred after feeding, C. maenas responded with an immediate summation of the MO2 associated with feeding and hyposaline stress, whereas C. irroratus reacted with a partial summation of responses in a salinity of 24\u2030, but were unable to sum responses in 16\u2030. C. irroratus exhibited longer gut transit times. This may be due to an inability to regulate osmotic water onload as efficiently as C. maenas. Mechanical digestion in crabs can account for a significant portion of SDA, and a short term interruption led to the delay in summation of metabolic demands. Although protein synthesis is reported to account for the majority of SDA, this did not appear to be the case here. Protein synthesis rates were higher in C. irroratus but neither feeding or salinity affected protein synthesis rates of either species which suggests that protein synthesis can continue in low salinity as long as substrates are available.",

Essential processes related to lipid metabolism can be influenced by various factors, including hyperthermal stress. This can affect the lipid content and distribution in both partners, while contributing to symbiosis disruption and bleaching. In order to gain further insight into the role and distribution of lipids in the cnidarian metabolism, we investigated the lipid composition of the sea anemone Anemonia viridis and its photosynthetic dinoflagellate endosymbionts (Symbiodinium). We compared the lipid content and fatty acid profiles of the host cellular layers, non-symbiotic epidermal and symbiont-containing gastrodermal cells, and those of Symbiodinium, in a mass spectrometry-based assessment. Lipids were more concentrated in Symbiodinium cells, and the lipid class distribution was dominated by polar lipids in all tissues. The fatty acid distribution between host cell layers and Symbiodinium cells suggested potential lipid transfers between the partners. The lipid composition and distribution was modified during short-term hyperthermal stress, mainly in Symbiodinium cells and gastrodermis. Exposure to elevated temperature rapidly caused a decrease in polar lipid C18 unsaturated fatty acids and a strong and rapid decrease in the abundance of polar lipid fatty acids relative to sterols. These lipid indicators could therefore be used as sensitive biomarkers to assess the physiology of symbiotic cnidarians, especially the effect of thermal stress at the onset of cnidarian bleaching. Overall, the findings of this study provide some insight on key lipids that may regulate maintenance of the symbiotic interaction.",

     "abstract": "Whether passerines collectively have a higher mean mass-independent basal rate of metabolism than the mean of other birds has been controversial. The conclusion that no difference exists was based on phylogenetic analyses. Higher basal rates, however, have been repeatedly seen in passerines and demonstrated by ANCOVA analyses. Several studies indicated that the mean mass-independent basal rate of passerines is >\u00a030% higher than the collective mean of other birds. Yet, at least three non-passerine orders of 25 have mean mass-independent basal rates equal to that of passerines. They are Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, and Procellariiformes, all characterized by an active lifestyle, including migratory and pelagic habits. In contrast, sedentary ducks endemic to islands have low basal rates. The high basal rates in temperate passerines correlate with migratory habits and life in cool to cold environments, the absence of these factors being partly responsible for the lower basal rates in most tropical passerines. The principal difference in energetics among non-passerines, between passerines and most non-passerines, and among passerines reflects the frequency of habits associated with high or low mass-independent energy expenditures, the habits correlating with body composition.The mean mass-independent basal rate in tropical passerines is slightly lower than in temperate passerines which implies that the collective mean in passerines would be somewhat lower if tropical passerines were included in proportion to their diversity. However, their inclusion will not eliminate the difference presently seen between passerines and other birds because the difference between tropical and temperate passerines is less than that between passerines and other birds.",

We postulated that bats from desert environments have lower metabolic rates (MR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) than their mesic counterparts. To test this idea, we measured MR and TEWL of four species of bats, which inhabit the Negev desert in Israel, one species mainly restricted to hyper-arid deserts (Otonycteris hemprichii), two species from semi-desert areas (Eptesicus bottae and Plecotus christii), and one widespread species (Pipistrellus kuhlii). We also measured separately, in the same individuals, the two components of TEWL, respiratory water loss (RWL) and cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL), using a mask. In all the species, MR and TEWL were significantly reduced during torpor, the latter being a consequence of reductions in both RWL and CEWL. Then, we evaluated whether MR and TEWL in bats differ according to their geographic distributions, and whether those rates change with Ta and the use of torpor. We did not find significant differences in MR among species, but we found that TEWL was lowest in the species restricted to desert habitats, intermediate in the semi-desert dwelling species, and highest in the widespread species, perhaps a consequence of adaptation to life in deserts. Our results were supported by a subsequent analysis of data collected from the literature on rates of TEWL for 35 bat species from desert and mesic habitats.",

Following injection, the phenylalanine-specific radioactivities in the gill, mantle and whole-animal free pools were elevated within one hour and remained elevated and stable for up to 6\u00a0h following injection of 3H-phenylalanine into the posterior adductor muscle. Incorporation of 3H-phenylalanine into body protein was linear over time following injection and the non-significant intercepts for the regressions suggested incorporation into body protein occurred rapidly after injection.

Urinary corticosterone metabolite (UCM) enzyme\u2013immunoassay (EIA) has been validated for numerous amphibian species as a non-invasive measure of physiological stress. Body-condition indices (BCIs) have also been widely used in amphibians as an indirect measure of animal health. Field endocrinology research on amphibian species in Asia is limited. In this study, we validated a UCM EIA in a peri-urban sub-population of the common Asian toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) in Pune, Maharashtra, India. We determined the baseline levels of UCMs in male (n\u00a0=\u00a039) and female (n\u00a0=\u00a019) toads. Secondly, we used a standard capture handling protocol to quantify changes in UCMs during short-term captivity. We also determined BCIs in the male and female toads using Fulton's index (K) and residual condition index (RCI). The results showed that mean baseline levels of UCMs were significantly higher in male toads than in females. There was no significant change in mean levels of UCMs of males and females between capture and captivity (0\u201312\u00a0h). This highlights plausible habituation of the species to the peri-urban environment. Associations between UCMs with BCIs (K and R) were positive in male toads but negative in females. In conclusion, our UCMs EIA can be applied with BCIs to assess health of the Asian toads. We also suggest that direct fitness parameters such as sperm and oocyte quality, reproductive ecology and immunocompetence measurements should be applied in combination with these conservation physiology tools to quantify the fitness consequences of pervasive environmental changes on native amphibians.",

It regulates oxidative stress by breaking down superoxide radicals to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. A gene coding for Cu,Zn-SOD was cloned and characterized from Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis; CSI). The full-length expressed sequence tag (EST) of this Cu,Zn-SOD gene (designated as CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD) contained 462\u00a0bp encoding a protein of 154 amino acids without signal peptides, indicated as intracellular CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD. This agreed with the results from the phylogenetic tree, which indicated that CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD belonged to the intracellular Cu,Zn-SOD. Chromosomal location determined that the CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD was localized to the proximal region of the Siamese crocodile chromosome 1p. Several highly conserved motifs, two conserved signature sequences (GFHVHEFGDNT and GNAGGRLACGVI), and conserved amino acid residues for binding copper and zinc (His47, His49, His64, His72, His81, Asp84, and His120) were also identified in CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD. Real-time PCR analysis showed that CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD mRNA was expressed in all the tissues examined (liver, pancreas, lung, kidney, heart, and whole blood), which suggests a constitutively expressed gene in these tissues. Expression of the gene in Escherichia coli cells followed by purification yielded a recombinant CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD, with Km and Vmax values of 6.075\u00a0mM xanthine and 1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0mmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mg\u2212\u00a01, respectively. This Vmax value was 40 times lower than native Cu,Zn-SOD (56\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0mmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mg\u2212\u00a01), extracted from crocodile erythrocytes. This suggests that cofactors, protein folding properties, or post-translational modifications were lost during the protein purification process, leading to a reduction in the rate of enzyme activity in bacterial expression of CSI-Cu,Zn-SOD.",

     "abstract": "In mammalian tissues under hypoxic conditions, ATP degradation results in accumulation of purine metabolites. During exercise, muscle energetic demand increases and oxygen consumption can exceed its supply. During breath-hold diving, oxygen supply is reduced and, although oxygen utilization is regulated by bradycardia (low heart rate) and peripheral vasoconstriction, tissues with low blood flow (ischemia) may become hypoxic. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential differences in the circulating levels of purine metabolism components between diving and exercise in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Blood samples were taken from captive dolphins following a swimming routine (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and after a 2\u00a0min dive (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Activity of enzymes involved in purine metabolism (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), inosine monophosphate deshydrogenase (IMPDH), xanthine oxidase (XO), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)), and purine metabolite (hypoxanthine (HX), xanthine (X), uric acid (UA), inosine monophosphate (IMP), inosine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), adenosine, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), ATP, guanosine diphosphate (GDP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP)) concentrations were quantified in erythrocyte and plasma samples. Enzymatic activity and purine metabolite concentrations involved in purine synthesis and degradation, were not significantly different between diving and exercise. Plasma adenosine concentration was higher after diving than exercise (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03); this may be related to dive-induced ischemia. In erythrocytes, HGPRT activity was higher after diving than exercise (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), suggesting an increased capacity for purine recycling and ATP synthesis from IMP in ischemic tissues of bottlenose dolphins during diving. Purine recycling and physiological adaptations may maintain the ATP concentrations in bottlenose dolphins after diving and exercise.",

Unlike in mammals where the transition from placental respiration to lung respiration is instantaneous, in birds the transition from embryonic CAM respiration to lung respiration can take over 24\u00a0h. To understand the physiological consequences of this long transition we examined circulatory changes and DA morphological changes during hatching in the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), a primitive ratite bird. By tracking microspheres injected into a CAM vein, we observed no change in DA blood flow between the pre-pipped to internally pipped stages. Two hours after external pipping, however, a significant decrease in DA blood flow occurred, evident from a decreased systemic blood flow and subsequent increased lung blood flow. Upon hatching, the right-to-left shunt disappeared. These physiological changes in DA blood flow correspond with a large decrease in DA lumen diameter from the pre-pipped stages to Day 1 hatchlings. Upon hatching, the right-to-left shunt disappeared and at the same time apoptosis of smooth muscle cells began remodeling the DA for permanent closure. After the initial smooth muscle contraction, the lumen disappeared as intimal cushioning formed, the internal elastic lamina degenerated, and numerous cells underwent regulated apoptosis. The DA closed rapidly between the initiation of external pipping and hatching, resulting in circulatory patterns similar to the adult. This response is most likely produced by increased DA constriction in response to increased arterial oxygen levels and the initiation of vessel remodeling.",

In particular, long-term responses of ectotherms to the warming trend in tropical regions are unknown, and understudied due to the difficulties in specimen and community traceability. In freshwater lakes employed as cooling reservoirs for power plants, increased physiological stress from high water temperature can potentially alter the community structure of fishes. We employ this highly tractable system to assess how thermal regimes can alter the physiology and ecology of aquatic species. We documented a significantly reduced lifespan, growth performance, and a shift in the age structure towards younger individuals in the thermally- impacted Coffeen Lake population of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), compared to a non-impacted control group (Lake Mattoon). Average age calculated for the Lake Mattoon population was 2.42\u00a0years, whereas the average age of bluegill from Coffeen Lake was only 0.96 years, and average specimen mass in Lake Mattoon was more than six times that of Coffeen Lake. During laboratory cross-acclimation studies of bluegill from Lake Mattoon at 17.5 and 35.0\u00a0\u00b0C, citrate synthase (CS) activity obtained from white muscle was regulated through acclimation, whereas cold-acclimated specimens exhibited twice the activity at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, if compared to CS activity values from warm-acclimated specimens. This study raises the questions about the causal relationships between physiological performance and habitat temperature, in particular how thresholds in an organism's physiology may modulate their community structure, and consequently their ecological success.",

     "abstract": "Thermal regimes in aquatic systems have profound implications for the physiology of ectotherms. In particular, the effect of elevated temperatures on mitochondrial energy transduction in tropical and subtropical teleosts may have profound consequences on organismal performance and population viability. Upper and lower whole-organism critical temperatures for teleosts suggest that subtropical and tropical species are not susceptible to the warming trends associated with climate change, but sub-lethal effects on energy transduction efficiency and population dynamics remain unclear. The goal of the present study was to compare the thermal sensitivity of processes associated with mitochondrial energy transduction in liver mitochondria from the striped mojarra (Eugerres plumieri), the whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) and the palometa (Trachinotus goodei), to those of the subtropical pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and the blue runner (Caranx crysos). Mitochondrial function was assayed at temperatures ranging from 10 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C and results obtained for both tropical and subtropical species showed a reduction in the energy transduction efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system in most species studied at temperatures below whole-organism critical temperature thresholds. Our results show a loss of coupling between O2 consumption and ATP production before the onset of the critical thermal maxima, indicating that elevated temperature may severely impact the yield of ATP production per carbon unit oxidized. As warming trends are projected for tropical regions, increasing water temperatures in tropical estuaries and coral reefs could impact long-term growth and reproductive performance in tropical organisms, which are already close to their upper thermal limit.",

Hct increase may result from increased nucleated red blood cell concentration ([RBC]) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) or reduced plasma volume. We hypothesized changes in Hct, hemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), [RBC] and MCV and their effects on viscosity would reduce OTC. Five experimental treatments that increase Hct were conducted on day 15 embryos: 60\u00a0min water submergence with 60\u00a0min recovery in air; exposure to 15% O2 with or without 5% CO2 for 24 h with 6 h recovery; or exposure to 10% O2 with or without 5% CO2 for 120 min with 120 min recovery. Control Hct, [Hb], [RBC], MCV, and viscosity were approximately 26%, 9\u00a0g%, 2.0 106\u00a0\u03bcL\u2212\u00a01, 130\u00a0\u03bcm3, and 1.6\u00a0mPa\u00a0s, respectively. All manipulations increased Hct and blood viscosity without changing blood osmolality (276\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01). Increased viscosity was attributed to increased [RBC] and MCV in submerged embryos, but solely MCV in embryos experiencing 10% O2 regardless of CO2. Blood viscosity in embryos exposed to 15% O2 increased via increased MCV alone, and viscosity was constant during recovery despite increased [RBC]. Consequently, blood viscosity was governed by MCV and [RBC] during submergence, while MCV was the strongest determinant of blood viscosity in extrinsic hypoxia with or without hypercapnia. Increased Hct and blood O2 content did not compensate for the effect of increased viscosity on OTC during these challenges.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a major challenge for the survival of animals living on plateaus; however, lifelong exposure to high altitudes could generate certain adaptabilities which make them more tolerant to these environments. The aim of the present study was to compare the oxidative stress and antioxidant status between low altitude (LA, 2900\u00a0m) and high altitude (HA, 4200\u00a0m) populations of Phrynocephalus vlangalii. The results showed that malondialdehyde levels in the HA populations decreased significantly in the brain, but markedly increased in the muscle and had no significant difference in the liver compared to LA populations. The activity of catalase in the brain was much higher in HA than LA. Except for total antioxidant capacity and glutathione reductase, other antioxidants were similar between the two populations in livers. By contrast, the levels of most antioxidants in muscle decreased markedly with elevation. We also explored the effects of hypoxia on oxidative damage and antioxidant defenses in P. vlangalii. The lizards were acclimated in a simulated hypoxic chamber (15% O2 and 8% O2) for 6\u00a0weeks. The results showed that in the 8% O2 group, the levels of malondialdehyde, catalase, glutathione and total antioxidant capacity in the brain, and malondialdehyde, catalase and superoxide dismutase in the liver were significantly higher than the 15% O2 group. These findings indicate that in this species the oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity are subject to altitude and hypoxia and this lizard may have acquired some ability to deal with the oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Mass coral bleaching due to thermal stress represents a major threat to the integrity and functioning of coral reefs. Thermal thresholds vary, however, between corals, partly as a result of the specific type of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate (Symbiodinium sp.) they harbour. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in corals under thermal and light stress has been recognised as one mechanism that can lead to cellular damage and the loss of their symbiont population (Oxidative Theory of Coral Bleaching). Here, we compared the response of symbiont and host enzymatic antioxidants in the coral species Acropora millepora and Montipora digitata at 28\u00a0\u00b0C and 33\u00a0\u00b0C. A. millepora at 33\u00a0\u00b0C showed a decrease in photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) and increase in maximum midday excitation pressure on PSII, with subsequent bleaching (declining photosynthetic pigment and symbiont density). M. digitata exhibited no bleaching response and photochemical changes in its symbionts were minor. The symbiont antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase peroxidase showed no significant upregulation to elevated temperatures in either coral, while only catalase was significantly elevated in both coral hosts at 33\u00a0\u00b0C. Increased host catalase activity in the susceptible coral after 5\u00a0days at 33\u00a0\u00b0C was independent of antioxidant responses in the symbiont and preceded significant declines in PSII photochemical efficiencies. This finding suggests a potential decoupling of host redox mechanisms from symbiont photophysiology and raises questions about the importance of symbiont-derived ROS in initiating coral bleaching.",

Although passive integrated transponders (PITs) have been used previously to measure subcutaneous temperature (Tsub) during daily torpor in a small marsupial, no study has attempted to use these devices at Tbs below 10\u00a0\u00b0C. Therefore, we investigated whether subcutaneous interscapular PITs can be used as a viable tool for measuring Tb in a small hibernating bat (Nyctophilus gouldi; Ng) and compared it with measurements of Tb during daily torpor in a heterothermic bat (Syconycteris australis; Sa). The precision of transponders was investigated as a function of ambient temperature (Ta) and remote Tsub readings enabled us to quantify Tsub\u2013Tb differentials during steady-state torpor and arousal. Transponders functioned well outside the manufacturer's recommended range, down to ~\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C. At rest, Tsub and rectal Tb (Trec) were strongly correlated for both bat species (Ng r2\u00a0=\u00a00.88; Sa r2\u00a0=\u00a00.95) and this was also true for N. gouldi in steady-state torpor (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.93). During induced rewarming Tsub increased faster than Trec in both species. Our results demonstrate that transponders can be used to provide accurate remote measurement of Tb in two species of bats during different physiological states, both during steady-state conditions and throughout dynamic phases such as rewarming from torpor. We show that, at least during rewarming, regional heterothermy common to larger hibernators and other hibernating bats is also present in bats capable of daily torpor.",

In this sense, metabolic differences associated to habitats have been widely reported in the interspecific level, however little is known about the intraspecific view of BMR under an environmental gradient.

Animals were captured in different subpopulations of its altitudinal range and their MR was studied over a thermal gradient. MR was analyzed through a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) in which, in addition to thermal effects, the bioclimatic zone and sex also influenced the metabolism of the species.

     "abstract": "An assessment of the key transcripts expression of the steroidogenesis-related genes in rainbow trout subjected to either acute or chronic stress was performed in both interrenal cells and whole head kidney tissue. The analysis of interrenal cells was possible thanks to the use, for the first time in this specific type of cells, of the technique of laser microdissection (LMD) which allows to isolate specific cells and process them independently of other surrounding cells in the tissue. The results indicated that both acute and chronic stressors induced a significant up-regulation of the steroidogenesis-related genes with a higher but expected degree in the isolated cells. In addition, under acute stress a delay between cortisol levels and transcript expression was found. Under chronic stress a clear relation between plasma cortisol levels, mRNA transcription and interrenal tissue area was observed, since all parameters were concomitantly increased at day 5 after stress. Moreover results indicated that the LMD technique allowed ascertaining with more precision and accuracy whether and when the steroidogenesis-related genes were significantly expressed, disregarding the noise produced by other cells present in the head kidney. Results also showed a typical physiological response in plasma parameters and a positive relationship between plasma cortisol data and transcript abundance in isolated cells. The present results may help to better understand the mechanisms behind the interrenal response to stress challenges in fish.",

     "abstract": "The paradox of secondary metabolites, toxic defence compounds produced by plants, in nectar and fruits is well known. Deterrence of feeding by nectarivorous and frugivorous birds is better understood than the effect of these chemicals on the digestive performance of birds. Digestive parameters such as transit time and sugar assimilation are important in assessing nutrient utilization and deterrence may be related to post-ingestive effects involving these parameters. Nectar and many fruits contain mainly sugars and water, and avian consumers compensate for low sugar content in their diet by increasing food intake: this may also increase their intake of secondary metabolites. We investigated how the alkaloid nicotine, naturally present in nectar of Nicotiana species, influences compensatory feeding and digestive performance of nectar-feeding birds. High nicotine concentration negatively affected compensatory feeding and apparent assimilation efficiency of white-bellied sunbirds Cinnyris talatala and Cape white-eyes Zosterops virens; but nicotine slowed gut transit time only in the latter species. In contrast, food intake and digestive performance of dark-capped bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor was unaffected by nicotine up to a concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcM. Bulbuls are primarily frugivorous; hence, they are more exposed to secondary metabolites than sunbirds and possibly white-eyes. Because their diet is richer in toxins, frugivorous birds may have evolved more efficient detoxification strategies than those of specialist nectar-feeding birds.",

In the experimental environment, temperature was increased to 29\u00a0\u00b0C in the high-temperature treatment, and oxygen lowered to 1.0\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01\u00a0O2 in the hypoxia treatment.

After the experimental exposure, metabolism was measured as routine metabolic rate (RMR) and electron transport system (ETS) activity. There was a reduction in hierarchy stability at high-temperature. Aggression changed after environmental changes. Dominant and subdominant fish at high temperatures increased their biting, compared with control-dominant. In contrast, hypoxia-dominant fish decreased their aggressive acts compared with all other fish. Shelter use decreased in control and hypoxic dominant fish. Dominant fish from undisturbed environments eat more than their subordinates. There was a decrease of RMR in fish exposed to the hypoxic environment when compared with control or high-temperature fish, independent of social position. Control-dominant fish had higher RMR than their subordinates. ETS activity increased in fish exposed to high temperatures; however, there was no effect on social rank.

     "publication date": "12-2015",
     "abstract": "A typical explanation for ecologically stable strategies that apply to only a proportion of a population, is bet hedging, where increased reproductive success offsets reduced reproductive rate. One such is partial migration, where only a proportion of a population moves seasonally to avoid inclement climatic conditions. Bet hedging may overlook unseen costs to maintain broad physiological resilience, implied by encountering a breadth of environmental conditions. We investigated the physiological correlates of partial migration by measuring standard metabolic rates, and rates of evaporative water loss, and then estimating upper and lower thermal tolerance in males and females of two hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Eristalis tenax. In central Europe, females of these species may either migrate or overwinter, whereas males may migrate south to the Mediterranean, but have not been found overwintering. Both species were sexually dimorphic; female Ep. balteatus were lighter than males, but female Er. tenax were heavier than males. While allometrically- corrected metabolic rate in both species increased with temperature, the most parsimonious models included no sex-specific differences in metabolic rate for either species. Evaporative water loss of both species also increased with temperature, but was higher for females of both species than males. Assuming that resting metabolism is congruent with the activity requirements of migration, highly consistent thermal tolerance and metabolic rate suggests that any given fly could migrate, although water loss patterns suggest that females may be less well-adapted to Mediterranean climates. We infer that partial migration probably results from the imperatives of their reproductive strategies.",

     "abstract": "Snakes often undergo periods of prolonged fasting and, under certain conditions, can survive years without food. Despite this unique phenomenon, there are relatively few reports of the physiological adaptations to fasting in snakes. At post-prandial day 1 (fed) or 21 (fasting), brain, liver, and adipose tissues were collected from juvenile checkered garter snakes (Thamnophis marcianus). There was greater glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)-specific activity in the liver of fasted than fed snakes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The mRNA abundance of various fat metabolism\u2013associated factors was measured in brain, liver, and adipose tissue. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA was greater in fasted than fed snakes in the brain (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) mRNA was greater in the liver of fasted than fed snakes. In adipose tissue, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) was greater in fed than fasted snakes. Analysis of adipocyte morphology revealed that cross-sectional area (P\u00a0=\u00a00.095) and diameter (P\u00a0=\u00a00.27) were not significantly different between fed and fasted snakes. Results suggest that mean adipocyte area can be preserved during fasting by dampening lipid biosynthesis while not changing rates of lipid hydrolysis. In the liver, however, extensive lipid remodeling may provide energy and lipoproteins to maintain lipid structural integrity during energy restriction. Because the duration of fasting was not sufficient to change adipocyte size, results suggest that the liver is important as a short-term provider of energy in the snake.",

     "abstract": "Temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the up-regulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18\u00a0\u00b0C, constant 28\u00a0\u00b0C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation.",

     "abstract": "Dietary compromises, especially food restrictions, possess species-specific effects on the health status and infection control in several organisms, including fish. To understand the starvation-mediated physiological responses in Edwardsiella tarda infected red sea bream, especially in the liver, we performed a 20-day starvation experiment using 4 treatment (2 fed and 2 starved) groups, namely, fed-placebo, starved-placebo, fed-infected, and starved-infected, wherein bacterial exposure was done on the 11th day. In the present study, the starved groups showed reduced hepatosomatic index and drastic depletion in glycogen storage and vacuole formation. The fed-infected fish showed significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in relation to its starved equivalent. Significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) alteration in glucose and energy metabolism, as evident from hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, was recorded in the starved groups. Interestingly, coinciding with the liver histology, PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors) \u03b1 transcription followed a time-dependent activation in starved groups while PPAR\u03b3 exhibited an opposite pattern. The transcription of hepcidin 1 and transferrin, initially increased in 0dai (days after infection) starved fish but reduced significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at later stages. Two-color immunohistochemistry and subsequent cell counting showed significant increase in P63-positive cells at 0dai and 5dai but later reduced slightly at 10dai. Similar results were also obtained in the lysosomal (cathepsin D) and non-lysosomal (ubiquitin) gene transcription level. All together, our data suggest that starvation exerts multidirectional responses, which allows for better physiological adaptations during any infectious period, in red sea bream.",

We investigated plasticity of thermal tolerance, energetic and water loss traits and their interaction with behaviour in a small-bodied, arboreal anuran (Hyperolius marmoratus Rapp, Hyperoliidae) undergoing rapid range expansion into the winter rainfall region of South Africa. After short-term exposure to three temperatures (acclimation treatments) commonly encountered in their historical and novel ranges, frogs exhibited a broad thermal tolerance range (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0s.d.: 42.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0\u00b0C) and higher plasticity in CTmax than in CTmin. Resting metabolic rate was lowest in cold-acclimated animals, while active metabolic rates were lowest in warm-acclimated frogs, likely reflecting compensation towards energy conservation. Evaporative water loss was not significantly altered by the acclimation treatments in either resting or active animals, indicating limited plasticity in this trait compared to metabolism. Our results suggest that plasticity of temperature limits and metabolism may benefit this species in variable environments such as those encountered in its expanded range. Lack of plasticity in water loss during resting and activity suggests that these frogs rely on their high cutaneous resistance and behavioural means to buffer climate variation. This study highlights the importance of synergistic interactions between physiology and behaviour in determining amphibian responses to temperature variation.",

Lizards need to either tolerate or regulate these increased ion concentrations. In this study, we aim to understand how Suter's skink (Oligosoma suteri), an intertidal skink restricted to shoreline habitats, is able to cope with the physiological stress of living in an extreme salt environment. We determined the diet, prey species' salt content, and nasal and cloacal salt excretion on Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands in northern New Zealand, where the skinks have contrasting access to terrestrial invertebrates. Analysis of stable isotopes suggests inter- and intra-population variability in Suter's skink diets. Intertidal invertebrates under washed up seaweed appear to compose a major part of the diet of the Rangitoto population, while the Motutapu population showed evidence for a mixed diet of terrestrial and intertidal invertebrates. Sodium content of prey species decreased with an increasing distance from the seawater. Field secretion of cations through nasal glands consisted primarily of Na+, which is consistent with other marine and intertidal species. Sodium was also the primary cation in urine. In contrast, fecal cations consisted primarily of K+. This first study into the salt secretion of an intertidal skink species provides evidence of Suter's skink's plasticity in secreting excess ions through nasal salt glands. This likely enables it to deal with the challenges of living in a semi-marine habitat.",

Detectable levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol, estrone, progesterone and testosterone were consistently detected over two consecutive lunar reproductive cycles in coral tissue. Intra-colony variation in steroid hormone levels ranged between 1.5- and 2.2-fold and were not statistically different. Activities of the steroidogenic enzymes 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 17 dehydrogenase were detectable and did not fluctuate over the reproductive cycle. Aromatase-like activity was detected during the lunar reproductive cycle with no significant fluctuations. Activities of regeneration enzymes did not fluctuate over the lunar cycle; however, activity of the clearance enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferases increased significantly (ANOVA, post hoc p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) during the two weeks before and after peak larval release (planulation), suggesting that the activity of this enzyme family may be linked to the reproductive state of the coral.

At 12\u00a0h-PI, cortisol implants elevated plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate. Plasma osmolality and ions remained stable, but cortisol increased gill and kidney Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) and H+ ATPase activities. Gill NKA activities were higher at 3%-BM, whereas kidney H+ ATPase activity was greater at 0.5%-BM. Cortisol induced liver protein mobilization and repartitioned liver and muscle glycogen. At 3%-BM, this did not increase plasma ammonia, reflecting improved excretion efficiency concomitant with upregulation of Rhesus glycoprotein Rhcg-1 in gill. Responses in glucocorticoid receptors (GR1/GR2) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to cortisol elevation were most prominent in kidney with increased expression of all receptors at 24\u00a0h-PI at 0.5%-BM, but only GR2 and MR at 0.5%-BM. In the liver, upregulation of all receptors occurred at 24\u00a0h-PI at 3%-BM, whilst only GR2 and MR were upregulated at 0.5%-BM. In the gill, there was a limited upregulation: GR2 and MR at 72\u00a0h-PI and GR1 at 168\u00a0h-PI at 3%-BM but only GR2 at 72\u00a0h-PI at 0.5%-BM. Thus cortisol elevation led to similar expression patterns of cortisol receptors in both feeding regimes, while feeding affected the type of receptor that was induced. Induction of corticoid receptors occurred simultaneously with increases in Rhcg-1 mRNA expression (gill) but well after NKA and H+ ATPase activities increased (gill/kidney).",

Most research attention and understanding about the impacts of hypoxia on estuarine species has focused on the benthos, where hypoxia is most common. Although the pelagic zone is also susceptible to the effects of hypoxia, the biological interactions and consequences are not as well understood in marine environments because documenting exposure or avoidance of hypoxia is often difficult. Physiological biomarkers may provide a way to gain more detailed spatiotemporal information regarding species' exposure to hypoxia. Here, we identified and tested a hypoxia-specific responsive gene, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (hif-1\u03b1), to evaluate its potential as a biomarker for hypoxia exposure in Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to establish the level of hepatic hif-1\u03b1 elevated gene expression (>\u00a01 sd normoxic mean), exposure amplification (\u2265\u00a02\u00a0hours), reduction rate (ca. 24\u00a0hours), and some evidence of a lethal hypoxic limit (ca. 2\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, \u2265\u00a04\u00a0hours). We then used these findings to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of hif-1\u03b1 for Pacific herring in a seasonally hypoxia estuary, Hood Canal, Washington, USA. Although expression did not parallel the local hypoxic conditions in the estuary, herring from the more severe hypoxic year (2013) had a higher probability of having elevated mRNA levels. These patterns indicate that hepatic hif-1\u03b1 levels may not be directly indicative of local DO levels for pelagic marine fish, but rather provide insight into hypoxia exposure over broader scales.",

Considering that changes in lipid composition of the gill cells' basolateral membranes may disrupt the major transporter Na+K+-ATPase, the goal of this study was to detect changes at this level during juvenile sea lamprey seawater acclimation. The results showed that saltwater acclimation has a direct effect on the fatty acid composition of gill cells basolateral membrane's phospholipids. When held in full-strength seawater, the fatty acid profile of basolateral membrane's phospholipids suffered a restructure by increasing either saturation or the ratio between oleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. Simultaneously, the activity of Na+K+-ATPase revealed a significant and positive correlation with basolateral membrane's cholesterol content in the presence of highest salinity. Our results pointed out for lipid adjustments involving the functional transporter present on the gill cell basolateral membranes to ensure the role played by branchial Na+K+-ATPase in ion transport during saltwater acclimation process. The responses observed contributed to the strategy adopted by gill cell's basolateral membranes to compensate for osmotic and ionic stressors, to ensure the success of the process of seawater acclimation associated with the downstream trophic migration of juvenile sea lamprey.",

In this study, we examined the activity levels of proteases, carbohydrases, and lipase in the pancreas, and along the anterior intestine, spiral intestine, and colon of the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo. We then interpreted our data in the context of a rate-yield continuum to discern this shark's digestive strategy. Our data show anticipated decreasing patterns in the activities of pancreatic enzymes moving posteriorly along the gut, but also show mid spiral intestine peaks in aminopeptidase and lipase activities, which support the spiral intestine as the main site of absorption in bonnetheads. Interestingly, we observed spikes in the activity levels of N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase and \u03b2-glucosidase in the bonnethead colon, and these chitin- and cellulose-degrading enzymes, respectively, are likely of microbial origin in this distal gut region. Taken in the context of intake and relatively long transit times of food through the gut, the colonic spikes in N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase and \u03b2-glucosidase activities suggest that bonnetheads take a yield-maximizing strategy to the digestive process, with some reliance on microbial digestion in their hindguts. This is one of the first studies to examine digestive enzyme activities along the gut of any shark, and importantly, the data match with previous observations that sharks take an extended time to digest their meals (consistent with a yield-maximizing digestive strategy) and that the spiral intestine is the primary site of absorption in sharks.",

The model is composed of 1\u20132 confluent layers of gill pavement cells (PVCs), with the outer layer exhibiting prominent apical surface microridges and TJs between adjacent cells. During development of electrophysiological characteristics, the model exhibits a sigmoidal increase in transpithelial resistance (TER) and plateaus around 30\u00a0k\u03a9cm2.

This suggests that these proteins are involved in maintaining barrier properties between gill PVCs of SW fishes. Gill cldn mRNA abundance also altered 6 and 12\u00a0h following abrupt SW exposure of puffer fish, but in a manner that differed qualitatively and quantitatively from the cultured model.

     "abstract": "Water is a crucial resource that can profoundly impact the biology of terrestrial organisms. Early life stages are particularly sensitive to hydric constraints because water uptake is an important component of embryonic development. While amniotic eggs constitute a key innovation to terrestrial life, many vertebrates are viviparous wherein the mother must be the source of water for her developing embryos. Since most viviparous squamates are lecithotrophic (i.e., energy is supplied to the offspring as yolk deposited into pre-ovulated follicles), water is the predominant resource allocated from the mother to the offspring during development. Contrary to energy that can be stored (e.g., as fat reserves), water typically cannot be acquired in advance. Therefore, the embryos' need for water can impose significant constraints on the pregnant female. We detailed water flux during pregnancy in a viviparous snake, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). We found that embryonic water uptake occurred mostly during the second half of pregnancy\u2014a period dominated by somatic growth. We also found that, somewhat unexpectedly, changes in female plasma osmolality were negatively related to fecundity. This latter result suggests that water consumption by the female is especially important for large litter sizes, and thus may suggest an important sensitivity of reproductive females to environmental water availability.",

Adipocyte area and diameter were greater in clavicular and subcutaneous than abdominal fat at 4 and 14\u00a0days post-hatch (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in all depots from day 4 to 14, and at both ages was greatest in subcutaneous, intermediate in clavicular, and lowest in abdominal fat (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In clavicular fat, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP)\u03b1, CEBP\u03b2, fatty acid synthase (FASN), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and NPY receptor 5 (NPYR5) mRNA increased and NPYR2 mRNA decreased from day 4 to 14 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, there are site-specific differences in broiler chick adipose development, with larger adipocytes and greater G3PDH activity in subcutaneous fat at day 4, more rapid growth of abdominal fat, and clavicular fat intermediate for most traits. Adipose tissue expansion was accompanied by changes in gene expression of adipose-associated factors.",

Immunocytochemical analysis revealed the presence of relatively large HSP30 structures primarily in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. All three of the stressors promoted the formation of aggresome-like inclusion bodies as determined by immunocytochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy using a ProteoStat aggresome dye and additional aggresomal markers, namely, anti-\u03b3-tubulin and anti-vimentin antibodies. Further analysis revealed that HSP30 co-localized with these aggresome-like inclusion bodies. In most cells, HSP30 was found to envelope or occur within these structures. Finally, we show that treatment of cells with withaferin A, a steroidal lactone with anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and proteasomal inhibitor properties, also induced HSP30 accumulation that co-localized with aggresome-like inclusion bodies. It is possible that proteasomal inhibitor or metal/metalloid-induced formation of aggresome-like inclusion bodies may sequester toxic protein aggregates until they can be degraded. While the role of HSP30 in these aggresome-like structures is not known, it is possible that they may be involved in various aspects of aggresome-like inclusion body formation or transport.",

However, atropine injections had no impact on heart rate until immediately before hatching, when it increased heart rate by 15%. This cholinergic tonus increased to 34% in hatchlings and dropped to 24% in adult iguanas. Although epinephrine was without effect, injection of propranolol slowed the heart throughout development, indicating the presence of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on the heart of early embryos, possibly stimulated by high levels of circulating catecholamines. The calculated excitatory tonus varied between 33% and 68% until immediately before hatching when it fell to 25% and 29%, a level retained in hatchlings and adults. Hypoxia caused a bradycardia in early embryos that was unaffected by injection of atropine indicating that hypoxia has a direct effect upon the heart. In later embryos and hatchlings hypoxia caused a tachycardia that was unaffected by injection of atropine.

Two experimental groups were fed during four weeks with a diet with or without LA. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, glutathione (GSH) content, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were evaluated in these organs. Also, a technique to measure protein disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl groups was optimized for intestine samples.

This device uses infrared light, enabling it to detect heartbeats in very early embryos. However, infrared light is a source of heat and extended enclosure of an egg in the device is likely to affect temperature with consequent effects on physiological processes, including fH. We studied the effect of use of the monitor on the temperature of eggs and on fH in two species of reptiles, the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) and the green iguana (Iguana iguana). Egg temperature increased from a room temperature of 27\u201328\u00b0C, by 26% in turtles and 14% in iguanas over 1\u00a0h of enclosure, resulting in an increase in fH of 76\u201381% in turtles and 35\u201350% iguanas.

The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of a simulated stressor on both endocrine and immune parameters. During two seasons, exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) was administered to seven female juvenile harbor seals and the response of several hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, total and free thyroxine and total triiodothyronine) and immunological parameters (total and differential leukocyte counts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation) were assessed. Cortisol peaked at 165\u00a0min (winter 203.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a084.7\u00a0ng/ml; summer 205.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a065.7\u00a0ng/ml) and remained significantly elevated 240\u00a0min after ACTH infusion in both seasons.

An increase in circulating total white blood cells was driven primarily by the increase in neutrophils which occurred simultaneously with a decrease in lymphocytes leading to an overall increase in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio.

Induction of ovarian development under night-interruption light schedules and Nanda\u2013Hamner cycles revealed that the photoinducible phase appeared in a circadian manner between ZT12 and ZT13. To characterize the effect of photoperiod on clock gene expression in the brain of this species, we determined the expression levels of the sdPer1, sdPer2, sdCry1, and sdCry2 clock genes under constant light and dark conditions (LL and DD) and photoperiodic (short and long photoperiods). The expression of sdPer1 exhibited clear circadian oscillation under both LL and DD conditions, while sdPer2 and sdCry1 expression levels were lower under DD than under LL conditions and sdCry2 expression was lower under LL than under DD conditions. These results suggest a key role for sdPer1 in circadian clock cycling and that sdPer2, sdCry1, and sdCry2 are light-responsive clock genes in the sapphire devil. After 1\u00a0week under a long photoperiod, we observed photoperiod-related changes in sdPer1, sdPer2, and sdCry2 expression, but not in sdCry1 expression. These results suggest that the expression patterns of some clock genes exhibit seasonal variation according to seasonal changes in day length and that such seasonal alteration of clock gene expression may contribute to seasonal recognition by the sapphire devil.",

In the present study, the effects of leptin and ghrelin on adipogenesis, lipolysis and on expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were examined in rainbow trout adipocytes in vitro. Leptin expression and release increased from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes in culture, but did not affect the process of adipogenesis. While ghrelin and its receptor were identified in cultured differentiated adipocytes, ghrelin did not influence either preadipocyte proliferation or differentiation, indicating that it may have other adipose-related roles. Leptin and ghrelin increased lipolysis in mature freshly isolated adipocytes, but mRNA expression of lipolysis markers was not significantly modified. Leptin significantly suppressed the fatty acid transporter-1 expression, suggesting a decrease in fatty acid uptake and storage, but did not affect expression of any of the lipogenesis or \u03b2-oxidation genes studied. Ghrelin significantly increased the mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid synthase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b2, and thus appears to stimulate synthesis of triglycerides as well as their mobilization. Overall, the study indicates that ghrelin, but not leptin seems to be an enhancer of lipid turn-over in adipose tissue of rainbow trout, and this regulation may at least partly be mediated through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. The mode of action of both hormones needs to be further explored to better understand their roles in regulating adiposity in fish.",

Both serotonin and glutamate have been shown to modulate the physiology of the dorsal vessel of some insects, yet until the present study, their activity in mosquitoes remained unknown. To test whether serotonin or glutamate regulate dorsal vessel physiology in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, live mosquitoes were restrained, and a video of the contracting heart (the abdominal portion of the dorsal vessel) was acquired. These adult female mosquitoes were then injected with various amounts of serotonin, glutamate, or a control vehicle solution, and additional videos were acquired at 2 and 10\u00a0min post-treatment. Comparison of the videos taken before and after treatment revealed that serotonin accelerates the frequency of heart contractions, with the cardioacceleration being significantly more pronounced when the wave-like contractions of cardiac muscle propagate in the anterograde direction (toward the head). Comparison of the videos taken before and after treatment with glutamate revealed that this molecule is also cardioacceleratory. However, unlike serotonin, the activity of glutamate does not depend on whether the contractions propagate in the anterograde or the retrograde (toward the posterior of the abdomen) directions. Serotonin or glutamate induces a minor change or no change in the percentage of contractions and the percentage of the time that the heart contracts in the anterograde or the retrograde directions. In summary, this study shows that the neurotransmitters serotonin and glutamate increase the heart contraction rate of mosquitoes.",

The effects of a group environment during incubation on egg development and incubation period were also investigated during the final 3\u00a0weeks of development. Chelodina longicollis hatch synchronously and metabolically compensate so that less advanced embryos catch up to more advanced clutch-mates.

     "abstract": "Cortisol is the main biomarker of physiological stress in fish. It is usually measured in plasma, which requires blood collection. Though cortisol is produced in the anterior kidney, it can diffuse easily through cell membranes due to its lipophilic nature. Taking advantage of that, some non-invasive techniques have been developed to measure cortisol directly in the water from fish-holding tanks, in skin mucus or in scales. In this study, we explored the possibility to analyze fish cortisol from gill filaments as a reliable acute stress marker. Our results show that gill cortisol levels correlate well with plasma cortisol levels in both rainbow trout and zebrafish exposed or not to an acute stress protocol. Measuring cortisol in gill filaments increases the available possibilities for stress assessment in fish. Although this approach should yet be tested for its use with other stressors, it has several advantages: In relatively large fish (i.e. above 30\u00a0g) gill cortisol levels could be measured in vivo. Sampling of gill biopsies is very fast and easy, and the procedure does not induce stress if properly performed, making it an ideal option for in vivo stress assessment. In small fish, the use of gill tissue to measure cortisol has important technical advantages with respect to the current methods using whole-body homogenates. Gill homogenates could be used directly for ELISA cortisol analysis, avoiding the need of tedious and expensive cortisol extraction protocols, and, since no organic solvent is required, contributing for a more environmentally friendly analysis.",

Ostriches (Struthio camelus) have large fermentation chambers and long digesta retention, emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) have a short gut and short retention times, and rheas (Rhea americana) are intermediate. A recent study showed that ostriches produce as much methane (CH4) as expected for a similar-sized, non-ruminant mammalian herbivore. We hypothesized that emus and rheas produce less CH4 than ostriches. We individually measured, by chamber respirometry, the amount of O2 consumed as well as CO2 and CH4 emitted from six adult rheas (body mass 23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3\u00a0kg) and two adult emus (33.5 and 32.0\u00a0kg) during 23-hour periods on a pelleted lucerne diet. In contrast to previous studies, which classified emus as non-producers, we measured CH4 emissions at 7.39 and 6.25\u00a0L/day for emus and 2.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.82\u00a0L/day for rheas, which is close to values expected for similar-sized non-ruminant mammals for both species. O2 consumption was of a similar magnitude as reported previously. Across ratites, CH4 yield (L/kg dry matter intake) was positively correlated with mean retention time of food particles in the gut, similar to findings within ruminant species. In ratites, this relationship leads to similar body mass-specific CH4 production for a high intake/short retention and a low intake/long retention strategy. Therefore, when investigating CH4 production in herbivorous birds, it is advisable to consider various CH4 measures, not only yield or absolute daily amount alone.",

Here, we conducted a comparative study and characterized secondary structure of the six newly identified sHsp genes Hsp17, Hsp21, Hsp22, Hsp23, Hsp24, and Hsp34. A characteristic \u03b1-crystallin domain is predicted in all the new proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a strong relation to other sHSPs from insects and interesting evidence regarding evolutionary origin and duplication events. Comparative analysis of transcription profiles for Hsp27, Hsp70, and the six newly identified genes revealed that Hsp17, Hsp21, and Hsp22 are constitutively expressed under normal conditions, while under two different heat shock conditions these genes are either not activated or are even repressed (Hsp22). In contrast, Hsp23, Hsp24, and Hsp34 are significantly activated along with Hsp27 and Hsp70 during heat stress.

By using immunohistochemistry, we localized the steroid-producing cells in mature zebrafish gonads and determined different expression patterns between males and females. All these steroidogenic enzymes and Foxl2a were detected both in the testis and ovary. In the testis, they were all localized both in Leydig and germ cells except Cyp19a1b which was only detected in germ cells. In the ovary, Cyp17-I, Cyp19a1a and Foxl2a were immunolocalized in both somatic and germ cells while Cyp19a1b was only detected in germ cells and Cyp11c1 in somatic cells. Moreover, Cyp19a1a and Foxl2a did not display exactly the same patterns of spatial localization but their expressions were correlated suggesting a possible regulation of cyp19a1a gene by Foxl2a in zebrafish. Comparative analysis revealed a dimorphic expression of Cyp11c1, Cyp19a1a, Cyp19a1b and Foxl2a between males and females. Overall, our study provides a detailed description of the expression of proteins involved in the biosynthesis of steroidal hormones at the cellular scale within gonads, which is critical to further elucidating the intimate roles of the enzymes and the use of the zebrafish as a model in the field of endocrinology.",

     "abstract": "Mature three-spined stickleback males use spiggin threads secreted from their kidney to glue together nest material. This requires strongly hypertrophied renal proximal tubular cells, which compromises renal osmoregulatory function during the breeding period. Experimental evidence suggests that the intestine takes over hypotonic fluid secretion at that stage but the mechanism is unexplored. To unravel the molecular mechanism we analyzed and compared transcript levels of several membrane proteins involved in water and salt transport in intestinal and renal tissues, in non-mature males (NM), mature males (MM), and mature females (MF). Aquaporin paralogs aqp1a, -3a, -8aa, -8ab, -10a, and -10b, two Na+,K+-ATPase alpha-1 subunit isoforms (nka547, nka976), Na+,K+,2Cl\u2212-, and Na+,Cl\u2212-cotransporters (nkcc1a, nkcc2, ncc), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and two claudin isoforms (cldn2, cldn15a) were expressed in the intestine and kidney in all groups. There were no differences in aqp and cldn expression between intestines of NM and MM; nkcc2 was lower and nka levels tended to be higher in intestines of MM than in NM. In the kidney, aqp1 and aqp8ab levels were lower in MM than in NM, whereas aqp3a, nkcc1a, cldn15a, and spiggin were markedly elevated. This was accompanied by marked hypertrophy of kidney tubules in MM. The data support an altered kidney function in terms of water handling in mature males, whereas there was no support for modified trans-epithelial water permeability or salt-secretory activity in the intestine of mature males. Salt-absorptive activity in the intestine may, however, be down-regulated during male maturation.",

     "abstract": "Burmese pythons are sit-and-wait predators that are well adapted to go long periods without food, yet subsequently consume and digest single meals that can exceed their body weight. These large feeding events result in a dramatic alkaline tide that is compensated by a hypoventilatory response that normalizes plasma pH; however, little is known regarding how plasma HCO3\u2212 is lowered in the days post-feeding. The current study demonstrated that Burmese pythons contain the cellular machinery for renal acid\u2013base compensation and actively remodel the kidney to limit HCO3\u2212 reabsorption in the post-feeding period. After being fed a 25% body weight meal plasma total CO2 was elevated by 1.5-fold after 1\u00a0day, but returned to control concentrations by 4\u00a0days post-feeding (dpf). Gene expression analysis was used to verify the presence of carbonic anhydrase (CA) II, IV and XIII, Na+ H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), the Na+ HCO3\u2212 co-transporter (NBC) and V-type ATPase. CA IV expression was significantly down-regulated at 3\u00a0dpf versus fasted controls. This was supported by activity analysis that showed a significant decrease in the amount of GPI-linked CA activity in isolated kidney membranes at 3\u00a0dpf versus fasted controls. In addition, V-type ATPase activity was significantly up-regulated at 3\u00a0dpf; no change in gene expression was observed. Both CA II and NHE3 expression was up-regulated at 3\u00a0dpf, which may be related to post-prandial ion balance. These results suggest that Burmese pythons actively remodel their kidney after feeding, which would in part benefit renal HCO3\u2212 clearance.",

Rainbow trout grew better than Atlantic salmon, and did not show reduced growth at 19\u00a0\u00b0C. Rainbow trout kept at 19\u00a0\u00b0C had increased blood hemoglobin concentration compared to rainbow trout kept at 13\u00a0\u00b0C, while salmon did not show the same hemoglobin response due to increased temperature. Both species showed reduced length growth and decreased muscle glycogen stores at 19\u00a0\u00b0C. Circulating IGF-1 concentration was higher in rainbow trout than in Atlantic salmon, but was not affected by temperature in either species. Plasma IGF-binding protein 1b (IGFBP-1b) concentration was reduced in Atlantic salmon reared at 19\u00a0\u00b0C after 15\u00a0days but increased in rainbow trout at 19 \u00b0C after 35\u00a0days. The igfbp1b mRNA level in liver showed a positive correlation to plasma concentrations of glucose and IGFBP-1b, suggesting involvement of this binding protein in carbohydrate metabolism at 19\u00a0\u00b0C. At this temperature muscle igfbp1a mRNA was down-regulated in both species. The muscle expression of this binding protein correlated negatively with muscle igf1 and length growth. The plasma IGFBP-1b concentration and igfbp1b and igfbp1a expression suggests reduced muscle igf1 signaling at elevated temperature leading to glucose allostasis, and that time course is species specific due to higher thermal tolerance in rainbow trout.",

     "abstract": "Molecular chaperones [heat shock proteins (HSPs)] increase in response to rapid changes in temperatures, but long-term acclimation to cold temperature may also warrant elevations in HSPs. In fishes, cold acclimation increases mitochondrial density and oxidative stress in some tissues, which may increase demand for HSPs. We hypothesized that levels of HSPs, as well as sirtuins (SIRTs), NAD-dependent deacetylases that mediate changes in metabolism and responses to oxidative stress (including increases in HSPs), would increase during cold acclimation of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Transcript levels of hsp70, hsc70, hsp60 and hsp90-\u03b1, sirts1\u20134, as well as protein levels of HSP60, HSP90 and HSC70 were quantified in liver and pectoral adductor muscle of stickleback during cold acclimation from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 8\u00a0\u00b0C. In liver, cold acclimation stimulated a transient increase in mRNA levels of hsp60 and hsc70. Transcript levels of sirt1 and sirt2 also increased in response to cold acclimation and remained elevated. In pectoral muscle, mRNA levels of hsp60, hsp90-\u03b1, hsc70 and sirt1 all transiently increased in response to cold acclimation, while levels of sirts2\u20134 remained constant or declined. Similar to transcript levels, protein levels of HSC70 increased in both liver and pectoral muscle. Levels of HSP90 also increased in liver after 4\u00a0weeks at 8\u00a0\u00b0C. HSP60 remained unchanged in both tissues, as did HSP90 in pectoral muscle. Our results indicate that while both HSPs and SIRTs increase in response to cold acclimation in stickleback, the response is tissue and isoform specific, likely reflecting differences in metabolism and oxidative stress.",

Nevertheless, studies on trypsin/trypsinogen in fish embryos are very limited. In this study, the trypsinogen of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) (tTG) was identified and the expression patterns and activity of trypsinogen/trypsin were investigated. The results showed that the tTG mRNA was evenly distributed in the oocytes and was also expressed along the yolk periphery in early embryos. At later embryo stages and 1\u00a0days after hatching (dph), the tTG mRNA concentrated at the alimentary tract and head. Quantitative expression analysis showed that the tTG transcripts decreased after fertilization until the gastrula stage, then increased with the embryo and larvae development. This result was also confirmed by the specific activity analysis of trypsin and in-situ-hybridization (ISH). All of the results indicated that tTG in early embryo stages was maternally derived and expressed by itself after gastrula stages. Additionally, location of tTG mRNA in embryos and larvae was investigated; we considered that trypsin may have multiple functions during the embryo development process. Based on our results regarding trypsinogen in embryos and early development, we concluded that the trypsin/trypsinogen in turbot embryos was inherited from a maternal source and we suggested that trypsin in early development has multiple functions in the process of development.",

     "abstract": "A multistressor study was conducted to investigate interactive effects of nutritional status and salinity on osmoregulation of juvenile white sturgeon. Our hypothesis was that lower nutritional status would decrease the salinity tolerance of juvenile white sturgeon. A four-week feed restriction (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 100% of optimum feeding rate: OFR defined as the rate (% body weight per day) at which growth is maximal) trial was performed, and relevant indices of nutritional status were measured. Following the trial, sturgeon were acutely exposed to various salinities (0, 8, 16, 24\u00a0ppt) for 120\u00a0h, and relevant osmoregulatory measurements were made at 12, 72, and 120\u00a0h post-salinity exposures. The feed-restriction trial resulted in a graded nutritional response with the most feed-restricted group (12.5% OFR) showing the lowest nutritional status. The salinity exposure trial showed clear evidence that lower nutritional status decreased the salinity tolerance of juvenile white sturgeon. Increasing salinities resulted in significant alterations in osmoregulatory indices of all feeding groups; however, a significantly slower acclimatory response to 24\u00a0ppt was detected in the most feed-restricted group compared to the non-feed-restricted group (100% OFR). Furthermore, evaluation of the effect of nutritional status on the relationship between osmoregulatory measurements and body size showed that there was a significant negative relationship between osmoregulatory performance and body size within the most feed-restricted group. This suggests that there is a certain body size range (200\u2013300\u00a0g based on our finding) where juvenile white sturgeon can maximize osmoregulatory capacity at a salinity of 24\u00a0ppt.",

Glycemia was not affected by GHRL, GRP, PP, and PYY treatments, but was suppressed by CCK. A tendency toward lower plasma glucose concentrations was observed in fish administered GLP at 50\u00a0ng/g BW. Hypothalamic NPY expression was highly variable and not significantly affected by treatment. POMC expression was also variable, but tended to be reduced by the highest concentration of CCK.

Prior to internal pipping, the chicken DA produces a weak O2-induced contraction. During hatching, the O2-sensitivity of the avian DA vessels increases significantly. To see if we could accelerate the maturation of chicken DA O2-sensitivity, we exposed the vessel in vitro to elevated O2 (25\u00a0kPa) for 3-h prior to internal pipping on day 19 of incubation. The DA initially responded to increasing O2 with a weak contraction (0.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0N/m) that significantly increased in strength (0.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0N/m) during 3-h 25\u00a0kPa O2 exposure. A tonic influence of nitric oxide, not present at low O2, appeared during the 3-h 25\u00a0kPa O2 exposure. The long-term O2-induced contraction was mediated by both L-type Ca2+ channels and internal Ca2+ stores. The Rho-kinase pathway inhibitors Y-27632 and fasudil produced significant relaxation, suggesting a role for Ca2+ sensitization in the contractile response to the 3\u00a0h of elevated O2. While the day 19 DA initially exhibited an immature contractile response to O2, maturation of the pathways regulating O2-induced contraction was accelerated by exposure to 25\u00a0kPa O2, producing contractions similar in magnitude to those found during the final stage of hatching. This suggests that maturation of O2-sensitivity may be accelerated in vivo by increasing arterial O2 levels.",

Thus, we investigated the independent and interactive effects of temperature and energy intake on the growth and metabolic rate of juvenile corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) in the context of shifts in complex environments. Unlike previous studies that imposed constant or fluctuating temperature regimes, we manipulated the availability of preferred thermal microclimates (control vs. relatively warm regimes) for eight weeks and allowed snakes to behaviorally thermoregulate among microclimates. By also controlling for energy intake, we demonstrate an interactive effect of temperature and energy on growth\u2014relevant temperature shifts had no effect on snakes' growth when energy intake was low and a positive effect on growth when energy intake was high. Thus, acclimation to relatively warm thermal options can result in increased rates of growth when food is abundant in a taxon in which body size confers fitness advantages. Temperature and energy also interactively influenced metabolic rate\u2014snakes in the warmer temperature regime exhibited reduced metabolic rate (O2 consumption rate at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 30\u00a0\u00b0C) if they had relatively high energy intake. Although we advocate for continued investigation into the effects of complex environments on other traits, our results indicate that warming may actually benefit important life history traits in some taxa and that metabolic shifts may underlie thermal acclimation.",

In support of this view, it has been shown that fish Mb O2 affinities differ between species when measured at the same temperature, but are in fact similar when adjusted for in vivo muscle temperatures, most likely to maintain intracellular O2 delivery in species adapted to different environments. It is unknown whether similar adaptations exist in the O2 affinity of Mb from reptiles, despite this group of ectothermic vertebrates displaying great variation in the tolerance to both temperature and hypoxia. In this study, we have purified Mb from muscle tissues of three reptilian species (turtle, tortoise and alligator) with different lifestyles. We have measured O2 binding characteristics and autoxidation rates of the three Mbs and measured the effects of temperature, lactate and blocking of reactive thiols on the O2 affinity of turtle Mb. Our data show that, at a constant temperature, reptilian Mbs have similar O2 affinities that are lower than those of mammalian Mbs, which may optimize intracellular O2 transport at lower body temperatures. Reptilian Mbs have lower autoxidation rates than both mammalian and fish Mbs, which may be beneficial during oxidative stress.

It is shown that there is a complex interaction between dietary monosaccharide concentrations, mitochondrial activity and oxidative modifications to proteins and lipids. Glucose at high concentration (10%) reduced mitochondrial protein density and consequently respiration in flies, while fructose did not affect these parameters. The production of ROS by mitochondria did not reflect activities of mitochondrial complexes. Moreover, there was no clear connection between mtROS production and antioxidant defense or between antioxidant defense and developmental survival, shown in our previous study (Rovenko et al., Comp.

Instead, mtROS and antioxidant machinery cooperated to maintain a redox state that determined survival rates, and paradoxically, pro-oxidant conditions facilitated larva survival independently of the type of carbohydrate. It seems that in this complex system glucose controls the amount of oxidative modification regulating mitochondrial activity, while fructose regulates steady-state mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes.",

In addition, a reduction in salinity was associated with increased levels of dopamine, ACTH, and cortisol (in vivo). Reductions in salinity evidently caused NRs and OR to increase the expression of cortisol and dopamine. We concluded that memory capacity and olfactory imprinting of salmon is related to the salinity of the environment during the migration to spawning sites. Furthermore, salinity affects the memory/imprinting and olfactory abilities, and cortisol and dopamine is also related with olfactory-related memories during migration.",

The ultrastructure of gills was also evaluated. All these results in this study showed a dose-dependent effect with ammonia exposure concentration. The data displayed a significant increase in hemolymph ammonia and urea concentrations under ammonia exposure. The up-regulation of Rh mRNA together with up-regulation of K+-channel mRNA, NKA activity, down-regulation of NKCC and NHE mRNA suggested a coordinated protective response to maintain a relatively low ammonia concentration in the body fluids during ambient ammonia exposure. The up-regulation of VAMP, H+-ATPase activity along with the ultrastructure of gills suggested a mechanism of exocytotic ammonia excretion that may exit in the gill of P. trituberculatus. An increased production of urea and the up-regulated expression of UT suggested that the crab can detoxify elevated ammonia levels in the body fluids into urea when pathways of ammonia excretion are decreased after long term ammonia exposure.",

     "abstract": "Brain glycogen is depleted when used as an emergency energy substrate. In mammals, brain glycogen levels rebound to higher than normal levels after a hypoglycemic episode and a few hours after refeeding or administration of glucose. This phenomenon is called glycogen supercompensation. However, this mechanism has not been investigated in lower vertebrates. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether brain glycogen supercompensation occurs in the rainbow trout brain. For this purpose, short-term brain glucose and glycogen contents were determined in rainbow trout after being subjected to the following experimental conditions: i) a 5-day or 10-day fasting period and refeeding; ii) a single injection of insulin (4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) and refeeding; and iii) sustained swimming and injection of glucose (500\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01). Food deprivation during the fasting periods and insulin administration both induced a decrease in glucose and glycogen levels in the brain. However, only refeeding after 10\u00a0days of fasting significantly increased the brain glycogen content above control levels, in a clear short-term supercompensation response. Unlike in mammals, prolonged exercise did not alter brain glucose or glycogen levels. Furthermore, brain glycogen supercompensation was not observed after glucose administration in fish undergoing sustained swimming. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing direct experimental evidence for the existence of a short-term glycogen supercompensation response in a teleost brain, although the response was only detectable after prolonged fasting.",

The antioxidant system in athletes contributes to neutralize the concomitant rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The objective of this study was to compare the antioxidant system in muscle of three species of elasmobranchs and teleosts, considering differences in swimming capacity among species within each group and evolutionary differences between the two groups. Muscle samples were collected from elasmobranchs (Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Mustelus henlei) and teleosts (Totoaba macdonaldi, Kajikia audax and Coryphaena hippurus) in the coast of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. The enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) was determined by spectrophotometry. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, GPx and GST was higher in elasmobranchs, as a group, than in teleosts. In fish species with high swimming capacities, P. glauca, K. audax and C. hippurus, antioxidant enzyme activity was higher in comparison with species with lower swimming capacities, M. henlei and T. macdonaldi. It is possible that antioxidant enzymes, particularly SOD, GPx and GST, contribute to avoidance of oxidative damage in teleost and elasmobranch species with higher swimming capacities. The antioxidant enzyme activities in fish appear to depend mainly on their swimming capacity and life style rather than the evolutionary group (elasmobranchs, teleosts).",

The 22-kDa form has been identified as IGFBP-1b and shown to increase under catabolic conditions. We developed a competitive time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) for salmon IGFBP-1b. Purified salmon IGFBP-1b was used for biotin-labeling, assay standard and antiserum production. The TR-FIA did not cross-react with the 41-kDa form (IGFBP-2b) but showed 3% cross-reactivity with the 28-kDa form (IGFBP-1a). It measured IGFBP-1b levels as low as 0.4\u00a0ng/ml, and ED80 and ED20 were 0.9 and 24.6\u00a0ng/ml, respectively. There appears to be little interference by IGF-I. Using the TR-FIA, serum IGFBP-1b levels were measured in individually-tagged underyearling masu salmon fed or fasted for 5\u00a0weeks, or fasted for 3\u00a0weeks followed by refeeding for 2\u00a0weeks. Fasting for 3\u00a0weeks significantly increased circulating IGFBP-1b levels, while it returned to the basal levels after prolonged fasting for additional 2\u00a0weeks. Serum IGFBP-1b level negatively correlated with body weight, condition factor, specific growth rate and serum IGF-I level. During parr\u2013smolt transformation of masu salmon, average circulating IGFBP-1b levels were the highest in May. There was a positive correlation between serum IGFBP-1b and IGF-I, which is in contrast to that in the fasting/feeding experiment. IGFBP-1b also showed a positive relationship with gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity. These results suggest that the relationship between circulating IGFBP-1b and IGF-I during smoltification differs from that during fasting and IGFBP-1b may play a role in the development of hypoosmoregulatory ability.",

They were identified by blast-search in the medaka genome database based on representation in osmoregulatory organs of other teleosts. Our hypothesis was that, because of their sequence similarities to mammalian orthologs previously characterized as barrier- and ion-selective channel-forming proteins, these paralogs would respond to salinity according to expected modulation of osmoregulatory function. Cldn10c, -10d, -10e, -10f, -27a, -28a, -28b and -30c had 4- to 100-fold higher expression in gill than other examined organs. Two splice variants of cldn10b were predominantly expressed in kidney, while cldn15a, -15b and -25 were found mainly in intestine. In gills, cldn27a, -28a, -28b and -30c did not change between fresh water (FW) and seawater (SW)-acclimated fish, while cldn10c, -10d, -10e, and -10f were most abundant in SW. Short-term SW transfer induced up-regulation of cldn10 gill paralogs after 1\u00a0day, decrease in cldn28b and no difference for cldn27a, -28a and -30c. The reverse pattern was observed after FW transfer of SW medaka. Intestinal cldn15a and -25 did not differ between FW and SW fish. However, cldn15b was 10-fold higher in FW than SW, suggesting a role in functional modulation of the intestine related to water and salt transport. In kidney, cldn10bs were elevated in SW fish, suggesting a role in paracellular ion transport in the marine nephron. Based on in silico analysis, most gill Cldn10s were predicted to form cation pores, whereas Cldn27a, 28a, 28b and 30c may increase epithelial resistance.",

This study investigated lower intestinal morphology and transport activity in two wild bird species with natural diets containing either low or high salt. Tissues from rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) and common murres (Uria aalge) were sampled for histology and electrophysiological analyses. The ptarmigan exists on a low salt diet, while the murre lives on a high protein and high salt diet. The ptarmigan colon and coprodeum had villi/folds and crypts and the epithelium contained absorptive epithelial cells, mitochondria-rich cells and goblet cells. The colon had significant amiloride-inhibitable Isc, 5-15\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2, with no glucose-stimulated Isc, and no significant phloridzin inhibition. The coprodeum also had high amiloride-inhibitable Isc. This transport pattern corresponded to that of chickens on low-salt diets. However, the ptarmigan colon also had a significant lysine/leucine-stimulated Isc of 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2. The short U. aalge colon was similar to that of ptarmigans, but with no villi. It demonstrated a significant lysine/leucine-stimulated Isc (11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2) with no amiloride-inhibitable Isc, similar to the high-salt chicken colon, but with no Na+-glucose cotransport. The murre coprodeum was inert to all substances and showed high resistance (1000\u00a0\u03a9\u00b7cm2), with a multilayered squamous epithelium. Despite some variations possibly associated with dietary protein intake, we conclude that natural high and low salt diets in different avian species are associated with different lower intestinal transport patterns, providing for post-renal adjustments in ion and water excretion.",

     "abstract": "Over-winter mortality is an important selective force for warm-water fish (e.g., centrarchids) that live in temperate habitats. Inherent challenges faced by fish during winter may be compounded by additional stressors that activate the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013interrenal axis, either before or during winter, leading to negative sub-lethal impacts on fish health and condition, and possibly reducing chance of survival. We used experimental cortisol manipulation to test the hypothesis that juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exposed to semi-chronic elevation in cortisol prior to winter would experience higher levels of over-winter mortality, physiological alterations and impaired immune status relative to control and sham-treated bass. Over-winter survival in experimental ponds was high, averaging 83%, and did not differ among treatment groups. Over the study period, bass exhibited an average increase in mass of 19.4%, as well as a slight increase in Fulton's condition factor, but neither measure differed among groups. Hepatosomatic index in cortisol-treated bass was 23% lower than in control fish, suggesting lower energy status, but white muscle lipid content was similar across all groups. Lastly, there was no difference in spleen somatic index or parasite load among treatment groups, indicating no long-term immune impairment related to our cortisol manipulation. The current study adds to a growing body of literature on glucocorticoid manipulations where field-based findings are not consistent with laboratory-based conceptual understanding of multiple stressors. This suggests that field conditions may provide fish with opportunities to mitigate negative effects of some stressors.",

Arterial blood samples taken at 4100\u00a0m of elevation in acclimatized rats and adapted pikas revealed inter-species differences with lower hemoglobin and hematocrit and higher blood pH in pikas. A linear and significant increase in minute ventilation was observed in pikas, which help them to cope with hypoxic\u2013hypercapnia. Pikas also displayed a high inspiratory drive and an invariant respiratory timing regardless of the conditions. Biochemical analysis revealed that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor gene and nNOS gene are highly conserved between rats and pikas, however pikas have higher expression of NMDA receptors and nNOS compared to rats at the brainstem level. Taken together, these results suggest that pikas have developed a specific ventilatory pattern supported by a modification of the NMDA/NO ventilatory central pathways to survive in extreme conditions imposed on the Tibetan plateaus. These physiological adaptive strategies help in maintaining a better blood oxygenation despite high CO2 concentration in burrows at high altitude.",

However, the mechanisms by which ROMKa expression is regulated in response to perturbations of plasma K+ levels are unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify potential links between the endocrine system and K+ regulation in a euryhaline fish. We assessed time-course changes in multiple endocrine parameters, including plasma cortisol and gene expression of branchial glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR1, GR2, and MR) and pituitary hormones, in seawater (SW)-acclimated Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) exposed to high-K+ (H-K) SW. Exposure to H-K SW elicited little effects on plasma cortisol or mRNA levels of GRs and pituitary hormones. Since plasma K+ and branchial ROMKa expression was increased within 6\u00a0h after H-K treatment in vivo, the effect of high K+ was subsequently tested in a gill filament incubation experiment using media with differing K+ concentrations. ROMKa mRNA levels were induced following incubation of filaments in H-K medium for 6\u00a0h. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the expression of ROMKa in teleost ionocytes can respond to high K+ conditions independent from systemic signaling.",

An intact group (IG) and an experimental group (EG, bilateral excision of first gill arch) were submitted to graded hypoxia, with and without access to air. The first pair of gill arches ablations reduced respiratory surface area and removed innervation by cranial nerve IX. In graded hypoxia without access to air, both groups displayed bradycardia and increased ventilatory stroke volume (VT), and the IG showed a significant increase in breathing frequency (fR). The EG exhibited very high fR in normoxia that did not increase further in hypoxia, this was linked to reduced O2 extraction from the ventilatory current (EO2) and a significantly higher critical O2 tension (PcO2) than the IG. In hypoxia with access to air, only the IG showed increased air-breathing, indicating that the first pair of gill arches excision severely attenuated air-breathing responses. Both groups exhibited bradycardia before and tachycardia after air-breaths. The fH and gill ventilation amplitude (VAMP) in the EG were overall higher than the IG. External and internal NaCN injections revealed that O2 chemoreceptors mediating ventilatory hypoxic responses (fR and VT) are internally oriented. The NaCN injections indicated that fR responses were mediated by receptors predominantly in the first pair of gill arches but VT responses by receptors on all gill arches. Receptors eliciting cardiac responses were both internally and externally oriented and distributed on all gill arches or extra-branchially. Air-breathing responses were predominantly mediated by receptors in the first pair of gill arches. In conclusion, the role of the first pair of gill arches is related to: (a) an elevated EO2 providing an adequate O2 uptake to maintain the aerobic metabolism during normoxia; (b) a significant bradycardia and increased fAB elicited by externally oriented O2 chemoreceptors; (c) increase in the ventilatory variables (fR and VAMP) stimulated by internally oriented O2 chemoreceptors.",

     "abstract": "The dynamics of animal populations are greatly influenced by interactions with their natural enemies and food resources. However, quantifying the relative effects of these factors on demographic rates remains a perpetual challenge for animal population ecology. Food scarcity is assumed to limit the growth and to initiate the decline of cyclic herbivore populations, but this has not been verified with physiological health indices. We hypothesized that individuals in declining populations would exhibit signs of malnutrition-induced deterioration of physiological condition. We evaluated the association of body condition with population cycle phase in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) during the increase and decline phases of a population cycle. The bank voles had lower body masses, condition indices and absolute masses of particular organs during the decline. Simultaneously, they had lower femoral masses, mineral contents and densities. Hemoglobin and hematocrit values and several parameters known to respond to food deprivation were unaffected by the population phase. There were no signs of lymphopenia, eosinophilia, granulocytosis or monocytosis. Erythrocyte counts were higher and plasma total protein levels and tissue proportions of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids lower in the population decline. Ectoparasite load was lower and adrenal gland masses or catecholamine concentrations did not suggest higher stress levels. Food availability seems to limit the size of voles during the decline but they can adapt to the prevailing conditions without clear deleterious health effects. This highlights the importance of quantifying individual health state when evaluating the effects of complex trophic interactions on the dynamics of wild animal populations.",

The full-length cDNA (2471\u00a0bp) consists of a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) (89\u00a0bp), a 3\u2032-UTR (426\u00a0bp), and an open reading frame (1956\u00a0bp) that encodes 651 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 71.8\u00a0kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.34. Based on the amino acid sequence analysis and multiple sequence alignment, this cDNA is a member of cytoplasmic hsp70 subfamily of the hsp70 family and was designated as ot-hsp70. Tissue expression analysis showed that HSP70 expression is highest in the testes when all examined organs were compared. Immunohistochemistry analysis, together with hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining, revealed that the HSP70 protein was expressed in all spermatogenic cells, but not in fibroblasts. In addition, O. tankahkeei were heat challenged by exposure to 32\u00a0\u00b0C seawater for 2\u00a0h, then returned to 13\u00a0\u00b0C for various recovery time (0\u201324\u00a0h). Relative expression of ot-hsp70 mRNA in the testes was measured at different time points post-challenge by quantitative real-time PCR. A clear time-dependent mRNA expression of ot-hsp70 after thermal stress indicates that the HSP70 gene is inducible.

Knowledge of the physiological mechanisms mediating effects in various tissues of fish is incomplete. Here we tested the effects of extracellular hypercapnia and acidosis on energy metabolism of gill and liver cells of Atlantic cod. Exposure media mimicked blood conditions in vivo, either during normo- or hypercapnia and at control or acidic extracellular pH (pHe). We determined metabolic rate and energy expenditure for protein biosynthesis, Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase and considered nutrition status by measurements of metabolic rate and protein biosynthesis in media with and without free amino acids (FAA). Addition of FAA stimulated hepatic but not branchial oxygen consumption. Normo- and hypercapnic acidosis as well as hypercapnia at control pHe depressed metabolic stimulation of hepatocytes. In gill cells, acidosis depressed respiration independent of PCO2 and FAA levels. For both cell types, depressed respiration was not correlated with the same reduction in energy allocated to protein biosynthesis or Na+/K+-ATPase. Hepatic energy expenditure for protein synthesis and Na+/K+-ATPase was even elevated at acidic compared to control pHe suggesting increased costs for ion regulation and cellular reorganization. Hypercapnia at control pHe strongly reduced oxygen demand of branchial Na+/K+-ATPase with a similar trend for H+-ATPase.

Recent studies suggest the phospholipase C zeta (PLC\u03b6), a sperm-specific protein, triggers egg activation by an IP3-mediated Ca2\u00a0+ release and allow Ca2\u00a0+ waves at fertilization. In the present study we cloned, characterized, and phylogenetically positioned the European eel PLC\u03b6 (PLC\u03b61). It is 1521bp long, with 10 exons encoding an open reading frame of 506 amino acids. The amino acid sequence contains an EF-hand domain, X and Y catalytic domains, and a carboxy-terminal C2 domain, all typical of other PLC\u03b6 orthologous. The tissue distribution was studied, and the gene expression was determined in testis during induced sexual maturation at three different thermal regimes. Also, brain and pituitary expression was studied through sex maturation at constant temperature. plc\u03b61 was expressed in brain of male and female, in testis but not in ovaries. By first time in vertebrates, it is reported plc\u03b61 expression in the pituitary gland. Testis plc\u03b61 expression increased through spermatogenesis under all the thermal regimes, but being significantly elevated at lower temperatures. It was very low when testis contained only spermatogonia or spermatocytes, while maximum expression was found during spermiogenesis. These results support the hypothesis for an eel sperm-specific PLC\u03b61 inducing egg activation, similarly to mammals and some teleosts, but different from some other teleost species, which express this protein in ovaries, but not in testes.",

     "abstract": "Antarctic icefishes (Family Channichthyidae) within the suborder Notothenioidei lack the oxygen-binding protein hemoglobin (Hb), and six of the 16 species of icefishes lack myoglobin (Mb) in heart ventricle. As iron-centered proteins, Hb and Mb can promote the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage biological macromolecules. Consistent with this, our previous studies have shown that icefishes have lower levels of oxidized proteins and lipids in oxidative muscle compared to red-blooded notothenioids. Because oxidized proteins are usually degraded by the 20S proteasome and must be resynthesized, we hypothesized that rates of protein synthesis would be lower in icefishes compared to red-blooded notothenioids, thereby reducing the energetic costs of protein synthesis and conferring a benefit to the loss of Hb and Mb. Rates of protein synthesis were quantified in hearts, and the fraction of oxygen consumption devoted to protein synthesis was measured in isolated hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes of notothenioids differing in the expression of Hb and cardiac Mb. Neither rates of protein synthesis nor the energetic costs of protein synthesis differed among species, suggesting that red-blooded species do not degrade and replace oxidatively modified proteins at a higher rate compared to icefishes but rather, persist with higher levels of oxidized proteins.",

Primary mesenchyme cells within the larval body cavity form a syncytium to secrete CaCO3 spicules from intracellular amorphous CaCO3 (ACC) stores. We studied the role of Na+K+2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC) in intracellular ACC accumulation and larval spicule formation of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. First, we incubated growing larvae with three different loop diuretics (azosemide, bumetanide, and furosemide) and established concentration-response curves. All loop diuretics were able to inhibit calcification already at concentrations that specifically inhibit NKCC. Calcification was most effectively inhibited by azosemide (IC50\u00a0=\u00a06.5\u00a0\u03bcM), while larval mortality and swimming ability were not negatively impacted by the treatment. The inhibition by bumetanide (IC50\u00a0=\u00a026.4\u00a0\u03bcM) and furosemide (IC50\u00a0=\u00a0315.4\u00a0\u03bcM) resembled the pharmacological fingerprint of the mammalian NKCC1 isoform. We further examined the effect of azosemide on the maintenance of cytoplasmic cords and on the occurrence of calcification vesicles using fluorescent dyes (calcein, FM1-43). Fifty micromolars of azosemide inhibited the maintenance of cytoplasmic cords and resulted in increased calcein fluorescence within calcification vesicles. The expression of NKCC in S. droebachiensis was verified by PCR and Western blot with a specific NKCC antibody. In summary, the pharmacological profile of loop diuretics and their specific effects on calcification in sea urchin larvae suggest that they act by inhibition of NKCC via repression of cytoplasmic cord formation and maintenance.",

The present study identifies two CCK receptor subtypes in a stomachless teleost, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), and investigates by using an in vitro system their involvement mediating the effects of the sulfated octapeptide of CCK (CCK-8S) on the motility of isolated proximal intestine. Partial-length mRNAs encoding two CCK receptor isoforms (CCKAR and CCKBR.I) were sequenced and the structural analysis showed that both receptors belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily. Both goldfish CCK receptor sequences were more closely related to zebrafish sequences, sharing the lowest similarities with cavefish and tilapia. The highest expression of goldfish CCKAR was observed along the whole intestine whereas the CCKBR gen was predominantly expressed in the hypothalamus, vagal lobe and posterior intestine. Application of CCK-8S to the organ bath evoked a concentration-dependent contractile response in intestine strips. The contractions were not blocked by either tetrodotoxin or atropine, suggesting that CCK-8S acts on the gut smooth muscle directly. Preincubations of intestine strips with devazepide and L365,260 (CCKAR and CCKBR receptor selective antagonists) showed that the CCK-8S-induced contraction could be partially mediated by the CCKAR receptor subtype, which is also the most abundant CCK receptor found in gastrointestinal tissues. In conclusion, two CCK receptors with a differential distribution pattern has been identified in goldfish, and the CCKAR subtype is mainly involved in the regulation of intestinal motility by the CCK-8S.",

The lipid peroxidation of liver, gill and brain tissues significantly increased at 1\u00a0h after transfer, but reactive oxygen species in the treatment group increased significantly after 24\u00a0h as compared to the control. The fish were found to develop a cascading anti-oxidative mechanism beginning with an increase in Cu/Zn-SOD levels, followed by increased CAT and GPx mRNA expressions in the three tissue types. Both smtB and mt2 mRNAs increased in the hepatic and brain tissues following 1\u00a0h of cold stress, but only smtB exhibited a significant increase in the gills at 1\u00a0h and 6\u00a0h after transfer to 12\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, cellular apoptosis in the brain was not evident after cold shock, but liver and gills showed cellular apoptosis at 1\u20133\u00a0h, with another peak in the liver at 6\u00a0h after cold shock. The results suggest that the cold shock induced oxidative stress, and the enzymatic (SOD, GPx and CAT) and non-enzymatic (mt-2 and smt-B) mRNA expressions all play a role in the resulting anti-oxidation within 1\u20136\u00a0h of cold shock. A functional comparison showed that the brain had the most powerful antioxidant defense system of the three tissue types since it had the highest smtB mRNA expression and a lower level of cell apoptosis than the liver and gills after exposure to cold stress.",

We subjected 4 female Steller sea lions to 3 feeding regimes over 70-day trials (unrestricted food intake, acute nutritional stress, and chronic nutritional stress), and drew blood samples from each animal at the end of each feeding regime. We then extracted the RNA of white blood cells and measured the response of 8 genes known to react to diet restriction in terrestrial mammals. Overall, we found that the genomic response of Steller sea lions experiencing nutritional stress was consistent with how terrestrial mammals respond to dietary restrictions. Our nutritionally stressed sea lions down-regulated some cellular processes involved in immune response and oxidative stress, and up-regulated pro-inflammatory responses and metabolic processes. Nutrigenomics appears to be a promising means to monitor nutritional status and contribute to mitigation measures needed to assist in the recovery of Steller sea lions and other at-risk species of marine mammals.",

With aquatic hypercarbia predicted to become more prevalent in the future due to global climate change, it is important to quantify how hypercarbia impacts aquatic organisms, especially fish. The impact of hypercarbia on the behavior and physiology of fishes has been well studied, but relatively few studies have examined the molecular processes that underlie resulting behavioral and physiological changes. In an effort to define the molecular response of fishes to acute hypercarbia exposure, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were exposed to either 30\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 CO2 (pCO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a015,700\u00a0\u03bcatm) or ambient (10\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 CO2; pCO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a0920\u00a0\u03bcatm) conditions for 1\u00a0h and the expression of a variety of genes, across three tissues, were compared. Exposure to 30\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 CO2 in bluegill and silver carp resulted in an increase in c-fos, hif1-\u03b1, and gr-2 transcripts, while silver carp alone showed increases in hsp70 and hsc70-2 mRNA. This study demonstrates that acute hypercarbia exposure impacts gene expression in a species and tissue specific manner, which can be useful in identifying potential mechanisms for hypercarbia tolerance between species, and pinpoint specific tissues that are sensitive to hypercarbia exposure.",

We selected the hypoxia-tolerant crucian carp (Carassius carassius) and the hypoxia-sensitive Chinese bream (Parabramis pekinensis) as model fish and investigated their hypoxia tolerance based on the critical oxygen tension of the routine metabolic rate ( M \u02d9 O2rout) (Pcrit), aquatic surface respiration (ASRcrit) and loss of equilibrium (LOEcrit) after two weeks of acclimation at either 10, 20 or 30\u00a0\u00b0C. We also measured the tissue substrate (glycogen and glucose of muscle and liver) and lactate levels of both normoxia- and hypoxia-treated fish (post-LOE). Crucian carp exhibited significantly lower Pcrit and LOEcrit but not ASRcrit. Crucian carp possessed higher hypoxia tolerance, partially due to a higher tissue glycogen reserve, which provides cellular fuel under severe hypoxia, as well as higher lactate tolerance and clearance ability than Chinese bream. The hypoxia tolerance was maintained in crucian carp but was decreased in Chinese bream as the temperature increased. The difference between the two species is based on the greater recruitment of tissue glycogen, resulting in an increased level of cellular fuel during hypoxia in crucian carp than in Chinese bream. In addition, crucian carp possessed the greater liver lactate clearance capacity, and the smaller increase in the M \u02d9 O2rout at higher temperatures compared to Chinese bream. Furthermore, substrate shortage and decreased lactate tolerance at high temperatures in Chinese bream might also contribute to the difference in hypoxia tolerance between the two species.",

     "abstract": "In response to varying environmental and physiological challenges, vertebrates have evolved complex and often overlapping systems. These systems detect changes in environmental oxygen availability and respond by increasing oxygen supply to the tissues and/or by decreasing oxygen demand at the cellular level. This suite of responses is termed the oxygen transport cascade and is comprised of several components. These components include 1) chemosensory detectors that sense changes in oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH in the blood, and initiate changes in 2) ventilation and 3) cardiac work, thereby altering the rate of oxygen delivery to, and carbon dioxide clearance from, the tissues. In addition, changes in 4) cellular and systemic metabolism alters tissue-level metabolic demand. Thus the need for oxygen can be managed locally when increasing oxygen supply is not sufficient or possible. Together, these mechanisms provide a spectrum of responses that facilitate the maintenance of systemic oxygen homeostasis in the face of environmental hypoxia or physiological oxygen depletion (i.e. due to exercise or disease). Bill Milsom has dedicated his career to the study of these responses across phylogenies, repeatedly demonstrating the power of applying the comparative approach to physiological questions. The focus of this review is to discuss the anatomy, signalling pathways, and mechanics of each step of the oxygen transport cascade from the perspective of a Milsomite. That is, by taking into account the developmental, physiological, and evolutionary components of questions related to oxygen transport. We also highlight examples of some of the remarkable species that have captured Bill\u2019s attention through their unique adaptations in multiple components of the oxygen transport cascade, which allow them to achieve astounding physiological feats. Bill\u2019s research examining the oxygen transport cascade has provided important insight and leadership to the study of the diverse suite of adaptations that maintain cellular oxygen content across vertebrate taxa, which underscores the value of the comparative approach to the study of physiological systems.",

Bill has reminded us to think comparatively about O2 and CO2/H+ sensing. We present a brief review of the fish gill and O2 chemoreceptors, as well as recent results from our laboratory, that were discussed at a symposium in honour of Prof. Milsom's extensive career. In a series of papers from the Milsom laboratory from 1986 to 1995, it was demonstrated that the fish gill is a major site of chemosensory discharge during hypoxia, and that this response is sensitive to multiple neurochemicals involved in chemosensing. These and other more recent studies by Bill et al. are now fundamental and have helped to shape the field as it is today. At the cellular level, we have shown that chemosensitive neuroepithelial cells (NECs) of the gills may possess unique adaptations compared to their mammalian homologues. In addition, we used injection of the styryl dye, FM1-43, to identify gill NECs in zebrafish and demonstrate increased vesicular activity in NECs in vitro during acute stimulation. In vivo, we have identified 5-HT2, 5-HT3, dopaminergic and nicotinic receptor activity involved in the hyperventilatory response in developing zebrafish. With this model we have also traced the fate of mitotic cells in the gills, and demonstrated the regeneration of resected gill filaments and replacement of O2-sensitive NECs.",

     "abstract": "Bill Milsom has made seminal contributions to our understanding of ventilatory control in a wide range of vertebrates. Teleosts are particularly interesting, because they produce a 3rd, potentially toxic respiratory gas (ammonia) in large amounts. Fish are well known to hyperventilate under high environmental ammonia (HEA), but only recently has the potential role of ammonia in normal ventilatory control been investigated. It is now clear that ammonia can act directly as a ventilatory stimulant in trout, independent of its effects on acid\u2013base balance. Even in ureotelic dogfish sharks, acute elevations in ammonia cause increases in ventilation. Peripherally, the detection of elevated ammonia resides in gill arches I and II in trout, and in vitro, neuroepithelial cells (NECs) from these arches are sensitive to ammonia, responding with elevations in intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ ([Ca2\u00a0+]i). Centrally, hyperventilatory responses to ammonia correlate more closely with concentrations of ammonia in the brain than in plasma or CSF. After chronic HEA exposure, ventilatory responsiveness to ammonia is lost, associated with both an attenuation of the [Ca2\u00a0+]i response in NECs, and the absence of elevation in brain ammonia concentration. Chronic exposure to HEA also causes increases in the mRNA expression of several Rh proteins (ammonia-conductive channels) in both brain and gills. \u201cSingle cell\u201d PCR techniques have been used to isolate the individual responses of NECs versus other gill cell types. We suggest several circumstances (post-feeding, post-exercise) where the role of ammonia as a ventilatory stimulant may have adaptive benefits for O2 uptake in fish.",

The maximal baroreflex gain was not different among the three species and ranged from 12.1 to 14.3\u00a0beats\u00a0min\u00a0\u22121\u00a0kPa\u00a0\u22121 and occurred at Pm ranging from 3.0 to 3.8\u00a0kPa, which were slightly below the resting Pm for each species. Mean arterial blood pressures at rest in the three species were near the saturation point of the baroreflex curve which provides the animals with a greater fH response range to hypotensive, rather than hypertensive, changes in Pm. This is consistent with the hypothesis that arterial baroreceptors are key sensory components that allow anurans to maintain Pm possibly by mobilization of lymphatic return in response to hypotension.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia is an unremitting stressor at high altitudes that places a premium on oxygen transport by the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Phenotypic plasticity and genotypic adaptation at various steps in the O2 cascade could help offset the effects of hypoxia on cellular O2 supply in high-altitude natives. In this review, we will discuss the unique mechanisms by which ventilation, cardiac output, and blood flow are controlled in high-altitude mammals and birds. Acclimatization to high altitudes leads to some changes in respiratory and cardiovascular control that increase O2 transport in hypoxia (e.g., ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia). However, acclimatization or development in hypoxia can also modify cardiorespiratory control in ways that are maladaptive for O2 transport. Hypoxia responses that arose as short-term solutions to O2 deprivation (e.g., peripheral vasoconstriction) or regional variation in O2 levels in the lungs (i.e., hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) are detrimental at in chronic high-altitude hypoxia. Evolved changes in cardiorespiratory control have arisen in many high-altitude taxa, including increases in effective ventilation, attenuation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and changes in catecholamine sensitivity of the heart and systemic vasculature. Parallel evolution of some of these changes in independent highland lineages supports their adaptive significance. Much less is known about the genomic bases and potential interactive effects of adaptation, acclimatization, developmental plasticity, and trans-generational epigenetic transfer on cardiorespiratory control. Future work to understand these various influences on breathing and circulation in high-altitude natives will help elucidate how complex physiological systems can be pushed to their limits to maintain cellular function in hypoxia.",

     "abstract": "Digesting snakes experience massive increases in metabolism that can last for many days and are accompanied by adjustments in the oxygen transport cascade. Accordingly, we examined the oxygen-binding properties of the blood in the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus) during fasting and 24 and 48\u00a0h after the snakes have ingested a rodent meal corresponding to 15% (\u00b1\u00a02%) of its own body mass. In general, oxygen\u2013hemoglobin (Hb\u2013O2) affinity was significantly increased 24\u00a0h post-feeding, and then returned toward fasting values within 48\u00a0h post-feeding. Content of organic phosphates ([NTP] and [NTP]/[Hb]), hemoglobin cooperativity (Hill's n), and Bohr Effect (\u0394logP50/\u0394pH) were not affected by feeding. The postprandial increase in Hb\u2013O2 affinity in the South American rattlesnake can be almost entirely ascribed by the moderate alkaline tide that follows meal ingestion. In general, digesting snakes were able to regulate blood metabolites at quite constant levels (e.g., plasma osmolality, lactate, glucose, and total protein levels). The level of circulating lipids, however, was considerably increased, which may be related to their mobilization, since lipids are known to be incorporated by the enterocytes after snakes have fed. In conclusion, our results indicate that the exceptional metabolic increment exhibited by C. d. terrificus during meal digestion is entirely supported by the aerobic pathways and that among the attending cardiorespiratory adjustments, pulmonary Hb\u2013O2 loading is likely improved due to the increment in blood O2 affinity.",

     "abstract": "Gonad-inhibiting hormone (GIH) is a member of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone family and plays a major role in regulating reproduction in crustaceans. In this study, a full-length cDNA of GIH of Oriental River prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense (Mn-GIH) was cloned from the eyestalk. A 1350\u00a0bp full-length Mn-GIH cDNA harbored 336\u00a0bp of an open reading frame encoding signal peptide of 112 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis revealed that the overall cDNA sequence and specific functional sites of Mn-GIH were highly conserved with those in other crustacean species. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated its tissue-specific, larval developmental stage-specific, and ovary developmental stage-specific expression pattern, respectively. The RNAi by GIH-ds-RNA in vivo injection was effective in this study and resulted a 50% (day 1), 83% (day 5) and 63% (day 9) down-regulation compared to control. The obvious changes of gonad somatic index (GSI) rate also provided strong evidence to the inhibition effects of GIH on ovary maturation and spawning. Four temperature gradients (12\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C, 17\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C, 22\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C, 27\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) were set to imitate the temperature in breeding and non-breeding seasons. The observed expression profiles suggest that Mn-GIH did not display a high level expression as supposed to maintain an immature ovary state under low temperature (12\u00a0\u00b0C). The results indicated that GIH was probably activated to concentrating and working by a proper temperature before reaching to breeding season.",

Both the routine metabolic rate (M\u00b7O2rout) and critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) of the M\u00b7O2rout increased significantly with temperature, whereas the seasonal acclimatization showed no significant effect. Only the high temperature group that acclimatized in spring showed a significantly higher aquatic surface respiration (ASRcrit) value compared with the other three groups. Fish in spring tended to show ASR behavior at higher oxygen tension compared with those in winter, which might have been caused by a more active lifestyle. Time to show LOE prolonged by 25\u201334% under low temperature. Spring fish showed 20% shorter LOE duration at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas the difference tended to vanish at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Glycogen contents in both liver and muscle were higher in winter than spring. The liver and muscle glycogen content decreased by 5\u201342% after exposure to anoxic conditions, whereas the magnitude was much smaller in spring. When fish swam in normoxic conditions, fish in higher temperatures showed higher critical swimming speed (Ucrit) than low temperature (5.49 vs 3.74\u00a0BL\u00a0s\u22121 in winter and 4.27 vs 3.21\u00a0BL\u00a0s\u22121 in spring), whereas fish in winter also showed higher Ucrit than fish in spring for each temperature. However, when fish swam in hypoxic waters, fish in higher temperatures showed a more profound decrease (52\u201361%) in Ucrit compared to those in lower temperature (25\u201327%). Fish in lower temperatures that had acclimatized in winter showed the highest Ucrit, which might have been caused by higher glycogen storage. The present study suggested that both glycogen storage and alterations in lifestyle had profound effects on hypoxia tolerance and swimming performance, which resulted in a profound difference between seasons and acclimation temperatures.",

To determine when the ion regulatory and gas exchange abilities first appear in the gills, mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs) and neuroepithelial cells (NECs) were examined in young B. splendens. To evaluate the relative importance of the gills and the labyrinth organ under different levels of oxygen uptake stress, the levels of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and Na+/K+\u2013ATPase (NKA) protein expressions in 2 gills and the labyrinth organ were examined in M. opercularis. We found that the first 3 gills developed earlier than the 4th gill in both species, an indication that the morphological variation begins early in life. In B. splendens, the MRCs and NECs clearly appeared in the first 3 gills at 4\u00a0dph and were first found in the 4th gill until 11\u00a0dph. The oxygen-sensing ability of the gills was concordant with the ionoregulatory function. In M. opercularis, the hypoxic group had a significantly higher air-breathing frequency. CAII protein expression was higher in the labyrinth organ in the hypoxic group. The gills exhibited increased NKA protein expression in the hypoxic and restricted groups, respectively. Functional plasticity in CAII and NKA protein expressions was found between the gills and the labyrinth organ in adult M. opercularis.",

As one of the first marine calcifiers to have its genome sequenced, purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) have been the subject of early research exploring genomic responses to ocean acidification, work that points to future experiments and illustrates the value of expanding genomic resources to other marine organisms in this new \u2018post-genomic\u2019 era. This review presents case studies of S. purpuratus demonstrating the ability of genomic experiments to address major knowledge gaps within ocean acidification. Ocean acidification research has focused largely on species vulnerability, and studies exploring mechanistic bases of tolerance toward low pH seawater are comparatively few. Transcriptomic responses to high pCO2 seawater in a population of urchins already encountering low pH conditions have cast light on traits required for success in future oceans. Secondly, there is relatively little information on whether marine organisms possess the capacity to adapt to oceans progressively decreasing in pH. Genomics offers powerful methods to investigate evolutionary responses to ocean acidification and recent work in S. purpuratus has identified genes under selection in acidified seawater. Finally, relatively few ocean acidification experiments investigate how shifts in seawater pH combine with other environmental factors to influence organism performance. In S. purpuratus, transcriptomics has provided insight into physiological responses of urchins exposed simultaneously to warmer and more acidic seawater. Collectively, these data support that similar breakthroughs will occur as genomic resources are developed for other marine species.",

The genus Trematomus (suborder Notothenioidei) is regarded primarily as a high latitude group because of its abundance there, they also inhabit the warmer regions in smaller numbers. Freeze avoidance in the notothenioids is linked to the presence of two antifreeze proteins (AFPs); the antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) and antifreeze potentiating protein (AFPP), both of which adsorb to internal ice crystals inhibiting growth. Both high and low latitude trematomids possess sufficient AFP to lower their blood freezing point below that of seawater (\u2212\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b0C). We investigated the contributions of AFGPs and AFPP to the blood freezing point depression to determine how they varied with depth, water temperature, and the presence of ice. High latitude trematomids had lower blood freezing points than those inhabiting lower latitude waters indicating differences in their freeze avoidance capacities. Lower freezing points were associated with higher levels of antifreeze activity due to higher levels of both AFGP and AFPP. Populations of Trematomus hansoni and Trematomus bernacchii from shallow depths appear more freeze avoidant than populations inhabiting deep, ice-free water based on their lower freezing points and higher antifreeze activities. Gel electrophoresis of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble AFGPs indicates that only high molecular weight isoforms, which contribute more to AFGP activity, vary across species as well as between individuals of a species.",

Understanding the sophisticated olfactory system of insect antennae is crucial for studying the physiological bases of olfaction and could also help enhance the effectiveness of C. pallens in biological control. However, functional studies of the olfactory genes in C. pallens are still lacking. In this study, we cloned five odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes from C. pallens (CpalOBPs). Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that the five CpalOBPs had different tissue expression profiles. Ligand-binding assays showed that farnesol, farnesene, cis-3-hexenyl hexanoate, geranylacetone, beta-ionone, octyl aldehyde, decanal, nerolidol (Ki\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM), and especially 2-pentadecanone (Ki\u00a0=\u00a01.19\u00a0\u03bcM) and 2-hexyl-1-decanol (Ki\u00a0=\u00a00.37\u00a0\u03bcM) strongly bound to CpalOBP2. CpalOBP15 exhibited high binding affinities for beta-ionone, 2-tridecanone, trans-nerolidol, and dodecyl aldehyde. Behavioral trials using the 14 compounds exhibiting high binding affinities for the CpalOBPs revealed that nine were able to elicit significant behavioral responses from C. pallens. Among them, farnesene and its corresponding alcohol, farnesol, elicited remarkable repellent behavioral responses from C. pallens. Our study provides several compounds that could be selected to develop slow-release agents that attract/repel C. pallens and to improve the search for strategies to eliminate insect pests.",

We measured the mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and a particle marker in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the reticulorumen (RR) of five gazelles and one dikdik species. Species-specific differences were independent from body mass (BM) or food intake. Comparative evaluations (including up to 31 other ruminant species) indicate that MRT GIT relate positively to BM, and are less related to feeding type (the percentage of grass in the natural diet, %grass) than MRT RR. The MRTparticleRR is related to BM and (as a trend) %grass, matching a higher RR capacity with increasing BM in grazers compared to browsers. MRTsoluteRR is neither linked to BM nor to %grass but shows a consistent phylogenetic signal. Selectivity factors (SF; MRTparticle/MRTsolute, proxies for the degree of digesta washing) are positively related to %grass, with a threshold effect, where species with >\u00a020% grass have higher SF. These findings suggest that in different ruminant taxa, morphophysiological adaptations controlling MRTsoluteRR evolved to achieve a similar SF RR in relation to a %grass threshold. A high SF could facilitate an increased microbial yield from the forestomach. Reasons for variation in SF above the %grass threshold might represent important drivers of ruminant diversification and await closer investigation.",

This study established the influence of long-term melatonin administration (as an implant) on growth performance and reproduction of adult male sea bass. Melatonin reduced the fish weight and condition factor, thus affecting the performance of fish. Melatonin also affected gonadogenesis, as shown by a decrease in the gonadosomatic index after 150 days of treatment and the lower percentage of running males during the spermatogenesis and full spermiation stages of this species. Exogenous melatonin also resulted in lower plasma androgen levels during the reproductive period, and showed a significant decrease in serum Lh and Fsh concentration after 30 and 60 days of treatment, respectively. Thus, melatonin elicited seasonal changes in key reproductive hormones that affected testicular maturity. The hypothalamic expression of kiss1 was significantly higher in melatonin-treated fish than in controls after 30 days of treatment, while a significant increase in kiss2 expression was detected on day 90 of treatment. By contrast, melatonin showed a significant decrease in kisspeptin expression in the dorsal brain on day 150 of treatment and also affected the expression of gnrh-1 and gnrh-3 and gnrhr-II-1a and 2b and the fsh\u03b2 gene in the pituitary.

Since 5-HT injections cause hyperglycemia, this study was designed to further investigate this action of 5-HT in the crab Neohelice granulate, fed with a high-carbohydrate (HC) or a high-protein (HP) diet. The effects of pre-treatment with mammalian 5-HT receptor antagonists, cyproheptadine and methiothepin, were also investigated. A series of in vivo experiments with 3H-5-HT was carried out in order to investigate the presence of putative receptors in peripheral tissues. Since gills were the tissue with the highest labeling in in vivo experiments, in vitro studies with isolated anterior and posterior gills were also conducted. Cyproheptadine blocked the hyperglycemic effect of 5-HT in HP-fed crabs. Methiothepin reduced glycogen levels in the anterior gills of HP crabs and partially blocked the 5-HT-like posture. The injection of 3H-5-HT identified specific binding sites in all the tissues studied and revealed that the binding can be influenced by the type of diet administered to the crabs. Incubation of the anterior and posterior gills with 3H-5-HT and 5-HT confirmed the specificity of the binding sites. Both antagonists inhibited 3H-5-HT binding. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of serotonin in the control of glucose homeostasis in crustaceans and provides evidences of at least two types of 5-HT binding sites in peripheral tissues. Further studies are necessary to identify the structure of these receptors and their signaling pathways.",

In this study, we characterized nNOS cDNA and examined the effects of hypoxia and antioxidant and steroid treatments on nNOS expression in Atlantic croaker hypothalamus. Hypoxia exposure (dissolved oxygen, DO: 1.7\u00a0mg/L for 2 and/or 4\u00a0weeks) caused significant increases in hypothalamic nNOS mRNA, protein and its neuronal expression. Hypothalamic nNOS expression and superoxide radical (O2\u2212, an index of ROS) production were increased by pharmacological treatment of fish exposed to normoxic conditions with N-ethylmaleimide, an alkene drug which covalently modifies sulfhydryl groups and inhibits aromatase activity. In contrast, treatments with N\u03c9-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, a competitive NOS-inhibitor, or vitamin E, an antioxidant, prevented the upregulation of O2\u2212 production and nNOS expression in hypoxia-exposed (DO: 1.7\u00a0mg/L for 4\u00a0weeks) fish. Moreover, treatment with 1,4,6-androstatrien-3,17-dione, an aromatase inhibitor, increased hypothalamic O2\u2212 production and nNOS expression in normoxic control fish; whereas estradiol-17\u03b2 treatment significantly reduced O2\u2212 production and nNOS expression in hypoxia-exposed fish.

     "abstract": "While there is a considerable body of work describing osmoregulation by elasmobranchs in brackish and saltwater, far fewer studies have investigated osmoregulation in hypersaline waters. We examined osmo- and ionoregulatory function and plasticity in juvenile brown-banded bamboo sharks, Chiloscyllium punctatum, exposed to three experimental salinities (25, 34 and 40\u2030) for two weeks. C. punctatum inhabits sheltered coastal areas and bays which can naturally become hypersaline as a consequence of evaporation of water but can also become hyposaline during flood events. We hypothesised that C. punctatum would demonstrate a phenotypically plastic osmoregulatory physiology. Plasma osmolality, urea, Na+ and Cl\u2212 levels increased significantly with increasing environmental salinity. Rectal gland and branchial sodium\u2013potassium ATPase (NKA) activities were unaffected by salinity. Using immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting we found evidence for the presence of the key ion-regulatory proteins vacuolar H+-ATPase (VHA), pendrin (Cl\u2212/HCO3\u2212 co-transporter) and the Na+\u2013H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) in discrete cells within the branchial epithelia. These results indicate that C. punctatum is a partially euryhaline elasmobranch able to maintain osmo- and ionoregulatory function between environmental salinities of 25\u2030 and 40\u2030. As suggested for other elasmobranchs, the gills of C. punctatum likely play a limited role in maintaining Na+ homeostasis over the salinity range studied, but may play an important role in acid\u2013base balance.",

We previously demonstrated that Cvv relies on an apical NKCC and NHE in the gill for Na+ uptake in high (7mM) and intermediate (2mM) Na+ concentrations, while Cvh relies only on NHE for Na+ uptake. This study investigated whether differential NHE isoform use explains differences in Na+ uptake kinetics between these two populations. We further studied whether Cvh uses a NHE-Rh metabolon or carbonic anhydrase (CA) to overcome thermodynamic challenges of NHE function in dilute freshwater. Transfer to more dilute freshwater resulted in upregulation of nhe-2 (Cvv only) and nhe-3 (Cvv and Cvh). Relative expression of nhe-3 compared to nhe-2 was 2-fold higher in Cvv, but 200-fold higher in Cvh suggesting that nhe-3 expression is an important freshwater adaptation for Cvh. Simultaneous measurement of Na+ and Tamm flux under various conditions provided no support for a NHE-Rh metabolon in either population. Carbonic anhydrase activity in Cvv was comparable in 7 and 2mM Na+ acclimated fish. In Cvh, CA activity increased by 75% in 0.1mM Na+ acclimated fish compared to 7mM Na+ fish. Ethoxzolamide had variable effects, stimulating and reducing Na+ uptake in Cvv acclimated to 7 and 2mM Na+, while reducing Na+ uptake in 7 and 0.1mM Na+ acclimated Cvh. This suggests that CA plays important, but different roles in regulating Na+ uptake in Cvv and Cvh.",

The full biological effects of having an extra chromosome set are largely unknown, but triploids are considered to be more sensitive to sub-optimal environmental conditions and to be stressed by the presence of diploid conspecifics. Brain serotonergic and dopaminergic activity are known to regulate the stress response in vertebrates, but monoamine systems in diploid and triploid fish have yet to be compared. Here we study monoamine neurochemistry in the telencephalon and brain stem of juvenile diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in response to stress (unstressed vs stressed individuals) and holding (separate- vs mixed-ploidy) conditions. Both diploids and triploids showed an increase in serotonergic activity following stress, but the increase was significantly greater in the telencephalon of triploids compared to diploids. Furthermore, while telencephalic dopaminergic activity was significantly increased in diploids following stress, there was no response in triploids. Holding conditions had a significant effect on dopaminergic activity in the brain stem of diploids only, with lower values in mixed- compared to separate-ploidy conditions. These results suggest artificially produced triploids experience increased reactivity and monoaminergic dysregulation following stress that may impede their welfare and performance.",

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were acclimated at 12\u00a0\u00b0C or 23\u00a0\u00b0C (minimum 3\u00a0weeks) after which cardiovascular variables (cardiac output (Q), stroke volume (Sv) and heart rate (fH)) were measured upon injection of the \u00df3-AR agonist, BRL37344, and antagonist, SR59230A. In both 12\u00a0\u00b0C and 23\u00a0\u00b0C acclimated carp, BRL37344 induced significant increases in fH and Q whereas Sv was significantly decreased. While temperature did not affect the change (increase vs. decrease) in cardiac variables, the magnitude and on-set of responses differed. For instance, fH, Sv and Q responded significantly faster to \u00df3-AR stimulation in 23\u00a0\u00b0C carp. In contrast, maximum responses of fH and Q were significantly higher in 23\u00a0\u00b0C carp whereas the maximum response of Sv was significantly greater in 12\u00a0\u00b0C carp. These findings suggest that temperature acclimation induced changes in \u03b23-AR receptor functionality (e.g. density and/or affinity).Stimulation of \u03b23-ARs in 23\u00a0\u00b0C acclimated channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) caused significant increases in fH, Sv and Q. The increase in Sv was opposite to the decrease observed in 23\u00a0\u00b0C acclimated common carp. SR59230A induced significant decreases in Sv and Q but had no effect in carp (23\u00a0\u00b0C).

The present study examined the effects of temperature on the recovery of UCP1 expression levels and the expression of genes involved in UCP1 transcription in the livers and kidneys of common carps.

Important differences were found between isolated tissue and whole animals, and between species. Drugs that stimulated ciliary beat in vitro did not increase water processing rate in vivo. None of the treatments increased water flow through the mantle cavity of intact animals. Results suggest that A. irradians was primarily modulating lateral ciliary activity, while M. edulis appeared to have a number of ways to control water processing activity, signifying that the two species may have different compensatory and regulatory mechanisms controlling feeding activity.",

For this purpose, we identified the effect of food restriction, administration of leptin, ghrelin 1-18, obestatin and combinations of food restriction with these hormones for 3\u00a0days on chicken ovulation (egg laying) rate and ovarian hormone release. The release of progesterone (P), testosterone (T), estradiol (E) and arginine-vasotocin (AVT) by isolated and cultured ovarian fragments was determined by EIA. It was observed that food restriction significantly reduced the egg-laying rate, T, E and AVT release and promoted P output by ovarian fragments. Leptin, administrated to ad libitum\u2013fed chickens, did not change these parameters besides promoting E release. Nevertheless, administration of leptin was able to prevent the effect of food restriction on ovulation, T and E (but not P or AVT) release. Ghrelin 1-18 administration to ad libitum\u2013fed birds did not affect the measured parameters besides a reduction in P release. Ghrelin 1-18 administration prevented the food restriction\u2013induced decrease in ovarian T, E and AVT, but it did not change P output or egg laying. Obestatin administrated to control chicken promoted their ovarian P, E and inhibited ovarian AVT release but did not affect egg laying. It was able to promote the effect of food restriction on P, T and AVT, but not E release or egg laying. Our results (1) confirm an inhibitory effect of food restriction on chicken ovulation rate; (2) shows that food restriction\u2013induced reduction in egg laying is associated with a decrease in ovarian T, E and AVT and an increase in ovarian P release; (3) confirm the involvement of metabolic hormones leptin, ghrelin and obestatin in the control of chicken ovarian hormones output; and (4) the ability of metabolic hormones to mimic/antagonize or prevent/promote the effects of food restriction on both egg laying and ovarian hormones demonstrates that nutritional status can influence ovarian ovulatory and endocrine functions via changes in metabolic hormones.",

In juvenile tissues, agt transcripts were mainly detected in liver, ren in kidney, ace and ace2 in intestine, agtr1 in kidney and brain, and agtr2 in liver and kidney. Expression analysis of the six RAS genes after a salinity shift revealed a clear increase of agt mRNA abundance in liver just after transferring soles to high salinity water (60\u00a0ppt) with a peak at 48\u00a0h. Moreover, gene expression analysis in gills showed transcriptional regulation of ace and agtr1 at 48\u00a0h and agtr2 at 96\u00a0h after transferring soles to 60\u00a0ppt. Incubation of larvae before mouth opening (until 3\u00a0days post hatch; dph) at low salinity (10\u00a0ppt) resulted in a coordinated transcriptional up-regulation of RAS genes. Nevertheless, no differences in mRNA abundance between salinities were observed when larvae were cultivated to low salinity after mouth opening. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) signal for agt and ace in 3\u00a0dph larvae incubated at 10\u00a0ppt and 35\u00a0ppt confirmed that the former gene was mainly expressed in liver whereas the later gene was mainly located in pharynx and posterior gut, without pronounced differences in intensity between salinities.

To date, little is known about the mechanism of protective antioxidative defenses in turtles during acute temperature change, specifically the role that the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA) plays. In this study, Chinese soft-shelled turtles (Pelodiscus sinensis) were initially acclimated at 28\u00a0\u00b0C (3\u00a0wks), exposed to acute cold condition (8\u00a0\u00b0C, 8\u00a0h) and finally placed in recovery (28\u00a0\u00b0C, 24\u00a0h). L-Gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) mRNA exhibited a stable transcription pattern during the intense thermal fluctuation. GLO activity also remained stable, which validated the mRNA expression pattern. The similar Q10 values for GLO activity in the different treatment groups at incubation temperatures of 28\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C indicated that the GLO activity response to thermal change exhibited a temperature-dependent enzymatic kinetic characteristic. The AA storage was tissue-specific as well as the AA re-supply in the recovery period, with brain as the priority. Despite the insufficient transport during cold exposure, the plasma AA reservoir greatly contributed to the redistribution of AA during recovery. Depending on the prominent GLO activity, the high level of tissue-specific AA storage and the extraordinary plasma AA transport potential, the Chinese soft-shelled turtle endured severe thermal fluctuations with no apparent oxidative stress. However, the significant decrease in AA concentration in the brain tissue during acute cold exposure suggested that such a strategy may not be sufficient for prolonged cold exposure.",

No significant differences in insulin transcription, insulin concentrations in the principal islets (PI), or plasma total insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels were observed between the three groups. In contrast, plasma insulin level in the Fasted group was significantly lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.002) than that in the other groups. These results suggest that insulin release is the primary regulator of plasma insulin level and is more sensitive to short-term changes in nutritional conditions than IGF-I level. Furthermore, we estimated the capacity for insulin release. Based on various individual measures, the average insulin stored in the PI was 82.8\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight (BW), and the maximum plasma content of insulin was estimated to be <\u00a01.7\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW.

We propose that the rates of these reactions are altered, as per energy needs of the seasonal metabolic states in avian migrants. To investigate this, blackheaded buntings were photoperiodically induced with non-migratory, premigratory, migratory and post-migratory phenotypes. High plasma levels of free fatty acids, citrate (an intermediate that begins the TCA cycle) and malate dehydrogenase (mdh, an enzyme involved at the end of the TCA cycle) confirmed increased availability of metabolic reserves and substrates to the TCA cycle during the premigratory and migratory states, respectively. Further, daily expression pattern of genes coding for enzymes involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (pdc and pdk) and oxidative phosphorylation in the TCA cycle (cs, odgh, sdhd and mdh) was monitored in the hypothalamus and liver. Reciprocal relationship between pdc and pdk expressions conformed with the altered requirements of acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle in different metabolic states. Except for pdk, all genes had a daily expression pattern, with high mRNA expression during the day in the premigratory/migratory phenotypes, and at night (cs, odhg, sdhd and mdh) in the nonmigratory phenotype. Differences in mRNA expression patterns of pdc, sdhd and mdh, but not of pdk, cs and odgh, between the hypothalamus and liver indicated a tissue dependent metabolism in buntings.

Six adult hens Gallus gallus domesticus were examined with a focus on MV structure and function. The thickness of the right ventricle (RV) wall and MV were examined post-mortem. RV wall and MV end-systolic thickness were estimated echocardiographically. The frame-by-frame processing of RV images was applied for the analysis of MV and RV free wall motion.

Heat stress mediated HF occurred at a THF of 26.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00b0C for CA fish, and at 28.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00b0C for WA fish. Biochemical analyses also revealed that WA fish had elevated resting plasma lactate indicating an increased dependence on anaerobic pathways. When cardiac fibres were tested with increasing temperatures, apparent breakpoints in the respiratory control ratio (RCR-I) with substrates supporting complex I (CI) oxygen flux occurred below the THF for both acclimated groups. While WA cardiac mitochondria were less sensitive to increasing temperature for respirational flux supported by CI, Complex II, and chemically uncoupled flux, CA fish maintained higher RCRs at higher temperatures. We conclude that while acclimation to summer temperatures does alter cardiac mitochondrial function in N. celidotus, these changes need not be beneficial in terms of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and may come at an energetic cost, which would be detrimental in the face of further habitat warming.",

Nine isonitrogenous (43%) and isoenergetic (22\u00a0MJ\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) diets were formulated combining three types, pregelatinized starch (PS), dextrin (Dx) and maltodextrin (Mx), and three levels (12, 18 and 24%) of carbohydrates. Growth performance was not significantly influenced by treatments. The best feed utilization was observed in 18% Mx group. Higher hepatic lipid content was found in fish fed lower dietary carbohydrate levels. PS induced higher liver and white muscle hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities compared to the lower values observed for Mx. Malic enzyme and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in liver and white muscle were lower in Mx group. The influence of dietary carbohydrates source was more noticeable than those induced by the carbohydrate level, when glycolysis and lipogenesis pathways were considered. Common dentex is able to use properly dietary carbohydrates, although optimal dietary inclusion levels are below 24%. The greater protein-sparing effect was promoted by the less complex carbohydrate (maltodextrin) and the best feed utilization indices were obtained at intermediate levels of inclusion (18%).",

It is less clear, however, if the brains of fishes respond to ammonia in a similar manner. The present study demonstrated that the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) was not only able to endure high environmental ammonia exposure (HEA; 2 to 22\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) but that they experienced 30% increases in brain water content at the highest ammonia concentrations. This swelling was accompanied by 4-fold increases in plasma total ammonia (TAmm) concentration, but both plasma TAmm and brain water content were restored to pre-exposure levels following depuration in ammonia-free water. The closely related, ammonia-tolerant goldfish (Carassius auratus) responded similarly to HEA (up to 3.6\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), which was accompanied by 4-fold increases in brain glutamine. Subsequent administration of the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine (MSO), reduced brain glutamine accumulation by 80% during HEA. However, MSO failed to prevent ammonia-induced increases in brain water content suggesting that glutamine may not be directly involved in initiating ammonia-induced brain swelling in fishes. Although the mechanisms of brain swelling are likely different, exposure to anoxia for 96\u00a0h caused similar, but lesser (10%) increases in brain water content in crucian carp. We conclude that brain swelling in some fishes may be a common response to increased internal ammonia or lower oxygen but further research is needed to deduce the underlying mechanisms behind such responses.",

Spiny lobsters have one of the most complex pelagic larval life cycles of any invertebrate and recently there has been an unexplained decline in post-larval recruitment for a number of species. We conducted the first analysis of the larval ontogeny of oxygen consumption, heart rate, maxilla 2 ventilation rate and oxyregulatory capacity of the spiny lobster, Sagmariasus verreauxi, to gain insight into their vulnerability to ocean change and to investigate life stage specific sensitivity to temperature-dependent oxygen limitation. In normoxia, heart and maxilla 2 ventilation rates increased in early larval development before declining, which we hypothesise is related to the transition from myogenic to neurogenic cardiac control. Maxilla 2 ventilation rate was sensitive to hypoxia at all larval stages, while heart rate was only sensitive to hypoxia in the late phyllosoma stages. Oxygen consumption conformed to environmental hypoxia at all larval stages. Spiny lobster larvae have limited respiratory control due to immature gas exchange physiology, compounded by their exceptionally large size. The lack of oxyregulatory ability suggests that all development stages are vulnerable to changes in sea temperature and oxygen availability. The synergetic stressors of increased temperature and reduced dissolved oxygen in the marine environment will diminish spiny lobster larval performance, increasing the challenge to achieve their extended larval life cycle, which may contribute to declines in post-larval recruitment.",

Body mass was constant over the year, but the masses of tissues and organs differed significantly between seasons. There were significant changes in body fat mass and serum leptin levels over the four seasons. E. olitor showed significant seasonal changes in food intake and thermogenesis, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content, enzyme activity, and serum tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels. Moreover, mRNA expression in the hypothalamus showed significant seasonal changes. All of our results suggested that E. olitor had constant body mass over the year, which was inconsistent with the prediction of the \u2018set-point\u2019 hypothesis. However, body fat mass and serum leptin levels were significantly different among the four seasons, providing support for the \u2018set-point\u2019 hypothesis.

We estimated overall reproductive success using genetic assignment at the end of the reproductive season. Results show that triglycerides and free fatty acid concentrations vary negatively during reproduction, while amino-acids and glucose concentrations remain stable. Decrease in triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations during reproduction is not related to initial concentration levels or to weight variation. Both metabolite concentration variations and weight variations are correlated to the number of offspring produced, which could indicate that gametic and behavioral reproductive investments substantially contribute to reproductive success in wild brown trout.

Oxidative stress occurs in living organisms when reactive oxygen species remain unquenched by antioxidant defense systems and become detrimental to cells. In fish, it is unknown how maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity influence offspring quality. The semelparous, migratory life history of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) provides a unique opportunity to explore intergenerational effects of oxidative stress. This study examined the effects of population origin on maternal and developing offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity, and elucidated intergenerational relationships among populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) with varying migration effort. For three geographically distinct populations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (British Columbia, Canada), antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress were measured in adult female plasma, heart, brain, and liver, as well as in developing offspring until time of emergence. Maternal and offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity varied among populations but patterns were not consistent across tissue/developmental stage. Furthermore, maternal oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity did not affect offspring oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity across any of the developmental stages or populations sampled. Our results revealed that offspring develop their endogenous antioxidant systems at varying rates across populations; however, this variability is overcome by the time of emergence. While offspring may be relying on maternally derived antioxidants in the initial stages of development, they rapidly develop their own antioxidant systems (mainly glutathione) during later stages of development.",

     "abstract": "The Daurian ground squirrel (Spermophilus dauricus) accumulates large amounts of body fat during pre-hibernation fattening. Leptin, an adipose-derived hormone, plays important roles in energy balance and thermogenesis. We predicted that body fat accumulation would lead to the elevation of leptin concentration while its effect on satiety would be suppressed in hypothalamus during fattening. In addition, the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) would increase and correlated positively with leptin concentration before hibernation. Here, we measured serum leptin concentration and leptin mRNA in white adipose tissue (WAT), hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in energy regulation and UCP1 in BAT before, during and after fattening in squirrels. The fat mass gradually increased during fattening but serum leptin increased mainly in the late phase of fattening, which was consistent with leptin mRNA expression in WAT. During fattening, the mRNA of hypothalamic leptin receptor was up-regulated and correlated positively with serum leptin. Orexigenic neuropeptide Y mRNA increased by 67%; however agouti-related peptide remained unchanged before hibernation. There was no significant change in anorexigenic neuropeptide mRNA. No change in suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B was detected. UCP1 mRNA expression and protein content in BAT increased significantly after fattening. These changes were independent of environmental conditions and serum leptin concentration. Our results suggest that the dissociation of leptin production and adiposity during fattening may facilitate fat accumulation. No evidence of suppressed leptin signal was found in fattening squirrels. The UCP1 recruitment in post-fattening squirrels could occur without winter-like acclimation and increased leptin.",

Across animal taxa, adverse embryonic/fetal environmental conditions can alter morphological and physiological phenotypes in juveniles or adults, and capacities for developmental plasticity are common phenomena. Human neonates with body sizes at the extremes of perinatal growth are at an increased risk of adult disease, particularly hypertension and cardiovascular disease. There are many rewarding areas of current and future research in comparative developmental physiology. We present key mechanisms, models, and experimental designs that can be used across taxa to investigate patterns in, and implications of, the development of animal phenotypes. Intraspecific variation in the timing of developmental events can be increased through developmental plasticity (heterokairy), and could provide the raw material for selection to produce heterochrony \u2014 an evolutionary change in the timing of developmental events. Epigenetics and critical windows research recognizes that in ovo or fetal development represent a vulnerable period in the life history of an animal, when the developing organism may be unable to actively mitigate environmental perturbations. \u2018Critical windows\u2019 are periods of susceptibility or vulnerability to environmental or maternal challenges, periods when recovery from challenge is possible, and periods when the phenotype or epigenome has been altered. Developmental plasticity may allow survival in an altered environment, but it also has possible long-term consequences for the animal. \u201cCatch-up growth\u201d in humans after the critical perinatal window has closed elicits adult obesity and exacerbates a programmed hypertensive phenotype (one of many examples of \u201cfetal programing\u201d). Grand challenges for developmental physiology include integrating variation in developmental timing within and across generations, applying multiple stressor dosages and stressor exposure at different developmental timepoints, assessment of epigenetic and parental influences, developing new animal models and techniques, and assessing and implementing these designs and models in human health and development.",

Prochilodus nigricans overcomes current seasonal and diurnal changes in dissolved oxygen by adjusting erythrocytic levels of ATP and GTP, modulators of Hb-O2 affinity. Will this fish species be endangered under more extreme environmental conditions as hypoxia and acidification tend to occur in a shorter period of time? As P. nigricans does not exhibit any apparent morphological alterations to exploit the air\u2013water interface, it must rely on fast adjustments of blood properties. To investigate this aspect, basic hematology indices, pHe, pHi, plasma lactate, erythrocytic levels of ATP and GTP and functional properties of the hemolysate of P. nigricans were analyzed over a period of 6\u00a0h in hypoxia and subsequent recovery in normoxia. The levels of erythrocytic GTP were four times higher than ATP and were reduced to \u00bc of the original level after 3\u00a0h under hypoxia. Erythrocytic levels of ATP were unaffected over the experimental period. All other analyzed blood parameters exhibited a time-course change in animals under hypoxia and returned to normoxic levels. Considering the hemolysate functional properties and the ability to regulate the above mentioned blood characteristics, P. nigricans is able to endure short-term changes in dissolved oxygen.",

In this study, haematological reference intervals were developed for free-ranging endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) pups within the context of endemic hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis) infection and the effects of pathogen, host, and environment factors on the variability of haematological parameters were investigated. Uncinaria sanguinis was identified as an important agent of disease, with infection causing regenerative anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, and a predominantly lymphocytic\u2013eosinophilic systemic inflammatory response. Conversely, the effects of sucking lice (Antarctophthirus microchir) were less apparent and infestation in pups appears unlikely to cause clinical impact. Overall, the effects of U. sanguinis, A. microchir, host factors (standard length, body condition, pup sex, moult status, and presence of lesions), and environment factors (capture-type and year of sampling) accounted for 26\u201365% of the total variance observed in haematological parameters. Importantly, this study demonstrated that anaemia in neonatal Australian sea lion pups is not solely a benign physiological response to host\u2013environment changes, but largely reflects a significant pathological process. This impact of hookworm infection on pup health has potential implications for the development of foraging and diving behaviour, which would subsequently influence the independent survival of juveniles following weaning. The haematological reference intervals developed in this study can facilitate long-term health surveillance, which is critical for the early recognition of changes in disease impact and to inform conservation management.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ghrelin and obestatin on food intake in grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus. Fish received intraperitoneal (IP) injection of saline, ghrelin (100\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0BW), obestatin-like (25\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0BW) and ghrelin in combination with obestatin-like. Ghrelin stimulation of food intake varied considerably among individual fish with 70.8% eliciting a robust response. In these high-responders, food intake was significantly increased by IP ghrelin within 2\u00a0h. Co-administration of ghrelin and obestatin-like resulted in a decrease in food intake, indicating that obestatin was able to antagonize the effect of ghrelin. However, IP obestatin-like alone could not regulate food intake in grass carp. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that IP ghrelin peptide led to a significant increase in mRNA abundance of NPY, Y8a and Y8b genes compared to saline injected fish, while in combination with obestatin-like peptide decreased ghrelin-induced gene expressions of these three genes. IP sole obestatin-like peptide did not modify the expression levels of NPY, Y8a, Y8b, CART and POMC compared to the control group. Therefore, IP administration of obestatin-like peptide, partially blocking the ghrelin-induced appetite, investigated the possible involvement of obestatin as a mediator of the ghrelin stimulatory action on food intake, at least in \u201chigh-responders\u201d grass carp.",

On the other hand, photoreceptor component of the ERG, the negative late receptor potential was not affected by cooling. The fact that the suppression of the dogfish shark b-wave at low temperatures was as a rule irreversible testifies about breakdown of neural retinal function at cold temperature extremes. Although in vivo experiments on immobilized Prussian carps have never resulted in complete deterioration of the b-wave at low temperatures, significant suppression of this ERG component by cooling was detected. Suppressing the effect of low temperatures on Prussian carp ERG might be due to the fact that C. gibelio, as well as other cyprinids, can be characterized as a warmwater species preferring temperatures well above cold extremes. The ERG of the eel, the third examined species, exhibited the strongest resistance to extremely low temperatures. During acute cooling of in situ eyecup preparations of migrating silver eels from 30\u00a0\u00b0C down to 2\u00a0\u00b0C the form of ERG became wider, but the amplitude of the b-wave only slightly decreased.

In the present study, we found that the established period of diacetyl adaptation in nematodes increased with the breeding temperature. When wild-type (N2) nematodes were bred at 15\u00a0\u00b0C, adaptation was observed from the young adult (YA) to the 3-day-old adult that is reached 3\u00a0days after the YA stage. On breeding nematodes at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, adaptation was observed between the YA and 5-day-old adult and between the YA and the 7-day-old adult, respectively. Breeding temperature has been shown to correlate with the rate of aging in nematodes, which is related to the level of oxygen consumption. Accordingly, long-lived isp-1 and clk-1 mutants that demonstrate decreased levels of oxygen consumption showed a shorter established period of adaptation than N2 nematodes, whereas short-lived gas-1 and mev-1 mutants that have a hypersensitive response to oxygen showed a longer period of adaptation than the N2. Moreover, the established period of diacetyl adaptation in N2 nematodes was shortened by the antioxidant \u03b1-lipoic acid. These results suggest that oxygen intermediates, which are produced by oxygen consumption, play a significant role in diacetyl adaptation. Although this is only one of many factors that regulate diacetyl adaptation, such as the release of neurotransmitters and changes in intracellular conditions, the acquisition of this adaptation requires an increase in the intensity of moderate oxygen signals.",

In an effort to identify the site of hydra's photoreceptors, we recorded extracellularly from single excised tentacles and from ablated hypostomes lacking tentacles in absolute darkness and during exposure to light of various wavelengths. During recording, after an initial period of absolute darkness, tentacles or hypostomes were exposed to light from 450\u00a0nm to 600\u00a0nm, red, and white light. Exposure to light caused a change in the pattern and frequency of impulses in the tentacles that varied with color. The number of large tentacle pulses (TPs) increased at 550 and 600\u00a0nm relative to darkness, whereas the number of small tentacle pulses (STPs) tended to decrease in 500\u00a0nm light. Impulse frequency was significantly different among the different wavelengths. In addition to bursts of tentacle contraction pulses, long trains of pulses were observed. A change in lighting caused a switch from bursting to trains or vice versa. In contrast to excised tentacles, no change in electrical activity was seen in ablated hypostomes at any of the wavelengths relative to each other or relative to darkness. These results indicate that isolated tentacles can distinguish among and respond to various colors across the visible spectrum and suggest that electromagnetic information is transmitted from the tentacles to the hypostome where it may be integrated by the hypostomal nervous system, ultimately contributing to hydra's photoreceptive behavior.",

Intermittent Cold Exposure (ICE) is an approachable method to study cold adaptation in rodents.

We find that pika kept in warm temperatures has little classical brown fat, but \u201cbrowning\u201d of white adipose tissues is observed rapidly upon cold exposure. This is demonstrated by the increased expression of several markers of brown fat differentiation including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1).

In addition, ICE increases the expression of several general adipose differentiation markers at both the mRNA and protein levels. These substantial changes in the distribution of fat are accomplished without changes in weight or blood levels of glucose and triglycerides, suggesting that the adaptable changes are coordinated and self-compensated.

     "abstract": "Around volcanic carbon dioxide (CO2) seeps in Papua New Guinea, partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) approximate those as predicted for the end of this century, and coral communities have low diversity and low structural complexity. To assess the mechanisms for such community shifts in response to ocean acidification, we examined the physiological performance of two hard corals that occur with increased or unaltered abundance at a seep site (mean pHTotal\u00a0=\u00a07.8, pCO2\u00a0=\u00a0862\u00a0\u03bcatm) compared to a control site (mean pHTotal\u00a0=\u00a08.1, pCO2\u00a0=\u00a0323\u00a0\u03bcatm), namely massive Porites spp. and Pocillopora damicornis, and two species with reduced abundance, Acropora millepora and Seriatopora hystrix. Oxygen fluxes, calcification, and skeletal densities were analyzed in corals originating from the seep and control site. Net photosynthesis rates increased considerably in Porites spp. and A. millepora and slightly in P. damicornis at increased pCO2, but remained unaltered in S. hystrix. Dark respiration rates remained constant in all corals investigated from both sites. Rates of light calcification declined in S. hystrix at high pCO2, but were unaffected by pCO2 in the other three coral taxa. Dark and net calcification rates remained unchanged in massive Porites and P. damicornis, but were drastically reduced at high pCO2 in A. millepora and S. hystrix. However, skeletal densities were similar at both seep and control sites in all coral taxa investigated. Our data suggest that the pCO2-tolerant corals were characterized by an increased ability to acclimatize to ocean acidification, e.g. by maintaining net calcification. Thus, robust corals, such as Porites spp. and P. damicornis, are more likely to persist for longer in a future high pCO2 world than those unable to acclimatize.",

We examined full-length cDNA sequences and tissue distributions of ENaC\u03b1, ENaC\u03b2, and ENaC\u03b3 subunits in the African lungfish Protopterus annectens. Protopterus ENaC (pENaC) comprises 3 subunits: pENaC\u03b1, pENaC\u03b2, and pENaC\u03b3. pENaC\u03b1, pENaC\u03b2, and pENaC\u03b3 subunits are closely related to \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of the Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri ENaC (nENaC), respectively. Three ENaC subunit mRNAs were highly expressed in the gills and moderately expressed in the kidney and rectum of P. annectens. During estivation for 2\u20134\u00a0weeks and 2\u20133\u00a0months, plasma Na+ concentration was relatively stable, but plasma urea concentration significantly increased in comparison with the control fish kept in a freshwater environment. Plasma aldosterone concentration and mRNA expression of the ENaC\u03b1 subunit gradually and significantly decreased in the gills and kidney after 2\u00a0months of estivation. Thus, aldosterone-dependent Na+ absorption via ENaC probably exists in the epithelial cells of osmoregulatory organs of lungfish kept in fresh water, whereas plasma Na+ concentration may be maintained by a mechanism independent of aldosterone-ENaC axis during estivation in lungfish.",

The link between early-life stress and oxidative balance is beginning to be explored and previous studies have focused on this link in adult non-breeding or immature individuals. However, as oxidative stress is considered as the main physiological mechanism underlying the trade-off between self-maintenance and investment in reproduction, it is necessary to look at the consequences of early-life stress on oxidative status during reproduction. Here, we investigated the effects of exposure to pre- and/or post-natal stress on oxidative balance during reproduction under benign or stressful environmental conditions in an avian model species, the Japanese quail. We determined total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and resistance to a free-radical attack in individual exposed to pre-natal stress, post-natal stress or both and in control individuals exposed to none of the stressors. TAS levels decreased over time in all females that reproduced under stressful conditions. TOS decreased between the beginning and the end of reproductive period in pre-natal control females. In all females, resistance to a free-radical attack decreased over the reproductive event but this decrease was more pronounced in females from a pre-natal stress development. Our results suggest that pre-natal stress may be associated with a higher cost of reproduction in terms of oxidative stress. These results also confirm that early-life stress can be associated with both benefits and costs depending of the life-history stage or environmental context.",

The dissimilarity in steroid concentrations between tissues was particularly evident in the T concentration with a level in gills almost three times higher compared to gonads (on average, 15.38\u00a0ng/g w.w. and 5.31\u00a0ng/g w.w., respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00008), suggesting its exogenous origin. In general, a tendency towards a skewed steroid profile related to sex, with E2 more abundant for males and T for females, was observed. Female gonads were characterized by a higher level of T than testis (4.61\u00a0ng/g w.w. for females and 0.70\u00a0ng/g w.w. for males, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0121).

As for gills, similar trend with T and E2 being more abundant in males was observed. At the same time, no disturbances in the sex ratio and gametogenesis process were observed which suggests i) efficient deactivation of free forms of steroids, and/or ii) their little or no physiological role.",

     "abstract": "Lizards, as ectotherms, spend much time basking for thermoregulating exposed to solar radiation. Consequently, they are subjected to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), which is the most harmful component of solar radiation spectrum. UVR can provoke damages, from the molecular to tissue level, even cause death. Photooxidation triggered by UVR produces reactive oxidative species (ROS). When antioxidant machinery cannot combat the ROS concentration, oxidative stress occurs in the organisms. Given that UVR increases with elevation, we hypothesised that lizards from high elevations should be better adapted against UVR than lizards from lower elevations. In this work, we test this hypothesis in Psammodromus algirus along an elevation gradient (three elevational belts, from 300 to 2500\u00a0m above sea level). We ran an experiment in which lizards from each elevation belt were exposed to 5-hour doses of UVR (UV-light bulb, experimental group) or photosynthetically active radiation (white-light bulb, control group) and, 24\u00a0h after the exposure, we took tissue samples from the tail. We measured oxidative damage (lipid and protein peroxidation) and antioxidant capacity as oxidative-stress biomarkers. We found no differences in oxidative stress between treatments. However, consistent with a previous work, less oxidative damage appeared in lizards from the highlands. We conclude that UVR is not a stressor agent for P. algirus; however, our findings suggest that the lowland environment is more oxidative for lizards. Therefore, P. algirus is well adapted to inhabit a large elevation range, and this would favour the lizard in case it ascends in response to global climate change.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring antioxidant that has been widely studied in mammals due to its potential to extend lifespan. However, antioxidants may also limit protein damage and therefore reduce rates of protein degradation, providing a potential avenue for enhancing growth in an aquaculture setting. The present study tested the hypotheses that in Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, resveratrol would decrease protein carbonylation and 4-HNE (indicators of protein and lipid oxidative damage, respectively), levels of ubiquitinylation and LC3 (indicators of non-lysosomal and lysosomal protein degradation, respectively), while having no effect on S6K activation (indicator of protein synthesis). These effects were predicted to increase growth rate. Mitochondrial volume density was also examined since resveratrol may lead to the proliferation of mitochondria, which are the principal source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative damage. Juvenile fish (n\u00a0=\u00a0142) were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with 600\u00a0\u03bcg resveratrol per g of food for 16\u00a0weeks. Fish treated with resveratrol had a 9% greater length and 33% greater body mass than control fish after 16\u00a0weeks. Additionally, there was lower protein carbonylation and lipid 4-HNE within the muscle tissues of treated fish, indicating decreased oxidative damage, and reduced protein ubiquitinylation in the resveratrol fed flounder, indicating less protein degradation. However, there was not a significant difference in LC3, S6K activation, or mitochondrial volume density. These results suggest that resveratrol has positive effects on growth due to its antioxidant properties that reduce non-lysosomal protein degradation.",

The processes leading to the large postprandial rise in metabolism in snakes is subject to opposing views. Gastric work, protein synthesis and organ growth have each been speculated to be major contributors to the SDA. To investigate the role of food composition on SDA, heart rate (HR) and organ growth, 48 ball pythons (Python regius) were fed meals of either fat, glucose, protein or protein combined with carbonate. Our study shows that protein, in the absence or presence of carbonate causes a large SDA response, while glucose caused a significantly smaller SDA response and digestion of fat failed to affect metabolism. Addition of carbonate to the diet to stimulate gastric acid secretion did not increase the SDA response. These results support protein synthesis as a major contributor to the SDA response and show that increased gastric acid secretion occurs at a low metabolic cost. The increase in metabolism was supported by tachycardia caused by altered autonomic regulation as well as an increased non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) tone in response to all diets, except for the lipid meal. Organ growth only occurred in the small intestine and liver in snakes fed on a high protein diet.",

     "abstract": "In vitro gut sac experiments were performed on freshwater and 60% seawater acclimated trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) under treatments designed to discern possible mechanisms of intestinal ammonia transport. Seawater acclimation increased ammonia flux rate into the serosal saline (Jsamm) in the anterior intestine, however it did not alter Jsamm in the mid- or posterior intestine suggesting similar mechanisms of ammonia handling in freshwater and seawater fish. Both fluid transport rate (FTR) and Jsamm were inhibited in response to basolateral ouabain treatment, suggesting a linkage of ammonia uptake to active transport, possibly coupled to fluid transport processes via solvent drag. Furthermore, decreases in FTR and Jsamm caused by low Na+ treatment indicated a Na+ linked transport mechanism. Mucosal bumetanide (10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0M) had no impact on FTR, yet decreased Jsamm in the anterior and mid-intestine, suggesting NH4+ substitution for K+ on an apical NKCC, and at least a partial uncoupling of ammonia transport from fluid transport. Additional treatments (amiloride, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), phenamil, bafilomycin, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), high sodium) intended to disrupt alternative routes of Na+ uptake yielded no change in FTR or Jsamm, suggesting the absence of direct competition between Na+ and ammonia for transport. Finally, [14C]methylamine permeability (PMA) measurements indicated the likely presence of an intestinal Rh-mediated ammonia transport system, as increasing NH4Cl (0, 1, 5\u00a0mmol\u00a0l\u2212\u00a01) concentrations reduced PMA, suggesting competition for transport through Rh proteins. Overall, the data presented in this paper provide some of the first insights into mechanisms of teleost intestinal ammonia transport.",

The results show that compensatory adjustments in state III respiratory rate and COX activity occur significantly in the heart, kidney and liver, but do not in the brain and white muscle, which suggest that the metabolic compensation of this fish in response to seasonal acclimation exhibits a tissue-specific pattern. The cold acclimation increases mitochondrial oxidative capacities in the heart, kidney and liver concomitantly with reducing their upper thermal limits of mitochondrial functions at acute warming and the thermal tolerance shifts in the same tissue-specific pattern as the metabolic compensation. When combining the effects of seasonal acclimation on mitochondrial oxidative capacity and organ mass, the metabolic compensation demonstrates an organ-specific pattern with four categories: over-compensation in the heart, complete compensation in the kidney, partial compensation in the liver and no compensation in the brain. The organ-specific pattern of metabolic compensation might be a trade-off strategy of the performance adjustments in the seasonal acclimation for this fish to maximize its fitness.",

To overcome this problem, we investigated if logging the difference between core and subcutaneous temperatures (\u0394Tc\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s) could reveal the metabolic costs associated with cold exposure. Using implanted temperature data loggers, we recorded core and subcutaneous temperatures continuously in eight captive rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and concurrently measured their resting metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry, at ambient temperatures ranging from \u2212\u00a07 to +\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C. \u0394Tc\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s showed no circadian fluctuations in warm (+\u00a023\u00a0\u00b0C) or cold (+\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C) environments implying that the \u0394Tc\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s was not affected by an endogenous circadian rhythm in our laboratory conditions. \u0394Tc\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s correlated well with resting metabolic rate (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.77) across all ambient temperatures except above the upper limit of the thermoneutral zone (+\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C). Determining \u0394Tc\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s could therefore provide a complementary approach for better estimating resting metabolic rate of animals within and below their thermoneutral zone.

The major FAs of inner and outer blubber layers were broadly similar to those found in NES maternal milk previously measured, suggesting a direct deposit of dietary FAs in the blubber during the suckling period. The outer blubber layer contained more medium-chain monounsaturated FAs that contribute in keeping the fluidity of this tissue at cold temperatures. It was compensated by higher proportions of saturated FAs in the inner blubber layer. The FA signature of inner blubber, the layer that is mainly mobilised during energy deprivation, slightly differed from the signature of serum. There were greater proportions of medium-chain saturated FAs and \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated FAs, and lower proportions of long-chain saturated FAs, medium-chain monounsaturated FAs and long-chain monounsaturated FAs in serum as compared to inner blubber. We also demonstrated that lipophilicity is the main factor governing the mobilisation of FAs from blubber. The least lipophilic FAs were preferentially hydrolysed from blubber, leading to an enrichment of the more lipophilic FAs in this tissue with the progression of the fast. The expression levels of HSL and ATGL, which are two enzymes involved in the lipolytic process, remained stable during the post-weaning fast. This suggests that the pups have developed the enzymatic mechanisms for an efficient lipolysis as soon as the first week of fast.",

To accomplish this fish were reared on three \u201cenhanced\u201d diets and one commercial diet, each with different levels of fatty acids, arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Neutral lipids from the muscle and liver incorporated the majority of the fatty acid profile, while phospholipids incorporated only certain fatty acids. Diet had an effect on the majority of sperm fatty acids, on the total volume of extractable milt, and on the percentage of motile sperm. Here, our results suggest that the total volume of extractable milt is a DHA-dependent process, as we found the diets with the highest DHA levels induced the most milt while the diet with the lowest DHA level induced the least amount of milt. The diet with the highest level of ARA induced medium milt volumes but had the highest sperm motility. EPA also seems important for sperm quality parameters since diets with higher EPA percentages had a higher volume of milt and higher sperm motility.

Biomarker levels did not increase along the temperature trial, but P. elegans (higher intertidal) showed higher amounts of HSP70 and total ubiquitin than P. serratus (lower intertidal). HSP70 and total ubiquitin levels showed a positive significant correlation in both species, suggesting that their association is important in thermal tolerance. Histopathological observations of muscle tissue in P. serratus showed no gross alterations due to temperature but did show localized atrophy of muscle fibers at CTMax. In P. elegans, alterations occurred at a larger scale, showing multiple foci of atrophic muscular fascicles caused by necrotic or autolytic processes. In conclusion, Palaemon congeners displayed different responses to stress at a cellular level, with P. elegans having greater biomarker levels and histopathological alterations.",

     "abstract": "Hormones and neuropeptides play a crucial role in the appetite control system of vertebrates, yet few studies have focused on their importance during early teleost development. In this study, we analysed the expression patterns of the appetite-controlling factors ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), peptide YY (PYY), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC-C), and cocaine-amphetamine-related transcript (CART) by quantitative PCR. Transcript expression was investigated in response to feeding in developing Atlantic halibut larvae: before (premetamorphic stage 5) and during metamorphosis (stages 8 and 9B), and also in response to a fast\u2013refeed challenge. We show that ghrelin transcript expression increased in synchrony with stomach development, while CART was significantly reduced during larval development. PYY was up-regulated 1 and 3\u00a0h after feeding in stage 5. Transcript abundance of other appetite-controlling factors did not change in response to feeding. Fasting\u2013refeeding trials (majority of larvae in metamorphosing stage 7) revealed a down-regulation of POMC-C 30\u00a0min after refeeding, while ghrelin, PYY and NPY transcript expression increased 2, 4 and 5\u00a0h after refeeding, respectively. In summary, transcripts for key appetite-controlling factors were detected early during development in Atlantic halibut and their emergence was not correlated with metamorphosis, with the exception of ghrelin. Our results suggest that PYY may mediate satiety early in larval development. The differing response times of POMC-C, ghrelin, PYY and NPY to a meal are intriguing and require further exploration to understand the role of each player in appetite control.",

The rate of CO2 production (VCO2) at 10, 20 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C was examined in adults of Agathemera crassa, a high-Andean phasmid of central Chile. Carbon dioxide release was recorded during 24\u00a0h with L:D cycle of 12:12\u00a0h in order to record both rest and activity periods. At rest, A. crassa showed three patterns of gas exchange, highlighting the use of DGE preferably at 10\u00a0\u00b0C. As the temperature increased, the CoGE pattern was more frequent being the only pattern observed in all individuals at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. During activity, patterns changed to CoGE with a significant increase in VCO2. Our results support the idea that gas exchange patterns in insects are not distinct but correspond to a continuum of responses addressed by metabolic demand and where DGE can be expressed only under an absolute state of rest. Our results support the idea that the presence of the DGE may be underestimated in other insect taxa because they may have been measured under conditions where this pattern not necessarily can be expressed.",

Although estrogens are clearly associated with the ovarian differentiation in teleosts, the effects of androgens on early gonadal development are still a matter of debate. Traditionally, 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) is considered the major androgen in fish; however, 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-DHT), the most potent androgen in tetrapods, was recently found in fish testis and plasma, but its physiological role is still unknown. In this context, the expression of genes associated with steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, body growth and sex differentiation were assessed in Odontesthes bonariensis larvae fed with food supplemented with two doses of 5\u03b1-DHT (0.1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/g of food) from hatching to 6\u00a0weeks of age. At the lowest dose, 5\u03b1-DHT treated larvae showed an estrogenic gene expression pattern, with low hsd11b2 and high cyp19a1a and er2 expression levels with no differences in sex ratio. At the highest dose, 5\u03b1-DHT produced a male-shifted sex ratio and the larvae exhibited a gene expression profile characteristic of an advancement of spermatogenesis, with inhibition of amh and stimulation of ndrg3. No differences were observed in somatic growth. These results suggest that in this species, 5\u03b1-DHT could have a role on sex differentiation and its effects can differ according to the dose.",

     "abstract": "Sound communication comprising the production and detection of acoustic signals is affected by ambient temperature in ectothermic animals. In the present study we investigated the effects of temperature on sound production and characteristics in the croaking gourami Trichopsis vittata, a freshwater fish from Southeast Asia possessing a highly specialized sound-generating mechanism found only in a single genus. The croaking gourami produces pulsed sounds by stretching and plucking two enhanced pectoral fin tendons during rapid pectoral fin beating. Croaking sounds typically consist of a series of double-pulsed bursts with main energies between 1 and 1.5\u00a0kHz. Sounds were recorded during dyadic contests between two males at three different temperatures (25\u00b0, 30\u00b0 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C). The mean dominant frequency increased with rising temperature from 1.18 to 1.33\u00a0kHz, whereas temporal characteristics decreased. The sound interval dropped from 492 to 259\u00a0ms, the burst period from 51 to 35\u00a0ms and the pulse period from 5.8 to 5.1\u00a0ms. In contrast, the number of sounds and number of bursts within a sound were not affected by temperature. The current study shows that spectral and temporal characteristics of sounds are affected in different ways by temperature in the croaking gourami, whereas the numbers of sounds and bursts remain unaffected. We conclude that acoustic communication in gouramis is affected by changes in ambient temperature.",

Furthermore, and the plasma ACTH, Na+, Cl\u2212, and K+ levels were the highest at 50% SW. Moreover, these parameters were significantly lower in the rAQP3-treated group than those in the control (parr: 2.0-, 2.4-, 2.1-, and 2.0-fold lower than SW; smolt: 4.2-, 1.9-, 2.4-, and 2.3-fold lower than SW, respectively). Hence, HPI axis genes may play a role in SW adaptation during migration from FW to SW environments. We showed that there was a negative correlation between rAQP3, HPI axis genes, and ion levels when the fish were transferred to SW, with levels being significantly lower in the rAQP3-injected group. Hence, cortisol appears to be a stress hormone and plasma Na+ and Cl\u2212 levels significantly increased when the fish were transferred to SW, with levels being significantly lower in the rAQP3-treated group. These results indicate that rAQP3 modulates the HPI axis and ion transportation in rainbow trout.",

We measured and calculated the mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and a particle (<\u00a02\u00a0mm) marker in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the reticulorumen (RR) of a small grazer, the Indian blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra, n\u00a0=\u00a05, body mass of 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0kg) and an intermediate feeder, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus, n\u00a0=\u00a05, body mass of 168\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0kg).

In particular, the high SFRR of blackbuck, in spite of its small body size, is remarkable, and leads to specific predictions on the RR anatomy of this species (such as a particularly large omasum), which can be tested in further studies. The adaptive value of a high SFRR is mainly considered as an increase in microbial productivity in the RR.",

The study was carried out from July to October in the freshwater tidal areas of the estuaries of Minho and Lima Rivers (NW Iberian Peninsula). Monthly, 7 biomarkers (biotransformation, energy production, anti-oxidant defenses and lipid peroxidation damages) were determined in C. fluminea and 17 abiotic parameters were determined in water or sediments in 4 sampling sites: M1, M2 and M3 in Minho (up\u00a0=\u00a0>\u00a0 downstream); and L in Lima estuaries. The results of biomarkers were integrated using the Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR), Index and also analysed in relation to environmental parameters by Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Overall, the findings of the present study indicate that July and August are particularly stressful months for the studied C. fluminea populations, especially at downstream sites; the increase of nutrients and ammonium water concentrations, water temperature and conductivity are major contributors for this increased stress; the biomarkers indicated that in July/August C. fluminea is exposed to oxidative stress inducers, environmental chemical contaminants biotransformed by esterases and glutathione S-transferase enzymes, and that organisms need additional energy to cope with the chemical and/or thermally-induced stress. The findings of the present study stress the importance of biomonitoring the health condition of C. fluminea because it may allow determining the likelihood of summer/post summer mortality syndrome in this species.",

Little is known about how maternal dietary protein affects offspring fitness in wild rodents. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that maternal dietary protein supplement has a long-term beneficial effect on offspring fitness in Brandt's vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii), a herbivorous rodent model. The vole dams were fed either a control (18% protein) or high-protein (36% protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, all offspring received a control diet till 14\u00a0weeks old. Energetic parameters, serum leptin concentration and glucose tolerance were measured. The adult offspring were fed high-fat diet for 8\u00a0weeks, and body weight and food intake were measured. No difference was observed in litter size, litter mass or pup mass before weaning. Maternal protein supplement increased body mass and the mass of reproductive organ but decreased digestibility and fat deposition and alleviated HFD-induced obesity especially in the males. Glucose tolerance was elevated in the offspring from maternal protein supplement, especially in the females. The accelerated growth may be associated with high serum leptin concentration at weaning, a state of leptin resistance, and the low digestibility may predispose obesity resistance especially in male offspring from maternal high-protein diet. These data demonstrate that maternal protein supplement confers the long-term sex-specific beneficial consequences of accelerated growth and improved obesity resistance and glucose tolerance of their offspring.",

Tetrabromocinnamic acid, a known stimulator of TER via casein kinase II inhibition, elevated TER in the cell line to 125% of control values after 2 and 6\u00a0h. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid induced a decrease in TER to <\u00a015% of pre-treatment level. Cortisol elevated TER after 12\u201372\u00a0h in a concentration-dependent manner, and this increase was antagonized by growth hormone (Gh). The effects of three osmoregulatory hormones, Gh, prolactin, and cortisol, on the mRNA expression of three tight junction proteins were examined: claudin-10e (Cldn-10e), Cldn-30, and zonula occludens-1 (Zo-1). The expression of cldn-10e was stimulated by all three hormones but with the strongest effect of Gh (50-fold). cldn-30 expression was stimulated especially by cortisol (20-fold) and also by Gh (4-fold). Finally, zo-1 was unresponsive to hormone treatment. Western blot analysis detected Cldn-10e and Cldn-30 immunoreactive proteins of expected molecular weight in samples from rainbow trout gills but not from RTgill-W1 cultures, possibly due to low expression levels. Collectively, these results show that the RTgill-W1 cell layers have tight junctions between cells, are sensitive to hormone treatments, and may provide a useful model for in vitro study of some in vivo gill phenomena.",

The lungs and kidneys are largely non-functional during embryonic development, and the embryonic phenotype of increased relative mass may be a predictive-adaptation to metabolic or respiratory acidosis, such as during exercise or high respiratory CO2.

     "abstract": "Scorpions exhibit some of the lowest recorded water loss rates among terrestrial arthropods. Evaporative water loss to the surrounding environment occurs mainly through the integument, and thus its resistance to water loss has paramount significance for the ability of scorpions to tolerate extremely dry habitats. Cuticular hydrocarbons (HCs) deposited on the outer epicuticle play an important role in determining cuticular waterproofing, and seasonal variation in both cuticular HC quantity and composition has been shown to correlate with water loss rates. Precursor incorporation rates into cuticle HCs have been observed to be extremely low in scorpions compared with insects. We therefore used adult male Buthus occitanus (Buthidae) in order to test HC profile plasticity during acute exposure to 14\u00a0d and 28\u00a0d of experimental desiccation. Cuticular HC profile of hydrated scorpions was similar to that reported for several other scorpion species, consisting of similar fractions of n-alkanes and branched alkanes, with no evidence for unsaturation. Most abundant of the n-alkanes were n-heptacosane (C27; 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% of total HCs), n-nonacosane (C29; 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%) and n-hentriacontane (C31; 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%). Exposure to desiccation stress resulted in a significant increase in the total amount of extracted HCs, and in the relative abundance of branched alkanes at the expense of n-alkanes. Together with an increase in HC chain lengths, these changes mimic previously-reported seasonal variation among freshly-collected specimens. This indicates that scorpions respond to water shortage by regulating the properties of their passive integumental barrier to water loss.",

     "abstract": "The Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii) has an exceptional ability to both withstand and recover from exposure to high external ammonia (HEA). This tolerance is likely due to the feeding behavior of this scavenger, which feeds on intermittent food falls of carrion (e.g. fish, large marine mammals) during which time it may be exposed to high concentrations of total ammonia (TAmm\u00a0=\u00a0NH3\u00a0+\u00a0NH4+) while burrowed inside the decomposing carcass. Here we exposed hagfish to 20\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01TAmm for periods of up to 48\u00a0h and then let animals recover in ammonia-free seawater. During the 48\u00a0h HEA exposure period, plasma TAmm increased 100-fold to over 5000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 while ammonia excretion (Jamm) was transiently inhibited. This increase in plasma TAmm resulted from NH3 influx down massive inwardly directed \u0394PNH3 gradients, which also led to a short-lived metabolic alkalosis. Plasma [TAmm] stabilized after 24\u201348\u00a0h, possibly through a reduction in NH3 permeability across the body surface, which lowered NH3 influx. Ammonia balance was subsequently maintained through the re-establishment of Jamm against an inwardly directed \u0394PNH3. Calculations of the Nernst potential for ammonia strongly indicated that Jamm was also taking place against a large inwardly directed NH4+ electrochemical gradient. Recovery from HEA in ammonia-free water was characterized by a large ammonia washout, and the restoration of plasma TAmm concentrations to near control concentrations. Ammonia clearance was also accompanied by a residual metabolic acidosis, which likely offset the ammonia-induced metabolic alkalosis seen in the early stages of HEA exposure. We conclude that restoration of Jamm by the Pacific hagfish during ammonia exposure likely involves secondary active transport of NH4+, possibly mediated by Na+/NH4+ (H+) exchange.",

     "abstract": "Global climate change is affecting ectothermic species, and a variety of studies are needed on thermal tolerances, especially from cellular and physiological perspectives. This study utilized AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cellular energy levels, to examine the effects of high water temperatures on zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) physiology. During heating, AMPK activity increased as water temperature increased to a point, and maximum AMPK activity was detected at high, but sublethal, water temperatures. This pattern varied with season, suggesting that cellular mechanisms of seasonal thermal acclimatization affect basic metabolic processes during sublethal heat stress. There was a greater seasonal variation in the water temperature at which maximum AMPK activity was measured than in lethal water temperature. Furthermore, baseline AMPK activity varied significantly across seasons, most likely reflecting altered metabolic states during times of growth and reproduction. In addition, when summer-collected mussels were lab-acclimated to winter and spring water temperatures, patterns of heat stress mirrored those of field-collected animals.

     "abstract": "The motility of salmonid fish sperm is initiated by a decrease in the extracellular K+ concentration. However, our previous studies revealed that salmonid fish sperm motility could be initiated in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of K+ by drastic osmotic shock induced by suspension in a hypertonic glycerol solution and subsequent dilution in a hypotonic solution (glycerol-treatment). In the present study, we examined if an osmotic shock-induced water influx is involved in the regulation of salmonid fish sperm motility. HgCl2, a common inhibitor of aquaporins (AQPs), decreased the duration of salmonid fish sperm motility. Dilution of sperm cells in a hypotonic solution increased the cellular volume, whereas HgCl2 inhibited such an increase in cellular volume. Furthermore, the expression of AQP 1a and 10 in rainbow trout testes was confirmed. In contrast, HgCl2 did not affect glycerol-treated sperm motility, indicating that AQPs are not involved in glycerol-treated sperm motility. We also explored the possibility of aquaporin-independent water influx in glycerol-treated sperm by assessing the sperm membrane permeability using propidium iodide. The plasma membrane of glycerol-treated sperm was considerably permeabilized. The cellular volume was decreased in a hypertonic glycerol solution and increased upon subsequent hypoosmotic shock, indicating an AQP-independent water flux across the plasma membrane upon glycerol-treatment. Taken together, these results showed that water influx across the plasma membrane via AQP is crucial for the maintenance of salmonid fish sperm motility under normal conditions, whereas water influx by osmotic shock-induced membrane permeation is critical for the initiation of glycerol-treated sperm motility.",

Sea bream operculum showed ~\u00a04-fold lower number of Na/K-ATPase immunoreactive cells and ~\u00a012-fold lower secretory current than the killifish. In sea bream opercular membranes, the basolateral addition of AVT (10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M) significantly stimulated Cl\u2212 secretion, while IT (10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M) was without effect. In killifish, IT produced an immediate dose-dependent stimulation of Cl\u2212 secretion with significant effect at doses \u2265\u00a010\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M and stimulation maxima (\u2206Isc ~\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02) at 10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M. The basolateral addition of bumetanide (200\u00a0\u03bcM) abolished >\u00a075% of the effect of IT on Cl\u2212 secretion. In turn, AVT had a dual effect on killifish opercular Isc: an immediate response (~\u00a03\u00a0min) with Isc reduction in an inverted bell-shaped dose\u2013response manner with higher current decrease (\u2212\u00a022\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02) at 10\u2212\u00a08\u00a0M AVT, and a sustained dose-dependent stimulation of Cl\u2212 secretion (stable up to 1\u00a0h), with a threshold significant effect at 10\u2212\u00a08\u00a0M and maximal stimulation (~\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcA\u00a0\u22c5\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02) at 10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M. Both effects of AVT appear receptor type specific. The V1-receptor antagonist SR 49059 abolished Isc reduction in response to AVT, while the specific V2-receptor antagonist (Tolvaptan, 1\u00a0\u03bcM) abolished the stimulatory action of AVT on Cl\u2212 secretion.

     "abstract": "Effects of severe hypercapnia have been extensively studied in marine fishes, while knowledge on the impacts of moderately elevated CO2 levels and their combination with warming is scarce. Here we investigate ion regulation mechanisms and energy budget in gills from Atlantic cod acclimated long-term to elevated PCO2 levels (2500\u00a0\u03bcatm) and temperature (18\u00a0\u00b0C). Isolated perfused gill preparations were established to determine gill thermal plasticity during acute exposures (10\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C) and in vivo costs of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, protein and RNA synthesis. Maximum enzyme capacities of F1Fo-ATPase, H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase were measured in vitro in crude gill homogenates. After whole animal acclimation to elevated PCO2 and/or warming, branchial oxygen consumption responded more strongly to acute temperature change. The fractions of gill respiration allocated to protein and RNA synthesis remained unchanged. In gills of fish CO2-exposed at both temperatures, energy turnover associated with Na+/K+-ATPase activity was reduced by 30% below rates of control fish. This contrasted in vitro capacities of Na+/K+-ATPase, which remained unchanged under elevated CO2 at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, and earlier studies which had found a strong upregulation under severe hypercapnia. F1Fo-ATPase capacities increased in hypercapnic gills at both temperatures, whereas Na+/K+ATPase and H+-ATPase capacities only increased in response to elevated CO2 and warming indicating the absence of thermal compensation under CO2. We conclude that in vivo ion regulatory energy demand is lowered under moderately elevated CO2 levels despite the stronger thermal response of total gill respiration and the upregulation of F1Fo-ATPase. This effect is maintained at elevated temperature.",

The present study tested differences in sex maturation and sex steroid hormones of yellowtail damselfish (Chrysiptera parasema) exposed to a white fluorescent bulb (12L:12D and 14L:10D) or long-afterglow phosphorescent pigment (LumiNova sheet) for 4\u00a0months. At the end of the experiment, in the phosphorescent group, mRNA expressions of gonadotropin hormones [(GTHs, including gonadotropin (GTH) \u03b1 and luteinizing hormone (LH) \u03b2)], estrogen receptor (ER), and vitellogenin were significantly higher than in the photoperiod groups (12L:12D and 14L:10D), and these results are consistent with those of Western blotting for protein expression. Furthermore, in the phosphorescent group, plasma FSH, LH, and estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) levels were significantly higher than in the photoperiod groups. However, plasma melatonin levels were significantly lower than in the photoperiod groups. Because LumiNova sheets continue to emit green light (520\u00a0nm) for approximately 2\u00a0h after sunset, the extended light conditions probably contributed to reproductive ability in the experimental fish. In conclusion, long-afterglow phosphorescent pigment can be used for energy-efficient aquaculture to regulate the reproduction of fish, although its effect needs to be evaluated in other species.",

The objective of this study was to investigate whether Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) from the largest colony in North America (Bonaventure Island, Quebec, Canada) were in negative nutritional state during the unprecedented low reproductive success year of 2012, and whether this was associated with changes in SST anomalies and diet. The incubation period of gannets in 2012 was characterized by a significant decline, from early to late incubation, in plasma triglyceride levels that was associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. However, no changes in plasma glycerol and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted. SST anomalies recorded in this area (south of the Gulf of St. Lawrence) during the breeding period were consistently higher in 2012 compared to the previous year (a better reproductive success year). Based on signatures of stable carbon (\u03b413C) and nitrogen (\u03b415N) isotopes in gannet red blood cells and in whole fish homogenates of three major preys (mackerel, herring, and capelin), a minor dietary shift was noted between those years and incubation periods. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the extreme warm-water perturbation event that prevailed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during summer 2012 was associated with a rapid deterioration of nutritional condition of Bonaventure Island gannets during the incubation. These suboptimal physiological changes likely contributed to the dramatic decline in reproductive success reported in this colony.",

     "abstract": "Little is known about the ecological and physiological processes governing depth distribution limits in species. Temperature and hydrostatic pressure are considered to be two dominant factors. Research has shown that some marine ectotherms are shifting their bathymetric distributions in response to rapid anthropogenic ocean surface warming. Shallow-water species unable to undergo latitudinal range shifts may depend on bathymetric range shifts to seek refuge from warming surface waters. As a first step in constraining the molecular basis of pressure tolerance in shallow water crustaceans, we examined differential gene expression in response to acute pressure and temperature exposures in juveniles of the shallow-water shrimp Palaemonetes varians. Significant increases in the transcription of genes coding for an NMDA receptor-regulated protein, an ADP ribosylation factor, \u03b2-actin, two heat shock protein 70\u00a0kDa isoforms (HSP70), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were found in response to elevated pressure. NMDA receptors have been implicated in pathways of excitotoxic damage to neurons and the onset of high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) in mammals. These data indicate that the sub-lethal effects of acute barotrauma are associated with transcriptional disturbances within the nervous tissue of crustaceans, and cellular macromolecular damage. Such transcriptional changes lead to the onset of symptoms similar to that described as HPNS in mammals, and may act as a limit to shallow water organisms' prolonged survival at depth.",

Based on a wavelet analysis of the local field potentials (LFPs), our study showed for the first time that the effects of prolonged and repeated exposure to the ELF MF on the LFPs were irreversible within investigated time frame.

The RWE of slower oscillations (1\u20132\u00a0Hz) was significantly decreased after the repeated exposures to either SnMF or SqMF. The SqMF induced decreasing of the faster waves in the range of 64\u2013128\u00a0Hz.

This study investigates the effects of thermal acclimation on red blood cell Hb\u2013O2 binding in Pacific bluefin tuna (T. orientalis) and yellowfin tuna (T. albacares) maintained in captive tanks at acclimation temperatures of 17\u00b0, 20\u00b0 and 24\u00a0\u00b0C.

The influence of many endocrine factors, such as gonadal steroids and neuropeptides, has been studied in relation to sex change, but comparatively less research has focused on gene expression changes within the brain in temperate grouper species with non-haremic social structures. The purpose of the present study was to investigate gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and brain aromatase (cyp19a1b) gene expression patterns during reproductive development and sex change in protogynous (female to male) black sea bass (Centropristis striata). Partial cDNA fragments for cyp19a1b and eef1a (a reference gene) were identified, and included with known gnrh2 and gnrh3 sequences in real time quantitative PCR. Elevated cyp19a1b expression was evident in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, optic tectum, and hypothalamus/midbrain region during vitellogenic growth, which may indicate changes in the brain related to neurogenesis or sexual behavior. In contrast, gnrh2 and gnrh3 expression levels were largely similar among gonadal states, and all three genes exhibited stable expression during sex change. Although sex change in black sea bass is not associated with dramatic changes in GnRH or cyp19a1b gene expression among brain regions, these genes may mediate processes at other levels, such as within individual hypothalamic nuclei, or through changes in neuron size, that warrant further research.",

The stromal\u2013vascular fraction of cells was isolated from the abdominal fat of 14\u00a0day-old broiler chicks and effects of exogenous chicken NPY on proliferation and differentiation determined. Based on a thymidine analog incorporation assay and gene expression analysis, there was no effect of NPY on proliferation during the first 12\u00a0hours post-treatment in cells that were induced to proliferate. However, there were effects of NPY treatment on proliferation and lipid accumulation during the first 6\u00a0days post-induction of differentiation. Neuropeptide Y supplementation during induction of differentiation was associated with greater glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and staining for neutral lipids, indicative of augmented lipid accumulation. This was also accompanied by increased proliferation during differentiation, which was characterized by up-regulation of proliferation and preadipocyte marker mRNA, and a greater number of proliferating cells in groups that were treated with NPY. Additionally, NPY treatment was associated with increased expression of fatty acid binding protein 4 and lipoprotein lipase during differentiation. In conclusion, these results suggest that NPY plays a role in promoting adipogenesis in chickens and that the mechanisms involve an increase in the synthesis of new preadipocytes and increased lipid synthesis and storage.",

Unidirectional flux chambers were used to examine the kinetics of urea uptake, and to determine the influence of sodium, ouabain, competitive urea analogues, and phloretin on urea uptake across the gut of fed dogfish. Intestinal epithelial preparations from starved and fed dogfish were mounted in Ussing chambers to examine the effect of phloretin on bidirectional solute transport across the intestine.

     "abstract": "This study looks at the correlations that fatty acids have with different tissues in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) during hormonally-induced sexual maturation, with different sperm quality parameters. In order to evaluate the different dynamics of the use of fatty acids, a categorization of the results from each sperm quality parameter (volume, concentration, motility and velocity) was performed. Low and moderate correlations were observed between muscle tissue and some sperm quality parameters but no high correlations were found. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n3, EPA) in the liver seems to have a role in determining the volume of sperm produced. This can be explained by the fact that EPA is a major requirement in the early phases of sperm production (probably as a component of the spermatozoal membrane). In addition, the levels of \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3-n3, ALA) and linoleic acid (18:2-n6, LA) in the liver decreased when sperm motility increased. In all the tissues, a negative correlation was observed between arachidonic acid (20:4n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06, ARA) and the different sperm velocity parameters. The fact that an increase in the consumption of ARA coincides with an increase in the speed of spermatozoa, highlights the important role that this fatty acid plays not only in sperm production, but also in sperm velocity. All this information could prove useful in the development of suitable broodstock diets to improve sperm quality and subsequently, the larval development of this species.",

Plasma osmolality, [Na+], [Cl\u2212] and muscle water content were severely altered in fasted fish acclimated to 10 and 2.5\u00a0ppt in comparison to normal seawater-acclimated fish, suggesting ion regulation and acid\u2013base balance disturbances. In contrast to feed-deprived fish, fed fish were able to avoid osmotic perturbation more effectively. This was accompanied by an increase in Na+/K+-ATPase expression and activity, transitory activation of H+-ATPase (only at 2.5\u00a0ppt) and down-regulation of Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 gene expression. Ammonia excretion rate was inhibited to a larger extent in fasted fish acclimated to low salinities while fed fish were able to excrete efficiently. Consequently, the build-up of ammonia in the\u00a0plasma of fed fish was relatively lower. Energy stores, especially glycogen and lipid, dropped in the fasted fish at low salinities and progression towards the anaerobic metabolic pathway became evident by an increase in plasma lactate level. Overall, the results indicate no osmotic stress in both feeding treatments within the salinity range of 32 to 20\u00a0ppt. However, at lower salinities (10\u20132.5\u00a0ppt) feed deprivation tends to reduce physiological, metabolic, ion-osmo-regulatory and molecular compensatory mechanisms and thus limits the fish's abilities to adapt to a hypo-osmotic environment.",

     "abstract": "Ostriches (Struthio camelus) are herbivorous birds with a digestive physiology that shares several similarities with that of herbivorous mammals. Previous reports, however, claimed a very low methane emission from ostriches, which would be clearly different from mammals. If this could be confirmed, ostrich meat would represent a very attractive alternative to ruminant\u2014and generally mammalian\u2014meat by representing a particularly low-emission agricultural form of production. We individually measured, by chamber respirometry, the amount of oxygen consumed as well as carbon dioxide and methane emitted from six adult ostriches (body mass 108.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3\u00a0kg) during a 24-hour period when fed a pelleted lucerne diet. While oxygen consumption was in the range of values previously reported for ostriches, supporting the validity of our experimental setup, methane production was, at 17.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0L\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01, much higher than previously reported for this species, and was of the magnitude expected for similar-sized, nonruminant mammalian herbivores. These results suggest that methane emission is similar between ostriches and nonruminant mammalian herbivores and that the environmental burden of these animals is comparable. The findings furthermore indicate that it appears justified to use currently available scaling equations for methane production of nonruminant mammals in paleo-reconstructions of methane production of herbivorous dinosaurs.",

To investigate this, full-length gnrh2 (chicken GnRH II) and gnrh3 (salmon GnRH) sequences of male three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), which are clustered with the taxa of the same GnRH type as other Euteleostei, were cloned and annotated. gnrh1 is absent in this species. The mRNA levels of gnrh2 and gnrh3 in the sticklebacks' brain were measured under breeding and post-breeding conditions as well as in castrated and sham-operated breeding fish and castrated/sham-operated fish kept under long-day (LD 16:8) and short-day (LD 8:16) conditions. Fully breeding males had considerably higher mRNA levels of gnrh2 and gnrh3 in the thalamus (Th) and in the telencephalon and preoptic area (T\u00a0+\u00a0POA), respectively, than post-breeding males. Sham-operated breeding males have higher gnrh3 mRNA levels than the corresponding castrated males. Moreover, higher gnrh2 mRNA levels in the Th and higher gnrh3 mRNA levels in the T\u00a0+\u00a0POA and hypothalamus (HypTh) were also found in long-day sham-operated males than in sham-operated fish kept under an inhibitory short day photoperiod. Nevertheless, gnrh2 and gnrh3 mRNA levels were not up-regulated in castrated males kept under long-day photoperiod, which suggests that positive feedbacks on the brain-pituitary-gonad axis are necessary for this response.",

     "abstract": "Moths have evolved a sensitive and sophisticated olfactory system to sense a variety of semiochemicals from the external environment. In chemosensory processes, the odorant binding protein (OBP) is an essential element for filtering, binding and transporting hydrophobic odorant molecules to the specific receptors. Here focusing on a major sub-class of lepidopteran OBPs, general-odorant binding proteins (GOBPs), we explored the relationship and functional difference between two GOBP members from a noctuid species Spodoptera litura. Using genomic DNA as the template, we demonstrated that SlitGOBP2 and three SlitPBPs are clustered on the same chromosome within a close proximity. qPCR results showed that two SlitGOBPs were primarily expressed in antennae at similar levels between females and males, but GOBP2 displayed much higher expression than GOBP1. Binding studies revealed that both SlitGOBP1 and 2 strongly bound C14\u2013C16 alcohol-pheromone analogs with high affinities (Ki\u00a0<\u00a01.0\u00a0\u03bcM). However, SlitGOBP2 also strongly bound most acetate- and aldehyde-sex pheromone components and analogs, while SlitGOBP1 could not. For tested plant odorants, SlitGOBP1 showed a relatively broad ligand-binding spectrum with moderate affinities, while SlitGOBP2 was tuned to some compounds with strong binding activities (Ki\u00a0<\u00a05.0\u00a0\u03bcM). Finally, by molecular docking we explored the differences in protein structures and potential key residues in the binding pockets between the two SlitGOBPs. Taken together, our study strongly suggests that SlitGOBP2 and SlitPBPs evolved by gene duplication events, and two SlitGOBPs have functionally differentiated in odorant recognition.",

This study aimed to explore the physiological background of aphid migration from unfavorable nutritional conditions to a new, intact host plant. Specifically, the relative expression of stress/metabolism-related genes and changes in metabolic reserves were determined for the winged and wingless forms of female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, under two different nutritional conditions. The expression level was determined for the following sets of genes: the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) and its receptor, enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, detoxifying enzymes, and genes encoding exoskeleton/cuticular proteins and cytoskeleton proteins. In both forms, the transcription of the adipokinetic hormone was upregulated during nutritional stress, whereas its receptor mRNA levels remained unchanged. Similarly, the expression of genes engaged in glycogen and triglyceride degradation was elevated. Glycogen reserves and phospholipids appeared to be used during stress. In comparison, nutrient rich reproductively active females of both forms appeared to use triglycerides. Moreover, we revealed changes in the mRNA level of the detoxifying genes delta-class glutathione S-transferase (GST-\u03b4) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), as well as the CP gene (which encodes exoskeleton/cuticular proteins) and the cofilin gene (the products of which influence cytoskeleton organization).

     "abstract": "The success of insects in terrestrial environments is due in large part to their ability to resist desiccation stress. Since the majority of water is lost across the cuticle, a relatively water-impermeable cuticle is a major component of insect desiccation resistance. Cuticular permeability is affected by the properties and mixing effects of component hydrocarbons, and changes in cuticular hydrocarbons can affect desiccation tolerance. A pre-exposure to a mild desiccation stress increases duration of desiccation survival in adult female Drosophila melanogaster, via a decrease in cuticular permeability. To test whether this acute response to desiccation stress is due to a change in cuticular hydrocarbons, we treated male and female D. melanogaster to a rapid desiccation hardening (RDH) treatment and used gas chromatography to examine the effects on cuticular hydrocarbon composition. RDH led to reduced proportions of unsaturated and methylated hydrocarbons compared to controls in females, but although RDH modified the cuticular hydrocarbon profile in males, there was no coordinated pattern. These data suggest that the phenomenon of RDH leading to reduced cuticular water loss occurs via an acute change in cuticular hydrocarbons that enhances desiccation tolerance in female, but not male, D. melanogaster.",

The objectives of the present study were to clone slc26a6, a prospective Cl\u2212/HCO3\u2212 exchanger from rainbow trout, investigate its expression patterns in various tissues, at different developmental stages and after differential salinity exposure, and probe the mechanisms of Cl\u2212 uptake in rainbow trout embryos during development using a pharmacological inhibitor approach combined with 36Cl\u2212 unidirectional fluxes. Results showed that the cloned gene encoded a 783 amino acid protein with conserved domains characteristic of the SLC26a family of anion exchange proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of this sequence against all subfamilies of the SLC26a family demonstrated that this translated protein shared a common ancestor with other actinopterygii and mammalian SLC26a6 isoforms and thus confirmed the identity of the cloned gene. Expression of slc26a6 was detected in all tissues and developmental stages assayed but was highest in the gill of juvenile trout. In trout embryos, Cl\u2212 uptake increased significantly post-hatch and was demonstrated to be mediated via an anion exchanger specific (DIDS sensitive) pathway that was also sensitive to hypercapnia. This parallels well with the predicted function of slc26a6, and the detection of the transcript in embryos and tissues of trout. In conclusion, this study is the first report of slc26a6 in rainbow trout and functional and expression analyses indicate its likely involvement in Cl\u2212/HCO3\u2212 exchange in two life stages of rainbow trout.",

     "abstract": "An intriguing question is how the capacity of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST)\u2014a special mechanism supporting endothermic thermoregulation in mammals\u2014is affected by selection for high exercise metabolism. It has been proposed that high NST could be a mechanism to compensate for a low basal production of heat. On the other hand, high basal or activity metabolism is associated with physiological characteristics such as high performance of the circulatory system, which are also required for achieving a high NST. Here we tested whether selection for high aerobic exercise performance, which correlates with an increased basal metabolic rate, led to a correlated evolution of maximum and facultative NST. Therefore, we measured the NST of bank voles, Myodes (= Clethrionomys) glareolus, from lines selected for 13\u201314 generations (n\u00a0=\u00a046) for high aerobic metabolism achieved during swimming and from unselected, control lines (n\u00a0=\u00a046). Open-flow respirometry was used to measure the rate of oxygen consumption (V\u00b7O2) in anesthetized bank voles injected with noradrenaline (NA). After adjusting for body mass, maximum NST (maximum V\u00b7O2 recorded after injection of NA) did not differ between the selected (2.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0mLO2min\u2212\u00a01) and control lines (2.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0mLO2min\u2212\u00a01; P\u00a0=\u00a00.891).

The \u03b12 adrenergic agonist clonidine inhibited the Cl\u2212 secretion (measured as short-circuit current, Isc), while the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and 1.0\u00a0mM dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) plus 0.1\u00a0mM isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX) stimulated Isc in OE from warm and cold acclimated fish, measured at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. In contrast, rapid cooling partially inhibited Isc, but totally blocked the inhibition by clonidine and stimulation by isoproterenol and db-cAMP\u00a0+\u00a0IBMX in OE from warm-acclimated fish, while OE from cold-acclimated animals responded normally at 5\u00a0\u00b0C. Warming epithelia from 5\u00a0\u00b0C to 20\u00a0\u00b0C restored Isc and stimulation by db-cAMP\u00a0+\u00a0IBMX markedly increased Isc to levels similar to warm acclimated epithelia, while isoproterenol was much less effective. The isoproterenol insensitivity suggests a downregulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the cold. We infer from present results and previous work (Buhariwalla et al. 2012) that cold shock of plasma membranes induces a phase shift from liquid to gel state that impaired plasma membrane protein mobility of necessary hormone regulatory functions, while cold acclimation preserved ion transport regulation via homeoviscous adaptation of plasma membrane lipids.",

In this study, we report the metabolic rearrangement in response to consumption of these monosaccharides at concentrations ranging from 0.25% to 20% in a Drosophila model. Flies raised on high-glucose diet displayed delay in pupation and increased developmental mortality compared with fructose consumers. Both monosaccharides at high concentrations promoted an obese-like phenotype indicated by increased fly body mass, levels of uric acid, and circulating and stored carbohydrates and lipids; and decreased percentage of water in the body. However, flies raised on fructose showed lower levels of circulating glucose and higher concentrations of stored carbohydrates, lipids, and uric acid. The preferential induction of obesity caused by fructose in Drosophila was associated with increased food consumption and reduced mRNA levels of DILP2 and DILP5 in the brain of adult flies. Our data show that glucose and fructose differently affect carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in Drosophila in part by modulation of insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling. Some reported similarities with effects observed in mammals make Drosophila as a useful model to study carbohydrate influence on metabolism and development of metabolic disorders.",

They have similar mean preferred body temperatures and patterns of seasonal and daily variations but differ in the magnitude of seasonal variation. Since an ectotherm metabolism is highly dependent on body temperature, thermoregulation is expected to directly affect their metabolism. We compared metabolic rates of adult males from an area of sympatry, measured under two temperature regimes (20\u00a0\u00b0C and 28\u00a0\u00b0C). Both species increased metabolic rates with temperature in a similar pattern. We also compared electron transport activity from tail tissues which provide values of species' potential metabolic activity (enzymatic capacity). Species clearly differed in potential metabolic activity; I. horvathi attained higher values than P. muralis. No difference was detected in how species exploited this potential (calculated from the ratio of electron transport activity and metabolic rates). However, we observed higher potential metabolic activity I. horvathi which together with the ability to thermoregulate more precisely could represent a higher competitive advantage over P. muralis in thermally more restrictive environments such as higher altitudes. Understanding of metabolism seems to provide valuable information for understanding recent distributional patterns as well as species interactions.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to test the effects of kisspeptin (Kiss) on somatic growth in the cinnamon clownfish Amphiprion melanopus. We investigated the effects of Kiss treatment on the growth by measuring the mRNA expressions of the growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth hormone factor (IGF-I), somatolactin (SL), and melatonin receptor (MT). The expression levels of GH and SL of the pituitary gland and IGF-I of the liver increased after Kiss treatment (in vivo and in vitro). In addition, the MT mRNA expression increased in the pituitary gland and brain after Kiss treatment (in vivo and in vitro). These results support the hypothesis that Kiss directly regulates the somatic growth-related factors, such as GH, SL, and MT, and IGF-I in the cinnamon clownfish. Further, injection of Kiss resulted in significantly higher levels of plasma melatonin than that in the control. We, therefore, conclude that Kiss plays a role in modulating growth and artificially induced rapid growth in cinnamon clownfish.",

This compensatory strategy enables the gill ion-regulatory metabolism to maintain homeostasis during exposure to hypoxia. The present study aimed to determine whether ionic regulation, glycogen utilization and antioxidant activity differ in terms of expression under hypoxic stresses; fish were sampled after being subjected to 3 or 12\u00a0h of hypoxia and 12\u00a0h of recovery under normoxia. The air-breathing behavior of the fish increased under hypoxia. No morphological modification of the gills was observed. The expression of carbonic anhydrase II did not vary among the treatments. The Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme activity did not decrease, but increases in Na+/K+-ATPase protein expression and ionocyte levels were observed. The glycogen utilization increased under hypoxia as measured by glycogen phosphorylase protein expression and blood glucose level, whereas the glycogen content decreased. The enzyme activity of several components of the antioxidant system in the gills, including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxidase dismutase, increased in enzyme activity. Based on the above data, we concluded that T. microlepis is a hypoxia-tolerant species that does not exhibit ion-regulatory suppression but uses glycogen to maintain energy utilization in the gills under hypoxic stress. Components of the antioxidant system showed increased expression under the applied experimental treatments.",

     "abstract": "In general, season affects the physiology and behavior of most animals. Warmer temperatures accelerate growth and reproduction of ectotherms, whereas these processes are slowed or halted in colder temperatures. Female blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus inhabiting the Chesapeake Bay, exhibit a seasonal migratory behavior that is closely tied with spawning and the release of larvae. To better understand reproductive activities of the migratory adult females, we examined two reproductive parameters of these crabs sampled monthly (April\u2013December, 2006): the levels of vitellogenin (VtG) in the hemolymph and VtG expression in the hepatopancreas and ovary. The full-length cDNA of VtG (CasVtG-ova) has been isolated from the ovary. The putative CasVtG sequence found in the ovary is >\u00a099% identical to that of the hepatopancreas and is related most closely to the sequences reported in other crab species. In female C. sapidus, the hepatopancreas produces over 99% of the total VtG toward the ovarian development. Ovarian stages 2 and 3 in the sampled females are characterized by significant high levels of VtG in hemolymph and VtG expression in both the hepatopancreas and ovary. However, during the southbound migration in fall, females at ovarian stages 2 and 3 have decreased VtG levels, compared to those in spring and summer. The decreased vitellogenesis activity during the fall migration suggests seasonal adaptation to ensure successful spawning and the larval release.",

This study reports a novel immunosuppressive activity against humoral immune responses by BEN family genes encoded in Cotesia plutellae bracovirus (CpBV). A total of 11 BEN family members are encoded in 10 different CpBV DNA segments. When the CpBV segments were individually injected, specific BEN genes were expressed and suppressed the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and prophenoloxidase genes following bacterial challenge. The suppressive activities of the BEN genes were reversed by injection of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to each BEN gene. The suppression of the AMP gene expressions by the BEN genes was also confirmed using an inhibition zone assay against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial growth. The significance of the suppressive activity of BEN genes against humoral immune responses was analyzed in terms of suppression of antiviral activity by the host humoral immunity. When CpBV was incubated with the plasma obtained from the larvae challenged with bacteria, the immunized plasma severely impaired the expression activity of the viral genes. However, an expression of BEN gene significantly rescued the viral gene expression by suppressing humoral immune response. These results suggest that BEN family genes of CpBV play a crucial role in defending the antiviral response of the parasitized Plutella xylostella by inhibiting humoral immune responses.",

The full-length GHS-R1a cDNA contained a 1803-bp coding domain sequence which encoded a peptide of 360 amino acid residues. Comparison analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of GHS-R1a were highly conserved in vertebrates and shared 97% amino acid identity with zebrafish (Danio rerio), 96% with jian carp (Cyprinus carpio var.

Intraperitoneally injected with grass carp ghrelin (50, 100 and 150\u00a0ng/g body weight (BW)), grass carp showed greater mRNA expression of GHS-R1a in the pituitary compared with saline injected at 0.5\u00a0h postinjection. It was observed that food deprivation could promote the expression of ghrelin and GHS-R1a in the pituitary, demonstrating that nutritional status can influence the expression of both ghrelin and GHS-R1a in the pituitary.

Deer keds shed their wings upon attachment on the host and, thus, the FAS of an individual blood-fed imago/pupa in the fur of its host can be traced back to the blood FA profile of a single moose (Alces alces). Host blood and different life stages of deer keds were investigated for FA by gas chromatography. The FAS of life stages resembled each other more closely than the diet. Blood meals modified the FAS of both sexes but the FAS of the blood-fed females were closer to those of the prepupae/pupae. The parasitizing males had higher proportions of major saturated FA (SFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) than the females, which contained more monounsaturated FA (MUFA) with higher ratios of n-3/n-6 PUFA and unsaturated FA (UFA)/SFA. The proportions of 16:1n-7 were <\u00a01% in the blood but 18% (males) and 29% (females) in the blood-fed keds. Allocation of lipids to offspring by the females and possible accumulation of PUFA in male reproductive organs may have induced these sex-related differences. MUFA percentages and UFA/SFA ratios increased while SFA and many PUFA decreased from the reproducing females to the pupae. The diapausing pupae displayed lowered n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios and could have mobilized 16:0 and 18:3n-3 for the most fundamental metabolic processes. In conclusion, FAS are modified through the life stages of the deer ked possibly due to their different FA requirements.",

     "abstract": "Critical windows are periods of developmental susceptibility when the phenotype of an embryonic, juvenile or adult animal may be vulnerable to environmental fluctuations. Temperature has pervasive effects on poikilotherm physiology, and embryos are especially vulnerable to temperature shifts. To identify critical windows, we incubated whitefish embryos at control temperatures of 2\u00a0\u00b0C, 5\u00a0\u00b0C, or 8\u00a0\u00b0C, and shifted treatments among temperatures at the end of gastrulation or organogenesis. Heart rate (fH) and oxygen consumption ( V \u02d9 O 2 ) were measured across embryonic development, and V \u02d9 O 2 was measured in 1-day old hatchlings. Thermal shifts, up or down, from initial incubation temperatures caused persistent changes in fH and V \u02d9 O 2 compared to control embryos measured at the same temperature (2\u00a0\u00b0C, 5\u00a0\u00b0C, or 8\u00a0\u00b0C). Most prominently, when embryos were measured at organogenesis, shifting incubation temperature after gastrulation significantly lowered V \u02d9 O 2 or fH. Incubation at 2\u00a0\u00b0C or 5\u00a0\u00b0C through gastrulation significantly lowered V \u02d9 O 2 (42% decrease) and fH (20% decrease) at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, incubation at 2\u00a0\u00b0C significantly lowered V \u02d9 O 2 (40% decrease) and fH (30% decrease) at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, and incubation at 5\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C significantly lowered V \u02d9 O 2 at 2\u00a0\u00b0C (27% decrease). Through the latter half of development, V \u02d9 O 2 and fH in embryos were not different from control values for thermally shifted treatments. However, in hatchlings measured at 2\u00a0\u00b0C, V \u02d9 O 2 was higher in groups incubated at 5\u00a0\u00b0C or 8\u00a0\u00b0C through organogenesis, compared to 2\u00a0\u00b0C controls (43 or 65% increase, respectively). Collectively, these data suggest that embryonic development through organogenesis represents a critical window of embryonic and hatchling phenotypic plasticity. This study presents an experimental design that identified thermally sensitive periods for fish embryos.",

Baroreflex sensitivity presented a high thermal dependence (Q10\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u20134.1), and the HR\u2013baroreflex curve was shifted up and to the right as temperature increased from 15 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C.

The cardiac limb of the baroreflex response to pharmacological treatments was significantly blunted after full autonomic blockade. In addition, there was a clear baroreflex\u2013HR response mainly to hypotension at all three temperatures tested. These findings indicate that toads present temperature dependence for cardiac limb of the barostatic response and the cardiac baroreflex response in R. schneideri is primarily hypotensive rather than hypertensive as well as crocodilians and mammals. Thus, the cardiac baroreflex compensation to changes in arterial pressure might present different patterns among amphibian species, since the previously reported bradycardic compensation to hypertension in some anurans was not observed in the toad used in the present study.",

Irrespective of BM cold water temperatures resulted in a reduction (30\u201335%) of MS whereas the reduction of MS at warm temperatures was only evident for larger fish (200 and 450\u00a0g), caused by plateauing of MMR at 10\u00a0\u00b0C and above.

The chub mackerel Scomber japonicus expresses two forms of Kiss (kiss1 and kiss2) and two Kiss receptor (kissr1 and kissr2) genes in the brain, which exhibit sexually dimorphic changes during the seasonal reproductive cycle. This indicates that the kisspeptin system plays an important role in gonadal recrudescence of chub mackerel; however, the involvement of the kisspeptin system in the pubertal process has not been identified. In the present study, we examined the mRNA expression of kiss1, kiss2, kissr1, kissr2, and gnrh1 (hypophysiotropic form) in the brain of a chub mackerel during puberty. In male fish, kiss2, kissr1 and kissr2 levels increased significantly at 14\u00a0weeks post-hatch (wph), synchronously with an increase in type A spermatogonial populations in the testis; kiss2 and gnrh1 levels significantly increased at 22\u00a0wph, just before the onset of meiosis in the testes.

Many birds living in regions with seasonal fluctuations in Ta typically respond to cold by increasing their insulation and adjusting their metabolic rate. To understand these metabolic adaptations, body temperature (Tb), metabolic rate (MR), thermal neutral zone (TNZ) and thermal conductance were measured within a range of temperatures from 5 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C in free-living Hwamei, Garrulax canorus, in both winter and summer.

Because of the strong relationship between thermoregulation and other homeostatic linked physiological parameters, perinatal thermal manipulation will also have an impact on other body functions like reproduction. As a maturation stimulant for later reproductive performance, hypothalamic type-2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) expression was investigated in 35\u00a0day old immature female broilers with and without embryonic temperature stimulation. For the first time, human-specific Dio2 primary antibodies combined with additional amplification enabled the immunohistochemical detection of hypothalamic Dio2 protein in birds. The novel protocol includes an additional amplification step involving swine-anti-rabbit/mouse/goat antibodies against both goat anti-Dio2 primary and rabbit anti-goat biotinylated secondary commercial antibodies in the standard diaminobenzidine protocol. However, significant Dio2 expression was exclusively found in perinatally short-term temperature stimulated hens. Caudal but not rostral hypothalamic slices revealed that elevating incubation temperature by 1\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h daily, from day 18 of embryonic development until hatching, induced a statistical significant expression of Dio2 within the subcommisural organ and the median eminence. This ample expression of Dio2 protein within caudal but not rostral hypothalamic slices of embryonic temperature stimulated chickens, leads to the assumption of a novel physiological prospective for embryonic thermal manipulation involving the suppression of thyroid hormone and the boosting of hypothalamic Dio2-induced FSH secretion to considerably advance the age of photoinduced egg production. It could be also of practicable relevance for broiler breeder females, and needs further investigations.",

We measured EWL and metabolic rate of torpid Myotis nattereri (Kuhl, 1817) huddling in groups or roosting individually. Evaporative water loss in huddling individual bats was almost 30% lower than in solitary animals (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), even after correcting for the effects of metabolic rate. Our results suggest that conservation of water is a substantial benefit underlying huddling by bats during hibernation. Ultimately, huddling could reduce the total cost of hibernation by reducing the number of expensive periodic arousals from torpor caused by the need to supplement water.",

Fish were either fed or fasted and were exposed to hypoxia (1.5\u20131.8\u00a0mg O2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) at or slightly above their critical oxygen concentration during 1, 3 or 7\u00a0days followed by a 7\u00a0day recovery period. Ventilation initially increased during hypoxia, but fasted fish had lower ventilation frequencies than fed fish. In fed fish, ventilation returned to control levels during hypoxia, while in fasted fish recovery only occurred after reoxygenation. Due to this, C. carpio managed, at least in part, to maintain aerobic metabolism during hypoxia: muscle and plasma lactate levels remained relatively stable although they tended to be higher in fed fish (despite higher ventilation rates). However, during recovery, compensatory responses differed greatly between both feeding regimes: plasma lactate in fed fish increased with a simultaneous breakdown of liver glycogen indicating increased energy use, while fasted fish seemed to economize energy and recycle decreasing plasma lactate levels into increasing liver glycogen levels. Protein was used under both feeding regimes during hypoxia and subsequent recovery: protein levels reduced mainly in liver for fed fish and in muscle for fasted fish. Overall, nutritional status had a greater impact on energy reserves than the lack of oxygen with a lower hepatosomatic index and lower glycogen stores in fasted fish. Fasted fish transiently increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity under hypoxia, but in general ionoregulatory balance proved to be only slightly disturbed, showing that sufficient energy was left for ion regulation.",

Because short term blood pressure homeostasis is regulated by arterial baroreceptors, we compared baroreflex function in three species of anurans that span a range of environments, dehydration tolerance and an ability to maintain Pm with dehydration and hemorrhage. The cardiac limb of the baroreflex loop was studied using pharmacological manipulation of Pm with phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside (20\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01), and the resulting changes in heart rate (fH) were quantitatively analyzed using a four-parameter sigmoidal logistic function.

Mean arterial blood pressures at rest in the three species were near the saturation point of the baroreflex curve which provides the animals with a greater fH response range to hypotensive, rather than hypertensive, changes in Pm.

In teleost fishes, a family of five AMs are present (AM1/4, AM2/3 and AM5) with four homologous AMs (AM1, AM2/3 and AM5) recently cloned from the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica. Both AM2 and AM5 have been shown to be strong in vivo vasodepressors in eel, but the mechanism of action of homologous AMs on isolated blood vessels has not been examined in teleost fish. In this study, both eel AM2 and AM5 caused a marked vasodilation of the dorsal aorta. However, only AM5 consistently dilated the small gonadal artery in contrast to AM2 that had no effect in most preparations. Neither AM2 nor AM5 had any effect when applied to the first afferent branchial artery; in contrast, eel ANP always caused a large vasodilation of the branchial artery. In the dorsal aorta, indomethacin significantly reduced the AM2 vasodilation, but had no effect on the AM5 vasodilation. In contrast, removal of the endothelium significantly enhanced the AM5 vasodilation only. In the gonadal artery, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ) significantly reduced the AM5 vasodilation suggesting a role for soluble guanylyl cyclase in the dilation, but l-NNA and removal of the endothelium had no effect. The results of this study indicate that AM2 and AM5 have distinct vasodilatory effects that may be due to the peptides signalling via different receptors to regulate vascular tone in eel.",

Because of the isotopic differences between these two endogenous nutrient pools, any shift toward nonlipid fuel oxidation would be expected to increase in the \u03b413C of the exhaled breath. Interestingly, the possibility of whether or not an exercise-induced change actually occurs has been debated in literature for over two decades and researchers have still not reached a consensus. We measured ventilatory and metabolic variables before, during, and after exercise in forty-eight adults (n\u00a0=\u00a025 females, n\u00a0=\u00a023 males; 20.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0years) assigned to either a resting treatment or one of three exercising treatments where they maintained a heart rate of 130, 150, or 170\u00a0bpm for 56\u00a0min. We found that the mean metabolic rates of the exercising groups increased 4.4-fold, 6.1-fold, and 7.7-fold above resting values, respectively. Exercise caused small increases in respiratory exchange ratios (e.g., from 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 to 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10) indicative of increased carbohydrate oxidation, but these changes were too variable to be reliably correlated with exercise intensity. In contrast, the \u03b413C of the exhaled breath increased by 0.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u2030, 1.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29\u2030, and 1.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50\u2030, respectively, for the three groups and was significantly correlated with the intensity of exercise. We also show that the isotopic difference of the lipid and nonlipids of the body is similar (~\u00a02.7\u2030) even when consuming bulk diets that are isotopically distinct (>\u00a08\u2030).

These neurons respond to light with slow hyperpolarization and to CO2 stimulation with slow depolarization. In this study, increasing the concentration of CO2 in the air caused hyperventilation and enlargement of the pneumostome in the intact animal. In a semi-intact preparation, pouring artificial seawater (ASW) with dissolved CO2 onto the central ganglia caused the previously closed pneumostome to open. In an ASW environment, Ip-1/2 neurons depolarized even under conditions of constant pH (alkaline ASW) and after dissolution of CO2. This depolarization prolonged the firing of action potentials in Ip-1/2 neurons. Adding protons (H+) to ASW caused Ip-1/2 depolarization only when the neurons' membranes were depolarized to a potential above the resting potential. Furthermore, in the presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (AZ), CO2-induced excitation in Ip-1/2 neurons was increased in both normal and alkaline ASW. These results suggest that when dissolved in ASW, CO2 directly induced the depolarizing response in Ip-1/2 neurons. Since Ip-1/2 neurons participate in pneumostome opening, these results suggest that increased CO2 levels in ASW directly stimulate CO2-sensitive central neurons, promoting ventilation.",

MPS was generally lower in ruminants than in hindgut fermenters and increased with M in the total dataset, but was nearly constant among closely related taxa (e.g. within ruminants, within equids) irrespective of M. MPS (but not MRT) was significantly correlated to GP96h, whereas MRT (but not MPS) was significantly correlated to MFN, suggesting different effects of these factors on different aspects of digestibility. Combinations of measures including MPS mostly explained digestibility better than other combinations. The phylogenetic signal \u03bb, which was mostly 1 when linking any single measure to digestibility, was estimated 0 in models that linked digestive efficiency to combinations of measures. These results support the intuitive concept that species diversification in large herbivores is tightly related to digestive physiology, and that chewing efficiency as measured by faecal particle size is an integral aspect of this scenario.",

     "abstract": "The activation of immune defences counteracts pathogens, but mounting an immune response is costly and can negatively impact life-history traits. Immune activation releases highly reactive species that kill pathogens but can also cause oxidative damage to host tissues, and these negative effects may therefore constrain further investment in immune responses. To offset these toxic effects, animals rely on a complex system of antioxidants. Here, we tested if vitamin E, a dietary antioxidant, can reduce oxidative damage induced by an immune challenge and thus enhance the immune response. In a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 experimental design, we supplemented great tit nestlings with either vitamin E or a placebo, and then injected them with either a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or a buffer solution (PBS) as a control. LPS-treated nestlings mounted an inflammatory response and increased antioxidant capacity, without any change in ROM (reactive oxygen metabolites), an index of early oxidative damage. These results suggest that the likely transient increase in reactive species of the LPS injection was counteracted by a rise in endogenous antioxidant defences that was independent of supplementary dietary antioxidants. Indeed, vitamin E supplementation neither affected oxidative status nor enhanced the immune response, suggesting that in our experimental condition great tit nestlings were not limited in vitamin E and in antioxidants in general. Overall, our results show that birds can mount an effective antioxidant response to face an immune challenge, and can therefore avoid stress caused by a transient increase in reactive species generated by immune activation.",

The implant doses were 0 (C0; as control), 5 (C5) and 50 (C50) mg cortisol/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken every seven days during the four weeks of the experiment and analyzed for cortisol, glucose, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), total protein, total lipid, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cholesterol and triglyceride content. Growth was reduced in all experimental groups and was not affected by cortisol treatment. Surprisingly, serum cortisol levels were higher in the C5 group than in the C50 throughout the experiment. A significant increase in glucose levels was observed in the cortisol-implanted fish from day 14 onwards. The high dose of cortisol elicited a significant increase in serum T3 and T4 levels. Fish implanted with the high cortisol dose also showed increases in serum ACTH, total lipid and cholesterol levels throughout a 28-day experimental period. The present study reveals that the negative effects of endoscopic surgery remain for at least four weeks and that a sustained-release implant of cortisol to mimic the effects of chronic stress affects metabolic responses. Since the adverse effects of endoscopic surgery on sturgeon welfare can be amplified by cortisol, special attention should be paid to the potential effects of chronic stress on sturgeon in culture.",

We assessed if these differences in mitochondria had an impact on metabolic processes that depend on mitochondrial function, specifically hypoxia tolerance and recovery from burst exercise. Bluegill, pumpkinseed, and their hybrids showed no difference in the critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) and no differences in tissue metabolites measured after exposure to 10% O2 for 30\u00a0min. In contrast, loss of equilibrium (LOE) measurements showed that hybrids had reduced hypoxia tolerance and lacked the size-dependence in hypoxia tolerance seen in the parental species. However, we found no evidence of systematic differences in metabolite levels in fish after LOE. Furthermore, there were abundant glycogen reserves at the point of loss of equilibrium. The three genotypes did not differ in metabolite status at rest, showed an equal disruption at exhaustion, and similar metabolic profiles throughout recovery. Thus, we found no evidence of a mitochondria dysfunction in hybrids, and mitochondrial differences and oxidative metabolism did not explain the variation in hypoxia tolerance seen in the hybrid and two parental species.",

These are typically designed for clinical use and automatically heat the blood sample to 37\u00a0\u00b0C for measurements. While most blood gas analyzers allow for temperature corrections of the measurements, the underlying algorithms are based on temperature-effects for human blood, and any discrepancies in the temperature dependency between the blood sample from a given species and human samples will bias measurements. In this study we review the effects of temperature on blood gases and pH and evaluate the performance of an automated blood gas analyzer (GEM Premier 3500). Whole blood obtained from pythons and freshwater turtles was equilibrated in rotating Eschweiler tonometers to a variety of known PO2's and PCO2's in gas mixtures prepared by W\u00f6sthoff gas mixing pumps and blood samples were measured immediately on the GEM Premier 3500. The pH measurements were compared to measurements using a Radiometer BMS glass capillary pH electrode kept and calibrated at the experimental temperature.

The bulbus arteriosus receives sympathetic innervation and is affected by several circulating substances, indicating neurohumoral control. We have previously shown that the peptide hormone, cholecystokinin (CCK), affects the hemodynamics of the cardiovascular system in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by increasing flow pulse amplitude without affecting cardiac output. We hypothesized that this could be explained by an altered tonus or compliance/distensibility of the bulbus arteriosus. Our results show that there is a substantial effect of CCK on the bulbus arteriosus. Concentrations of CCK that altered the cardiac function of in situ perfused hearts also contracted the bulbus arteriosus in vitro. Pressure\u2013volume curves revealed a change in both the tonus and the compliance/distensibility of this structure. Furthermore, the stimulatory (constricting) effect of CCK was also evident in the ventricle and vasculature leading to the gills, but absent in the atrium, efferent branchial arteries and dorsal aorta. In conclusion, CCK alters the mechanical properties of the ventricle, bulbus arteriosus, ventral aorta and afferent gill vasculature, thus maintaining adequate branchial and systemic blood flow and pressure when cardiorespiratory demands change, such as after feeding.",

It is therefore important, especially for comparative studies, that these variables (and others) are measured under standardised conditions, of which a resting state during the inactive phase is part of the accepted criteria. Here we show how measurement duration and timing affect these criteria and impact on the estimation of basal metabolic rate (oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production) and standard evaporative water loss of a small nocturnal rodent. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and evaporative water loss all decreased over the duration of an experiment. Random assortment of hourly values indicated that this was an animal rather than a random effect for up to 11\u00a0h. Experimental start time also had a significant effect on measurement of physiological variables. A longer time period was required to achieve minimal carbon dioxide consumption and evaporative water loss when experiments commenced earlier in the day; however, experiments with earlier start times had a lower overall estimates of minimal oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. For this species, measurement duration of at least 8\u00a0h, ideally commencing between before the inactive phase at 03:00\u00a0h and 05:00\u00a0h, is required to obtain minimal standard values for physiological variables. Up to 80% of recently published studies measuring basal metabolic rate and/or evaporative water loss of small nocturnal mammals may overestimate basal values due to insufficiently long measurement duration.",

Mammalian oxidative muscle couples expression of sMtCK with M-CK, creating an energy shuttle between mitochondria and myofibrils. We hypothesized that the expression pattern and activity of CK would differ between hearts of red- and white-blooded Antarctic notothenioid fishes due to their striking differences in cardiac ultrastructure. Hearts of white-blooded icefishes (family Channichthyidae) have significantly higher mitochondrial densities compared to red-blooded species, decreasing the diffusion distance for ATP between mitochondria and myofibrils and potentially minimizing the need for CK. The distribution of CK isoforms was evaluated using western blotting and maximal activity of CK was measured in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions and tissue homogenates of heart ventricles of red- and white-blooded notothenioids. Transcript abundance of sMtCK and M-CK was also quantified. Overall, CK activity is similar between hearts of red- and white-blooded notothenioids but hearts of icefishes lack MtCK and have higher activities of M-CK in the cytosol compared to red-blooded fishes.

Exogenous angiotensin I (ANG I) injection did not change MAP or \u0192H in captopril-treated embryos, confirming ACE inhibition. Captopril-treated embryos were significantly hypotensive, with MAP 15% lower than controls, which we attributed to the loss of vasoconstrictive ANG II action. Exogenous ANG II induced a relatively greater hypertensive response in captopril-treated embryos compared to controls. Changes in response to ANG II following pre-treatment with phentolamine (\u03b1-adrenergic antagonist) indicated a portion of the ANG II response was due to circulating catecholamines in captopril-treated embryos. An increase in MAP and \u0192H in response to hexamethonium indicated vagal tone was also increased in the absence of ACE activity. Captopril-treated embryos had lower osmolality, lower Na+ and higher K+ concentration in the blood, indicating osmoregulatory changes. Larger kidney mass in captopril-treated embryos suggests disrupting the RAS may stimulate kidney growth by decreasing resistance at the efferent arteriole and increasing the fraction of cardiac output to the kidneys. This study suggests that the RAS, most likely through ANG II action, influences the development of the cardiovascular and osmoregulatory systems.",

     "abstract": "Changes in temperature across geographic gradients can occur on a wide temporal range, from fluctuations within hours as a result of day-night to those over many years. These events will drive many organisms towards their physiological limits of thermal tolerance. Recently, many reports support a limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses to high temperatures, meaning a conserved heat tolerance among ectotherms in general. We address this problem and tested the heat and cold tolerance invariant\u2013variant hypotheses in terrestrial isopods. We studied five different populations of Porcellio laevis and three populations of Porcellio scaber, spanning 30\u00b0 S latitudinal gradient in Chile. The heat tolerance of woodlice was conserved with little variation along latitude and environmental temperatures, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with environmental temperatures and latitudes. Indeed, a significant and negative correlation was observed between cold tolerance and latitude. Also, significant and positive correlations were observed among cold tolerance and environmental temperatures. Conversely, heat tolerance was not significantly correlated with any of the environmental temperatures tested neither with latitude. This macrophysiological pattern indicated that heat and cold-tolerances of species and populations not always change across geographical gradients meaning that thermal tolerance responses to high temperatures may be evolutionary constrained.",

     "abstract": "Seasonally-acquired cold tolerance can be reversed at warm temperatures, leaving temperate ectotherms vulnerable to cold snaps. However, deacclimation, and its underlying mechanisms, has not been well-explored in insects. Swallowtail butterflies are widely distributed but in some cases their range is limited by low temperature and their cold tolerance is seasonally acquired, implying that they experience mortality resulting from deacclimation. We investigated cold tolerance and hemolymph composition of Anise swallowtail (Papilio zelicaon) pupae during overwintering in the laboratory, and after four days exposure to warm temperatures in spring. Overwintering pupae had supercooling points around \u2212\u00a020.5\u00a0\u00b0C and survived brief exposures to \u2212\u00a030\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting partial freeze tolerance. Overwintering pupae had hemolymph osmolality of approximately 920\u00a0mOsm, imparted by high concentrations of glycerol, K+ and Na+. After exposure to spring warming, supercooling points increased to approximately \u2212\u00a017\u00a0\u00b0C, and survival of a 1\u00a0h exposure to \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C decreased from 100% to 0%. This deacclimation was associated with decreased hemolymph osmolality and reduced glycerol, trehalose, Na+ and Ca2\u00a0+ concentrations. We compared cold tolerance of pupae to weather conditions at and beyond the species' northern range boundary. Minimum temperatures at the range boundary approached the lower lethal temperature of pupae, and were colder north of the range, suggesting that cold hardiness may set northern range limits. Minimum temperatures following warm snaps were likely to cause mortality in at least one of the past three years. Cold snaps in the spring are increasing in frequency as a result of global climate change, so are likely to be a significant source of mortality for this species, and other temperate ectotherms.",

     "abstract": "Cold environmental conditions and small body size promote heat loss and may create thermoregulatory challenges for marine mammals born in polar regions. However, among polar-born phocid seal species there are variations in physical attributes and environmental conditions at birth, allowing for an interesting contrast in thermoregulatory strategy. We compared thermoregulatory strategies through morphometrics, sculp attributes (conductivity and resistance), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST via uncoupling protein 1; UCP1), and muscle thermogenesis (via enzyme activity) in neonatal harp (Pagophilus groenlandicus), hooded (Cystophora cristata), and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). Harp seals are the smallest at birth (9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 kg), rely on lanugo (82.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.70% of thermal resistance), and are capable of NST through expression of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In contrast, hooded seal neonates (26.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 kg) have 2.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23 cm of blubber, accounting for 38.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.07% of their thermal resistance. They are not capable of NST, as UCP1 is not expressed. The large Weddell seal neonates (31.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 kg) rely on lanugo (89.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25% of thermal resistance) like harp seals, but no evidence of BAT was found. Muscle enzyme activity was highest in Weddell seal neonates, suggesting that they rely primarily on muscle thermogenesis. Similar total thermal resistance, combined with marked differences in thermogenic capacity of NST and ST among species, strongly supports that thermoregulatory strategy in neonatal phocids is more closely tied to pups' surface area to volume ratio (SA:V) and potential for early water immersion rather than mass and ambient environmental conditions.",

Using the well-studied green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), this study sought to develop and evaluate the use of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) as a minimally invasive tool for investigating auditory sensitivity in a larger diversity of anuran species. The goals of the study were to assess the effects of frequency, signal level, sex, and body size on auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes and latencies, characterize gross ABR morphology, and generate an audiogram that could be compared to several previously published audiograms for green treefrogs. Increasing signal level resulted in larger ABR amplitudes and shorter latencies, and these effects were frequency dependent. There was little evidence for an effect of sex or size on ABRs. Analyses consistently distinguished between responses to stimuli in the frequency ranges of the three previously-described populations of afferents that innervate the two auditory end organs in anurans. The overall shape of the audiogram shared prominent features with previously published audiograms. This study highlights the utility of AEPs as a valuable tool for the study of anuran auditory sensitivity.",

This economically important species has demonstrated freshwater tolerance; however, the physiological mechanisms and costs related to freshwater exposure remain poorly understood. The current study therefore investigated the physiological response of red drum using an acute freshwater transfer protocol. Plasma osmolality, Cl\u2212, Mg2\u00a0+ and Ca2\u00a0+ were all significantly reduced by 24\u00a0h post-transfer; Cl\u2212 and Mg2\u00a0+ recovered to control levels by 7\u00a0days post-transfer. No effect of transfer was observed on muscle water content; however, muscle Cl\u2212 was significantly reduced. Interestingly, plasma and muscle Na+ content was unaffected by freshwater transfer. Intestinal fluid was absent by 24\u00a0h post-transfer indicating cessation of drinking. Branchial gene expression analysis showed that both CFTR and NKCC1 exhibited significant down-regulation at 8 and 24\u00a0h post-transfer, respectively, although transfer had no impact on NHE2, NHE3 or Na+, K+ ATPase (NKA) activity. These general findings are supported by immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed no apparent NKCC containing cells in the gills at 7\u00a0days post transfer while NKA cells localization was unaffected. The results of the current study suggest that red drum can effectively regulate Na+ balance upon freshwater exposure using already present Na+ uptake pathways while also down-regulating ion excretion mechanisms.",

We investigate the distributions of microfilaments and microtubules and their associated molecular motors, myosin and dynein, by confocal and transmission electron microscopy, evaluating a functional role for the cytoskeleton in pigment translocation using inhibitors of polymer turnover and motor activity in vitro. Microtubules occupy the chromatophore cell extensions whether the pigment granules are aggregated or dispersed. The inhibition of microtubule turnover by taxol induces pigment aggregation and inhibits re-dispersion. Phalloidin-FITC actin labeling, together with tannic acid fixation and ultrastructural analysis, reveals that microfilaments form networks associated with the pigment granules. Actin polymerization induced by jasplaquinolide strongly inhibits RPCH-induced aggregation, causes spontaneous pigment dispersion, and inhibits pigment re-dispersion. Inhibition of actin polymerization by latrunculin-A completely impedes pigment aggregation and re-dispersion. Confocal immunocytochemistry shows that non-muscle myosin II (NMMII) co-localizes mainly with pigment granules while blebbistatin inhibition of NMMII strongly reduces the RPCH response, also inducing spontaneous pigment dispersion. Myosin II and dynein also co-localize with the pigment granules. Inhibition of dynein ATPase by erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine induces aggregation, inhibits RPCH-triggered aggregation, and inhibits re-dispersion. Granule aggregation and dispersion depend mainly on microfilament integrity although microtubules may be involved. Both cytoskeletal polymers are functional only when subunit turnover is active. Myosin and dynein may be the molecular motors that drive pigment aggregation. These mechanisms of granule translocation in crustacean chromatophores share various features with those of vertebrate pigment cells.",

     "abstract": "The Asian swamp eel (Monopterus albus, Zuiew 1793) is a facultative air-breathing fish with reduced gills. Previous studies have shown that gas exchange seems to occur across the epithelium of the buccopharyngeal cavity, the esophagus and the integument, resulting in substantial diffusion limitations that must be compensated by adaptations in others steps of the O2 transport system to secure adequate O2 delivery to the respiring tissues. We therefore investigated O2 binding properties of whole blood, stripped hemoglobin (Hb), two major isoHb components and the myoglobin (Mb) from M. albus. Whole blood was sampled using indwelling catheters for blood gas analysis and determination of O2 equilibrium curves. Hb was purified to assess the effects of endogenous allosteric effectors, and Mb was isolated from heart and skeletal muscle to determine its O2 binding properties. The blood of M. albus has a high O2 carrying capacity [hematocrit (Hct) of 42.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5%] and binds O2 with an unusually high affinity (P50\u00a0=\u00a02.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mmHg at 27\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a07.7), correlating with insensitivity of the Hb to the anionic allosteric effectors that normally decrease Hb-O2 affinity. In addition, Mb is present at high concentrations in both heart and muscle (5.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.99 and 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0mg \u2219 g wet tissue-\u00a01, respectively). We suggest that the high Hct and high blood O2 affinity serve to overcome the low diffusion capacity in the relatively inefficient respiratory surfaces, while high Hct and Mb concentration aid in increasing the O2 flux from the blood to the muscles.",

     "abstract": "Crustaceans generally act as oxy-regulators, maintaining constant oxygen uptake as oxygen partial pressures decrease, but when a critical low level is reached, ventilation and aerobic metabolism shut down. Cave-adapted animals, including crustaceans, often show a reduced metabolic rate possibly owing in part to the hypoxic nature of such environments. However, metabolic rates have not been thoroughly explored in crustaceans from anchialine habitats (coastal ponds and caves), which can experience variable oxygenic regimes. Here, an atypical oxy-conforming pattern of oxygen uptake is reported in the Hawaiian anchialine atyid Halocaridina rubra, along with other unusual metabolic characteristics. Ventilatory rates are near-maximal in normoxia and did not increase appreciably as PO2 declined, resulting in a decline in VO2 during progressive hypoxia. Halocaridina rubra maintained in anoxic waters survived for seven days (the duration of the experiment) with no measureable oxygen uptake, suggesting a reliance on anaerobic metabolism. Supporting this, lactate dehydrogenase activity was high, even in normoxia, and oxygen debts were quickly repaid by an unusually extreme increase in oxygen uptake upon exposure to normoxia. In contrast, four related anchialine shrimp species from the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, exhibited physiological properties consistent with previously studied crustaceans. The unusual respiratory patterns found in H. rubra are discussed in the context of a trade-off in gill morphology for osmoregulatory ion transport vs. diffusion of respiratory gasses. Future focus on anchialine species may offer novel insight into the diversity of metabolic responses to hypoxia and other physiological challenges experienced by crustaceans.",

Branchial gene expression of Na+\u2013K+\u20132Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC), an indicator of SW-type mitochondria-rich (MR) cells, was positively correlated with SMR, while Na+\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NCC), an indicator of FW-type MR cells, was negatively correlated.

In the present study, we have examined desiccation survival in males and females of Drosophila hydei from colder and drier montane conditions of the western Himalayas (altitudinal populations; 600\u20132202\u00a0m). In contrast with most other studies in drosophilids, D. hydei males exhibited comparatively higher desiccation resistance despite smaller body size compared to females. Accordingly, we tested the physiological basis of such adaptations in both sexes of D. hydei. Body size traits (wing length, wet weight and dry weight) were ~\u00a01.2 fold higher in females than males. However, desiccation resistance was 10 to 13\u00a0h higher in males than females. These differences matched enhanced storage of trehalose content (~\u00a01.2 fold), higher hemolymph content (~\u00a01.2 fold) and enhanced cuticular lipid mass (~\u00a01.5 fold) in males than females. Water loss before succumbing to death (dehydration tolerance) was much higher in males (~\u00a081%) than females (~\u00a064%). A greater loss of hemolymph water until death under desiccation stress was associated with higher desiccation resistance in males. Further, there were lacks of differences in the rate of water loss, rate of trehalose utilization and rate of hemolymph depletion between the sexes in D. hydei. Therefore, sex-specific differences in desiccation resistance of D. hydei were independent of body size as well as the exhaustion of metabolite reserves and rather were caused by the higher dehydration tolerance as well as higher acquisition of hemolymph and trehalose contents.",

     "abstract": "The occurrence of stress-inducing factors in captive crocodilians is a concern, since chronic stress can negatively affect animal health and reproduction, and hence production. Monitoring stress in wild crocodiles could also be beneficial for assessing the state of health in populations which are potentially threatened by environmental pollution. In both cases, a non-invasive approach to assess adrenocortical function as a measure of stress would be preferable, as animals are not disturbed during sample collection, and therefore sampling is feedback-free. So far, however, such a non-invasive method has not been established for any crocodilian species. As an initial step, we therefore examined the suitability of two enzyme-immunoassays, detecting faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) with a 11\u03b2,21-diol-20-one and 5\u03b2-3\u03b1-ol-11-one structure, respectively, for monitoring stress-related physiological responses in captive Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge was performed on 10 sub-adult crocodiles, resulting in an overall increase in serum corticosterone levels of 272% above the pre-injection levels 5\u00a0h post-injection. Saline-treated control animals (n\u00a0=\u00a08) showed an overall increase of 156% in serum corticosterone levels 5\u00a0h post-administration. Faecal samples pre- and post-injection could be obtained from three of the six individually housed crocodiles, resulting in FGM concentrations 136\u2013380% above pre-injection levels, always detected in the first sample collected post-treatment (7\u201315\u00a0days post-injection). FGM concentrations seem comparatively stable at ambient temperatures for up to 72\u00a0h post-defaecation. In conclusion, non-invasive hormone monitoring can be used for assessing adrenocortical function in captive Nile crocodiles based on FGM analysis.",

Using black-capped chickadees exposed to three experimental temperatures (0\u00a0\u00b0C, 15\u00a0\u00b0C, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C), the goal of this experiment was to determine the relationship between plasma levels of TRIG and GLY and fattening rate measured over periods from a few hours to the previous two days. Results showed that birds maintained in the cold had metabolite levels 39\u201381% higher than those at thermoneutrality, likely reflecting the size of their fat reserves, and that TRIG and total GLY were highly correlated across treatments. Fattening rate was also higher at 0\u00a0\u00b0C (+\u00a035%) and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (+\u00a024%) relative to that measured at 15\u00a0\u00b0C and, as expected, was positively correlated with metabolite levels across treatments. However, despite fattening rates similar to that observed at the other temperatures, the relationships were uncoupled at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, implying that the technique may not be easily applicable at temperatures within or close to thermoneutrality. We also found a strong individual effect in the relationships between fattening rate and TRIG levels, suggesting high individual consistency in these parameters in conditions of unrestricted food access such as in captivity. Our study confirms that plasma TRIG and GLY levels can be used as relative indexes of condition and fattening rates in wintering passerines.",

It was constitutively expressed in parasitized host, Plutella xylostella. In vivo transient expression of CpBV-CrV1 significantly impaired hemocyte nodule formation. However, its specific RNA interference significantly recovered the immune response. Two point mutations (Ala\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Pro at 192nd and 196th positions) were designed to remove the main coiled-coil motif of CpBV-CrV1. When CpBV-CrV1 and the mutant CpBV-CrV1 were expressed in Sf9 cells, their proteins were synthesized and secreted into each culture medium. When each culture medium was overlaid on hemocytes of nonparasitized P. xylostella, an immunofluorescence assay showed that CpBV-CrV1 entered the hemocytes, but the mutant protein did not. The entered CpBV-CrV1 significantly inhibited hemocyte-spreading behavior by preventing F-actin formation. These results indicate that CpBV-CrV1 is an immunosuppressive factor of CpBV, in which its coiled-coil motif is essential.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine circulating patterns of the three major adrenal steroids in blood in response to stress during acute restraint handling in two subspecies of white-crowned sparrow. Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) are long distance migrants that breed at high latitudes and Nuttall's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys nuttalli) are residents of coastal California. Column partition chromatography was developed to separate progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and corticosterone from a small plasma sample. Each of these steroids has the capability to modulate the stress response through various mechanisms. For example, progesterone is bound to corticosterone binding globulin (CBG) with a higher affinity than corticosterone. If plasma levels of progesterone rise during acute stress, then this could displace corticosterone from CBG and increase the amount of biologically active, free, corticosterone in blood. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been implicated to have many anti-stress properties with the potential to mitigate some of the actions of corticosterone. Results indicate that progesterone levels in both subspecies are elevated in response to acute stress handling. DHEA levels declined in Gambel's but did not change in Nuttall's. Thus DHEA does not follow the same secretory pattern as in mammals. Corticosterone levels were elevated in response to acute stress handling in both subspecies. This study provides new insight into an integrated stress response among three steroids.",

Apart from effects on growth, proactive behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, the possible negative impacts of maternal testosterone on the immune system are often considered a limitation for its deposition. The effects of maternal testosterone can be modulated by postnatal environmental conditions, such as the availability of food resources. However, the majority of studies considering the effects of maternal testosterone on the immune system have been conducted under optimum conditions. We evaluated the influence of genetic selection for high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone content in Japanese quail on immune responsiveness of offspring to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation under severe protein restriction. Protein restriction negatively influenced body weight and performance in the PHA-test. We observed an increase in Cort (corticosterone) and He/Ly (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) after LPS, while no changes occurred in total IgY levels in the protein-restricted group. HET quails showed higher body mass and total IgY levels and lower He/Ly ratio than LET quails, while the PHA index and Cort concentration did not differ between lines. No interactions were found between protein restriction and genetic line. In conclusion, the immune response was not compromised under conditions of severe protein restriction in the faster growing HET line compared with the LET line. We hypothesise that the immune responsiveness of birds with higher yolk testosterone may be linked with other maternally-derived substances in a context-dependent manner.",

In addition, osmoregulatory and metabolic parameters in plasma corroborated a clear reorganization depending on the stress source/period.

     "abstract": "Many mammals hibernate, which is a profound lethargic state of several weeks or months during winter, that represents a transitory episode of hetherothermy. As with other cases of dormancy, the main benefit of hibernation seems to be energy saving. However, the depth and duration of torpor can be experimentally modified by the composition of food, especially by fattyacid composition. In eutherians, diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids (i.e., fatty acids with at least one double bond) lengthen torpor, reduce metabolism and permit hibernation at lower temperatures. Here we studied whether diets varying in fatty acid composition have an effect on the physiology of hibernation in a South American marsupial, Dromiciops gliroides. We designed a factorial experiment where thermal acclimation (two levels: natural versus constant temperature) was combined with diet acclimation: saturated (i.e., diets with high concentration of saturated fatty acids) versus unsaturated (i.e., diets with high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids). We measured energy metabolism in active and torpid individuals, as well as torpor duration, and a suite of 12 blood biochemical parameters. After a cafeteria test, we found that D. gliroides did not show any preference for a given diet. Also, we did not find effects of diet on body temperature during torpor, or its duration. However, saturated diets, combined with high temperatures provoked a disproportionate increase in fat utilization, leading to body mass reduction. Those animals were more active, and metabolized more fats than those fed with a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (=\u201cunsaturated diets\u201d). These results contrast with previous studies, which showed a significant effect of fatty acid composition of diets on food preferences and torpor patterns in mammals.",

To investigate differences among strains or provenience, we compared one strain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; RBT) and one strain of brown trout (Salmo trutta; BNT) from a common hatchery and one RBT strain from a separate hatchery. In general, trout swum individually or in groups exhibited a decrease in Ucrit as turbidity increased. Both RBT strains were more similar to each other and were impaired to a larger extent in swimming performance than BNT, which was less impacted. For groups, indicators of aerobic metabolism were elevated while those of anaerobic metabolism were depressed. Specifically, citrate synthase activities and glucose levels tended to be greater while plasma lactate and LDH activities were reduced. Lactate and LDH levels in individually swum trout under sediment exposure suggest a greater similarity of fish from the same provenience. We suggest that acute exposures to environmentally relevant turbidities generated by fine suspended sediment may cause a reduced Ucrit, and that these changes may be related to changes in the utilization of aerobic and anaerobic pathways.",

Tapref of single chicks measured in a thermocline (N\u00a0=\u00a016) averaged 33.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b0C (mode, 33.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u00b0C). The same value was obtained in hatchlings studied in pairs. LCT was computed from the ambient temperature (Ta)\u2013 V \u02d9 O 2 relationship, constructed by slowly decreasing the Ta of a respirometer from 38 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C over 2.5\u00a0h, while continuously measuring V \u02d9 O 2 by an open-flow methodology; LCT averaged 36.4\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 or 36.8\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4, depending on the method of computation.

     "publication date": "10-2014",
     "abstract": "The oxygenation enthalpy of the heme groups of hemoglobin (Hb) is inherently exothermic, resulting in decreased Hb-O2 affinity with rising temperature. However, oxygenation is coupled with endothermic dissociation of allosteric effectors (e.g. protons, chloride ions and organic phosphates) from the protein, which reduces the overall oxygenation enthalpy. The evolution of Hbs with reduced temperature sensitivity ostensibly safeguards O2 unloading in cold extremities of regionally-heterothermic vertebrates permitting energy-saving reductions in heat loss. Ungulate (e.g. bovine) Hbs have long served as a model system in this regard in that they exhibit numerically low oxygenation enthalpies that are thought to correlate with the presence of an additional Cl\u2212 binding site (compared to human Hb) comprised of three cationic residues at positions 8, 76 and 77 of the \u03b2-chains of Hb. However, ungulate Hbs also exhibit distinctive amino acid exchanges at the N-termini of the \u03b2-chains that stabilize the low-affinity deoxystructure of the Hb, mimicking the action of organic phosphates. In order to assess the relative contributions from these two effects, we measured the temperature sensitivity of Hb-O2 affinity in bovine and human Hbs in the absence and presence of Cl\u2212 ions under strictly controlled pH conditions. The data indicate that Cl\u2212-binding accounts for a minority (~\u00a030%) of the total reduction in the oxygenation enthalpy manifested in bovine compared to human Hb, whereas the majority of this reduction is ascribable to structural differences, including increased \u03b2-chain hydrophobicity that would increase the heat of oxygenation-linked conformational change in bovine Hb.",

The diel-fluctuating temperature group showed lower CTmin than the 20\u00a0\u00b0C group but a similar CTmax, indicating a wider thermal scope. SDA linearly increased with the temperature. Temperature variation between 20 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C had little effect on either swimming or growth performance. However, fish in the 15\u00a0\u00b0C group exhibited much poorer swimming and growth performance than those in the 20\u00a0\u00b0C group. Ucrit decreased slightly under low acclimation temperature due to the pronounced improvement in swimming efficiency under cold temperature. Fish in the diel-fluctuating temperature group fed more but exhibited similar SGR compared to 20\u00a0\u00b0C group, possibly due in part to an increase in energy expenditure to cope with the temperature fluctuation. The narrower thermal scope and lower CTmax of Chinese bream together with the conservation of CTmax with temperature acclimation, suggests that local water temperature elevations may have more profound effects on Chinese bream than on other fish species in the Three Gorges Reservoir.",

Previous studies that have attempted to relate how cellular processes translate into whole-organism physiology have done so over a range of body masses of subjects. However, the data still remains controversial when observing metabolic rates at the cellular level. To bridge the gap between these ideas, we examined cellular metabolic rate of primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from 49 species of birds representing a 32,000-fold range in body masses to test the hypothesis that metabolic rate of cultured cells scales with body size. We used a Seahorse XF-96 Extracellular flux analyzer to measure cellular respiration in fibroblasts. Additionally, we measured fibroblast size and mitochondrial content. We found no significant correlation between cellular metabolic rate, cell size, or mitochondrial content and body mass. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between cellular basal metabolic rate and proton leak in these cells. We conclude that metabolic rate of cells isolated in culture does not scale with body mass, but cellular metabolic rate is correlated to growth rate in birds.",

Brown mudfish (Neochanna apoda), for example, pseudoaestivate, inhabiting moist soil for months at a time, whereas inanga (Galaxias maculatus) emerse under unfavourable water conditions, but only for periods of a few hours. This study sought to identify the physiological and biochemical strategies that determine emersion tolerance in these species. Nitrogenous waste excretion was measured before and after an experimental emersion period (14\u00a0days for mudfish, 6\u00a0h for inanga). Both species showed significantly elevated ammonia \u201cwashout\u201d upon return to water, but no increase in plasma or muscle ammonia. Post-emersion urea levels were elevated in plasma and muscle in both fish, however the extent of the accumulation did not indicate significant de novo urea production. This was supported by the lack of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase activity in tissues. Consequently, mudfish metabolism was examined to determine whether changes in parameters such as oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide excretion, and/or altered metabolic costs (represented by the key ionoregulatory enzyme Na+, K+-ATPase; NKA) could explain emersion tolerance. Oxygen consumption rates, already very low in immersed mudfish, were largely maintained over the course of emersion. Carbon dioxide excretion decreased during emersion, and a small, but significant, decrease in NKA was noted. These data suggest that the extended emersion capacity of mudfish may result from a generally low metabolic rate that is maintained throughout aerial exposure via cutaneous gas exchange, and which limits the production of potentially toxic nitrogenous waste.",

Our 5-year bio-monitoring study of the Bronx River Estuary demonstrates comparatively low dissolved oxygen concentrations in this urbanized watershed. Additionally, our current results establish altered hormonal levels, resulting from endocrine disruption, in Geukensia demissa (Atlantic ribbed mussel) from the Bronx River Estuary. No studies have yet investigated a correlation between low dissolved oxygen and endocrine disruption in field-collected bivalves. Testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone levels were collected from male and female mussels in the oxygen depleted Bronx River and well-oxygenated Greenwich Cove. Bronx River mussels exhibited higher testosterone levels and lower estradiol levels than Greenwich Cove mussels. The resulting abnormal hormonal ratio seems to indicate that environmental conditions in the Bronx River facilitate an allosteric inhibition of the cytochrome P450 aromatase enzyme, which aids conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Low progesterone levels suggest that Bronx River mussels are experiencing a delay in sexual maturation, and morphometric data show a stalling of shell and tissue growth. To confirm that the mussels collected from both sites are the same species, the universal mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene was analyzed, through DNA barcoding. Minimal sequential heterogeneity confirmed the mussels are the same species.

The expression of genes involved in responses to H2S toxicity (cytochrome c oxidase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and cytochrome P450-2J6), H2S detoxification (sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase), and endogenous H2S production (cystathionine \u03b3 lyase) was determined in both gill and liver tissues by real time PCR. The results indicated complex changes in expression patterns that \u2013 depending on the gene \u2013 not only differed between organs and populations, but also on the type of H2S exposure. Populations differences, both constitutive and H2S exposure dependent (i.e., plastic), in gene expression were particularly evident for sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and to a lesser degree for cytochrome P450-2J6. Our study uncovered putatively adaptive modifications in gene regulation that parallel previously documented adaptive changes in phenotypic traits.",

Their ability to withstand extreme environmental conditions and ease of maintenance has made them popular aquatic research organisms. Scientific advances with most popular model organisms have been assisted with the availability of continuous cell lines; however, cell lines from F. heteroclitus appear to be unavailable. The development of a killifish cell line, KFE-5, derived from the mid trunk region of a late stage embryo is described here. KFE-5 grows well in Leibovitz's L-15 media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). This cell line has been passaged over 60 times in a span of three years, and cells at various passages have been successfully cryopreserved and thawed. The cells are mostly fibroblastic but contain myogenic cells that differentiate into mono-, bi- and multi-nucleated striated myocytes. Immunofluorescence detection of muscle specific antigens such as \u03b1-actinin, desmin, and myosin confirms KFE-5 as a myogenic cell line. KFE-5 has a temperature preference for 26\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C and has been shown to withstand temperatures up to 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The cell line responds to chemical signals including growth factors, hormones and extracellular matrix components. KFE-5 could thus be useful not only for mummichog's thermobiology but also for studies in fish muscle physiology and development.",

The aim of this study was to undertake a comprehensive examination of the physiological and biochemical responses of native (Ruditapes decussatus) and alien-invasive (Ruditapes philippinarum) clams to environmental warming. We evaluated thermal tolerance limits (CTMax), routine metabolic rates (RMRs) and respective thermal sensitivity (Q10 values), critical oxygen partial pressure (Pcrit), heat shock response (HSP70/HSC70 levels), lipid peroxidation (MDA build-up) and antioxidant enzyme [glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)] activities. Contrary to most studies that show that invasive species have a higher thermal tolerance than native congeners, here we revealed that the alien-invasive and native species had similar CTMax values. However, warming had a stronger effect on metabolism and oxidative status of the native R. decussatus, as indicated by the higher RMRs and HSP70/HSC70 and MDA levels, as well as GST, CAT and SOD activities. Moreover, we argue that the alien-invasive clams, instead of up-regulating energetically expensive cellular responses, have evolved a less demanding strategy to cope with short-term environmental (oxidative) stress-pervasive valve closure. Although efficient during stressful short-term periods to ensure isolation and guarantee longer survival, such adaptive behavioural strategy entails metabolic arrest (and the enhancement of anaerobic pathways), which to some extent will not be advantageous under the chronically warming conditions predicted in the future.",

In the present study we analyze the effects of KB-R7943 on the ATP-dependent potassium current (IKATP) recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp in ventricular cardiomyocytes from a mammal (mouse) and a fish (crucian carp). IKATP was induced by external application of a mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) and internal perfusion of the cell with ATP-free pipette solution.

In crucian carp the IKATP is about an order of magnitude more sensitive to KB-R7943 than the background IK1, but in mammals IKATP and IK1 are almost equally sensitive to KB-R7943.

In order to test whether humidity levels affect starvation and heat resistance, we investigated developmental acclimation effects of low to high humidity conditions on the storage and utilization of energy resources, body mass, starvation survival, heat knockdown and heat survival of D. melanogaster. Isofemale lines reared under higher humidity (85% RH) stored significantly higher level of lipids and showed greater starvation survival hours but smaller in body size. In contrast, lines reared at low humidity evidenced reduced levels of body lipids and starvation resistance. Starvation resistance and lipid storage level were higher in females than males. However, the rate of utilization of lipids under starvation stress was lower for lines reared under higher humidity. Adult flies of lines reared at 65% RH and acclimated under high or low humidity condition for 200 hours also showed changes in resistance to starvation and heat but such effects were significantly lower as compared with developmental acclimation. Isofemale lines reared under higher humidity showed greater heat knockdown time and heat-shock survival. These laboratory observations on developmental and adult acclimation effects of low versus high humidity conditions have helped in explaining seasonal changes in resistance to starvation and heat of the wild-caught flies of D. melanogaster. Thus, we may suggest that wet versus drier conditions significantly affect starvation and heat resistance of D. melanogaster.",

However, the multiple myostatin genes found in some fishes may be an exception. In silico promoter analyses of the three putative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) myostatin promoters have failed to identify putative GREs, suggesting a divergence in myostatin function. Therefore, we hypothesized that myostatin mRNA expression is not regulated by glucocorticoids in rainbow trout. In this study, both juvenile rainbow trout and primary trout myoblasts were treated with cortisol to examine the effects on myostatin mRNA expression. Results suggest that exogenous cortisol does not regulate myostatin-1a and -1b expression in vivo, as myostatin mRNA levels were not significantly affected by cortisol treatment in either red or white muscle tissue. In red muscle, myostatin-2a levels were significantly elevated in the cortisol treatment group relative to the control, but not the vehicle control, at both 12\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h post-injection. As such, it is unclear if cortisol was acting alone or in combination with the vehicle. Cortisol increased myostatin-1b expression in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Further work is needed to determine if this response is the direct result of cortisol acting on the myostatin-1b promoter or through an alternative mechanism. These results suggest that regulation of myostatin by cortisol may not be as highly conserved as previously thought and support previous work that describes potential functional divergence of the multiple myostatin genes in fishes.",

     "abstract": "Tropical regions are expected to be some of the most affected by rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) because seasonal temperature variations are minimal. As temperatures rise, less oxygen dissolves in water, but metabolic requirements of fish and thus, the demand for effective oxygen uptake, increase. Gill remodelling is an acclimation strategy well documented in freshwater cyprinids experiencing large seasonal variations in temperature and oxygen as well as an amphibious killifish upon air exposure. However, no study has investigated whether tropical reef fishes remodel their gills to allow for increased oxygen demands at elevated temperatures. We tested for gill remodelling in five coral reef species (Acanthochromis polyacanthus, Chromis atripectoralis, Pomacentrus moluccensis, Dascyllus melanurus and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus) from populations in northern Papua New Guinea (2\u00b0 35.765\u2032 S; 150\u00b0 46.193\u2032 E).

We measured lamellar perimeter, cross-sectional area, base thickness, and length for five filaments on the 2nd gill arches and qualitatively assessed 3rd gill arches via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All species exhibited significant differences in the quantitative measurements made on the lamellae, but no consistent trends with temperature were observed. SEM only revealed alterations in gill morphology in P. moluccensis. The overall lack of changes in gill morphology with increasing temperature suggests that these near-equatorial reef fishes may fail to maintain adequate O2 uptake under future climate scenarios unless other adaptive mechanisms are employed.",

Six different diets were formulated and fish were classified into two experimental groups sharing one diet. In the first group (LS), fish were fed four diets where lipids were reduced (23%\u201317%) by increasing carbohydrates (12%\u201328%) and, the second group (SF) consisted on three diets where the amount of carbohydrates (28%\u201311%) was exchanged at expenses of fiber (1%\u201318%). Differences in growth were not observed; nevertheless, the hepatosomatic index was positively related to dietary starch levels, apparently not due to enhanced hepatic lipogenesis, partly supported by unchanged G6PDH expression. In the LS group, lipogenic activity of adipose tissue was stimulated with low-lipid/high-carbohydrate diets by up-regulating G6PDH expression and a tendency to increase FAS, and promoted carbohydrate utilization versus fatty acid oxidation by modulating the transcription factors LXR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b2 expression. In the SF group, PPARs and LXR\u03b1 increased parallel to fiber levels in adipose tissue. Furthermore, an adaptation of hepatic GK to dietary starch inclusion was observed in both groups; however, the lack of effects on G6Pase expression indicated that gluconeogenesis was not nutritionally regulated under the conditions examined. Overall, metabolic adaptations directed to an efficient use of dietary carbohydrates are present in gilthead sea bream, supporting the possibility of increasing carbohydrate or fiber content in diets for aquaculture sustainability.",

We found that ducklings reared at thermoneutrality displayed a capacity for non-shivering thermogenesis during the first month of post-hatching life.

Thus, further work is needed to clarify the relative costs of different components of the immune system and the role of environmental and life-history traits in modulating the costs of resistance. Within the components of immunity, inflammation is considered to be associated with a larger energetic expenditure. Here, we evaluated the energetic cost of the inflammatory response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in a wild population of a subterranean rodent, Ctenomys talarum, and the trade-offs between immune activity and reproduction. C. talarum develops an inflammatory response to PHA, but contrary to our predictions, this response was not associated with an increase in oxygen consumption regardless of reproductive status or sex. Our study shows that an immune challenge may not always result in a detectable energetic cost. We discuss the possibility that other currencies could be underlying the cost, such as micro-or macronutrients requirements, autoimmunity or oxidative stress.",

We hypothesized that 1) the two species would differ in concentrations of metals important in melanin synthesis (Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn), 2) differences in metal concentration levels would be related to feather coloration. Our study confirmed the first prediction and provides the first evidence that selected elements may play a greater role in pheomelanin than in eumelanin synthesis. Concentrations of three elements considered as important in melanin synthesis (Ca, Fe, Zn) were 52% to 93% higher in rusty colored Common Redstart feathers compared to the dark gray Blackcap feathers. However, element concentrations were not correlated with feather coloration or sex in either species. Our study suggests that, of the two melanin forms, pheomelanin synthesis may bear higher costs associated with the acquisition of specific elements or limited elements may create trade-offs between ornamentation and other physiological functions. Our findings warrant further investigations designed to better understand the roles of macro- and microelements in the synthesis of both forms of melanin.",

Ovarian developmental stages from vitellogenesis up to ovulation were associated with increasing day length and water temperatures below 21\u00a0\u00b0C (winter and beginning of spring). Gonadal regression was observed when water temperature exceeded this value or when photoperiod decreased. Most females were arrested at primary growth stage during summer (high temperature) or at cortical alveoli stage between autumn and beginning of winter (short photoperiod). Plasma E2 and transcript levels of fshr, cyp19a1b and cyp19a1a increased during vitellogenesis, while fshb remained high at all vitellogenic stages. A significant correlation between plasma sex steroids (T and E2) and cyp19a1b as well as lhcgr transcript levels was observed during vitellogenesis, suggesting a steroid positive feedback. Gnrh-I, Gth subunits and lhcgr transcript levels increased significantly during late vitellogenesis and final maturation. Present results suggest that pejerrey vitellogenesis is controlled by Fsh/Fshr, stimulating gonadal aromatase and estradiol synthesis. Moreover, the increase of testosterone and estradiol during final vitellogenesis could induce coordinately the functioning of the Gnrh/Lh system (perhaps through brain P450 aromatase stimulation and brain estradiol increase) and the gonadal Lhcgr synthesis to promote the final maturation of oocytes. All these stimulation mechanisms of gonadal development would be possible only under permissive environmental conditions.",

Included in the suite of physiological processes affected is gut motility, with below optimum temperatures generally resulting in slow gut passage. Trachylepis margaritifer (rainbow skink) however presents an unusual pattern whereby gut passage time decreases at a low temperature compared to when at an intermediate temperature. It has been suggested that this may be a \u2018cutting-your-losses\u2019 response whereby nutritional gain is sacrificed by voiding the digesta to reduce the risk of these rotting within the gut at these low temperatures, and if this is so, it should result in reduced digestive performance at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. We tested this hypothesis by measuring appetite, apparent digestive efficiency (ADE) and apparent assimilation efficiency (AAE) in T. margaritifer. We found that although temperature significantly affected appetite and gut passage time, it did not affect digestive efficiency. Both ADE (>\u00a090%) and AAE (>\u00a080%) were high and temperature-independent across the range tested. Thus, the \u2018cutting-your-losses\u2019 hypothesis does not explain faster gut passage at 25\u00a0\u00b0C.

Cell bioenergetics were assessed by flux analysis of oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Under control conditions, DF-1 cells had higher OCR associated with ATP synthase activity and mitochondrial oxygen reserve capacity as well as lower OCR due to proton leak and non-mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. In response to 4-HNE (0 to 30\u00a0\u03bcM), DF-1 cells were more sensitive to oxidant challenge than both young (passage 8) and senescent (passage 19) pCEF1\u00b0 cells. Both passages 8 and 19 pCEF1\u00b0 cells exhibited higher proton leak in response to 4-HNE, but this was not observed in DF-1 cells. Inducible proton leak occurs by 4-HNE stimulated activation of uncoupling protein (UCP) and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). From mRNA expression data indicated that ANT and avian UCP were down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, in DF-1 compared to pCEF1\u00b0 cells. Thus, we hypothesize that DF-1 cells are unable to increase proton leak due to lower expression of ANT, but not avian UCP, and this inability to increase proton leak contributes to greater susceptibility to oxidative stress of DF-1 cells compared to pCEF1\u00b0 cells.",

These species are widely distributed throughout the Western Palearctic region and coexist in the stream where individuals for this study come from. We highlight the physiological strategies of these two different predator species of stoneflies, showing a higher accumulation of lipid reserves in P. bipunctata, higher glucose levels in the body tissues of D. cephalotes and a higher capacity of the antioxidant enzymes in P. bipunctata, what provides it a protection against oxidation of lipids, which are greater in this species. This leads to a similar oxidative state in both species. Based on these results is discussed how two close related species developing a very similar ecological role in the same habitat can achieve a similar fitness with differences in their physiological strategies.",

The objectives of the present work were to describe and compare the respiratory responses to combined heat and hypoxia in two bivalve species (Pecten maximus and Mytilus spp.) living in two contrasted coastal habitats (subtidal and intertidal, respectively). Results were consistent with the vertical zonation of both species. Mytilus spp. seemed to cope better with a temperature increase than P. maximus, which was found to be outside of its optimal thermal window at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Concerning respiratory responses to hypoxia at a given temperature, P. maximus displayed greater oxyregulation capacity that was maintained over a larger range of O2 levels, as compared to Mytilus spp. When acclimation temperatures increased, both species showed a decrease in their oxyregulation capacities alongside a reduction in aerobic performance, especially in P. maximus. The comparison between species suggests that subtidal species, such as P. maximus, might be more vulnerable to a combination of heat and hypoxia than intertidal species, such as Mytilus spp. Lastly, this study highlighted the utility of segmented linear models to estimate PcO2 and regulation percentages in marine organisms exposed to hypoxia.",

In addition, we exposed birds to thermoneutral (control) and severe cold exposure treatments to determine whether acute cold exposure influenced fuel storage, mobilization or transport. Carcass lipid mass and pectoralis intramuscular lipid did not vary significantly between seasons or temperature treatments for any of the study species. Muscle glycogen varied significantly seasonally only for chickadee supracoracoideus and leg muscles, and did not vary among warm or cold treatments for any species. Pectoralis fatty acid binding protein (FABPc) was significantly elevated in winter for chickadees and nuthatches, but not for sparrows. Plasma metabolites showed little consistent variation in response to season or acute cold exposure.

Furthermore, few studies compare stress indices between captive and wild populations, to assess potential alteration of stress physiology in captivity. To address these issues, we examined corticosterone (CORT) and heterophil to lymphocyte (H:L) ratios in two ecotypes of the garter snake Thamnophis elegans. We found that CORT and H:L ratios were not correlated within individuals, and both variables showed little or no repeatability over a period of months. CORT levels, but not H:L ratios, were higher for individuals sampled after 10\u00a0min from the time of capture. However, both variables showed similar patterns of ecotypic variation, and both increased over time in gravid females maintained in captivity for four months.

We assessed the magnitude of a PHA-triggered immune response and the associated energetic costs in 60-day old Ctenomys talarum. We expected that the magnitude of the macroscopic inflammatory response to PHA is lower in young tuco-tucos compared with that of adults, given the allocation of substantial energy to growth, and that the magnitude of the inflammation is lower in male pups compared to females, due to the higher investment in growth of the larger sex. Concomitantly, we expected that the pups challenged with PHA show an increase in oxygen consumption compared to control animals and that a positive association exists between magnitude of the PHA-induced inflammation and oxygen consumption. Contrary to what was expected, young tuco-tucos mounted a higher inflammatory response compared with adults and there were no differences in the magnitude of this response between sexes. The inflammatory response induced by a PHA injection did not represent a significant energetic cost for young tuco-tucos. There were no differences in oxygen consumption between PHA-injected and control animals, and tuco-tucos that mounted a higher inflammatory response to PHA did not show higher oxygen consumption. Energy expenditure, however, is not the only physiological cost involved in trade-offs between immune response and various functions of the organism, and other currencies are discussed.",

Co-immunolocalization with mitochondrial Complex IV demonstrated, for the first time in shark gills, that both NKA- and VHA-rich cells are also MR cells, and that all MR cells are either NKA- or VHA-rich cells. Additionally we localized the anion exchanger pendrin to VHA-rich cells, but not NKA-rich cells. In starved sharks, VHA was localized throughout the cell cytoplasm and pendrin was present at the apical pole (but not in the membrane). However, in a significant number of gill cells from fed leopard sharks, VHA translocated to the basolateral membrane (as previously described in dogfish), and pendrin translocated to the apical membrane.

To this end cDNA fragments encoding genes for cytosolic and mitochondrial alanine aminotransferase (cALT; mALT), pyruvate kinase (PK), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) were cloned and sequenced. Measurement of mRNA levels through quantitative real-time PCR performed in livers of fasted seabass revealed a significant increase in cALT (8.5-fold induction) while promoting a drastic 45-fold down-regulation of PK in relation to the levels found in fed seabass. These observations were corroborated by enzyme activity meaning that during food deprivation an increase in the capacity of pyruvate generation happened via alanine to offset the reduction in pyruvate derived via glycolysis. After a 3-day refeeding period cALT returned to control levels while PK was not able to rebound. No alterations were detected in the expression levels of G6PDH while 6PGDH was revealed to be more sensitive specially to fasting, as confirmed by a significant 5.7-fold decrease in mRNA levels with no recovery after refeeding. Our results indicate that in early stages of refeeding, the liver prioritized the restoration of systemic normoglycemia and replenishment of hepatic glycogen. In a later stage, once regular feeding is re-established, dietary fuel may then be channeled to glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis.",

We investigated the response of these two sea urchin groups to reduced seawater pH with the tropical cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides, the sympatric euechinoid Tripneustes ventricosus and the temperate euechinoid Paracentrotus lividus. Both euechinoid showed a compensation of the coelomic fluid pH due to increased buffer capacity. This was linked to an increased concentration of DIC in the coelomic fluid and thus of bicarbonate ions (most probably originating from the surrounding seawater as isotopic signature of the carbon \u2013 \u03b413C \u2013 was similar). On the other hand, the cidaroid showed no changes within the coelomic fluid.

Feeding rate was not affected in any species. While euechinoids are able to regulate their extracellular acid\u2013base balance, many questions are still unanswered on the costs of this capacity. On the contrary, cidaroids do not seem affected by a reduced seawater pH.

Modern insects vary in body mass by over 6 orders of magnitude, but are small by comparison to many other metazoan taxa. The small size of modern insects may reflect limitations imposed by their open respiratory systems which rely, in part, on diffusion. Diffusion rates decline with distance such that, absent compensation, the capacity for larger insects to deliver oxygen to their tissues may be compromised. To compensate, larger grasshoppers, beetles, and bumblebees devote proportionally more of their body volume to the respiratory system, as demonstrated by hypermetric scaling of tracheal volume with body mass>\u00a01. Among bumblebee sisters, total respiratory volume scaled with mass2.6, but it is unclear at what level or levels of the tracheal system (main tracheal trunks, air sacs, tracheoles) bumblebees express this extreme hypermetry. Here we use transmission electron microscopy to examine the morphology of tracheoles in bumblebee flight muscle among sister bumblebees varying nearly four-fold in body mass. Neither tracheole density nor tracheole diameter changed with body mass. The total cross-sectional area of tracheoles was also invariant with body mass. Together, these results reveal that bumblebees do not compensate for size-related limitations on oxygen delivery by increasing investment at the level of the tracheoles.",

As pulmonated animals, oxygen privation experienced during submergence represents a considerable challenge both physiologically and biochemically. Routine exposure to hypoxia and the rapid transitions between ischemia/reperfusion of tissues leads to extremely high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which must be opposed by antioxidant defenses to avoid oxidative stress. The diving behaviors and capabilities of pinnipeds are very diverse, resulting in distinct metabolic responses among species. To assess whether these characteristics reflect the antioxidant status of two marine diving mammals with distinct diving capacities, oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in the blood of Arctocephalus australis (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and Mirounga leonina (n\u00a0=\u00a012). All of the biomarkers analyzed in M. leonina were significantly higher than those of A. australis, suggesting that higher antioxidant content is needed to counteract the high ROS production associated with the long submergence times (24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0min) of this species, which are nearly ten times greater than those of A. australis (2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0min).

We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate DNA methyltransferases to determine the number and similarity of DNMT found in Atlantic cod. This analysis revealed that Atlantic cod have one maintenance dnmt (dnmt1) and five de novo DNMTs (dnmt4, dnmt3, dnmt3b, dnmt3aa, dnmt3ab). Stage specific changes in expression levels occurred for all genes analyzed. The effect of acute thermal stress was evaluated during early development. Compared to controls these experiments showed significant alterations in expression levels of several genes, that in some instances were reversed at later stages of development. A significant effect of continuous thermal stress was found in gastrula embryos where lower mRNA expression levels of 1-C metabolism, de novo DNMTs and cell proliferation genes were detected. One exception was the maintenance DNMT, which was only sensitive to acute and not continuous thermal stress. DNA methylation status indicated that blastula embryos were hypomethylated compared to spermatozoa and late gastrula stages. In post-gastrula stage, however, continuous thermal stress resulted in a higher degree of DNA methylation compared to controls. These data reveal that the regulation of epigenetically important transcripts in the 1-C metabolism of Atlantic cod embryos is sensitive to thermal stress.",

Tuco-tuco's pups display an altricial development, spending more than 80% of the time in contact with the mother.

Here, we promote cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Cichlidae) as a system in which to study the physiological and evolutionary significance of carotenoids. Cichlids include some of the best examples of adaptive radiation and color pattern diversification in vertebrates. In this paper, we examine fitness correlates of carotenoid pigmentation in cichlids and review hypotheses regarding the signal content of carotenoid-based ornaments. Carotenoid-based coloration is influenced by diet and body condition and is positively related to mating success and social dominance. Gaps in our knowledge are discussed in the last part of this review, particularly in the understanding of carotenoid metabolism pathways and the genetics of carotenoid coloration.

The present study aimed to evaluate the chronic immune response induced by repeated emersions and the possible impact of domestication by comparing farmed Eurasian perch with short (F1) and long (F4) captive-life history. In the first experiment, fish were exposed to a single emersion and physiological stress response was measured in the short term to characterize fish sensitivity to the tested stressor. Serum cortisol and glucose elevated within 6\u00a0h post-stress and splenosomatic index (SSI) decreased within 48\u00a0h, indicating that the species was affected by emersion stressor. In the second experiment, F1 and F4 generations were submitted to repeated water emersions (3 times/week during 44\u00a0days). On day 9, 18 and 44, samplings were performed 48\u00a0h post-stressor to highlight any sustained disruption of immune system. Serum cortisol, glucose, SSI and lysozyme activity were evaluated and serum proteome was analyzed using 2D-DIGE. Any of the tested variables were affected by repeated emersions and proteomic analysis only revealed that alpha-2 macroglobulins (a2Ms) were up-regulated in the serum of stressed individuals. Domestication also resulted in the up-regulation of five a2M isoforms and down-regulation of complement C3 and Ig light chain proteins, independently of any stressor exposure. In conclusion, the results suggested that repeated emersions are not severe stressors for Eurasian perch, probably explaining why domestication had no influence on fish responses. Changes associated with domestication are highly complex and certainly need further investigations.",

We evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial membrane potential, and aerobic fiber area of the locomotor muscle after different periods of hypoxia (1, 4, or 10\u00a0h) followed by 30 or 120\u00a0min of reoxygenation. Additionally, changes in cell volume, mitochondrial dysfunction, and infiltration of hemocytes were evaluated after hypoxia and a subsequent 2, 24, or 48\u00a0h of reoxygenation. After hypoxia, neither ROS nor LPO increased. However, mitochondrial membrane potential and aerobic fiber area decreased in a time-dependent manner. After reoxygenation, the ROS and LPO levels increased and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, but these quickly recovered in crabs exposed to 4\u00a0h of hypoxia. On the other hand, alterations of mitochondria resulted in morphological changes in aerobic fibers, which required more time to recover during reoxygenation after 10\u00a0h of hypoxia. The locomotor muscles of the crab N. granulata suffer damage after hypoxia and reoxygenation. The intensity of this damage is dependent on the duration of hypoxia. In all experimental situations analyzed, the locomotor muscle of this crab was capable of recovery.",

     "abstract": "Ecdysteroids initiate signaling along multiple pathways that regulate various aspects of development, maturation, and reproduction in arthropods. This study was carried out to seek the late target genes of ecdysteroid signaling from different tissues of the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. In the present study, eight isoforms of ecdysteroid receptor (EcR), two isoforms of retinoic acid X receptor (RXR), and one homolog of E75 were characterized from L. vannamei. The overall protein sequences and specific functional sites of EcR, RXR and E75 among crustacean species were found highly conserved. Tissue-specific, development stage-specific, and molt stage-specific expression patterns of LvEcR, LvRXR, and LvE75 were detected by qPCR. Double stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of any one of the three genes LvEcR, LvRXR and LvE75 caused specific expression changes of the other two, and resulted in corresponding expression changes of two molting related genes Cathepsin-L (LvCHSL) and Hemocyanin (LvHCyn) in the hepatopancreas, two chitin metabolism related genes chitin synthase (LvChS) and chitinase isoenzyme (LvChi2) in the epidermis, and two muscle growth related genes LvActin and myosin heavy chain (LvMHC) in the muscle. In correspondence, after in vivo injections of 20 hydroxyecdysone, specific expression changes of LvEcR, LvRXR, LvE75, LvCHSL and LvHCyn in the hepatopancreas, LvEcR, LvRXR, LvE75, LvChS and LvChi2 in the epidermis, and LvEcR, LvRXR, LvE75, LvActin and LvMHC in the muscle were also observed, respectively. Results in our study indicate multiple functions of ecdysteroids signaling in L. vannamei and the function may be time- and space-specific; ecdysteroids may act through different pathways via its functional receptor heterodimer EcR\u2013RXR and the early responsive gene E75 to perform specific regulation roles on the target genes in different shrimp tissues; LvCHSL and LvHCyn in the hepatopancreas, LvChS and LvChi2 in the epidermis, and LvActin and LvMHC in the muscle are potential targets for ecdysteroid control.

The ability of melatonin to enhance reproductive capacity (fecundity, embryo survival and hatching rate) inducing the transcriptional activity of gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh), luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr) and melatonin receptor (mtnr) was investigated in adult females. Moreover, the melatonin-mediated enhancement of killifish sperm motility and velocity was found consistent with higher fecundity of melatonin-exposed fishes. As a further extent, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy evidenced a reduction of lipid unsaturation level on isolated spermatozoa from treated males. Moreover, the reduction of mtnr gene expression during embryo development and lower biometric parameters documented in the larvae from melatonin-exposed parents suggest that melatonin acts as a hormonal mediator able to transfer the environmental signal to oocytes and then to embryos as inheritance of adaptive environmental changes. These results support the positive role of melatonin on killifish reproduction and its role as a maternal factor on embryo and larval development.",

Three stocks migrating from spawning rivers to either lake (landlocked stock), brackish water or full strength sea water were grown under common garden conditions, and gill lipids and their acyl and alkenyl chains were examined in February (presmolts) and at the end of May (smolts) by mass spectrometry and gas\u2013liquid chromatography. The most remarkable changes upon transition from the presmolt phase to the smolt phase were: (i) increase in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio, (ii) decrease in the abundance of phosphatidylinositol (PI) content, (iii) increase in the amount of sulfatides, (iv) increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species with two highly unsaturated acyl chains, and finally (v) convergence of interstock differences in PC and PE species composition towards a similar lipid composition. Increases in the gill membrane content of cholesterol and sulfatides are discussed as pre-adaptation of salmon gills for salt-secretion, which may occur by increases in membrane microdomains (rafts) harboring ion channels and pumps. The decreases of PI were likely related to adjusting the gill membrane permeability to ions by diminishing prostanoid production. The similarity of those changes among three salmon stocks and the convergence of initially (presmolt phase) different PC and PE species profiles between the stocks towards similar lipid composition suggests that smoltification process of the gill epithelium is largely similar in anadromous and landlocked populations.",

Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that King George whiting (KGW) Sillaginodes punctata approaching sexual maturity exhibits a decrease in HSP production and that exposure to high temperatures provokes HSP production in juvenile whiting. Both adult and juvenile whiting expressed significant increases in HSP69 in response to temperature shocks of 24, 26, 28 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Juvenile whiting had significantly higher HSP69 than adults and expressed more HSP69 at 24 and 26\u00a0\u00b0C. No mortalities were observed in juvenile fish at 30\u00a0\u00b0C while 50% of adults suffered mortality at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Following exposure of juveniles to 24, 26 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C, HSP69 was measured at 24, 96 and 168\u00a0h. HSP69 peaked at 96\u00a0h and returned to the 24\u00a0h level after 168\u00a0h exposure. This study indicates that juveniles can cope with high temperatures better than adults, which offers a partial explanation to fish movement patterns in nature where younger fish inhabit near shore waters and then migrate to deep water towards maturation. Further, this work implies that KGW growth and recruitment can be affected by increasing temperatures due to global warming.",

Several environmental stressors vary geographically and thus organisms inhabiting different sites face different oxidant environments.

To accomplish this, antioxidant enzymatic activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, DT-diaphorase) and lipid peroxidation were assayed in tissue samples from the lizards' tail. Lipid peroxidation was higher in individuals from lowlands than from highlands, indicating higher oxidative stress in lowland lizards. These results suggest that environmental conditions are less oxidant at high elevations with respect to low ones. Therefore, our study shows that oxidative stress varies geographically, which should have important consequences for our understanding of geographic variation in physiology and life-history of organisms.",

A study was designed to investigate glucose regulation and pancreas physiology at selection age in LWS chickens and HWS chickens. Oral glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests revealed differences in threshold sensitivity to insulin and glucose clearance rate between the lines. Results from real-time PCR showed greater pancreatic mRNA expression of four glucose regulatory genes (preproinsulin, PPI; preproglucagon, PPG; glucose transporter 2, GLUT2; and pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1, Pdx1) in LWS chickens, than HWS chickens. Histological analysis of the pancreas revealed that HWS chickens have larger pancreatic islets, less pancreatic islet mass, and more pancreatic inflammation than LWS chickens, all of which presumably contribute to impaired glucose metabolism.",

The marine medaka AQP cDNAs encode polypeptides of 259\u2013298 amino acids, respectively. Topology predictions showed six transmembrane domains, five connecting loops, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains, all of which is conserved among AQP molecules. Although asparagine\u2013proline\u2013alanine (NPA) motifs are highly conserved in most odAQP isoforms, several AQPs revealed variant types of motifs such as asparagine\u2013proline\u2013proline (NPP), asparagine\u2013proline\u2013valine (NPV) or/and asparagine\u2013proline\u2013serine (NPS) motifs. The phylogenic analysis showed that marine medaka AQPs had closet relationship with Japanese ricefish (medaka; Oryzias latipes) counterparts. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses showed that marine medaka AQP transcripts would be expressed in not only osmoregulatory tissues but also nonosmoregulatory tissues, and also that the expression levels of certain AQP isoforms in nonosmoregulatory tissues were readily comparable or even higher than those in typically known osmoregulatory organs. Although the overall tissue distribution patterns of AQPs were not significantly different between 0- and 30-ppt acclimated fish, the expression levels under different salinities were largely variable among isoforms and tissues. This is the first report to investigate tissue expression profiles of teleostean AQPs 11 and 12 during the long-term acclimation to freshwater and salted water.",

The acute response of North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) to lowered salinity was tested by exposing sharks to 21\u2030 salinity for 48\u00a0h. Temporal trends in blood pH, plasma osmolality, CO2, HCO3\u2212, Na+, Cl\u2212, K+, and urea concentrations, and in the rates of urea efflux and O2 consumption, were quantified. The rate of O2 consumption exhibited cyclic variation and was significantly depressed by lowered salinity. After 9\u00a0h, plasma [Cl\u2212] stabilized at 9% below initial levels, while plasma [Na+] decreased by more than 20% within the first 12\u00a0h. Plasma [urea] dropped by 15% between 4 and 6\u00a0h, and continued to decrease. The rate of urea efflux increased over time, peaking after 36\u00a0h at 72% above the initial rate. Free-swimming sharks subjected to the same salinity challenge survived over 96\u00a0h and differed from cannulated sharks with respect to patterns of Na+ and urea homeostasis. This high-resolution study reveals that dogfish exposed to 21\u2030 salinity can maintain homeostasis of Cl\u2212 and pH, but Na+ and urea continue to be lost, likely accounting for the inability of the dogfish to fully acclimate to reduced salinity.",

Both adenosine and ATP markedly decreased contractility in atria from all three species. This was attenuated by theophylline, suggesting that the response is mediated by P1 receptors. Ventricles were less sensitive, although high concentrations of the adenyl compounds evoked decreases in contractility.

Thus, one might question whether fibroblasts are a representative model system to portray the metabolic profile of the whole organism, as compared with cells isolated from other tissues, like muscle, brain or kidneys. To explore whether fibroblasts have the same metabolic profile as do myoblast cells, we cultured cells from day-old chicks of quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) selected for fast-growth or normal growth (our control group). Our results suggest that isolated primary fibroblasts and myoblast cells had higher rates of glycolysis, oxygen consumption and more mitochondria in the fast-growing line than in the control line. Our findings lend support for the idea that fibroblasts are a representative cell system to characterize the whole organism metabolic signature at the cellular-level.

No clear relationship in circulating PNP or XO activity could be established between marine, semiaquatic and terrestrial mammals. Erythrocytes from bottlenose dolphins and humans are highly permeable to nucleosides and glucose, intraerythrocyte PNP activity may be related to a release of purine nucleotides from the liver. High-energy costs will probably mean a higher ATP degradation rate in river otters, as compared to northern elephant seals or dolphins. Lower erythrocyte PNP activity and elevated plasma XO activity in northern elephant seal could be associated with fasting and/or sleep- and dive-associated apneas.",

     "abstract": "In the last few decades, attention has been focused on the impacts of contamination in marine benthic populations, while the responses of aquatic organisms to natural alterations, namely changes in salinity, have received little attention. In fact, salinity is one of the dominant environmental factors affecting marine bivalves. The ebb and flood of the tide, combined with fresh water inputs from rivers or heavy rainy events, and with extremely dry and hot seasons, can dramatically alter water salinity. Therefore, the salinity of a certain environment can restrict the spatial distribution of a given population, which is especially important when assessing the spread of an invasive species into a new environment. In the present study, the main objective was to understand how clam Venerupis philippinarum copes with salinity changes and, hence biochemical and metabolomic alterations, taking place in individuals submitted to a wide range of salinities were investigated. The results showed that V. philippinarum presented high mortality at lower salinities (0 and 7\u00a0g/L) but tolerated high salinities (35 and 42\u00a0g/L). The quantification of ionic content revealed that, clams had the capacity to maintain ionic homeostasis along the salinity gradient, mainly changing the concentration of Na, but also with the influence of Mg and Ca. The results showed a decrease in protein content at lower salinities (0 to 21\u00a0g/L). Glycogen and glucose increased with increasing salinity gradient. 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of clam aqueous extracts revealed different metabolite profiles at 7, 28 and 42\u00a0g/L salinities, thus enabling metabolite changes to be measured in relation to salinity.",

Viviparous reptiles utilise both a yolk and a placenta to support their developing embryos, but it has not yet been confirmed whether yolk is a source of maternal T and E2 in such species. We investigated this question using the viviparous lizard Niveoscincus metallicus as our model species.

Rather, we found no statistically significant decline in yolk concentrations of both T and E2 post-ovulation.

     "abstract": "Esophageal desalination is a crucial step in the gastrointestinal water absorption pathway, as this pre-intestinal processing establishes the osmotic conditions necessary for water absorption. Previous work has shown that esophageal Na+ absorption is amiloride sensitive; however, it is as yet unclear if Na+, H+ exchangers (NHE) or Na+ channels (ENaC) are responsible. The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate the roles that NHE isoforms may play in this process in a marine teleost, the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta), as well as what role NHE isoforms may play in the downstream intestinal Na+ transport. A combination of symmetrical current clamp and asymmetrical voltage clamp experiments showed the esophagus to contain both an ion absorptive current (Isc\u00a0=\u00a00.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.68) and serosal side negative transepithelial potential (TEP\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a04.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6). 22Na uptake (JNam\u00a0\u2192\u00a0s) was inhibited by 0.5\u00a0mM EIPA, with no effect of 0.1\u00a0mM amiloride, 1\u00a0mM furosemide or 1\u00a0mM thiazide. A Cl\u2212 free saline reduced JNam\u00a0\u2192\u00a0s by 40% while also reducing conductance and reversing TEP. These results suggest that both transcellular and paracellular components contribute to esophageal Na+ transport, with transcellular transport mediated by NHE. The NHE1, NHE2 and NHE3 genes were amplified and tissue distribution analysis by real-time PCR showed high NHE2 expression levels in the esophagus and stomach. Little NHE3 expression was observed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and NHE2 expression was absent from the intestine. Hypersalinity (60\u00a0ppt) had no effect on the expression profile of NHE2, slc4a2, scl26a6, CAc or V-type ATPase (\u03b2-subunit), suggesting that esophageal desalination is less flexible in response to osmotic stress than the intestine.",

Kynurenic acid, an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors, significantly reduced resting normoxic heart rate but did not block the bradycardia associated with aquatic hypoxia. Kainic acid (an excitotoxic glutamatergic receptor agonist) also significantly reduced normoxic heart rate, but blocked the hypoxia-induced bradycardia. Neither kynurenic acid nor kainic acid microinjections affected blood pressure in normoxia or hypoxia. The results of this study indicate that glutamatergic receptors in the nGV are involved in the maintenance of resting heart rate and the destruction of these neurons with kainic acid abolishes the bradycardia associated with aquatic hypoxia.",

Dietary live yeast represents a prominent source of proteins and amino acids for laboratory-reared drosophilids. In this study, Drosophila melanogaster adults were fed on diets supplemented or not with live yeast. We hypothesized that manipulating nutritional conditions through live yeast supplementation would translate into altered physiology and stress tolerance. We verified how live yeast supplementation affected body mass characteristics, total lipids and proteins, metabolic profiles and cold tolerance (acute and chronic stress). Females fed with live yeast had increased body mass and contained more lipids and proteins. Using GC/MS profiling, we found distinct metabolic fingerprints according to nutritional conditions. Metabolite pathway enrichment analysis corroborated that live yeast supplementation was associated with amino acid and protein biosyntheses. The cold assays revealed that the presence of dietary live yeast greatly promoted cold tolerance. Hence, this study conclusively demonstrates a significant interaction between nutritional conditions and thermal tolerance.",

We hypothesized that the pseudobranch of the milkfish might exhibit osmoregulatory ability similar to that of the gills. In this study, the obtained Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and protein abundance profiles showed that these parameters were higher in the pseudobranchs of the seawater (SW)- than the freshwater (FW)-acclimated milkfish, opposite the situation in the gills. The pseudobranch of the milkfish contained two types of NKA-immunoreactive cells, chloride cells (CCs) and pseudobranch-type cells (PSCs). To further clarify the roles of CCs and PSCs in the pseudobranch, we investigated the distributions of two ion transporters: the Na+, K+, 2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). NKCC on the basolateral membrane and CFTR on the apical membrane were found only in pseudobranchial CCs of SW-acclimated individuals. Taken together, the results distinguished NKA-IR CCs and PSCs in the pseudobranch of milkfish using antibodies against NKCC and CFTR as markers. In addition, increases in the numbers and sizes of CCs as well as in NKA expression observed upon salinity challenge indicated the potential roles of pseudobranchs in hypo-osmoregulation in this euryhaline teleost.",

     "abstract": "In fish, vitamins are part of the first line of the antioxidant defense, they are directly related to stress and disease, and they are involved in the maintenance of various physiological processes and metabolic reactions. In general, fish are unable to synthesize vitamin C due to a deficiency in gulonolactone oxidase (GLO), the enzyme responsible for its de novo synthesis. Vitamin E is involved in the immune response and perhaps one of its main physiological functions is to protect membranes from oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation) associated with free radical production. In fish muscle, vitamin E has an important role as an antioxidant in vivo and its content is highly related to the stability of lipids and fats. The aim of this study was to determine the content of vitamins C and E in muscle from different species of elasmobranch and teleost fishes. The concentrations of vitamins C and E were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of vitamin C found for the group of elasmobranchs was lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) than that for teleosts. For Mustelus henlei vitamin C was found in only one individual; in Tetrapturus audax and Totoaba macdonaldi vitamin C concentration was below the detection limit. The concentration of vitamin E was lower in the group of elasmobranchs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared with that of teleosts. The main differences in the antioxidant system between teleosts and elasmobranchs appear to be the specific type and levels of antioxidant compounds, as well as the synergistic interactions among the antioxidants present in their tissues.",

To ascertain the involvement of these glands and their secretion in predator deterrence, it was tested against a predatory fish, Clarias gariepinus, using a paired choice behavioral assay. The results showed that the fish avoid eating C. curtipes tadpoles when paired with tadpoles of a sympatric species, Sylvirana temporalis. While the fish fed on C. curtipes tadpoles whose parotoid glands were surgically removed, did not touch those with intact glands, suggesting a role for the parotoid gland secretion in predator deterrence. Histochemical and biochemical analyses of the gland secretion revealed the presence of high concentrations of proteins, lipids, and alkaloids. SDS-PAGE showed the presence of proteins with prominent bands at 17 and 50\u00a0kDa. The presence of other small molecules (950\u20132000\u00a0amu) as detected by LC\u2013MS showed the presence of five major peaks. Peaks 1 and 2 are probably tetrodotoxin and/or its analogs. Peaks 3 and 5 are possibly bufalin and argininosuccinic acid, respectively while peak 4 remains unidentified. Thus, secretion of parotoid glands of larval C. curtipes contains chemicals which, either alone or in combination, might be responsible for deterring predators.",

However, previous studies have shown that growth hormone (GH) transgenic coho salmon display modified nutritional regulation of glycolysis and lipogenesis compared to non-transgenic fish, suggesting the potential for better use of glucose in GH transgenic fish. To examine this in detail, GH transgenic and non-transgenic coho salmon were subjected to glucose tolerance test and subsequent metabolic assessments. After intra-peritoneal injection of 250\u00a0mg/kg glucose, we analysed post-injection kinetics of glycaemia and expression of several key target genes highly involved in glucose homeostasis in muscle and liver tissues. Our data show no significant differences in plasma glucose levels during peak hyperglycaemia (3\u20136\u00a0h after injection), demonstrating a similar glucose tolerance between transgenic and non transgenic. However, and unrelated to the hyperglycaemic episode, GH transgenic fish return to a slightly lower basal glycaemia values 24\u00a0h after injection. Correspondingly, GH transgenic fish exhibited higher mRNA levels of glucokinase (GK) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in liver, and glucose transporter (GLUT4) in muscle. These data suggest that these metabolic actors may be involved in different glucose use in GH transgenic fish, which would be expected to influence the glucose challenge response. Overall, our data demonstrate that GH transgenic coho salmon may be a pertinent animal model for further study of glucose metabolism in carnivorous fish.",

The cunner is non-migratory and is known for its remarkable ability to endure the freezing winter months with little to no food by entering a torpid/dormant state. To evaluate the physiological strategies employed by the cunner's intestinal tract to withstand food deprivation, fish were sampled for their gut after a four-week period of acute food deprivation during their summer (active/feeding) state, as well as after 4\u00a0months of overwinter fasting. Digestive capacity was evaluated by measuring digestive enzyme activity and related mRNA transcript expression for trypsin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminopeptidase and lipase. In order to assess how gut hormones affect/are affected by acute fasting and torpor, we examined the intestinal mRNA expression of several putative appetite regulators, i.e. CCK, apelin, orexin and mTOR. Short-term summer fasting induced a reduction in the activity, but not the transcript expression, of all digestive enzymes examined as well as a reduction in gut apelin mRNA. Torpor induced a reduction in the activity of all enzymes with the exception of alanine aminopeptidase, and a decrease in mRNA levels of alanine aminopeptidase, orexin, CCK and mTOR. Our results suggest that both acute fasting and long-term fasting induce a reduction in the intestinal function of cunner, as evidenced by an overall decrease in the activities of digestive enzymes and mRNA expression of several factors involved in feeding and digestion.",

The results demonstrate that calcium and a known odourant L-arginine are cross-adaptive, that calcium induces an EOG response in a concentration-dependent manner, and that calcium induces a strong avoidance behaviour. The behavioural avoidance was also demonstrated to be olfactory-dependent. Taken together, the results demonstrate that calcium is a potent odourant for fathead minnows. Being able to smell calcium may represent an ability to sense and avoid areas with significant changes in ionic strength, thereby avoiding physiological stress.",

     "abstract": "Digestive flexibility is important because it allows an animal to maximize energy and nutrient return from the diet consumed, and also to reduce the maintenance costs associated with one of the body's most expensive systems in terms of energy and protein requirements. Two different patterns of digestive flexibility have been described for vertebrates, one for species in which metabolic costs of homeostasis are relatively high and the gut is rarely empty (e.g., mammals and birds), and one for species in which metabolic costs of homeostasis are relatively low and the gut usually spends long periods of time empty (e.g., amphibians and reptiles). In this review we analyze the information on digestive tract down-regulation during fasting in fish, in order to evaluate the extent to which digestive flexibility in fish conforms to that in other species. We found that: (1) gut size decay during long-term fasting in fish appears to be almost linear with time, even for very long fasting periods. Thus, gut size temporal dynamics in fish during long-term fasting resemble those observed in some mammals species; (2) by contrast, histological changes during fasting in fish are more similar to those described for amphibians and reptiles; and (3) data on enterocyte turnover rates indicate that cell turnover times in fish are relatively short, and although longer than those observed in mammals, they are not very different from those reported for birds. In conclusion, current data suggest that both mechanisms, cell turnover rates and change in epithelial configuration, probably are involved in digestive tract regulation in fish.",

     "abstract": "The transfer of euryhaline crustaceans from full-strength seawater to low salinity results in both a rapid up-regulation of carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2.1.1) mRNA and a slow induction of CA activity. There is a delay of several days between the two processes, which is attributed to the time required to synthesize new enzyme. These delays may also be due to limitations in the cellular uptake of Zn, which is a required post-translational active site modification to CA. To investigate these processes, the euryhaline crabs, Callinectes sapidus and Carcinus maenas, were acclimated to salinities below their isosmotic points (22.5 and 25\u00a0ppt, respectively) for 7\u00a0days to activate the physiological and molecular mechanisms of osmoregulation. CA mRNA increased 90-fold in C. sapidus and 2-fold in C. maenas within 6\u00a0h; whereas it took 48\u00a0h for the initial increases in CA activity (120% and 31%), and 4 to 7\u00a0days for new acclimated levels (300% and 100%, respectively). Crabs were then transferred to lower salinities (10 and 15\u00a0ppt) to induce further CA activity and to determine if previous increases in CA mRNA reduced the time required for subsequent CA induction. Additionally, the expression of the Zn transporter ZIP1 was examined in C. sapidus at 35 and 22.5\u00a0ppt. In both species, prior CA mRNA elevation failed to accelerate the rate of CA induction. Levels of CA mRNA did not change in either crab following transfer from intermediate to low salinity. Taken together, these results show that the timecourse of CA induction at low salinity is not limited by the expression of CA mRNA, but by the synthesis of new enzyme from an existing pool of mRNA. No increases in ZIP1 expression occurred at low salinity, therefore these delays may be due to the limits of cellular Zn uptake.",

Water exchange was adjusted according to fish biomass to exclude density effects on water quality. In the enriched tanks single-colour glass gravel was used as substrate (blue and red-brown substrate, or BS and RBS respectively), while control tanks had no gravel. Growth, aggressive behaviour and size distribution results indicated that the lower density created a less favourable social environment. In both densities studied, BS enhanced growth, suppressed aggression and reduced brain serotonergic activity. In the condition of intense social interactions (i.e. the lower density) BS also reduced brain dopaminergic activity. These results along with the negative correlations observed between brain monoamines and fish body mass, indicated that substrate and density effects are socially-induced. However, there may be several biotic and/or abiotic factors interfering with substrate effects that should be investigated before the practical use of a substrate in land-based intensive aquaculture.",

The isofemale lines of seasonal populations were reared under ecologically relevant growth temperatures (18 or 26\u00a0\u00b0C) or humidity conditions (35 or 85% RH) but tested at different times under identical experimental conditions. The larvae as well as flies reared under two thermal conditions (18 or 26\u00a0\u00b0C) showed no effect on desiccation related traits as well as storage and utilization of energy metabolites. In contrast, for D. leontia reared under low humidity (35% RH), significant changes at larval as well adult stages include increase in the desiccation resistance as well as cuticular lipid quantity, reduced levels of rate of body water loss, higher storage of carbohydrates but lower rate of utilization of carbohydrates as compared with flies reared at high humidity (85% RH). D. leontia has responded to rearing under low humidity conditions by increasing its desiccation resistance but not due to changes in the growth temperatures. These laboratory observations on seasonal populations highlight differences due to rearing conditions but not due to seasons. Further, direct analysis of wild-caught seasonal populations has shown trends similar to developmental acclimation effects. For wild caught flies, there are significant seasonal differences i.e. higher desiccation resistance as well as cuticular lipid quantity but reduced rate of water loss for autumn than rainy season flies. Thus, our laboratory observations are relevant for understanding seasonal adaptations of natural populations of tropical D. leontia to wet-dry conditions in the wild.",

Sensitive to digestive demand, SDA is theoretically fixed to a given meal size and type. In this study, we altered relative meal size to explore the effects of digestive demand on the postprandial metabolic profile and SDA of the corn snake, Pantherophis guttatus. We also examined the effects of body temperature on the SDA response while controlling for meal size and type and assessed whether these responses are highly repeatable under the same conditions. Additionally, the effects of body mass on SDA were investigated by feeding snakes the same relative and absolute meal size. With increases in digestive demand (meals from 5% to 45% of body mass), P. guttatus responded with incremental increases in the postprandial peak in oxygen consumption ( V \u02d9 O2), the duration of the significantly elevated V \u02d9 O2, and SDA. Body temperature had an observable impact on the postprandial metabolic profile, decreasing the duration and increasing the peak V \u02d9 O2, however, body temperature did not significantly alter SDA. Regardless of temperature, and hence duration, snakes expended the same amount of energy in digesting a given meal. This was additionally borne out when testing the individual repeatability of the SDA response, individual P. guttatus exhibited nearly identical postprandial responses to the same meal. Over a 90-fold range in body mass, and fed meals equaling 25% of body mass, P. guttatus exhibited an isometric relationship between SDA and body mass. When fed a set 10-gram meal, snakes regardless of body size expended the same amount of energy on digestion and assimilation. Characteristically, P. guttatus experience a rapid postprandial increase in metabolic rate that peaks and gradually descends to prefeeding levels. The magnitude of that response (quantified as SDA) varies as a function of digestive demand (i.e., meal size); however, when demand is fixed, SDA is constant regardless of body temperature and body size.",

An increase in oxidative damage and alterations in amino acid concentrations in the diencephalon may contribute to the physiological, behavioral and thermoregulatory responses of heat-exposed chicks.",

     "abstract": "The photoreceptive teleost pineal is considered to be essential to the generation, synchronisation and maintenance of biological rhythms, primarily via melatonin release. The role of internal (circadian clock) and external (light) signals controlling melatonin production in the fish pineal differs between species, yet the reasons underpinning this remain largely unknown. Whilst in salmonids, pineal melatonin is apparently regulated directly by light, in all other studied teleosts, rhythmic melatonin production persists endogenously under the regulation of clock gene expression. To better understand the role of clocks in teleost pineals, this study aimed to characterise the expression of selected clock genes in vitro under different photoperiodic conditions in comparison to in vivo in both Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and in European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) (in vitro 12L:12D), a species known to display endogenous rhythmic melatonin synthesis. Results revealed no rhythmic clock gene (Clock, Period 1 & 2) expression in Atlantic salmon or European seabass (Clock and Period 1) pineal in vitro. However rhythmic expression of Cryptochrome 2 and Period 1 in the Atlantic salmon pineal was observed in vivo, which infers extra-pineal regulation of clocks in this species. No rhythmic arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (Aanat2) expression was observed in the Atlantic salmon yet in the European seabass, circadian Aanat2 expression was observed. Subsequent in silico analysis of available Aanat2 genomic sequences reveals that Atlantic salmon Aanat2 promoter sequences do not contain similar regulatory architecture as present in European seabass, and previously described in other teleosts which alludes to a loss in functional connection in the pathway.",

     "abstract": "Tonic immobility (TI), which can be divided into short (STI) or long (LTI) duration, is a character related to fear. Our previous study has demonstrated LTI phenotype and chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration retarded growth of breast muscle in broiler chickens. In order to investigate the mechanism behind the negative effects of LTI and CORT on growth, the level of mRNA transcription of several key genes linked to energy and protein metabolism was measured in muscle. LTI broilers showed lower levels of ATP, energy charge (EC) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and lower muscle glycogen content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but higher level of ADP (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) than STI birds. CORT treatment elevated EC level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reduced liver glycogen content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Real-time PCR results showed that STI chickens had higher mRNA expression of PPAR \u03b1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) and AMPK \u03b1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) than LTI. CORT significantly down-regulated \u03b1-enolase mRNA expression in breast muscle compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Neither TI nor CORT altered gene expression in Akt/mTOR/p70s6k cascade pathway in muscle (p > 0.05). However, western blot results showed that LTI chickens exhibited higher protein content of total Akt (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and phosphorylated Akt (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) than STI. CORT treatment decreased the total protein content of Akt (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) and p70s6k (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08). These results suggest that the retardation of muscle growth by LTI and chronic CORT administration parallels a strong alternation in energy status but slight changes of Akt/mTOR/p70s6k cascade, indicating that a decrease in muscle growth induced by LTI and CORT might not be mediated through mTOR-dependent signaling pathways.",

In this study, we examined the pattern of accumulation of HSP30 and HSP70 in Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells recovering from heat shock. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of elevated levels of HSP30 after 72\u00a0h of recovery. However, the relative levels of HSP70 declined to near control levels after 24\u00a0h. The relative levels of both hsp30 and hsp70 mRNA were reduced to low levels after 24\u00a0h of recovery from heat shock. Pretreatment of cells with cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor, produced a rapid decline in HSP70 but not HSP30. The cycloheximide-associated decline of HSP70 was blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, but had little effect on the relative level of HSP30. Also, treatment of cells with the phosphorylation inhibitor, SB203580, in addition to cycloheximide treatment enhanced the stability of HSP30 compared to cycloheximide alone. Immunocytochemical studies detected the presence of HSP30 accumulation in a granular pattern in the cytoplasm of recovering cells and its association with aggresome-like structures, which was enhanced in the presence of SB203580. This study has shown that the relative levels of heat shock-induced HSP30 persist during recovery in contrast to HSP70. While HSP70 is degraded by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, it is likely that the presence of HSP30 multimeric complexes that are known to associate with unfolded protein as well as its association with aggresome-like structures may delay its degradation.",

Heretofore, the impact of water deprivation on CORT plasma levels has not been thoroughly investigated. However, both baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT are expected to respond to water deprivation not only because of hydric stress per se, but also because CORT is an important mineralocorticoid in vertebrates. We assessed the effects of water deprivation on baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT, in Children's pythons (Antaresia childreni), a species that experiences seasonal droughts in natural conditions. We imposed a 52-day water deprivation on a group of unfed Children's pythons (i.e., water-deprived treatment) and provided water ad libitum to another group (i.e., control treatment). We examined body mass variations throughout the experiment, and baseline CORT and stress-induced CORT at the end of the treatments. Relative body mass loss averaged ~\u00a010% in pythons without water, a value 2 to 4 times higher compared to control snakes. Following re-exposition to water, pythons from the water-deprived treatment drank readily and abundantly and attained a body mass similar to pythons from the control treatment. Together, these results suggest a substantial dehydration as a consequence of water deprivation. Interestingly, stress-induced but not baseline CORT level was significantly higher in water-deprived snakes, suggesting that baseline CORT might not respond to this degree of dehydration. Therefore, possible mineralocorticoid role of CORT needs to be clarified in snakes. Because dehydration usually induces adjustments (reduced movements, lowered body temperature) to limit water loss, and decreases locomotor performances, elevated stress-induced CORT in water-deprived snakes might therefore compensate for altered locomotor performances. Future studies should test this hypothesis.",

Akt and Rheb, a GTP-binding protein, regulate mTOR protein kinase activity. Molting in crustaceans is regulated by ecdysteroids synthesized by a pair of molting glands, or Y-organs (YOs), located in the cephalothorax. During premolt, the YOs hypertrophy and increase production of ecdysteroids. Rapamycin (1\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibited ecdysteroid secretion in Carcinus maenas and Gecarcinus lateralis YOs in vitro, indicating that ecdysteroidogenesis requires mTOR-dependent protein synthesis. The effects of molting on the expression of four key mTOR signaling genes (mTOR, Akt, Rheb, and S6K) in the YO was investigated. Partial cDNAs encoding green crab (C. maenas) mTOR (4031\u00a0bp), Akt (855\u00a0bp), and S6K (918\u00a0bp) were obtained from expressed sequence tags. Identity/similarity of the deduced amino acid sequence of the C. maenas cDNAs to human orthologs were 72%/81% for Cm-mTOR, 58%/73% for Cm-Akt, and 77%/88% for Cm-S6K. mTOR, Akt, S6K, and elongation factor 2 (EF2) in C. maenas and blackback land crab (G. lateralis) were expressed in all tissues examined. The two species differed in the effects of molting on gene expression in the YO. In G. lateralis, Gl-mTOR, Gl-Akt, and Gl-EF2 mRNA levels were increased during premolt. By contrast, molting had no effect on the expression of Cm-mTOR, Cm-Akt, Cm-S6K, Cm-Rheb, and Cm-EF2. These data suggest that YO activation during premolt involves up regulation of mTOR signaling genes in G. lateralis, but is not required in C. maenas.",

Acute stress affected many parameters related to energy metabolism, with most of them turning back to normal levels after 480\u00a0min. In general, the present results support the existence of two stages in the short-term time-course of metabolic response to handling stress. A first stage occurring few minutes post-stress (15\u201345\u00a0min), was characterized by increased mobilization of liver glycogen resulting in increased production of endogenous glucose, reduced use of exogenous glucose and reduced lipogenic potential. A second stage, occurring 60\u2013120\u00a0min post-stress onwards was characterized by the recovery of liver glycogen levels, the increased capacity of liver for releasing glucose, and the recovery of lipogenic capacity whereas no changes were noted in gluconeogenic potential, which probably needs longer time periods to become enhanced.",

Isolated opercular epithelia were cooled from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C for warm and cold acclimated fish; from 30 to 8\u00a0\u00b0C, Isc decreased with Q10\u00a0=\u00a01.68 for warm and Q10\u00a0=\u00a01.56 for cold acclimated tissues. By Arrhenius plots, there is a critical temperature, 8\u00a0\u00b0C, below which aerobic Isc decreased sharply (Q10\u00a0=\u00a06.90 for warm and 4.23 for cold acclimated tissues), suggesting a shift in mitochondrial efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. In anaerobic conditions (0.5\u00a0mM NaCN; N2 saturation), chloride transport continued at a lower rate, and Isc decrease with cooling below 8\u00a0\u00b0C was less pronounced (Q10\u00a0=\u00a02.95 for warm and 3.08 for cold), suggesting a shift in transporter function in plasma membrane. Under anaerobic conditions, NaCl secretion at 20\u00a0\u00b0C was reversibly inhibited by hypotonic shock, indicating normal regulation of transport. Chloride secretion in warm-acclimated fish was supported mostly (75% at 20\u00a0\u00b0C) by aerobic metabolism, whereas that for cold-acclimated fish was lower (55% at 20\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting a greater reliance on anaerobic metabolism in the cold. Once acclimated to cold, ionocytes may be temporarily incapable of increasing their aerobic ATP supply, even when warmed to 30\u00a0\u00b0C. In cold acclimated fish there was increased polyunsaturated fatty acid composition of gill epithelium (consistent with homeoviscous adaptation) and gill remodeling, wherein epithelial cells filled the interlamellar space (interlamellar cell mass, ILCM) by as much as 70%, thus increasing diffusion distance against passive ion gain. Most ionocytes in these thickened epithelial masses became taller, still connecting basal lamina with the environment, consistent with the continuing transport rates at low temperatures. Whereas the low aerobic scope of cold-acclimated fish and thickened gill epithelium is appropriate to winter inactivity, metabolic depression and anaerobiosis, the large aerobic scope of warm-acclimated fish favors active foraging at high temperatures.",

Southern populations have a higher survival rate and higher oxygen consumption at higher temperatures (27 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C) in comparison with northern populations. Southern individuals also presented a hyperventilation, and higher energy stores compared to northern individuals whatever the acclimation temperature considered.

In addition, this work provided the opportunity to study the effects of moulting in king penguins. This annual event that imposes deep metabolic adjustments is liable to affect blood gas levels. Because of the regular food supply and probably also of the blood sampling conditions, the blood pH of captive penguins was low. This effect was increased in moulting penguins and supposedly due to both the decreased energetic metabolism and the production of uric acid resulting from new feather synthesis. The decrease in the anion gap also revealed the use of plasmatic albumin for this synthesis. The elevated venous PO2 in all birds is not likely due to stress caused by sampling conditions. The other data, in accordance with those in the literature, show neither major influence of captivity nor fundamental interspecific differences, despite potential diving aptitude.",

Exposure to 0 and 5\u00a0\u00b0C for longer than 2\u00a0weeks was lethal to all the immature stages.

The temperature treatment at 15\u00a0\u00b0C allowed both L3 and L5 to exhibit a feeding behavior and induced little non-freezing injury, suggesting a minimal temperature threshold for optimal overwintering conditions of S. exigua. Three heat shock protein genes (Hsp70, Hsp74, Hsp83) were expressed in the larvae at the low temperature treatments. Only Hsp70 was inducible to the low temperatures in both L3 and L5 stages. RNA interference of Hsp70 expression led to significantly lose the survival rates of the treated larvae in the conditions inducing the non-freezing injury.

As solubilization of SAP in the calcium-containing Ringer's solution was problematic but resolved with the addition of a physiological concentration of bile collected from the gall bladder of salmon, an evaluation of bile effects became an added element. Results indicated that bile increased baseline glucose absorption and possibly transport, and also had a protective effect on the epithelial barrier, at least partially due to taurocholate. Compared to controls, tissues exposed to LEC\u00a0+\u00a0bile, KTI\u00a0+\u00a0bile and LEC\u00a0+\u00a0KTI\u00a0+\u00a0bile exhibited increased glucose uptake at the higher glucose concentrations, apparently due to markedly increased tissue permeability. Addition of SAP, however, attenuated the response, possibly by binding bile components. SAP\u00a0+\u00a0bile, also in combination with LEC and/or KTI, as well as LEC, KTI and LEC\u00a0+\u00a0KTI without bile often reduced transcellular glucose uptake pathways, while maintaining low tissue permeability. SAP\u00a0+\u00a0LEC\u00a0+\u00a0KTI\u00a0+\u00a0bile, LEC and KTI caused the most marked reductions. The distal intestine was more affected, reflecting the restriction of in vivo SBM-induced inflammatory changes to this region.",

Water\u2013ethanol extracted glycoprotein from H. fusiformis was supplemented to three fishmeal-based diets at the concentration of 0, 5, and 10\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 diet (designated as H0, H5, and H10, respectively). After a 12\u00a0week-long feeding trial, growth performance and biochemical responses were analyzed including proximate composition, and whole body amino acids and fatty acids. We also measured plasma insulin like growth factor (IGF), IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) and interleukin (IL). The fish fed H5 showed the greatest weight gain among the dietary treatments. In parallel with the growth, the fish fed the diets containing H. fusiformis glycoprotein showed an increased plasma IGF-I activity and increased expression of 43-kDa IGFBP-3 compared to that in the control, whereas an opposite trend was observed for 34-kDa IGFBP-1. Although no differences were found in the level of whole body linoleic acid (C18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06) and linolenic acid (C18:3n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) among treatments, increases in arachidonic acid (ARA, C20:4n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) were observed in fish fed H5 compared to control.

Recently, depression of mitochondrial substrate oxidation in isolated liver mitochondria was observed and associated to hypothermic/hypometabolic states in Djungarian hamsters, mice and hibernators. We aimed to clarify whether hypothermia or hypometabolism causes mitochondrial depression during torpor by studying the Golden spiny mouse (Acomys russatus), a desert rodent which performs daily torpor at high ambient temperatures of 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Notably, metabolic rate but not body temperature is significantly decreased under these conditions. In isolated liver, heart, skeletal muscle or kidney mitochondria we found no depression of respiration. Moderate cold exposure lowered torpor body temperature but had minor effects on minimal metabolic rate in torpor. Neither decreased body temperature nor metabolic rate impacted mitochondrial respiration. Measurements of mitochondrial proton leak kinetics and determination of P/O ratio revealed no differences in mitochondrial efficiency. Hydrogen peroxide release from mitochondria was not affected. We conclude that interspecies differences of mitochondrial depression during torpor do not support a general relationship between mitochondrial respiration, body temperature and metabolic rate. In Golden spiny mice, reduction of metabolic rate at mild temperatures is not triggered by depression of substrate oxidation as found in liver mitochondria from other cold-exposed rodents.",

Fish were challenged for 24\u00a0h to 1) emersion, 2) fresh water (FW), and 3) high environmental ammonia (HEA; 1\u00a0mM NH4Cl), or 4) ammonia loading (1.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/g NH4HCO3). When air exposed, L. pholis maintained aquatic ammonia excretion rates (JAmm) while branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity increased, but no changes at the protein or mRNA levels of transporters were noted. In FW, JAmm decreased and osmotic problems were encountered. Skin NKA activity decreased, branchial Rhcg2, and skin Rhcg1 and Rhcg2 increased. Exposure to HEA only increased branchial Rhcg2 levels. Although internal ammonia loading only led to a modest non-significant increase in JAmm, skin NKA (activity and \u03b1-subunit), carbonic anhydrase protein levels, and branchial Rhcg1 levels increased. In summary, variable responses were observed involving both gill and skin but given the instability of its habitat, the constitutive expression of transporters is likely also of importance.",

On the other hand, in vivo co-stimulation of both systems is not well documented. To better understand this interaction, we decided to evaluate the in vivo effects of both stimulation of the immune system and co-stimulation of both systems in Eurasian perch juveniles. Fish were injected either with 10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 LPS, or with a combination of LPS and 0.8\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 cortisol or LPS and 0.08\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and sampled 1, 3 or 7\u00a0days after injection. LPS affected the immune system by increasing plasma lysozyme activity and blood neutrophils populations. During the same time-course, LPS decreased the proportion of a mixture of lymphocytes and thrombocytes in blood and TNF-\u03b1 expression in spleen. Cortisol modulated the LPS-mediated response in TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression levels in spleen. Contrary to LPS alone, the association of LPS with DOC modulated the abundance of complement component 3 (C3) mRNA in spleen. On the other hand, LPS altered the corticotropic axis by decreasing mRNA expression levels of all corticosteroid receptors and of 11\u03b2-HSD-2 in spleen. Both corticosteroids injected were not able to balance these LPS-induced suppressive effects on corticosteroid receptors and 11\u03b2-HSD-2 expression levels in spleen. Contrary to LPS alone, the association of LPS with DOC modulated GR-1b expression in gills. These results indicated that LPS is a strong modulator of the corticosteroid receptors expression in spleen. Furthermore, we report for the first time a LPS-induced decrease of the mineralocorticoid receptor expression. Finally, corticosteroids were able to modulate the LPS-mediated response at the transcriptional level.",

     "abstract": "Adult birds have a ventilatory equivalent (pulmonary ventilation\u2013oxygen consumption ratio, V \u02d9 E/ V \u02d9 O 2 ) lower than mammals because of the superior gas exchange efficiency of their respiratory apparatus. In particular, adult Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) have been reported to have an extraordinary low ventilatory equivalent (~\u00a014\u00a0mL STPD\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0mL BTPS\u2212\u00a01). We asked if similar high efficiency was already apparent in duck hatchlings. Breathing pattern and V \u02d9 E were measured by the barometric technique and V \u02d9 O 2 by an open-flow methodology in 1-day old Muscovy duck hatchlings (N\u00a0=\u00a021); same measurements were performed on chicken hatchlings (N\u00a0=\u00a021) for purpose of comparison. During air breathing V \u02d9 E/ V \u02d9 O 2 was slightly, yet significantly, lower in ducklings (20.8) than in chicks (25.3), mostly because of a lower breathing frequency (f). The hatchlings of both species (N\u00a0=\u00a014 per group) responded to inspired hypoxia (15 or 10% O2) or hypercapnia (2 or 4% CO2) with a clear hyperventilation; however, in ducklings the hypercapnic hyperventilation was smaller than in chicks because of a smaller increase in tidal volume and lower f. We conclude that duck and chicken hatchlings just a few hours old have the high ventilatory efficiency typical of birds, although possibly not as high as their adults. The low f and blunted V \u02d9 E response to hypercapnia of the newborn duck could be related to the aquatic habitat of the species. In such a case, it would mean that these characteristics are genetic traits, the phenotypic expression of which does not require diving experience.",

     "abstract": "Nectar composition within a plant pollinator group can be variable, and bird pollinated plants can be segregated into two groups based on their adaptations to either a specialist or an occasional bird pollination system. Specialist nectarivores rely primarily on nectar for their energy requirements, while occasional nectarivores meet their energy requirements from nectar as well as from seeds, fruit and insects. Avian blood plasma glucose concentration (PGlu) is generally high compared with mammals. It is also affected by a range of factors including species, gender, age, ambient temperature, feeding pattern, reproductive status, circadian rhythm and moult status, among others. We examined whether sugar content affected PGlu of two avian nectarivores, a specialist nectarivore the Amethyst Sunbird Chalcomitra amethystina, and an occasional nectarivore the Cape White-eye Zosterops virens, when fed sucrose\u2013hexose sugar solution diets of varying concentrations (5%\u201335%). Both species regulated PGlu within a range which was affected by sampling time (fed or fasted) and not dietary sugar concentration. The range in mean PGlu was broader in Amethyst Sunbirds (11.52\u201316.51\u00a0mmol/L) compared with Cape White-eyes (14.33\u201315.85\u00a0mmol/L). This suggests that these birds are not constrained by dietary sugar concentration with regard to PGlu regulation, and consequently selective pressure on plants for their nectar characteristics is due to reasons other than glucose regulation.",

     "abstract": "Basal metabolic rates in mammals are mainly determined by body mass, but also by ecological factors. Some mammalian species inhabiting hot, dry environments were found to have lower metabolic rates compared to temperate species. We studied energy metabolism in Phillip's dikdik (Madoqua saltiana phillipsi), a small antelope inhabiting xeric shrubland habitats in the Eastern \u2018horn\u2019 of Africa, and compared results to literature data. We measured body mass (BM) changes and digestibility in 12 adults kept on different food intake levels to determine, by extrapolation to zero BM change, maintenance energy requirements (MEm) for metabolizable energy (ME). The MEm averaged at 404\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0kJ\u00a0ME\u00a0kg\u00a0BM\u2212\u00a00.75\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01.

Selecting the 20 lowest values of the respiration measurement period to estimate resting metabolic rate (RMR) resulted in a mean RMR of 244\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u00a0BM\u2212\u00a00.75\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01, which was not significantly lower than the expected basal metabolic rate of 293\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u00a0BM\u2212\u00a00.75\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01. Therefore, resting metabolism was similar to the expected average basal metabolism of a mammal of this size, which suggests a comparatively low metabolic rate in dikdiks.

To investigate further into these aspects we have focused on orthologs of SoxE and \u03b2-catenin, key players of the male and female gonadic differentiation respectively in mammals. Based on phylogenetic analyses, Cg-SoxE, the oyster's SoxE ortholog, is closely related to vertebrate SoxE genes while Cg-\u03b2-catenin, the oyster's \u03b2-catenin ortholog, is classified amongst lophotrochozoa. The mRNA expression measured by qPCR in the gonadic area during a gametogenetic cycle is maximal for Cg-SoxE when sex is indiscernible and for Cg-\u03b2-catenin in mature females. Both expressions are localized from early germ cells to spermatocytes and pre-vitellogenic oocytes, and potentially in somatic cells. Cg-\u03b2-catenin is also expressed in vitellogenic oocytes. These actors may be involved in early oyster gonadic differentiation, which includes sex determination.

Analysis of the tissue distribution of transporter mRNAs revealed that mct8 and mct10 transcripts were both abundant in liver, but also present at lower levels in brain, gonad and other tissues.

Myogenesis is controlled by numerous extracellular signals together with intracellular transcriptional factors whose coordinated expression is critical for the appropriate development of muscle fibres. Full-length cDNAs for the transcription factors Myf5, Mrf4, Pax7 and Sox8 were cloned and sequenced for gilthead sea bream. Pax7, sox8, myod2 and myf5 levels were up-regulated during the proliferating phase of the myogenic cultures coincident with the highest expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In contrast, myogenin and mrf4 transcript abundance was highest during the differentiation phase of the culture when myotubes were present, and was correlated with increased myosin heavy chain (mhc) and desmin expression. In vivo, 30\u00a0days of fasting resulted in muscle fibre atrophy, a reduction in myod2, myf5 and igf1 expression, lower number of Myod-positive cells, and decreased PCNA protein expression, whereas myogenin expression was not significantly affected.

     "abstract": "The Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis, is a rare and large-sized anadromous bony fish and understanding of its reproductive regulation is a precondition for controlled reproduction. In this study, two gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) precursor cDNAs, AsGnRH1 (mammalian type) and AsGnRH2 (chicken type 2), were sequenced in A. sinensis. The precursor cDNAs of the AsGnRH1 and AsGnRH2 are 381 and 649 base pairs (bp), encoding signal peptide plus precursors of 92 and 86 amino acids, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment suggests that AsGnRH1 and AsGnRH2 decapeptides are highly conserved among vertebrates. Besides, AsGnRH1 had closer evolutionary relationship with tetrapods, while AsGnRH2 was conservatively grouped with teleosts in the phylogenetic analysis. Tissue distribution analysis shows that AsGnRH2 is exclusively transcribed in the brain, whereas AsGnRH1 exhibits more extensive tissue distribution including brain, liver, spleen and gonad. Furthermore, Chinese sturgeons were subcutaneously implanted with 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and the effect of E2 on brain GnRH mRNA levels was evaluated by real-time PCR. A significant increase in AsGnRH1 and AsGnRH2 mRNA levels is detected in fish receiving E2 implantation compared to controls after one month (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results indicate that E2 exerts positive feedback effects on the transcription of the two GnRHs in immature Chinese sturgeon.",

No mortalities were recorded during emersion periods shorter than 40\u00a0h, however, all hemolymph parameters were modulated by aerial exposure.

Oxygen consumption at re-immersion was affected by aerial exposure time, with low values in animals emersed for longer than 30\u00a0h. We postulate that the unexpected high tolerance of L. santolla to aerial exposure is mainly related to adaptations to hypoxia, developed to overcome hypoxic events in their natural environment in deep water. The present findings are not only important for understanding L. santolla's physiology, but also provide the first evaluation of the potential marketing of southern king crab as live seafood.",

     "abstract": "Many animals undergo extended periods of fasting. During these fasts, animals oxidize a ratio of macronutrients dependent on the nutritional, energetic, and hydric requirements of the fasting period. In this study, we use Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica), a bird with natural intermediate fasting periods, to examine macronutrient use during a 6\u00a0d fast. We raised groups of quail on isotopically labeled materials (13C-1-leucine, 13C-U-glucose, or 13C-1-palmitic acid) with the intent of labeling specific macronutrient/tissue pools in each treatment, and then traced their use as fuels by measuring the \u03b413C values of breath CO2. Based on changes in \u03b413C values during the fast, it appears that the carbohydrate label,13C-U-glucose, was largely incorporated into the lipid pool and thus breath samples ultimately reflected lipid use rather than carbohydrate use. In the lipid treatment, the 13C-1-palmitic acid faithfully labeled the lipid pool and was reflected in the kinetics \u03b413C values in breath CO2 during the fast. Endogenous lipid oxidation peaked after 24\u00a0h of fasting and remained constantly elevated thereafter. The protein label,13C-1-leucine, showed clear diurnal periods of protein sparing and degradation, with maximal rates of protein oxidation occurring at night and the lowest rates occurring during the day time. This stable isotope tracer method provides a noninvasive approach to study the nutrient dynamics of fasting animals and should provide new insights into how different types of animals use specific nutrient pools during fasting and possibly other non-steady physiological states.",

The weak osmoregulator, C. magister, is unable to balance the demands of osmoregulation and digestion. Concordant with observed decreases in oxygen consumption and mechanical digestion, proteolytic digestion within the foregut and hepatopancreas was delayed, resulting in a relative reduction of circulating amino acids post-feeding in low salinity. In contrast, the efficient osmoregulator, C. sapidus, balances the demands of osmoregulation and digestion, and mechanical digestion continues unabated in low salinity. Protease activity in the gut fluid and hepatopancreas showed either no change or a reduction over time. The transport of amino acids into the cells post-feeding is opposed by an efflux of amino acids at the cellular level, and resulted in a build up of amino acids in the hemolymph. Despite differences in the extracellular responses to low salinity exposure following feeding, both species were able to maintain high digestive efficiencies.",

Plasma and liver osmoregulatory and metabolic parameters, as well as AVT and IT pituitary contents were determined concomitantly with hypothalamic pro-vasotocin (pro-VT) and pro-isotocin (pro-IT) mRNA expression levels. Previously, sequences coding for pro-VT and pro-IT cDNAs were cloned. Two osmoregulatory periods related to plasma osmolality and metabolic parameter variations could be distinguished: i) an adaptative period, from 12\u00a0h to 3\u00a0days after transfer, and ii) a chronic regulatory period, starting at day 3 after transfer. Higher values in hypothalamic pro-VT and pro-IT mRNA expression as well as in pituitary AVT and IT storage levels in both hypo- and/or hyper-osmotic transfers have been distinguished. These increase correlated with changes in plasma cortisol levels, suggesting an interaction between this hormone and pro-VT expression. Furthermore, pro-IT expression enhancement also suggests a role of the isotocinergic system as a modulator in the acute stress response induced by hyper-osmotic challenge in S. aurata.",

We therefore studied the oxidative stress by measuring lipid peroxidation, anti-oxidant defenses and neurotransmission activity in E. albidus from arctic (Greenland) and temperate (Germany) regions during a short-term exposure to saline conditions (0, 15, 35 and 50\u2030 NaCl) and low temperatures (+\u00a02, \u2212\u00a02 and \u2212\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C). Various enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers were analyzed. Results have shown that both salt and freezing caused oxidative stress in E. albidus, particularly from Germany, as confirmed by catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and superoxide dismutase activities and lipid peroxidation levels. Neurotransmission (as judged from acetylcholinesterase activity) was reduced by saline conditions at +\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, but stimulated at \u2212\u00a02 and \u2212\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C.

The objective of the current study was to determine if overexpression of syndecan-4 and glypican-1 would increase proliferation, differentiation and FGF2 responsiveness in satellite cells isolated from pectoralis major muscle from 16-wk-old turkeys. Overexpression of syndecan-4 and glypican-1 did not have a significant effect on proliferation and differentiation in 1\u00a0d, 7\u00a0wk, and 16\u00a0wk satellite cells, and did not affect FGF2 responsiveness during proliferation.

     "abstract": "Vasotocin (VT) is the basic nonapeptide hormone secreted by the neurohypophysis of non-mammalian vertebrates and is involved in the regulation of osmoregulation, metabolism, cardiovascular function, reproduction and behaviour. Among the reproductive function, VT is specifically implicated in final oocyte maturation, ovulation, oviposition/parturition in teleosts, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. The central catecholaminergic system is involved in the regulation of pituitary hormone secretion including gonadotropin, and mediates also changes in environmental photoperiod and temperature. The close apposition of the VT and catecholaminergic systems in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus signifies a strong possibility of their functional interaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of exogenously administered catecholamines on VT secretion in two different reproductive phases of female catfish Heteropneustes fossilis. For this, the catecholamine precursor l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and catecholamines (dopamine-DA, norepinephrine-NE, and epinephrine-E) were intraperitoneally injected in normal catfish and/or along with \u03b1-methylparatyrosine (\u03b1-MPT, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor). Brain and plasma VT levels were measured by specific ELISA, 24\u00a0h post injection. Both l-DOPA and DA inhibited brain and plasma VT levels in a concentration-dependent manner in preparatory and prespawning phases. In contrast, NE elicited dose-dependent effects: the lowest dose (0.5\u00a0ng/g body mass, BM) was ineffective, the median dose (1\u00a0ng/g BM) stimulated, and the high doses (10 and 100\u00a0ng/g BM) inhibited VT levels. E stimulated VT levels dose-dependently. A single injection of \u03b1-MPT (250\u00a0\u03bcg/g BM) strongly inhibited VT when given alone and enhanced the inhibitory effects of l-DOPA and DA in the combination groups. The \u03b1-MPT inhibition of VT was significantly reduced by the injection of NE (5\u00a0ng/g BM) and was restored or elevated by E. When the adrenergic neurotransmitters were given together with \u03b1-MPT, the inhibitory effect of the latter was abolished and VT levels were significantly elevated. Thus, the present data indicate that the physiological changes in VT is differentially regulated by the catecholamines (DA inhibits and NE/E stimulates VT).",

For 21-day fasted fish, blood glucose appearance also had significant contributions from unlabeled glucose (52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016%) despite the unavailability of dietary carbohydrates. To assess the role of hepatic enzymes in glycemic control, activity and mRNA levels of hepatic glucokinase (GK) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were assessed. Both G6Pase activity and expression declined with fasting indicating the absence of a classical counter-regulatory stimulation of hepatic glucose production in response to declining glucose levels. GK activities were basal during fed and fasted conditions, but were strongly stimulated by refeeding. Overall, hepatic G6Pase and GK showed limited capacity in regulating glucose levels between feeding and fasting states.",

We capitalized on a model avian system (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus), where extensive information is available on the fitness roles of carotenoids, to test how variation in carotenoid and/or vitamin E concentrations in the diet impacts body accumulation of these compounds, factors related to oxidative damage (e.g., breast muscle and plasma oxidative-stress susceptibility, plasma nitric-oxide levels), and plumage color development. As in a previous study of ours on carotenoids and health in finches, we employed a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial experimental design on birds in both molting and non-molting conditions, to understand how seasonal shifts in carotenoid use (i.e., pigment incorporation into plumage) might alter the accumulation and roles of carotenoids and vitamins. As expected, lutein supplementation increased the level of circulating carotenoids in both experiments and the color of newly molted plumage. By contrast, vitamin E provisioning did not significantly affect plasma carotenoid levels or plumage coloration in either experiment. Interestingly, carotenoid provisioning decreased circulating vitamin E levels during molt, which suggests either molecular competition between carotenoids and tocopherol at the absorption/transport stages or that vitamin E serves as an antioxidant to offset harmful actions that carotenoids may have at very high concentrations. Finally, in both experiments, we found a reduction in breast-muscle oxidative damage for tocopherol-supplemented birds, which constitutes the first demonstration of a protective effect of vitamin E against oxidative stress in wild birds. Taken together, these findings provide an interesting contrast with our earlier work on season-specific physiological benefits of carotenoids in finches and point to complex associations between indicators of antioxidant and oxidative state in wild-caught animals.",

     "abstract": "Meal size and animal size are important factors affecting the characteristics of the specific dynamic action (SDA) response across a variety of taxa. The effects of these two variables on the SDA of decapod crustaceans are based on just a couple of articles, and are not wholly consistent with the responses reported for other aquatic ectotherms. Therefore, the effects of meal size and animal size on the characteristics of SDA response were investigated in a variety of decapod crustaceans from different families. A 6 fold increase in meal size (0.5%\u20133% body mass) resulted a pronounced increase in the duration of increased oxygen consumption, resulting in an increase in the SDA of Callinectes sapidus, Cancer gracilis, Hemigrapsus nudus, Homarus americanus, Pugettia producta and Procambarus clarkii. Unlike many other aquatic ectotherms a substantial increase between meal sizes was required, with meal size close to their upper feeding limit (3% body mass), before changes were evident. In many organisms increases in both duration and scope contribute to the overall SDA, here changes in scope as a function of meal size were weak, suggesting that a similar amount of energy is required to upregulate gastric processes, regardless of meal size. The SDA characteristics were less likely to be influenced by the size of the animal, and there was no difference in the SDA (kJ) as a function of size in H. americanus or Cancer irroratus when analysed as mass specific values. In several fish species characteristics of the SDA response are more closely related to the transit times of food, rather than the size of a meal. To determine if a similar trend occurred in crustaceans, the transit rates of different sized meals were followed through the digestive system using a fluoroscope. Although there was a trend towards larger meals taking longer to pass through the gut, this was only statistically significant for P. clarkii. There were some changes in transit times as a function of animal size. The foregut clearance times for Cancer magister increased with increasing body size, while smaller Carcinus maenas cleared the hindgut region at a faster rate than larger individuals. Unlike fish there was no clear relationship between transit rates and any of the SDA characteristics. While the fluoroscopy method is useful for assessing foregut activity and food passage, it is limited when inferring connections between nutrient assimilation and post-absorptive processes in crustaceans. Therefore, at least with respect to meal size, transit rates do not make a good proxy for determining the SDA characteristics in crustaceans.",

Hyperoxia had no effect on temperature at CTMax or time taken to reach CTMax. Hypoxia, on the other hand, resulted in a significantly lower CTMax and shorter time to CTMax than under standard or hyperoxic conditions, with both indices affected by triploidy but not in a consistent fashion: in one experiment triploids had a lower CTMax and shorter time to CTMax than diploids and in a second experiment they had a higher CTMax and longer time to CTMax than diploids.

     "abstract": "The effects of unsaturated fatty acids on membrane properties were studied using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recording of isolated wing (Ib) cells in bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) taste discs. Applying arachidonic acid to the bath induced monophasic inward currents in 60% of wing cells and biphasic inward and outward currents in the other cells. The intracellular dialysis of arachidonic acid did not induce an inward current; however, it enhanced a slowly developing Ba2\u00a0+-sensitive outward current. The effects of various unsaturated fatty acids were explored under the condition of Cs+ internal solution. Linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic acids induced large inward currents. Oleic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids elicited the same inward currents as those of arachidonic acid. Wing cells, under the basal condition with Cs+ internal solution, displayed a small inward current of \u2212\u00a01.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0pA/pF at \u2212\u00a050\u00a0mV (n\u00a0=\u00a040), in which the peak existed at a membrane potential of \u2212\u00a049\u00a0mV.

External linoleic acid (50\u00a0\u03bcM) also induced a similar inward current of \u2212\u00a05.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0pA/pF at \u2212\u00a050\u00a0mV (n\u00a0=\u00a019) from the basal current and the peak was located at \u2212\u00a061\u00a0mV. External Ca2\u00a0+-free saline and linoleic acid induced similar current/voltage (I/V) relationships elicited by a ramp voltage as well as voltage steps. Linoleic acid-induced currents were not influenced by replacing internal EGTA with BAPTA, whereas inward currents disappeared under the elimination of external Na+ and addition of flufenamic acid. These results suggest that dietary unsaturated fatty acids may depolarize wing (Ib) cells, which affects the excitability of these cells.",

Na+ uptake kinetic parameters, unidirectional Na+ fluxes, and net Cl\u2212 fluxes were determined at pH\u00a06.0 and 3.6. At pH\u00a06.0, both species presented low unidirectional Na+ flux rates, with kinetics showing a relatively low affinity for Na+ (angelfish Km\u00a0=\u00a079, discus Km\u00a0=\u00a0268\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), with similar maximum transport capacities (Jmax\u00a0~\u00a0535\u00a0nmol\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01). Overall, there appeared to be high sensitivity to inhibition by low pH, yet low intrinsic branchial permeability limiting diffusive ion effluxes, resulting in relatively low net loss rates of Na+, the same strategy as seen previously in other blackwater cichlids, and very different from the strategy of blackwater characids. At low pH, Na+ uptake in angelfish was inhibited competitively (increased Km\u00a0=\u00a0166\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) and non-competitively (decreased Jmax\u00a0=\u00a0106\u00a0nmol\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01), whereas in discus, only a decrease in Jmax (112\u00a0nmol\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01) was statistically significant. An acute reduction in H+-ATPase activity, but not in Na+/K+-ATPase activity, in the gills of angelfish suggests a possible mechanism for this non-competitive inhibition at low pH. Discus fish were more tolerant to low pH than angelfish, as seen by lesser effects of exposure to pH\u00a03.6 on unidirectional Na+ uptake and efflux rates and net Na+ and Cl\u2212 loss rates. Overall, discus are better than angelfish in maintaining ionic balance under acidic, ion-poor conditions.",

Feeding provided readily available energy and clearly increased muscle and liver protein and glycogen stores. Swimming, feeding and cortisol all induced aerobic metabolism by increasing oxygen consumption, and stimulated protein metabolism as demonstrated by the increased ammonia and urea excretion and ammonia quotient. Hypercortisol stimulated ammonia self-detoxifying mechanisms by enhancing ammonia and urea excretion, especially during severe exercise. At high swimming level, higher branchial clearance rates in cortisol treated fish succeeded in eliminating the elevation of endogenous ammonia, resulting in reduced plasma Tamm levels compared to control and sham implanted fish. Carp easily induced anaerobic metabolism, both during routine and active swimming, with elevated lactate levels as a consequence. Both feeding and cortisol treatment increased this dependence on anaerobic metabolism. Hypercortisol induced both glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis resulting in hyperglycemia and muscle and liver glycogen deposition, most likely as a protective mechanism for prolonged stress situations and primarily fuelled by protein mobilization.",

Carotenoid pigments promote egg-laying and fertility in several animals, and are displayed externally within secondary sex traits by males of many colorful species to attract mates, but it is unclear if or how carotenoids affect male primary sex traits. We manipulated carotenoid availability in the diet of male mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during both development and adulthood to determine effects on size and carotenoid content of the testes. We found that developmental carotenoid manipulations did not affect testis size or carotenoid concentration, but that increased carotenoid dietary levels at adulthood resulted in more carotenoid-rich, but smaller, testes. This latter result was surprising, given positive correlations in mammals between testicle size and carotenoid concentration. We also found negative correlations between testis size and carotenoid concentration for individual ducks, regardless of dietary treatment. These results suggest that carotenoid deposition into testis tissue can reduce investment in gonad size (and thus overall sperm count), although the functional consequences of this relationship remain to be tested.",

     "abstract": "The complex vertebrate skeleton depends on regulated cell activities to lay down protein matrix and mineral components of bone. As a distinctive vertebrate characteristic, bone is a storage site for physiologically-important calcium ion. The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is linked to homeostatic regulation of calcium through its expression in endocrine glands that secrete calcium homeostatic hormones, in Ca2\u00a0+- and ion-transporting epithelia, and in skeleton. Since CaSR is restricted in its presence to the chordate\u2013vertebrate evolutionary lineage, we propose there to be important functional ties between CaSRs and vertebrate skeleton in the context of that group's characteristic form of calcium-mineralized skeleton. Since little is known about CaSR in the skeletal biology of non-mammalian vertebrates, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were applied to adult and embryonic zebrafish to reveal CaSR transcript and protein expression in several tissues, including, among these, chondrocytes and developing bone and notochord as components in skeletal development. Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) knockdown technique was used to probe CaSR role(s) in the zebrafish model system. By RT-PCR assessment, injection of a splice-inhibiting CaSR MO reduced normally-spliced Casr gene transcript expression measured at 2\u00a0days postfertilization (dpf). Corresponding to the knockdown of normally-spliced mRNA by the CaSR MO, we observed a morphant phenotype characterized by stunted growth and disorganization of the notochord and axial skeleton by 1\u00a0dpf. We conclude that, like its critically important role in normal bone development in mammals, CaSR is essential in skeletogenesis in fishes.",

The imminent increase in ocean pCO2 is predicted to have negative consequences for marine fishes, including reduced aerobic performance, but variability among species could be expected. Understanding interspecific responses to ocean acidification is important for predicting the consequences of ocean acidification on communities and ecosystems. In the present study, the effects of exposure to near-future seawater CO2 (860\u00a0\u03bcatm) on resting ( M \u02d9 O2rest) and maximum ( M \u02d9 O2max) oxygen consumption rates were determined for three tropical coral reef fish species interlinked through predator\u2013prey relationships: juvenile Pomacentrus moluccensis and Pomacentrus amboinensis, and one of their predators: adult Pseudochromis fuscus. Contrary to predictions, one of the prey species, P. amboinensis, displayed a 28\u201339% increase in M \u02d9 O2max after both an acute and four-day exposure to near-future CO2 seawater, while maintaining M \u02d9 O2rest. By contrast, the same treatment had no significant effects on M \u02d9 O2rest or M \u02d9 O2max of the other two species. However, acute exposure of P. amboinensis to 1400 and 2400\u00a0\u03bcatm CO2 resulted in M \u02d9 O2max returning to control values. Overall, the findings suggest that: (1) the metabolic costs of living in a near-future CO2 seawater environment were insignificant for the species examined at rest; (2) the M \u02d9 O2max response of tropical reef species to near-future CO2 seawater can be dependent on the severity of external hypercapnia; and (3) near-future ocean pCO2 may not be detrimental to aerobic scope of all fish species and it may even augment aerobic scope of some species. The present results also highlight that close phylogenetic relatedness and living in the same environment, does not necessarily imply similar physiological responses to near-future CO2.",

     "abstract": "In order to maximize protein digestion, the release of enzymes into the gut lumen is closely controlled by a regulatory loop. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is among the enteric hormones that play a key role in the control of digestive enzyme secretion, but its role in first-feeding larvae is still unclear and may differ between species. However, in all marine fish larvae that have not developed a stomach by first-feeding, trypsin is the most important proteolytic enzyme. In order to examine the regulation and feedback mechanisms in the gut of larval cod, we therefore studied the interactions between cholecystokinin and tryptic enzyme activity following the administration of solutions containing test substances directly into the gut. We tube-fed a single dose of physiological saline solution containing either CCK, CCK antagonist, trypsin inhibitor, phytohemagglutinin (PHA; a possible trigger for the digestive response) or physiological saline alone, while a further control group was left untreated. We then followed the response in CCK and tryptic enzyme activity for 0.5\u20138\u00a0h after the administration. We performed the experiment on larvae at 26\u00a0day post first-feeding, which is before the stomach has evolved and the size of the larvae allows easier handling. Individual larvae were analyzed for CCK and tryptic enzyme activity using radioimmunoassay and fluorimetric techniques respectively. Both factors varied over time in the untreated control group, possibly due to an endogenous daily rhythm. The higher CCK levels at 4\u00a0h and 8\u00a0h in the saline-injected group may be caused by reflexes initiated by distension of the gut. An increase in tryptic enzyme activity after injection of CCK supports the hypothesis that this hormone plays a part in the release of pancreatic enzymes in larval cod at this developmental stage. However, administration of a CCK antagonist and a trypsin inhibitor did not reveal conclusive results, probably due to the relatively low concentrations used. The response in tryptic activity in the PHA group was similar to the administration of CCK, pointing towards a stimulatory effect of PHA on the proteolytic enzyme capacity of cod larvae.",

At the cellular/functional level, ovarian development and ovarian and hepatic total lipid levels were examined. At the molecular level, transcript abundance of ovarian follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSH-R) and luteinizing hormone receptor (LH-R) was measured.

There were no significant differences between treatments with regard to oocyte size and lipid contents of liver and ovary. Messenger RNA levels of FSH-R and LH-R were significantly lower in the treated females. Similarly, cAMP levels were significantly lower in the ovarian fragments of the 11-KT implanted females. These results suggest that 11-KT specifically, but possibly androgens in general, may not have an important function in regulating gonadal development of previtellogenic female hapuku; indeed, if anything, 11-KT appeared to have a detrimental effect and its use will not be beneficial in advancing sexual maturity of hapuku in aquaculture.",

Systematic changes in hemolymph ecdysteroid titer then occurred during egg development. There was a clear circadian rhythm in the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer throughout egg development. This is the first report of an ecdysteroid rhythm in any adult female insect. Of various tissues examined in vitro, only ovaries released ecdysteroids. The amounts released were adequate to account for observed hemolymph ecdysteroid titers. Therefore, ovaries are the primary, perhaps sole, source of hemolymph ecdysteroids. Ovaries in vitro showed a circadian rhythm of changes in ecdysteroid content and release that was in synchrony with the hemolymph ecdysteroid rhythm, indicating that ovarian ecdysteroid release drives the rhythm seen in the hemolymph. Potential regulation of ovarian ecdysteroids is discussed in relation to the known rhythms in prothoracicotropic hormone and insulin-like peptides that occur during egg development. The prospect of circadian regulation of egg development itself by hormones and/or an ovarian clock is also discussed.",

Analysis of the red and white muscle transcriptome in resting or swimming (1.3 body lengths/s) fish for 30\u00a0days revealed significant changes in the expression of a large number of genes (395 and 597, respectively), with a total of 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common for both muscles.

Additionally, DEGs in both muscles were involved in processes of defense response and apoptosis.

Based on the recent discovery that males swim even more efficiently than females, it was predicted that males also would be able to swim ~\u00a06000\u00a0km within six months. Additionally, eels do not mature naturally in captivity due to strong neural inhibition. Earlier, it was hypothesized that swimming exercise is a natural trigger to induce sexual maturation and may even result in full maturation. In the present study two groups of farmed male silver eels were subjected to either endurance swimming or resting for up to 6\u00a0months. It was found that male eels were able to swim continuously for a total distance of 6670\u00a0km within 6\u00a0months. The body weight decrease in swimming and resting males after 6\u00a0months was similar (<\u00a030\u00a0g) underlining the extreme low energy cost of swimming. In contrast to our expectation long-term swimming did not induce sexual maturation in farmed silver eels, suggesting that swimming alone is not sufficient as a trigger for sexual maturation.

In experiment 2, feeding the 4% ARG diet significantly increased the amplitude of pulsatile plasma GH levels and also significantly increased IGF-I mRNA in liver and muscle, (at 2\u00a0h PP) and plasma IGF-I levels (at 6\u00a0h PP). Although relatively infrequent sampling failed to reveal alterations in TH or GH levels in response to ARG-induced growth activation, PP high frequency sampling unveiled high amplitude pulsatile GH secretions and may be important in activating IGF production in target tissues. Additionally, expressed and secreted IGF-I exhibited discernible patterns which closely correlate with ARG-induced growth effects in catfish.",

     "abstract": "Selection for growth-related traits in domesticated fishes often results in predictable changes within the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF-1) axis. Little is known about the mechanisms controlling changes in growth capacity resulting from fishery-induced evolution. We took advantage of a long-term study where Menidia menidia were selected for size at age over multiple generations to mimic fisheries-induced selection. This selection regime produced three populations with significant differences in intrinsic growth rate. These growth differences partially rebounded, but persisted even after selection was relaxed, resulting in fast, intermediate, and slow-growing lines. Plasma IGF-1 was measured in these populations as a potential target of selection on growth. IGF-1 was significantly correlated with current length and mass, and was positively correlated with growth rate (g d\u00a0\u22121) in two lines, indicating it may be an appropriate indicator of growth capacity. The slow-growing line exhibited higher overall IGF-1 levels relative to the depressed IGF-1 seen in the fast-growing line, contrary to our prediction. We offer possible explanations for this unusual pattern and argue that somatic growth is likely to be under control of mechanism(s) downstream to IGF-1. IGF-1 provides an interesting basis for understanding endocrine control of growth in response to artificial selection and recovery.",

     "abstract": "Kisspeptins, encoded by kiss genes, have emerged as critical regulator of reproductive function in vertebrates. Our previous studies demonstrated that the chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) brain expresses kiss1 and kiss2 and peripheral administration of synthetic Kiss1 pentadecapeptide (Kiss1-15) but not Kiss2 dodecapeptide (Kiss2-12) induces spermiation in sexually immature adult chub mackerel. In the present study, we evaluated the potency of Kiss1-15, Kiss2-12, and GnRH analogue (GnRHa) to induce pubertal onset in prepubertal chub mackerel. Peptides were administered through subcutaneous injection for three times (bi-weekly) over 6\u00a0weeks. Interestingly, gonadosomatic index (GSI) of Kiss1-15 treated fish increased significantly in comparison to other treatments. Histologically, 66.7% of Kiss1-15 treated fish exhibited presence of spermatozoa (SPZ) in the testes with only 28.6% of GnRHa treated fish. However, Kiss2-12 treated fish showed only spermatocytes (SC) as the advanced germ cells in the testes. In contrast, only spermatogonia (SPG) were observed in the testes of control fish. Changes in the number of testicular germ cells among treatments revealed a significantly higher number of SC, spermatids and SPZ in the Kiss1-15 treated fish. Gene expression analyses revealed no significant changes in gnrh1 in the telencephalon-preoptic region of the brain, including fsh\u03b2 and lh\u03b2 in the pituitary of experimental fish. However, GnRHa treated fish showed significantly higher lh\u03b2 expression. Levels of sex steroids, 11-ketotestosterone and estradiol-17\u03b2 were significantly higher in Kiss1-15 treated fish. These results indicate application of Kiss1-15 peptides for accelerating pubertal onset in chub mackerel.",

Selected fish were collected in July at the Tagus estuary (24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0\u00b0C; salinity of 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u2030; pH\u00a0=\u00a08). Fish were subjected to a temperature increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0C.h\u2212\u00a01 until they reached their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax), starting at 24\u00a0\u00b0C (control temperature). Muscle samples were collected during the trial and results showed that oxidative stress biomarkers are highly sensitive to temperature. Results from stress oxidative enzymes show alterations with increasing temperature in all tested species. Catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) activity significantly increased in L. ramada, D. labrax and decreased in D. vulgaris. Glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) activity increased in L. ramada, D. sargus, D. vulgaris, and D. labrax. In G. niger it showed a cycle of increase-decrease. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased in L. ramada, D. sargus and D. labrax. With respect to correlation analysis (Pearson; Spearman r), the results showed that oxidation products and antioxidant defenses were correlated in L. ramada (LPO-CAT and LPO-GST, D. sargus (LPO-CAT), and D. labrax (LPO-CAT). Oxidative biomarkers were correlated with thermal stress biomarker (Hsp70) in L. ramada (CAT-Hsp70), D. vulgaris (LPO-Hsp70), D. labrax (GST-Hsp70) and G. niger (LPO-Hsp70). In conclusion, oxidative stress does occur with increasing temperatures and there seems to be a relation between thermal stress response and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that oxidative stress biomarkers should be applied with caution, particularly in field multi-species/multi-environment studies.",

     "abstract": "In birds, fatty acids (FA) serve as the primary metabolic fuel during exercise and fasting, and their composition affects metabolic rate and thus energy requirements. To ascertain the relationship between FAs and metabolic rate, a distinction should be made between structural and fuel lipids. Indeed, increased unsaturation of structural lipid FAs brings about increased cell metabolism, and changes in the FA composition of fuel lipids affects metabolic rate through selective mobilization and increasing availability of specific FAs. We examined the effects of acclimation to a low ambient temperature (Ta: 12.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0\u00b0C) and nutritional status (fed or unfed) on the FA composition of four tissues in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica. Differentiating between neutral (triglycerides) and polar (phospholipids) lipids, we tested the hypothesis that both acclimation to low Ta and nutritional status modify FA composition of triglycerides and phospholipids. We found that both factors affect FA composition of triglycerides, but not the composition of phospholipids. We also found changes in liver triacylglyceride FA composition in the low-Ta acclimated quail, namely, the two FAs that differed, oleic acid (18:1) and arachidonic acid (20:4), were associated with thermoregulation. In addition, the FAs that changed with nutritional status were all reported to be involved in regulation of glucose metabolism, and thus we suggest that they also play a role in the response to fasting.",

TCs are originated from embryonic serosal membrane at hatch of C. plutellae egg. Injection of in vitro cultured TCs significantly prolonged a larval period of nonparasitized P. xylostella and impaired a larva-to-pupa metamorphosis. This developmental alteration was also induced by injection of TC-cultured medium (TCM). However, heat-treated TCM significantly lost the inhibitory activity against larval development of P. xylostella. Larvae treated with TC or TCM appeared to undergo abnormal endocrine conditions. Juvenile hormone esterase activity was significantly suppressed at early last instar by injection of TC or TCM. In addition, expression of ecdysone receptor at final instar was lost, but that of insulin receptor was maintained until the end of the larval period in TC or TCM treatment. A proteomic analysis of TCM predicted several teratocyte-secreting proteins (TSPs). The inhibitory effect of host development by TCs was significantly enhanced by an addition of another parasitic factor, C. plutellae bracovirus. These results suggest that C. plutellae TC plays a crucial role in alteration of host development by secreting TSPs.",

The polar lipid and protein components of the yolk are delivered to oocytes by circulating vitellogenins, however the source(s) of the neutral lipid remains unknown. We cloned a cDNA encoding an orthologue of low-density-lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) from the ovary of cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki (ct-Ldlr). Predominant expression of ct-ldlr mRNA was observed in the ovary and moderate expression was detected in intestine, gill and brain. The relative abundance of ct-ldlr transcripts was highest in early pre-vitellogenic ovaries and significantly decreased during vitellogenesis, followed by a slight increase during final maturation and in post-ovulatory follicles. In situ hybridization revealed an intense and evenly distributed localization of ct-ldlr transcripts in the ooplasm of pre-vitellogenic oocytes and these signals disappeared in vitellogenic follicles. Collectively, these results suggest that the Ldlr is involved in deposition of yolk lipids in cutthroat trout oocytes. The ct-ldlr transcripts also were detected in theca and granulosa cells, suggesting that this receptor may be involved in cholesterol uptake for ovarian steroidogenesis. This is the first report on partial characterization of an ldlr orthologue in any fish species.",

Being able to measure key metabolic costs of animals under natural conditions is therefore an important tool in behavioral ecology. One method for estimating activity-specific metabolic rate is via derived measures of acceleration, often \u2018overall dynamic body acceleration\u2019 (ODBA), recorded by an instrumented acceleration logger. ODBA has been shown to correlate well with rate of oxygen consumption ( V \u02d9 o2) in a range of species during activity in the laboratory. This study devised a method for attaching acceleration loggers to decapod crustaceans and then correlated ODBA against concurrent respirometry readings to assess accelerometry as a proxy for activity-specific energy expenditure in a model species, the American lobster Homarus americanus. Where the instrumented animals exhibited a sufficient range of activity levels, positive linear relationships were found between V \u02d9 o2 and ODBA over 20\u00a0min periods at a range of ambient temperatures (6, 13 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C). Mixed effect linear models based on these data and morphometrics provided reasonably strong predictive power for estimating activity-specific V \u02d9 o2 from ODBA. These V \u02d9 o2\u2013ODBA calibrations demonstrate the potential of accelerometry as an effective predictor of behavior-specific metabolic rate of crustaceans in the wild during periods of activity.",

In particular the substrate specificity, the ionic requirements, and possible effects of pH were examined. Among the organic substrates, leucine, glycine, serine and valine generated the largest transport currents with apparent affinities in the lower millimolar range. The importance of Na+ as the driver ion in the transport process is confirmed, although Li+ is also capable to sustain transport, while K+ is not. No evidence of a relevant role of Cl\u2212 in the transport activity was found.

We also measured the biochemical indices of both trained and non-trained fish immediately after Ucrit, after exhaustive exercise and 1\u00a0h after exhaustive exercise. The aerobic swimming performance, as indicated by Ucrit, increased significantly after exercise training, most likely because of the higher tissue metabolic capacity, as suggested by the higher CS activity in the red muscle tissue, and the higher energy store and more efficient substrate utilization, as suggested by higher liver and muscle glycogen contents at rest but lower tissue glycogen contents after Ucrit. The lower lactate content after Ucrit is most likely because of higher aerobic metabolic capacity, and (or) the clearance rate of lactate in trained fish may also contribute to improved aerobic swimming performance. Compared to Ucrit, exhaustive exercise elicited higher plasma and muscle lactate contents. The anaerobic metabolic performance is not affected by the exercise training, as suggested by the EPOC. However, trained fish did show higher lactate clearance rates, as suggested by lower muscle lactate content after a 1\u00a0h recovery period following exhaustive exercise compared to non-trained fish. Furthermore, trained fish decreased their liver and muscle glycogen contents more profoundly after exhaustive exercise, suggesting that training can improve the substrate utilization during anaerobic exercise.",

Preload plasma glucose levels were similar for seabass and rats (3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 and 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mmol\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01, respectively) but post-load plasma glucose was significantly higher in seabass compared to rats (14.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 versus 5.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0mmol\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In conclusion, G6P-H2 and body water exchange is incomplete for both species and has to be accounted for in estimating hepatic glycogen synthesis and direct pathway activities with labeled water tracers. Transaldolase-mediated exchange is insignificant. Hepatic direct pathway glycogenesis plays a prominent role in seabass glucose load disposal, but a negligible role in the rat.",

     "abstract": "We examined morphological changes and molecular mechanisms of ion regulation in mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells of Japanese eel acclimated to different environmental salinities. Electron microscopic observations revealed that the apical membrane of MR cells appeared as a flat or slightly projecting disk with a mesh-like structure on its surface in eel acclimated to freshwater (FW). In seawater (SW)-acclimated eel, in contrast, the apical membrane of MR cells showed a slightly concave surface without a mesh-like structure. The mRNA expression of Na+/H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3) in deionized FW and normal SW was higher than that in normal FW and 30%-diluted SW. Expression of Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter-1a (NKCC1a) became higher with increasing environmental salinity. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the apical NHE3 immunoreaction was stronger in deionized FW and normal SW than in the other groups. Basolateral NKCC1 immunoreaction was most intense in normal SW. These results indicate that apical NHE3 is involved in ion uptake in fish acclimated to hypotonic environments, and that basolateral NKCC1 is important for acclimation to hypertonic environments. The relatively high expression of NHE3 in SW further indicates a possible role of NHE3 in acid-base regulation in the gills in SW-acclimated fish.",

     "abstract": "Marine tetrapods evolved specific excretory structures (e.g. salt glands) that maintain salt concentrations within a narrow range of variation. However, recent investigations showed that in some lineages (sea snakes), individuals dehydrate in seawater and cannot equilibrate their hydromineral balance without access to fresh water. How these marine species cope with salt gain is therefore puzzling. We sampled two species of amphibious sea kraits (Laticauda saintgironsi and L. laticaudata) in the field. We also experimentally investigated patterns of salt regulation, specifically variations in natremia (plasma sodium) and body mass (net water flow), in individuals transferred first to fresh water and then to seawater. Our results show that free-ranging sea kraits display hypernatremia (up to 205\u00a0mmol\u00b7l\u2212\u00a01). Experimental data showed that natremia markedly decreased in snakes exposed to fresh water and increased when they were transferred to saltwater, thereby demonstrating a marked flexibility in their relation to environmental conditions. A literature survey indicated that all free-ranging marine snake species usually display hypernatremia despite having functional salt glands. Overall, sea snakes exhibit a marked tolerance to salt load compared to other marine tetrapods and apparently trigger substantial salt excretion only once natremia exceeds a high threshold. We hypothesise that this high tolerance significantly decreases energetic costs linked to salt gland functioning.",

     "abstract": "Seasonal torpor or hibernation is a phenomenon characterized by a physiological transition to dormancy (torpor) during challenging periods in terms of energy availability or metabolic load. Extensive physiological reprogramming and changes in gene-expression, immune function, oxygen transport and intermediate metabolism, occur during eutherian hibernation. Here we studied the seasonality of blood parameters, and during daily torpor, in a South American marsupial (Dromiciops gliroides). Seasonal trends in blood parameters showed an increase in hematological parameters during winter, and increases in total proteins, albumin and globulin during autumn. In contrast, torpor induced a drastic drop during most blood parameters. PCV dropped significantly 60%, as well as RBC (58%), hemoglobin concentration (58%), WBC (79%), including neutrophils (51%), eosinophils (84%) and lymphocytes (82%). Biochemical parameters also showed reductions: triglycerides (81%), proteins (32%), albumin (24%), globulins (38%), albumin (24%), creatinine (48%) and glucose (42%). Our results confirm some patterns observed in hibernating eutherians, such as leukopenia, probably caused by sequestration of white blood cells in organs. However, red blood cells and hemoglobin concentration also were reduced, which is to the best of our knowledge has not been reported for marsupials. The observed reduction in biochemical parameters suggests that marsupials, as in eutherians, change from carbohydrate-based to lipid-based metabolism during hibernation. However, the absence of increases in beta-hydroxybutyrate is puzzling. Finally, we found an increase (although non-significant after statistical correction for multiple comparisons) of creatine kinase which together with an increase in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio could be indicative of muscle lysis and inflammation. These results indicate profound changes in standard physiological processes during torpor.",

This study focused on how avian renal structure and glomerular perfusion change in concert during development, as well as on changes in body fluid compartment osmolalities. White leghorn chicken eggs were incubated at 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 55\u201360% relative humidity and were examined during days (D) 10\u201318 of development. Alcian blue, a stain that forms solid aggregations in actively perfused glomeruli of the metanephric kidney, was used to identify the proportion of glomeruli actually perfused. Total nephron number increased from 4705\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01599 nephrons/kidney on day 12 to 39,825\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03051 nephrons/kidney on day 18.

Glomerular volume increased from days 12 to 14, remaining constant thereafter. Blood and cloacal fluid osmolality ranged from 270 to 280 mOsm/L. Amniotic fluid osmolality changed in a complex fashion during development but was comparable to blood on days 10 and 18. Allantoic fluid had the lowest osmolalities (175\u2013215 mOsm/L) across development. Uric acid increased steadily within the allantoic fluid compartment, from 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mmol/L to 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0mmol/L.

Both hybrid striped bass and tilapia exhibited barotraumas such as swim bladder ruptures, herniations, and hematomas to several organs. Hybrid striped bass exposed to the highest sound level had significant numbers of damaged hair cells, while no damage was found when fish were exposed at lower sound levels. Considerable hair cell damage was found in only one out of 11 tilapia specimens exposed at the highest sound level. Results suggest that impulsive sounds such as from pile driving may have a more significant effect on the swim bladders and surrounding organs than on the inner ears of fishes, at least at the sound exposure levels used in this study.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) are rate-limiting enzymes in bile acid synthesis. In addition, a small heterodimer partner (SHP) is also known to inhibit bile acid synthesis via the suppression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 expression. However, little information is currently available regarding primary structure of the genes involved in bile acid synthesis in fish. We therefore cloned cyp7a1, cyp8b1 and shp genes from rainbow trout and obtained cDNAs encoding two isoforms each of Cyp7a1 (-1 and -2), Cyp8b1 (-1 and -2) and Shp (-1 and -2). Both cyp7a1-1 and -2 encoded proteins of 512 amino acids. Trout cyp7a1-1 was expressed not only primarily in the kidney, pyloric caecum and mid-gut, but also weakly in the liver, eye, gill and ovary. cyp7a1-2 was highly expressed in the liver, pyloric caecum and mid-gut. cyp8b1-1 and -2, which encoded proteins of 512 and 509 amino acids, respectively, were principally expressed in the liver. Both shp-1 and -2, which encoded proteins of 288 and 290 amino acids, respectively, were strongly expressed in the liver, but shp-2 was also highly expressed in the gallbladder and digestive tract. The temporal changes in the expression of cyp7a1-1/-2, cyp8b1-1/-2 and shp-1/-2 in the liver were assessed after consumption of a single meal. Expression of cyp7a1-1/-2 and cyp8b1-1/-2 increased within 3\u00a0h post feeding (hpf) when the stomach was still approximately 84% full and the gallbladder was almost completely empty. Although the expression of shp-1 did not change after feeding, the expression pattern of shp-2 was inversely related to the expression patterns of cyp7a1-1/-2 and cyp8b1-1/-2. Specifically, shp-2 expression decreased until 3 hpf before returning to initial levels at 24 hpf. These findings suggest that Cyp7a1s/8b1s and Shp-2 function antagonistically in bile acid synthesis in rainbow trout.",

Ucides cordatus, a mangrove crab, is naturally exposed to fluctuations in calcium and salinity. To study calcium transport in this species during isosmotic conditions, dissociated gill cells were marked with fluo-3 and intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ change was followed by adding extracellular Ca2\u00a0+ as CaCl2 (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0 and 5\u00a0mM), together with different inhibitors. For control gill cells, Ca2\u00a0+ transport followed Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with Vmax\u00a0=\u00a00.137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 \u2206Ca2\u00a0+i (\u03bcM\u00a0\u00d7\u00a022.104\u00a0cells\u2212\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0180\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01; N\u00a0=\u00a04; r2\u00a0=\u00a00.99); Km\u00a0=\u00a00.989\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.027\u00a0mM. The use of different inhibitors for gill cells showed that amiloride (Na+/Ca2\u00a0+ exchange inhibitor) inhibited 80% of Ca2\u00a0+ transport in gill cells (Vmax). KB-R, an inhibitor of Ca influx in vertebrates, similarly caused a decrease in Ca2\u00a0+ transport and verapamil (Ca2\u00a0+ channel inhibitor) had no effect on Ca2\u00a0+ transport, while nifedipine (another Ca2\u00a0+ channel inhibitor) caused a 20% decrease in Ca2\u00a0+ affinity compared to control values. Ouabain, on the other hand, caused no change in Ca2\u00a0+ transport, while vanadate increased the concentration of intracellular calcium through inhibition of Ca2\u00a0+ efflux probably through the plasma membrane Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase. Results show that transport kinetics for Ca2\u00a0+ in these crabs under isosmotic conditions is lower compared to a hyper-regulator freshwater crab Dilocarcinus pagei studied earlier using fluorescent Ca2\u00a0+ probes. These kinds of studies will help understanding the comparative mechanisms underlying the evolution of Ca transport in crabs living in different environments.",

     "abstract": "Many eukaryotes share a common response to environmental stresses. The responses include reorganization of cellular organelles and proteins. Similar stress responses between divergent species suggest that these protective mechanisms may have evolved early and been retained from the earliest eukaryotic ancestors. Many eukaryotic cells have the capacity to sequester proteins and mRNAs into transient stress granules (SGs) that protect most cellular mRNAs (Anderson and Kedersha, 2008). Our observations extend the phylogenetic range of SGs from trypanosomatids, insects, yeast and mammalian cells, where they were first described, to a species of the lophotrochozoan animal phylum Rotifera. We focus on the distribution of three proteins known to be associated with both ribosomes and SG formation: eukaryotic initiation factors eIF3B, eIF4E and T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1. We found that these three proteins co-localize to SGs in rotifers in response to temperature stress, osmotic stress and nutrient deprivation as has been described in other eukaryotes. We have also found that the large ribosomal subunit fails to localize to the SGs in rotifers. Furthermore, the SGs in rotifers disperse once the environmental stress is removed as demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells. These results are consistent with SG formation in trypanosomatids, insects, yeast and mammalian cells, further supporting the presence of this protective mechanism early in the evolution of eukaryotes.",

Here, such measurements were made using three sockeye salmon populations (Early Stuart, Chilko and Quesnel), which each performed two consecutive critical swimming speed (Ucrit) challenges to provide a comprehensive quantification of cardiovascular physiology, oxygen status and blood chemistry associated with swimming and recovery. Swim performance, oxygen uptake, cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume did not significantly vary at rest, during swimming or during recovery between populations or sexes. Despite incomplete metabolic recovery between swim challenges, all fish repeated their swim performance and similar quantitative changes in the cardiorespiratory variables were observed for each swim challenge. The high maximum cardiorespiratory performance and excellent repeat swim performance are clearly beneficial in allowing the salmon to maintain steady ground speeds and reach the distant spawning grounds in a timely manner.",

We identified the active component of carp serum to be transferrin. The zinc\u2013transferrin complex interacts with the transferrin receptor and stimulates the proliferation of immature red blood cells. In addition, the growth rate of the immature red blood cells was regulated by the supplied ZnCl2 concentration. Under stress, the zinc in the common carp digestive tract tissue was released and used as a signal to induce red blood cell formation in the head kidney.

In a previous study we have reported a low tolerance of Senegalese sole juveniles to dietary lipid levels and suggested a maximal dietary inclusion level of 8% lipids for both optimal growth and nutrient utilization. The mechanisms behind this apparent poor utilization of the dietary lipids are still to be elucidated. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the overall process of digestion and lipid absorption in relation to dietary lipid levels.Triplicate groups of twenty fish (mean initial mass 29\u00a0g) were fed two isonitrogenous diets (54% of protein dry matter basis) with different lipid levels (L4 and L17, 4 and 17% lipids dry matter basis), for 88\u00a0days. Protein and lipid apparent digestibility coefficients as well as lipase activity were similar in both groups suggesting that Solea senegalensis has the ability to digest equally well a low fat or a high fat diet. Plasma triglyceride concentrations were significantly higher 5 and 16\u00a0h after feeding in fish fed the L17 compared to those fed L4, following dietary lipid supply, demonstrating effective lipid absorption. Expression of proteins related to lipid transport (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein), trafficking (Fatty acid binding protein 11) and fatty acid uptake (VLDL-r) was significantly higher in liver of fish fed the high fat diet 16\u00a0h after the meal, but remained unchanged in muscle. In conclusion, it seems that high fat diets do not impair lipid digestion and absorption.",

This study tested an inhibitory effect of C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV) on the metamorphosis of P. xylostella. Parasitized P. xylostella exhibited significantly reduced prothoracic gland (PTG) development at the last instar compared to nonparasitized larvae. Expression of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) was markedly suppressed during the last instar larvae parasitized by C. plutellae. By contrast, expression of the insulin receptor (InR) significantly increased in the parasitized larvae. Microinjection of CpBV significantly inhibited the larva-to-pupa metamorphosis of nonparasitized larvae in a dose-dependent manner. Injection of CpBV also inhibited the expression of the EcR and increased the expression of the InR. Individual CpBV segments were transiently expressed in its encoded genes in nonparasitized larvae and screened to determine antimetamorphic viral gene(s). Out of 21 CpBV segments, two viral segments (CpBV-S22 and CpBV-S27) were proved to inhibit larva-to-pupa metamorphosis by transient expression assay. RNA interference of each gene encoded in the viral segments was applied to determine antimetamorphic gene(s). Protein tyrosine phosphatase, early expressed gene, and four hypothetical genes were selected to be associated with the antimetamorphic activity of CpBV. These results suggest that antimetamorphosis of P. xylostella parasitized by C. plutellae is induced by inhibiting PTG development and subsequent ecdysteroid signaling with viral factors of CpBV.",

     "abstract": "The ongoing debate about methods for fitting the two-parameter allometric equation y\u00a0=\u00a0axb to bivariate data seemed to be resolved recently when three groups of investigators independently reported that statistical models fitted by the traditional allometric method (i.e., by back-transforming a linear model fitted to log\u2013log transformations) typically are superior to models fitted by standard nonlinear regression. However, the narrow focus for the statistical analyses in these investigations compromised the most important of the ensuing conclusions. All the investigations focused on two-parameter power functions and excluded from consideration other simple functions that might better describe pattern in the data; and all relied on Akaike's Information Criterion instead of graphical validation to identify the better statistical model. My re-analysis of data from one of the studies (BMR vs. body mass in mustelid carnivores) revealed (1) that the best descriptor for pattern in the dataset is a straight line and not a two-parameter power function; (2) that a model with additive, normal, heteroscedastic error is superior to one with multiplicative, lognormal, heteroscedastic error; and (3) that Akaike's Information Criterion is not a generally reliable metric for discriminating between models fitted to different distributions. These findings have apparent implications for interpreting the outcomes of all three of the aforementioned studies. Future investigations of allometric variation should adopt a more holistic approach to analysis and not be wedded to the traditional allometric method.",

     "abstract": "Zebrafish scales consist of bone-forming osteoblasts, bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and calcified bone matrix. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the effects induced by dynamic and static acceleration, we investigated the scale osteoblast- and osteoclast-specific marker gene expression involving osteoblast\u2013osteoclast communication molecules. Osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds to the osteoclast surface receptor, RANK, and stimulates bone resorption. OPG, on the other hand, is secreted by osteoblast as a decoy receptor for RANKL, prevents RANKL from binding to RANK and thus prevents bone resorption. Therefore, the RANK\u2013RANKL\u2013OPG pathway contributes to the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by osteoblasts. Semaphorin 4D, in contrast, is expressed on osteoclasts, and binding to its receptor Plexin-B1 on osteoblasts results in suppression of bone formation. In the present study, we found that both dynamic and static acceleration at 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u2005g decreased RANKL/OPG ratio and increased osteoblast-specific functional mRNA such as alkaline phosphatase, while static acceleration increased and dynamic acceleration decreased osteoclast-specific mRNA such as cathepsin K. Static acceleration increased semaphorin 4D mRNA expression, while dynamic acceleration had no effect. The results of the present study indicated that osteoclasts have predominant control over bone metabolism via semaphorin 4D expression induced by static acceleration at 3.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\u2005g.",

     "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis whether developmental acclimation at ecologically relevant humidity regimes (40% and 75% RH) affects desiccation resistance of pre-adults (3rd instar larvae) and adults of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Additionally, we untangled whether drought (40% RH) acclimation affects cold-tolerance in the adults of D. melanogaster. We observed that low humidity (40% RH) acclimated individuals survived significantly longer (1.6-fold) under lethal levels of desiccation stress (0\u20135% RH) than their counter-replicates acclimated at 75% RH. In contrast to a faster duration of development of 1st and 2nd instar larvae, 3rd instar larvae showed a delayed development at 40% RH as compared to their counterparts grown at 75% RH. Rearing to low humidity conferred an increase in bulk water, hemolymph content and dehydration tolerance, consistent with increase in desiccation resistance for replicates grown at 40% as compared to their counterparts at 75% RH. Further, we found a trade-off between the levels of carbohydrates and body lipid reserves at 40% and 75% RH. Higher levels of carbohydrates sustained longer survival under desiccation stress for individuals developed at 40% RH than their congeners at 75% RH. However, the rate of carbohydrate utilization did not differ between the individuals reared at these contrasting humidity regimes. Interestingly, our results of accelerated failure time (AFT) models showed substantial decreased death rates at a series of low temperatures (0, \u2212\u00a02, or \u2212\u00a04\u00a0\u00b0C) for replicates acclimated at 40% RH as compared to their counter-parts at 75% RH. Therefore, our findings indicate that development to low humidity conditions constrained on multiple physiological mechanisms of water-balance, and conferred cross-tolerance towards desiccation and cold stress in D. melanogaster. Finally, we suggest that the ability of generalist Drosophila species to tolerate fluctuations in humidity might aid in their existence and abundance under expected changes in moisture level in course of global climate change.",

To elucidate potential effects of higher temperatures and PCO2 on physiology and biomineralization of marine bivalves, we exposed two bivalve species, the eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica and the hard clams Mercenaria mercenaria to different combinations of PCO2 (~\u00a0400 and 800\u00a0\u03bcatm) and temperatures (22 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C) for 15\u00a0weeks. Survival, bioenergetic traits (tissue levels of lipids, glycogen, glucose and high energy phosphates) and biomineralization parameters (mechanical properties of the shells and activity of carbonic anhydrase, CA) were determined in clams and oysters under different temperature and PCO2 regimes. Our analysis showed major inter-species differences in shell mechanical traits and bioenergetics parameters. Elevated temperature led to the depletion of tissue energy reserves indicating energy deficiency in both species and resulted in higher mortality in oysters. Interestingly, while elevated PCO2 had a small effect on the physiology and metabolism of both species, it improved survival in oysters. At the same time, a combination of high temperature and elevated PCO2 lead to a significant decrease in shell hardness in both species, suggesting major changes in their biomineralization processes. Overall, these studies show that global climate change and ocean acidification might have complex interactive effects on physiology, metabolism and biomineralization in coastal and estuarine marine bivalves.",

Fasting reduced growth, and based on gene expression analysis, increased capacity for protein degradation. Regardless of feeding treatment, triploids displayed slightly greater feed intake and specific growth rates than diploids. Continually fed triploids displayed lower expression of several autophagy-related genes than diploids, suggesting that reduced rates of protein degradation contributed to their faster growth. Reduced expression of ubiquitin ligases fbxo32 and fbxo25 and autophagy-related genes during refeeding implicates reduced proteolysis in recovery growth. At one week of refeeding triploids exhibited greater gains in eviscerated body weight and length, whereas diploids exhibited greater gains in gastrointestinal tract weights. During refeeding two autophagy-related genes, atg4b and lc3b, decreased within one week to continually fed levels in the triploids, but in diploids overshot in expression at one and two weeks of refeeding then rebounding above continually fed levels by week four, suggesting a delayed return to basal levels of proteolysis.",

When GFP was injected 30 and 90\u00a0min before YFP, and vice versa, the number of vesicles with pre-injected protein increased and the percentage of vesicles with colocalized GFP and YFP reduced. At the same time, the uptake rate of a protein injected later progressively and significantly decreased. Subcellular localization of endocytic receptors, megalin and cubilin, in renal PT cells after intravenous YFP introduction were revealed by immunofluorescent microscopy. Colocalization of internalized YFP with megalin or cubilin in the endocytic vesicles was demonstrated. The data suggest the possibility of protein uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis and the existence of a mechanism limiting the protein absorption rate in wintering frogs.",

     "abstract": "Reproductive potential of fish stocks is critically dependent on sperm performance in an aquatic environment. The aim of this study is to test hypotheses, which govern the initiation of sperm motility and swimming performance, through physiological functions of osmolality and Ca2\u00a0+ ion, in a threatened species of freshwater fish, the redside dace, Clinostomus elongatus. Spermatozoa motility was activated in either ionic or non-ionic media spanning a range of osmolalities. The role of Ca2\u00a0+ channels on induction of spermatozoa motility and velocity was experimentally investigated by diluting sperm in media that contain various Ca2\u00a0+ channel blockers. Results show that initiation of spermatozoa motility is a hypo-osmolality dependent mechanism. Inhibitors for L-type Ca2\u00a0+ channels partially prohibited initiation of spermatozoa motility, while velocity was significantly reduced in both L-type and T-type Ca2\u00a0+ channel blockers. Examination using W-7, an inhibitor for Ca2\u00a0+-dependent calmodulin, showed significant decreases in spermatozoa motility and velocity. Involvement for Ca2\u00a0+ in axonemal beating was confirmed by significant increases in velocity after adding Ca2\u00a0+ into the activation media, while motility remained unchanged in Ca2\u00a0+ supplemented activation media. Together, these findings suggest the involvement of Ca2\u00a0+ in hypo-osmolality-dependent initiation of spermatozoa motility mediated by activation of Ca2\u00a0+ binding protein in the axoneme of a freshwater fish sperm. Blocking Ca2\u00a0+ exchange through L- or T-type Ca2\u00a0+ channel influences flagellar beating force and leads to decrease in spermatozoa velocity.",

Field studies have shed light on the geographic distribution of the two common alleles (HbI1 and HbI2), and laboratory studies have shown effects of genotype on physiological traits such as growth, reproduction and hypoxia tolerance. The geographic distribution of alleles shows a correlation with temperature, with increasing frequency of HbI1 in warmer areas. This is likely due to temperature-related differences in oxygen affinity of the three genotypes. We provide a general ecological introduction to cod haemoglobin polymorphism and a detailed discussion of physiological studies, particularly laboratory growth studies. Although differences in oxygen uptake are almost certainly a contributory mechanism to observed differences in traits such as growth rate, many other environmental, behavioural and social factors may also contribute, making it difficult to quantify the effect of HbI either experimentally or in the field.",

     "publication date": "09-2013",
     "abstract": "In birds, corticosterone (CORT) appears to facilitate reproductive activity because baseline and stress-induced CORT levels are elevated in breeding individuals compared with other times of the year. In particular, CORT is lower in the sex providing most of the parental care (i.e., incubation), which could be an important adaptation to tolerate stressors that result in abandoning reproduction. Therefore, one explanation for sex differences in CORT is that lower levels are favoured during the incubation/parental phase of reproduction. Using two species of uniparental shorebird \u2013 polyandrous red phalaropes (Phalaropus fulicarius) and polygynous white-rumped sandpipers (Calidris fuscicollis) \u2013 we predicted that the incubating sex would have lower baseline and stress-induced CORT, and incubating individuals with lower CORT would more effectively defend nests against a simulated intrusion, would return more quickly afterwards, and would ultimately have higher hatch success. We found that phalaropes followed the predicted pattern: incubating individuals (males) had lower baseline and stress-induced CORT than females but for baseline CORT these differences existed prior to males commencing incubation. Incubating male phalaropes with lower baseline and stress-induced CORT returned to incubate more quickly after a disturbance and there was non-significant tendency for baseline CORT to be lower in successful nests. In sandpipers, we observed no sex differences and no significant relationships between individual CORT levels and nest defence behaviours or hatch success. Our results demonstrate that in phalaropes at least, selection favours lower baseline and stress-induced CORT during the nesting period. These results can explain sex differences in stress-induced levels of CORT, however sex differences in baseline CORT were present prior to incubation.",

Weekly plasma samples showed that leptin, glucose and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were significantly modulated by energy intake level. NEFA increased sharply but transiently in underfed camels of the UN-OV or OV-UN groups, whereas glucose and leptin concentrations decreased with underfeeding and increased with overfeeding with more significant effects in camels that were previously overfed or underfed, respectively. In experiment 2 twelve female camels were either normally watered (n\u00a0=\u00a06) or dehydrated (n\u00a0=\u00a06) during 23\u00a0d and then rehydrated during 4\u00a0d. Dehydration specifically increased blood hematocrit, plasma NEFA and glucose whereas leptin decreased slightly. For both experiments, leptinemia was positively related to hump adipocyte volume.

Taking into account that the actions of 5-HT and NPY on food intake in fish are similar to those observed in mammals, the objective of this study was to characterize a possible short-term interaction between hypothalamic 5-HT and NPY, by examining whether 5-HT regulates NPY gene expression, to help clarify the mechanism underlying the observed anorexigenic action of central 5-HT in the rainbow trout. We used qRT-PCR to determine the levels of NPY mRNA in the hypothalamus-preoptic area (HPA) of rainbow trout after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a single dose of dexfenfluramine (dFF, 3\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u00a0\u22121; 24\u00a0h-fasted and fed fish) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 5-HT (100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u00a0\u22121; 24\u00a0h-fasted fish). Significant suppression of food intake was observed after administration of 5-HT and dFF. No significant changes in NPY gene expression were obtained 150\u00a0min after administration of 5-HT or dFF. However, administration of the 5HT1B receptor agonist anpirtoline did not have any significant effect on food intake in rainbow trout.

     "abstract": "Intraspecific analyses of the relationship between metabolic rate and mass have rarely been considered during complete ontogeny. Spiny lobsters are fascinating candidates to examine metabolic changes during ontogeny because their life cycle includes an extended planktonic, nektonic, and benthic life stages. The effect of body mass on metabolic rates, aerobic scope, and ammonia-N excretion of Sagmariasus verreauxi juveniles were examined to determine energetic demands through juvenile development. Mass-independent routine oxygen consumption increased allometrically during juvenile development with a mass scaling exponent of 0.83. The mass scaling exponent of active metabolism (0.81) was reduced compared to standard metabolism (0.91) of juvenile lobsters. The aerobic scope of juvenile lobsters decreased with larger body mass. To examine if the mass scaling exponent varies with ontogeny, we compared our data with previous measurements made with larvae of the same species. Comparison between mass scaling exponents showed they were higher for phyllosoma (0.97) compared to juvenile (0.83) development. Higher scaling exponents for phyllosoma may be attributed to increased growth rates of phyllosoma compared to juveniles, which increase oxygen consumption due to the higher energy cost of growth. The mass scaling exponent for complete ontogeny (0.91) of S. verreauxi was larger than the commonly cited 0.67 (1/3) and 0.75 (3/4) mass scaling exponents, indicating that species-specific differences can be a large factor affecting allometric relationships of animals.",

     "abstract": "The increase in atmospheric CO2 due to anthropogenic activity results in an acidification of the surface waters of the oceans. The impact of these chemical changes depends on the considered organisms. In particular, it depends on the ability of the organism to control the pH of its inner fluids. Among echinoderms, this ability seems to differ significantly according to species or taxa. In the present paper, we investigated the buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid in different echinoderm taxa as well as factors modifying this capacity. Euechinoidea (sea urchins except Cidaroidea) present a very high buffer capacity of the coelomic fluid (from 0.8 to 1.8\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 SW above that of seawater), while Cidaroidea (other sea urchins), starfish and holothurians have a significantly lower one (from \u2212\u00a00.1 to 0.4\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 SW compared to seawater). We hypothesize that this is linked to the more efficient gas exchange structures present in the three last taxa, whereas Euechinoidea evolved specific buffer systems to compensate lower gas exchange abilities. The constituents of the buffer capacity and the factors influencing it were investigated in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the starfish Asterias rubens. Buffer capacity is primarily due to the bicarbonate buffer system of seawater (representing about 63% for sea urchins and 92% for starfish). It is also partly due to coelomocytes present in the coelomic fluid (around 8% for both) and, in P. lividus only, a compound of an apparent size larger than 3\u00a0kDa is involved (about 15%). Feeding increased the buffer capacity in P. lividus (to a difference with seawater of about 2.3\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 SW compared to unfed ones who showed a difference of about 0.5\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 SW) but not in A. rubens (difference with seawater of about 0.2 for both conditions). In P. lividus, decreased seawater pH induced an increase of the buffer capacity of individuals maintained at pH\u00a07.7 to about twice that of the control individuals and, for those at pH\u00a07.4, about three times. This allowed a partial compensation of the coelomic fluid pH for individuals maintained at pH\u00a07.7 but not for those at pH\u00a07.4.",

A variety of nitrodilators failed to elicit any changes in vascular tone, although a dilatation to exogenous cyclic GMP was noted. NOS3 antibody staining does not localise to endothelial markers in cryosections, and gives rise to non-specific staining of Western blots. Abundant NOS2 mRNA was found in all species but NOS3 was not found in any fish, while putative orthologues are not flanked by similar genes to NOS3 in humans. We conclude that NOS3 does not exist in fish, and that previous reports of its presence may reflect use of antibodies raised against mammalian epitopes.",

     "abstract": "Large changes in oxygen availability in aquatic environments, ranging from anoxia through to hyperoxia, can lead to corresponding wide variation in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by animals with aquatic respiration. Therefore, animals living in marine, estuarine and freshwater environments have developed efficient antioxidant defenses to minimize oxidative stress and to regulate the cellular actions of ROS. Changes in oxygen levels may lead to bursts of ROS generation that can be particularly harmful. This situation is commonly experienced by aquatic animals during abrupt transitions from periods of hypoxia/anoxia back to oxygenated conditions (e.g. intertidal cycles). The strategies developed differ significantly among aquatic species and are (i) improvement of their endogenous antioxidant system under hyperoxia (that leads to increased ROS formation) or other similar ROS-related stresses, (ii) increase in antioxidant levels when displaying higher metabolic rates, (iii) presence of constitutively high levels of antioxidants, that attenuates oxidative stress derived from fluctuations in oxygen availability, or (iv) increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (and/or the levels of their mRNAs) during hypometabolic states associated with anoxia/hypoxia. This enhancement of the antioxidant system \u2013 coined over a decade ago as \u201cpreparation for oxidative stress\u201d \u2013 controls the possible harmful effects of increased ROS formation during hypoxia/reoxygenation. The present article proposes a novel explanation for the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon that could be triggered by hypoxia-induced ROS formation. We also discuss the connections among oxygen sensing, oxidative damage and regulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense apparatus in animals adapted to many natural or man-made challenges of the aquatic environment.",

     "abstract": "Aquatic hypoxia is generally viewed as stressful for aerobic organisms. However, hypoxia may also benefit organisms by decreasing cellular stress, particularly that related to free radicals. Thus, an ideal habitat may have the minimum O2 necessary to both sustain aerobic metabolism and reduce the need to scavenge free radicals and repair free radical damage. The ability of aquatic organisms to sustain aerobic metabolism relates in part to the ability to maximize gas diffusion, which can be facilitated by small body size when O2 uptake occurs across the body surface, by a large gill surface area, or by the ability to use atmospheric air. We use water-breathing organisms in chronically hypoxic papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) swamps of East Africa to test the hypothesis that cellular-level benefits of hypoxia may translate into increased fitness, especially for small organisms. A review of recent studies of fingernail clams (Sphaerium sp.) shows that clams living in sustained hypoxia have minimized oxidative stress and that these cellular-level benefits may lead to increased fitness. We suggest that organisms in the extreme conditions in the papyrus swamps provide a unique opportunity to challenge the conventional classification of hypoxic habitats as \u2018stressful\u2019 and normoxic habitats as \u2018optimal.\u2019",

In recent years, genomic and proteomic approaches have been key drivers of advancement in the field, for example, providing knowledge about gene and protein expression, regulation of signal transduction pathways, and functional control of enzymes/proteins by reversible protein phosphorylation. Advances in comparative biochemistry have always drawn upon conceptual and technological advances that arise from \u201cmainline\u201d biochemistry and molecular biology, often from medical models. The present article discusses three such advances that will have major impacts on comparative biochemistry in the 21st century. The first is the crucial role of posttranslational modification in metabolic control, expanding outwards from reversible phosphorylation to explore the individual and interacting effects of protein modification by acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation and O-GlcNAcylation, among others. The second is the newly recognized role of non-coding RNA in the regulation of gene expression, particularly the action of microRNAs. The third is the emergence of powerful multiplex technology that allows rapid, high-throughput detection of analytes and will revolutionize RNA and protein profiling in the comparative biochemistry laboratory. Commercial tools such as Luminex allow researchers to simultaneously quantify up to 100 different analytes in a single sample, thereby creating broad functional analyses of metabolism and cell signaling pathways.",

Although some of these oxygen-derived metabolites are well-documented mediators of cell and tissue damage, others have been shown to be crucial for cell survival and homeostasis. One ROS that has been identified as a major second messenger in redox signaling is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This small, membrane-permeable oxidant is produced transiently in physiological (nontoxic) amounts by a variety of different enzymes residing within different subcellular compartments and organelles. There is an accumulating literature demonstrating that the reversible, H2O2-mediated oxidation of different signaling proteins is an important posttranslational mechanism that regulates a number of different biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, motility and apoptosis. Although several, well-characterized methods have been developed to quantify the generation of extracellular H2O2, the ability to unequivocally detect and quantify this important signaling molecule within living cells has been relatively limited. Fortunately, a great deal of progress has been made over the past few years in developing H2O2-selective probes that are capable of detecting physiological levels of this signaling molecule. This overview presents a critical evaluation of the established as well as the more recently developed methods to detect and quantify extracellular and intracellular H2O2 produced by living cells.",

In this study the freshwater zebrafish (Danio rerio) was exposed to two kinds of carbon NM, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and fullerenol [C60(OH)18\u201322(OK4)] to analyze oxidative stress responses on fish brain. Adult zebrafish (mean mass: 0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0g) were submitted to intraperitoneal injections of SWCNT suspension and fullerenol solution (30\u00a0mg/kg of fish), receiving one or two doses with a time interval of 24\u00a0h. Results showed that total antioxidant capacity was lowered in brains of fish exposed 24\u00a0h to fullerenol when compared to those from SWCNT treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After 48\u00a0h, fullerenol induced higher expression of both catalytic and regulatory subunits of enzyme glutamate cysteine ligase when compared to control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating an antioxidant behavior. In vitro assays showed a dual effect of SWCNT, since a pro-oxidant behavior was observed at low concentrations (0.1 and 1.0\u00a0mg/L) and an antioxidant one at the highest concentration (10.0\u00a0mg/L). Few biological responses were altered by this NM: decrease in total antioxidant capacity and induction of the expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 when compared to control group.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of free LA and LA-nanocapsules on antioxidant enzymes, the concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) and a by-product of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde), as well as the expression of gene coding for different forms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in model fish. For this, carp Cyprinus carpio (Cyprinidae) were exposed (i.p.) to different forms of LA (free and in nanocapsules) for different times (48\u00a0h, 96\u00a0h and 1\u00a0week) and the brain, liver and muscle were analyzed. Results indicated that the organs respond differently depending on the time and form in which LA was delivered. After 96\u00a0h and 1\u00a0week, a better antioxidant response was found generally in the formulation with nanocapsules. The nanocapsule composition showed to be a factor to be considered in future studies, because in some organs and exposure times empty nanocapsules promoted an antioxidant effect and in others a pro-oxidant effect.",

Muscle from shrimp exposed to Cd alone or Cd\u00a0+\u00a0As showed a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels, while the pre-treatment with LA reversed this situation. In this tissue, the pre-treatment with LA also induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in all groups.In hepatopancreas it was observed a marked accumulation of Cd and As, a decrease in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration in response to Cd exposure alone (\u2212\u00a0LA); concomitant in the same group it was observed an increment of metallothionein-like content. As exposure induced an increase in GSH levels but LA reversed this increase. Also, LA showed to increase the GST activity in all groups treated.

This phenomenon is well documented, but there are few studies on the toxic effects on the phytoplankton community. In the current study the relation of oxidative stress (TBARS, ROOH, RC\u00a0=\u00a0O) and antioxidant defenses (activities of SOD, CAT, GPx and GST) of two phytoplankton communities with BCF of heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn) and of PAHs (naphthalene, pyrene, indenol, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene) was tested. Three sampling surveys were conducted bimonthly on the surface and bottom at different sampling points in the lakes Menor and Mayor of the 2nd section of Chapultepec Park. Also negative and positive controls obtained in the laboratory were included. Toxicity relationships were analyzed using the integrated biomarker response (IBR). Both green algae and cyanobacteria dominated. The contents of ROOH and protein oxidation assessed as RC\u00a0=\u00a0O were higher in the Lago Menor, a water body that contains ancient sediments. Through the IBR it was demonstrated that these damages were influenced by Pb, indenol and benzo[b]fluoranthene. In contrast, TBARS content was higher in Lago Mayor, which has sediment in formation. Through IBR it was estimated that Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, indenol and benzo[b]fluoranthene were related to this damage. However, oxidative stress was accompanied by an induction of CAT and SOD, in contrast, GPx and GST had low or null activity. The field data were similar to the positive controls. We demonstrated for the first time that, although the phytoplankton suffers oxidative stress elicited by metals and PAHs, this community is able to counter this damage through antioxidant defenses. The effects of organic or inorganic toxics in phytoplankton depend on their bioavailability that is modulated by the sediment and also by its physicochemical properties and the characteristics of the abiotic medium.",

In this study, induction of pro-oxidant forces (CH2O, O2, H2O2), oxidative stress (TBARS, RCO) and antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the skin mucus layer regarding to the liver of Goodea gracilis exposed to CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and BrCHCl2 were evaluated, in addition to the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP 2E1) and glutathione S-transferase theta (GSTT) activities. Regardless of the implicit toxicity involved in the bioactivation of the HMs, carried out by the CYP 2E1 and GST, it was noticeable that this process induces oxidative stress. The usefulness of the mucus layer for the evaluation of the oxidative stress response was demonstrated, despite some peculiar characteristics concerning induction of oxidative stress in liver and skin mucous layer. However, for the understanding of the induction of reactive oxygen species in both targets it is essential to evaluate the activity of antioxidant defenses; otherwise the interpretation of toxic effects elicited by HMs would be erroneous. In the skin mucus layer, lower activities of the enzymes involved in antioxidant defense than in liver were observed. The evaluation of the biomarkers in the skin mucus layer involved in the oxidative stress is useful due the consistent response regarding to concentration of the HMs.",

The results demonstrated high toxicity with dishwasher detergent, resulting in high lipid peroxidation levels (MDA malondialdehyde evaluation). No differences in MDA concentrations were found among fish exposed to laundry detergent and organisms exposed to LAS. In the genetic damage evaluation, significant differences in the number of cells with DNA strand breaks (comets) were observed: the fish exposed to dishwasher detergent presented the highest number of damaged cells (79%), in comparison with those exposed to other products (laundry and LAS) and the control group (8% damaged cells). The toxicity of dishwasher detergent (biological detergent containing enzymes and perfume) was higher than the value observed with LAS. Laundry detergent does not contain enzymes or perfume and its toxicity was similar to LAS. Since detergents are complex mixtures of different substances, in which additive and/or synergistic effects may occur, the deleterious effect caused by the dishwasher detergent was probably due to the combined effects of the ingredients of detergent.",

A subsequent reverse acclimation protocol, where bishops were acclimated to a second Tacc value and then re-acclimated to the first, revealed that short-term changes in Mb and BMR were completely reversible, but changes in Msum were only partially reversible. Following the reverse-acclimation protocol, metabolic expansibility (Msum/BMR) varied significantly with air temperature, being greatest at Tacc\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0\u00b0C.

These results challenged the widespread notion that both elevated temperatures (e.g. 30\u00a0\u00b0C) and temperature fluctuations are required for digestion and growth in temperate climate reptiles. Here, we investigated the impact of constant cool temperatures on another physiological performance that is crucial to population persistence: gestation. At the time when reproductive females were midway through vitellogenesis, we placed ten reproductive and two non-reproductive female aspic vipers at each of two contrasted constant temperature conditions: cool (23\u00a0\u00b0C) versus warm (28\u00a0\u00b0C). Sixty percent of the females placed at 28\u00a0\u00b0C gave birth to healthy offspring, suggesting that constant warm body temperatures were compatible with normal offspring production. Conversely, none of the cool females gave birth to healthy offspring. A blister disease affected exclusively cool pregnant females. Apparently, the combination of cool temperatures plus gestation was too challenging for such females. Our results suggest that reproduction is more thermally sensitive than digestion or growth, indeed gestation faltered under moderately cool thermal constraints. This sensitivity could be a crucial factor determining the capacity of this species to colonize different habitats.",

For this purpose, the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and DT-diaphorase (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1) were measured together with the lipid peroxidation degree (malondialdehyde, MDA) in liver and brain tissues of the collected species. Only the brain tissue manifested a higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase in addition to a negative correlation between the values of MDA and MLSP among the different fish species. Hypotheses are proposed from the analysis of the obtained results that open new areas of research and converge on the importance of the theory of free radicals in the processes that condition the maximum life expectancy of an animal species.",

The relatively high [K+] confirms that CSF is produced by submucosal glands. Since the chemical energy of water of CSF was always higher than that of body fluids, diffusion of water would be from CSF to the interstitial fluid and not in the opposite direction. It is concluded that volume and composition of CSF are regulated by subepidermal exocrine gland secretion balanced by EWL into the atmosphere and ion reuptake by the epidermal epithelium. Previously discovered regulatory mechanisms of epithelial ion absorption, hitherto not ascribed a body function, fit well with a role in regulating turnover of CSF. As a regulated external physiological compartment, CSF would be of importance for the immune defenses that amphibians employ in protecting their skin.",

     "abstract": "Morpho-functional adjustments in the heart of juvenile tegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae) were analyzed at distinct seasonal periods to investigate how the demands of growth and of energy saving are reconciled during the first annual cycle. The relative ventricular mass (Mv) was 31% and 69% larger in late autumn and winter dormancy, respectively, compared to early autumn. This effect did not persist during unfed arousal, suggesting that protein accumulates in the heart during hypometabolism and is degraded on arousal. Both the hypertrophy and the atrophy were disproportionate in the largest individuals. In contrast, Mv was smaller in lizards that were starved during spring activity compared to fed lizards, this effect being larger in smaller individuals. In late autumn and winter dormancy the spongy myocardium had 8% of the section area covered by lacunary spaces, which expanded after food intake during arousal and reached 29% in spring activity together with higher density of cardiomyocytes. Total and soluble proteins per mass unity were unchanged, and maximum activities of selected enzymes suggest sustained glycolytic and aerobic capacities during hypometabolism. Results indicate that important structural adjustments occur in the heart in anticipation of dormancy, and that the protein balance in the tissue is maintained at winter temperatures ~\u00a017\u00a0\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "African egg-eating snakes (Dasypeltis) feed only on freshly laid bird eggs which they perforate within their esophagus before swallowing the liquid contents and regurgitating the empty shell. Compared to a snake\u2019s typical intact meal, the liquid diet of Dasypeltis would expectedly generate a more moderate postprandial metabolic response and specific dynamic action (SDA). Free-ranging Dasypeltis feed over a range of ambient temperatures and thereby experience predicted temperature-dependent shifts in the duration and magnitude of their postprandial metabolic response. Such shifts would undoubtedly be shared among different species and age classes of Dasypeltis. To examine these expectations, we measured pre- and postprandial metabolic rates of adult Dasypeltis inornata and adult and neonate Dasypeltis scabra in response to liquid egg meals weighing 20% of snake body mass at 20, 25, 27, 30, and 32\u00a0\u00b0C. With an increase in body temperature, postprandial metabolic profiles of neonate and adult snakes became narrower and shorter in duration. Specific dynamic action varied among temperature treatments, increasing from 20 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Standard metabolic rate, postprandial peak metabolic rate, and SDA scaled with mass exponents that typically did not differ from 1.0. As expected, Dasypeltis digesting a liquid egg diet experienced a more modest postprandial response and SDA, expending on average only 10.6% of the meal\u2019s energy on the breakdown, absorption, and assimilation of the egg meal, whereas other colubrids consuming intact rodent or fish meals expend on average 16.3% of the meal\u2019s energy on digestion and assimilation. Actively foraging and feeding throughout the avian egg laying season enable Dasypeltis to survive when eggs are not available. The adaptive suite of traits that enable Dasypeltis to consume eggs of large relative size and ingest only the liquid contents may also be joined by physiological adaptations specific to their liquid diet and extended bouts of fasting.",

In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), energy demands are largely met by oxidation of glucose. In recent studies, in addition to glucose, lactate is also considered an energy substrate for the CNS. Astrocytes were demonstrated to play an important role in transporting lactate as metabolic substrate from capillaries to neurons through monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). The present study was to use zebrafish as an in vivo model to test the hypothesis of whether the various MCT homologs play differential roles in the development and functioning of the CNS. Using RT-PCR and double in situ hybridization coupling with immunocytochemical staining experiments, zebrafish MCTs1\u20134 were all found to be expressed in brains of embryos, and were further elucidated to be localized in both neurons and astrocytes. Loss-of-functions by morpholino knockdown further provided in vivo evidences to infer that zMCTs1, -2, and -4 may be involved in metabolite transport and functioning in the developing brain. Subsequent rescue experiments with capped mRNAs of specific isoforms further indicated that zMCT2 is an indispensable monocarboxylate-transporting route for CNS development and function in zebrafish. This information is essential for identifying proper candidates of MCT isoforms that are involved in the development and functioning of the CNS.",

     "abstract": "Fish early life stages have been shown to react sensitive to simulated ocean acidification. In particular, acid\u2013base disturbances elicited by altered seawater carbonate chemistry have been shown to induce pathologies in larval fish. However, the mechanisms underlying these disturbances are largely unknown. We used gene expression profiling of genes involved in acid\u2013base regulation and metabolism to investigate the effects of seawater hypercapnia on developing Japanese ricefish (medaka; Oryzias latipes). Our results demonstrate that embryos respond with delayed development during the time window of 2\u20135\u00a0dpf when exposed to a seawater pCO2 of 0.12 and 0.42\u00a0kPa. This developmental delay is associated with strong down-regulation of genes from major metabolic pathways including glycolysis (G6PDH), Krebs cycle (CS) and the electron transport chain (CytC). In a second step we identified acid\u2013base relevant genes in different ontogenetic stages (embryos, hatchlings and adults) and tissues (gill and intestine) that are up regulated in response to hypercapnia, including NHE3, NBCa, NBCb, AE1a, AE1b, ATP1a1a.1, ATP1a1b, ATP1b1a, Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg. Interestingly, NHE3 and Rhcg expressions were increased in response to environmental hypercapnia in all ontogenetic stages and tissues tested, indicating the central role of these proteins in acid\u2013base regulation. Furthermore, the increased expression of genes from amino acid metabolism pathways (ALT1, ALT2, AST1a, AST1b, AST2 and GLUD) suggests that energetic demands of hatchlings are fueled by the breakdown of amino acids. The present study provides a first detailed gene expression analysis throughout the ontogeny of a euryhaline teleost in response to seawater hypercapnia, indicating highest sensitivity in early embryonic stages, when functional ion regulatory epithelia are not yet developed.",

We then measured the critical swimming speed (Ucrit) and metabolic rate (MR) of hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish (under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions). The feeding rate (FR), feeding efficiency (FE) and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish in hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated groups were also measured. The Pcrit, ASR and LOE of hypoxia-acclimated fish were significantly lower than those of non-acclimated fish. Hypoxia acclimation resulted in a significantly higher Ucrit when the individuals swam in hypoxia. The Ucrit, maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and metabolic scope (MS) of both the hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish all decreased with the decrease of DO. However, the Ucrit, MMR and MS decreased by 31, 43 and 54%, respectively, in non-acclimated fish, whereas these values decreased by 15, 28 and 29%, respectively, in hypoxia-acclimated fish, which suggests that hypoxia-acclimated fish were less sensitive to the DO decrease. The FR, FE and SGR all decreased by 21, 20 and 45%, respectively, in the hypoxia-acclimated group compared to the non-acclimated group. This result suggests that diel-cycling hypoxia acclimation improved the hypoxia tolerance and aerobic swimming performance of southern catfish, whereas impaired the growth performance. The high hypoxia tolerance and physiological plasticity to hypoxia-acclimated southern catfish may be related to its lower maintenance energy expenditure, sit-and-wait lifestyle and bottom-dwelling living environment condition (usually facing oxygen fluctuation). The growth performance of so-called \u2018visceral type\u2019 fish species, such as southern catfish, are more sensitive to hypoxia compared to other fish species because of their high peak post-prandial metabolic rate, which may be restrained by the limited aerobic metabolic scope in hypoxia.",

     "abstract": "Adjustable hair bundle mechanoreceptors located on anemone tentacles detect movements of nearby, swimming prey. The hair bundles are formed by numerous actin-based stereocilia that converge onto a single, central kinocilium. Interestingly, morphological and functional changes to the hair bundles are induced by activating chemoreceptors that bind prey-derived N-acetylated sugars and proline, respectively. Morphological changes to the hair bundles involve alterations to the actin cytoskeleton of stereocilia. A pharmacological activation of Rho induces hair bundles to elongate to lengths comparable to those normally induced by exposure to N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) and prevents shortening of hair bundles normally induced by proline. Rho inhibition prevents NANA-induced elongation, but does not prevent proline-induced shortening of hair bundles. Western blots feature a band similar in mass to that predicted for a Rho homolog in the genome of Nematostella. Immunocytochemistry localizes Rho in stereocilia of the hair bundle. Anemone hair bundles arise from multicellular complexes. Data from experiments using heptanol, a gap junction uncoupler, indicate that cell\u2013cell communication is required in order for activated chemoreceptors to induce morphological changes to the hair bundles.",

Moreover, 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) was shown to bind and transcriptionally activate the mineralocorticoid receptor and may act as a mineralocorticoid in fish. Immune modulations induced by intraperitoneal injections of these two corticosteroids were assessed in Eurasian perch juveniles. Cortisol and DOC were injected at 0.8\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 and 0.08\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 body weight respectively.

Moreover, 6\u00a0h after injection, cortisol reduced expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 in spleen. DOC had no effects on the immune variables measured in plasma, but increased expression levels of C-type lysozyme and apolipoprotein A1 mRNA in both gills and spleen. Meanwhile, DOC stimulated its putative signalling pathway by increasing expression of mineralocorticoid receptor and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 in spleen. These results confirmed the role of cortisol as an innate, short term immune stimulator. For the first time, DOC is described as a possible immune stimulator in fish.",

The present study extends this work by examining effects of acute heat- and cold stress on total hemocyte counts (THCs) and expression of key regulatory molecules involved in responding to stress: tumor suppressor factor (p53), cell cycle arrest activator (p21), and a DNA base excision repair enzyme (apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)). Hyperthermia (28\u00a0\u00b0C, 32\u00a0\u00b0C) led to significant decreases of THCs in both species. The extent of decrease in THC was temperature-, time-, and species-dependent; lower THC values were found in M. californianus, the more cold-adapted species. Western blot analyses of hemocyte extracts with antibodies specific for p53 protein, several site-specific phosphorylation states of p53, p21 protein, and APE indicated that heat- and cold (2\u00a0\u00b0C) stress induced a time-dependent activation of stress-related proteins in response to DNA damage; these stress-induced changes could govern cell cycle arrest or DNA damage repair. Our results show that the downstream regulatory response to temperature-induced cell damage may play an important role in deciding cellular fate following heat- and cold stress. Compared to M. californianus, the more warm-adapted M. galloprovincialis appears to have a higher temperature tolerance due to a lesser reduction in THC, faster signaling activation and transduction, and stronger DNA repair ability following heat stress.",

     "abstract": "The strong dependence of metabolic rates on body mass has attracted the interest of ecological physiologists, as it has important implications to many aspects of biology including species variations in body size, the evolution of life history, and the structure and function of biological communities. The great diversity of observed scaling exponents has led some authors to conclude that there is no single universal scaling exponent, but instead it ranges from 2/3 to 1. Most of the telling evidence against the universality of power scaling exponents comes from ontogenetic changes. Nevertheless, there could be other sources of phenotypic variation that influence this allometric relationship at least at the intraspecific level. In order to explore the general concept of the metabolic scaling in terrestrial molluscs we tested the role of several biological and methodological sources of variation on the empirically estimated scaling exponent. Specifically, we measured a proxy of metabolic rate (CO2 production) in 421 individuals, during three generations, in three different populations. Additionally, we measured this scaling relationship in 208 individuals at five developmental stages. Our results suggest that the metabolic scaling exponent at the intraspecific level does not have a single stationary value, but instead it shows some degree of variation across geographic distribution, transgenerational change and ontogenetic stages. The major differences in the metabolic scaling exponent that we found were at different developmental stages of snails, because ontogeny involves increases in size at different rates, which in turn, generate differential energy demands.",

Among bio-indicators useful to monitor the toxicological effects of these chemicals, Cnidarians offer a unique model. Cnidarians possess highly specialized stinging cells, termed nematocytes, which respond to hyposmotic solution with well established homeostatic parameters as an acute osmotic phase (OP), leading to cell swelling, and then a slower regulatory volume decrease (RVD) phase, causing cell shrinkage. Here we report the effect of 65% artificial sea water (ASW) containing heavy metals, such as Cd, La, Co, Cu and Zn (concentrations comprised between 100 and 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM) on both OP and RVD in nematocytes isolated from the jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca by 605\u00a0mM NaSCN plus 0.01\u00a0mM Ca2\u00a0+. The exposure of the cells to Co and La inhibited RVD but not OP. However, Cu, Cd and Zn prevented the OP in a dose-dependent manner and, hence, also the detection of RVD. These results suggest that, in isolated nematocytes, heavy metal pollutants impair RVD either directly or indirectly through interference with the OP, thus negating RVD. Although further studies need to clarify the exact mechanisms whereby heavy metals exert their toxicity, it is evident that nematocytes of Cnidarians could serve as a model for ecotoxicological investigations.",

The period of heating increased after being treated with hypoxia (12% and 8% O2) for one week. Hysteresis of heart rate appeared at any given body temperature and oxygen level except at 39\u00a0\u00b0C and 40\u00a0\u00b0C at 8% O2. SMR significantly increased after one-week acclimatization to 12% and 8% O2 when ambient temperature (Ta) was 25\u00a0\u00b0C, however, it did not change at 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Thus, we suggest that P. przewalskii has special thermoregulatory and metabolic mechanisms to acclimatize to the hypoxic environment.",

     "abstract": "An endoparasitoid wasp Cotesia plutellae encodes two host translation inhibitory factors (HTIFs) that are expressed in late larval stage of Plutella xylostella parasitized by C. plutellae. The late expressions of HTIFs seemed to be associated with decreasing titer of juvenile hormone (JH) at the last larval instar because an addition of pyriproxyfen (PYR, a JH analog) inhibited the late expression pattern of two HTIF genes. To understand their late expression control, promoter region of an HTIF gene called CpBV15\u03b1 was cloned by inverse PCR. The cloned HTIF upstream region (1113\u00a0bp) possessed a putative JH response element (JHRE) and other promoter elements. The putative promoter region was rejoined with an open reading frame of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). When the recombinant vector construct was injected into early third instar larvae of nonparasitized P. xylostella, it was expressed in fourth larval instar at 72\u00a0h after injection, compared to relatively early expression in 24\u00a0h after injection of control construct containing a baculovirus immediate-early promoter. However, recombinant EGFP construct lost the late expression pattern when its promoter region was incomplete by truncating JHRE region. PYR application inhibited EGFP expression of the recombinant construct, but gave little influence on truncated constructs. Interestingly, when the complete promoter construct was injected to pupal stage, its late expression pattern was lost and showed early expression pattern. However, an addition of PYR to pupae, which had been injected with the complete promoter construct, inhibited the reporter gene expression. These results suggest that late expression of a HTIF (CpBV15\u03b1) is controlled by its promoter, which is sensitive to host JH titer.",

We show this by comparing the colour of baseline (unpaired males) and amplecting (paired) males. We also investigate the possible role of stress and stress hormones on this colour change. Frogs were subjected to four different levels of stressors (handling, toe-clipping, saline injection and adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] injection) and the colour change was measured using digital photography. A comparison of baseline colour and stress hormone (corticosterone) levels was also conducted to give further insight to this topic. From the images, the Red Blue Green (RGB) colour values were calculated, and a principal components analysis (PCA) was used to create a single colour metric (the major axis) as an index of colour in the visible spectrum. A moderate stressor (toe-clipping) led to a significant change in colour (within 10\u00a0min) similar to that of amplecting males. Surprisingly, neither a mild stressor (handling and saline injection) nor the maximum stressor (handling and ACTH injection) led to a lightening response. This study confirms that the dynamic male colour change in this species in response to medium stressors adds new knowledge to the understanding of the functional mechanisms of dynamic colour change in amphibians.",

AQP3 mRNA was primarily detected in the osmoregulatory organs, such as gills, while AQP8 mRNA was primarily found in the intestine. These results suggested that AQP isoforms play a role in osmoregulation in specific osmoregulatory organs. Similarly, AQP3 mRNA expression in the gills (mean values:1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 [parr] and 1.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 [smolt]) was significantly higher than AQP8 mRNA levels (parr: 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003; smolt: 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004), and in the intestine, AQP8 mRNA expression (parr: 0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007; smolt: 1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03) was significantly higher than AQP3 mRNA levels (parr: 0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006; smolt: 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005); these expression patterns were similar in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, AQP mRNA levels were lower in cortisol treated than in control groups. Therefore, these results suggest that AQPs play important roles in the water absorption mechanisms associated with multiple AQP isoforms, and that cortisol enhances the hypo-osmoregulatory capacity of fish in SW, and also controls the expression of AQPs in a hyperosmotic environment.",

We studied the effects of overcrowding on male behavior and selected hormones, brain arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT) and plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and cortisol as these are known to play roles in reproduction and related social interactions. The highest brain AVT and plasma cortisol levels were measured in non-aggressive males kept in the overcrowded group of 15 fish/m2. IT level was elevated in fish kept at the lower density of 9 fish/m2, and at which the males began to display territoriality and aggression. The plasma level of 11-KT was similar in all the males. Brain AVT and IT and plasma cortisol along with behavioral observations can be applied as species-specific indicators of the well-being of round goby males.",

The magnitude of these changes may depend on dietary history including oil sources with different fatty acid compositions. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer (Perciformes, Latidae), a tropical ectothermic fish, was fed on diets either rich in dietary long-chain (\u2265\u00a0C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from fish oil, rich in stearidonic and \u03b3-linolenic acid (SDA and GLA, respectively) from Echium plantagineum, or rapeseed oil deficient in LC-PUFA. Following 5\u00a0weeks at the optimum temperature of 30\u00a0\u00b0C when growth rates were comparable amongst dietary treatments, water temperature was dropped to 20\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0week for half of the animals and maintained at 30\u00a0\u00b0C for the other half. Decreased temperature increased the liver and skeletal muscle content of LC-PUFA in fish fed on echium oil compared with rapeseed oil, while dietary LC-PUFA depots in fish oil fed-fish depleted rapidly in the week of sub-optimal temperature. The lipid unsaturation index of cellular membrane in the liver and muscle increased under low temperature at the same rate regardless of dietary oil. Therefore, rapid exposure of an ectothermic vertebrate to a lower and sub-optimal temperature caused significant modulation in fatty acid composition. We propose that the tolerance of barramundi, a representative of tropical farmed fish, to sub-optimal temperature will be enhanced when fatty acid substrates closer to the LC-PUFA are available in their diet.",

     "abstract": "Pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs), a sub-family of odorant-binding proteins, are thought primarily to bind and transport the sex pheromones in moths. Considering multiple components of sex pheromone and multiple PBP genes exist in a single species, PBPs may contribute to the discrimination of different sex pheromone components. However, so far this discrimination is still unclear. Our previous ligand-binding assays showed that Spodoptera litura PBP1 (SlitPBP1) did not exhibit an obvious binding specificity among different sex pheromone components. In this study, binding specificity of the other two PBPs in S. litura (SlitPBP2 and SlitPBP3) was further investigated. As a result, SlitPBP2 was capable of binding all four sex pheromone components with similar affinities; whereas SlitPBP3 showed very weak binding affinities to them except Z9,E12\u201314:Ac. Similar results were also obtained from studied pheromone analogs, to which SlitPBP2 showed much stronger affinities than SlitPBP3. However, both SlitPBP2 and SlitPBP3 exhibited overall weaker affinities to sex pheromones and their analogs than SlitPBP1. In addition, quantitative real time PCR showed that three SlitPBP genes exhibited a very different sex-biased expression in adult antenna with male-biased for SlitPBP1 and SlitPBP2 while female-biased for SlitPBP3. Finally, ligand-binding assays indicated that the two SlitPBPs showed a similar pH-dependent conformational change as reported SlitPBP1, but these three SlitPBPs showed different behavior across a pH range or something similar. Taken together, our data suggest that in S. litura PBP1 and PBP2 may play critical roles in the perception of female sex pheromones, but do not show an obvious discriminative ability among different sex pheromone components; whereas PBP3 may have other functions.",

     "abstract": "We used arterial tyramine injections to study development of sympathetic actions on in vivo heart rate and blood pressure in embryonic, hatching and yearling female American alligators. Tyramine is a pharmacological tool for understanding comparative and developmental sympathetic regulation of cardiovascular function, and this indirect sympathomimetic agent causes endogenous neuronal catecholamine release, increasing blood pressure and heart rate. Arterial tyramine injection in hatchling and yearling alligators caused the typical vertebrate response \u2014 rise in heart rate and blood pressure. However, in embryonic alligators, tyramine caused a substantial and immediate bradycardia at both 70% and 90% of embryonic development. This embryonic bradycardia was accompanied by hypotension, followed by a sustained hypertension similar to the hatchling and juvenile responses. Pretreatment with atropine injection (cholinergic receptor blocker) eliminated the embryonic hypotensive bradycardia, and phentolamine pretreatment (\u03b1-adrenergic receptor blocker) eliminated the embryonic hypotensive and hypertensive responses but not the bradycardia. In addition, hexamethonium pretreatment (nicotinic receptor blocker) significantly blunted embryos' bradycardic tyramine response. However, pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine, a neurotoxin that destroys catecholaminergic terminals, did not eliminate the embryonic bradycardia. Tyramine likely stimulated a unique embryonic response \u2014 neurotransmitter release from preganglionic nerve terminals (blocked with hexamethonium) and an acetylcholine mediated bradycardia with a secondary norepinephrine-dependent sustained hypertension. In addition, tyramine appears to stimulate sympathetic nerve terminals directly, which contributed to the overall hypertension in the embryonic, hatchling and yearling animals. Data demonstrated that humoral catecholamine control of cardiovascular function was dominant over the immature parasympathetic nervous system in developing alligator embryos, and suggested that sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals were present and developing in ovo but were not tonically active.",

The present study investigated the proximate mechanisms underlying catecholamine mobilization. Trout exposed to heat shock in vivo exhibited a significant reduction in arterial O2 tension, but arterial O2 concentration was not affected by heat shock, nor was catecholamine release during heat shock prevented by prior and concomitant exposure to hyperoxia (to prevent the fall in arterial O2 tension). Thus, catecholamine mobilization probably was not triggered by impaired blood O2 transport. Heat-shocked trout also exhibited an elevation of arterial CO2 tension coupled with a fall in arterial pH, but these factors are not expected to trigger catecholamine release. The changes in blood O2 and CO2 tension occurred despite a significant hyperventilatory response to heat shock. Future studies should investigate whether catecholamine mobilization during heat shock in rainbow trout is triggered by a specific effect of high temperature activating the sympathetic nervous system via a thermosensitive transient receptor potential channel.",

     "abstract": "The slope of the typically linear relationship between metabolic rate and walking speed represents the net cost of transport (NCOT). The extrapolated y-intercept is often greater than resting metabolic rate, thus representing a fixed cost associated with pedestrian transport including body maintenance costs. The full cause of the elevated y-intercept remains elusive and it could simply represent experimental stresses. The present literature-based study compares the mass-independent energetic cost of pedestrian locomotion in birds (excluding those with an upright posture, i.e. penguins), represented by the y-intercept, to a known predictor of cost of transport, hip height. Both phylogenetically informed and non-phylogenetically informed analyses were undertaken to determine if patterns of association between hip height, body mass, and the y-intercept are robust with respect to the method of analysis. Body mass and hip height were significant predictors of the y-intercept in the best phylogenetically-informed and non-phylogenetically informed models. Thus there is evidence that, in birds at least, the elevated y-intercept is a legitimate component of locomotion energy expenditure. Hip height is probably a good proxy of effective limb length and thus perhaps birds with greater hip heights have lower y-intercepts because their longer legs more efficiently accommodate body motion and/or because their limbs are more aligned with the ground reaction forces.",

GPx activity measured at the end of anoxia or severe hypoxia and in the early hours of post-stress recovery also showed an overactivation compared to the control group. We can hypothesize that this overproduction of GPx corresponded to an anticipatory mechanism coping with the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the recovery phase in subterranean animals. This response could be considered as a major asset for life in alternately normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and therefore in extreme biotopes such as groundwaters.",

Very few studies have actually tested this assumption in free-living animals under uncontrolled natural conditions. Non-invasive urine sampling and standard capture handling protocol have enabled the rapid quantification of baseline corticosterone and short-term corticosterone stress responses in anuran amphibians. In this study, established non-invasive methods were used to monitor physiological stress and urinary testosterone levels in male individuals of the terrestrial breeding Fijian ground frog (Platymantis vitiana). Adult male frogs (n\u00a0=\u00a020) were sampled at nighttime on three repeated occasions at intervals of 14\u00a0days during their annual breeding season on Viwa Island, Fiji. All frogs expressed urinary corticosterone metabolite responses to the capture and handling stressor, with some frogs showing consistently higher urinary corticosterone responses than others. Ranks of corticosterone values at 0, 4 and 8\u00a0h, and the corrected rank were highly significant (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75\u20130.99) between the three repeated sampling occasions. Statistical repeatabilities were high for baseline corticosterone (r\u00a0=\u00a00.973) and for corticosterone values at 2\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.862), 4\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.861), 6\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.820) and 8\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.926), and also for the total (inclusive of baseline corticosterone values) and the corrected integrated responses (index of the acute response) [r\u00a0=\u00a00.867 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.870]. Urinary testosterone levels also showed high statistical repeatability (r\u00a0=\u00a00.78). Furthermore, variation in baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses was greater between individuals than within individuals. Baseline urinary corticosterone was significantly negatively correlated with the corrected integrated corticosterone response (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but non-significantly with body-condition (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.04) and baseline urinary testosterone (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.07). In contrast, the corrected integrated corticosterone response was positively correlated (non-significantly) with baseline urinary testosterone (r\u00a0=\u00a0+\u00a00.04) and body-condition (r\u00a0=\u00a0+\u00a00.08). Urinary testosterone levels and body-condition were significantly negatively correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.23, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The results suggest that male frogs with higher levels of testosterone could have depleted energy reserve during the breeding period. The acute corticosterone responses help in replenishing energy that is needed for breeding and survival. The results also provide some support to the \u2018cort-fitness\u2019 hypothesis as highlighted by the negative correlation between baseline corticosterone and body-condition. It is most likely that the acute corticosterone response is adaptive and linked positively with reproductive fitness and survival in male anurans.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined i) the effect of an experimental rise in plasma triglyceride on the whole metabolic rate in winter-acclimatized (WA) and de-acclimatized king penguin chicks kept at thermoneutrality (TN), and ii) investigated the fuel preference of muscle mitochondria.

In vitro, the oxidation rate of muscle mitochondria respiring on lipid-derived substrate was +\u00a040% higher in WA chicks than in TN, while no differences were found between groups when mitochondria oxidized carbohydrate-derived substrate or succinate. Despite an enhanced fuel selection towards lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle, a rise of circulating lipids per se was not sufficient to fully unravel the thermogenic capacity of winter-acclimatized king penguin chicks.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine whether blood oxygen capacity of waders varies with respect to migration at both inter-specific and individual level. To verify this hypothesis we measured hemoglobin concentration in 875 waders from 14 species during their autumn migration through central Poland. In most of the species we found an increase in the hemoglobin levels along with increasing fat loads during the stopover period, which suggests that individual birds are able to elevate their oxygen-carrying capacity of blood prior to departure on a migratory flight. Positive relationship between hemoglobin concentrations of waders and their fat loads was confirmed at the inter-specific level by the comparative analysis of independent contrasts. Comparative analysis also demonstrated that hemoglobin concentrations were positively related with theoretical flight range and mean refueling rate during stopovers. The results indicate that species traveling according to the strategy of energy-minimization (short-distance migrants, low fat reserves, low refueling rates) have lower blood oxygen capacity in comparison to time-selected species (long-distance migrants, high fat reserves, high refueling rates). It remains uncertain whether high hemoglobin levels in long-distance migrants are a fixed evolutionary trait or a temporal physiological adaptation associated with carrying considerable fat load.",

     "abstract": "Feeding and swimming can influence ion balance in fish. Therefore we investigated their impact on ionoregulation and its hormonal control in goldfish and common carp. As expected due to the osmorespiratory compromise, exhaustive swimming induced increases in gill Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) activity in both species, resulting in stable levels of plasma ions. In contrast to our expectations, this only occurred in fed fish and feeding itself increased NKA activity, especially in carp. Fasting fish were able to maintain ion balance without increasing NKA activity, we propose that the increase in NKA activity is related to ammonia excretion rather than ion uptake per se. In goldfish, this increase in NKA activity coincided with a cortisol elevation whilst no significant change was found in carp. In goldfish, high conversion of plasma T4 to T3 was found in both fed and fasted fish resulting in low T4/T3 ratios, which increased slightly due to exhaustive swimming. In starved carp the conversion seemed much less efficient, and high T4/T3 ratios were observed. We propose that thyroid hormone regulation in carp was more related to its role in energy metabolism rather than ionoregulation. The present research showed that both species, whether fed or fasted, are able to sufficiently adapt their osmorepiratory strategy to minimise ions losses whilst maintaining gas exchange under exhaustive swimming.",

     "abstract": "Intraspecific variation in metabolic rate of fish can be pronounced and have been linked to various fitness-related behavioural and physiological traits, but the underlying causes for this variation have received far less attention than the consequences of it. In the present study we investigated whether European eels (Anguilla anguilla) displayed temporal repeatability of body-mass-corrected (residual) metabolic rate over a two-month period and if variations in organ mass and enzyme activity between individual fish could be the cause for the observed variation in metabolic rate. Both standard metabolic rate (SMR; Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a00.743) and routine metabolic rate (RMR; r\u00a0=\u00a00.496) were repeatable over the two-month period. Repeatability of RMR is an interesting finding as it indicates that the level of spontaneous activity in respirometer-confined fish is not random. Cumulative organ mass (liver, heart, spleen and intestine; mean 1.6% total body mass) was found to explain 38% of the variation in SMR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.613) with the liver (one of the metabolically most active organs) being the driver for the correlation between organ mass and metabolic rate. No relationships were found for either liver citrate synthase or cytochrome oxidase activity and metabolic rate in the European eels.

In vertebrates, MSTN is known to negatively regulate skeletal muscle growth, and GDF11 is found to inhibit neurogenesis. In invertebrates, only one ortholog of vertebrate MSTN and GDF11 (MSTN/GDF11) existed. Little attention has been paid on its role to date. In this study, the cDNA that encodes a 422-amino-acid MSTN/GDF11 protein (LvMSTN/GDF11) was characterized from a crustacean species, the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Sequence analysis revealed that the overall protein sequence and specific functional sites of LvMSTN/GDF11 were highly conserved with those in other crustacean species. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique demonstrated its tissue-specific, larval developmental stage-specific, and molt stage-specific expression pattern, respectively. After in vivo injections of 20 hydroxyecdysone (20E), LvMSTN/GDF11 transcripts were declined in the abdominal (A) and pleopod (P1) muscles, increased in the pereiopod (P2) muscle, and not affected in the thoracic (T) muscle. The observed expression profiles suggest multiple functions of LvMSTN/GDF11 in L. vannamei and its role differs during the larval development and natural molt cycle. The different responses of LvMSTN/GDF11 to acute increases of 20E in the A, P1, P2 and T muscles may indicate that LvMSTN/GDF11 is transcriptionally regulated via ecdysteroids to coincide with its specific roles in the former three muscles, while its role may be independent of 20E regulation in the T muscle.",

To better understand the function of Mb in the fish heart, we have measured the effects of adding 20% carbon monoxide (CO), which inhibits Mb function, compared to inert 20% N2 on the O2 consumption and twitch force in hypoxic rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ventricle ring preparations. Results showed that O2 consumption was significantly reduced upon addition of CO, whereas twitch force was not affected. Control experiments at 40% CO did not decrease O2 consumption further, showing that CO was not inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria. Because myocardial O2 consumption can be depressed by endogenous nitric oxide (NO) in the trout myocardium and because Mb is a scavenger of NO, CO inhibition experiments were also made in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). O2 consumption decreased to a similar extent upon CO addition, regardless of NO synthase inhibition, indicating that under hypoxic conditions Mb-dependent NO scavenging plays a minor role. Taken together, these results show that O2 consumption of the hypoxic rainbow trout heart is dependent on the function of Mb as intracellular O2 carrier.",

Pyloric blockade reduced the postprandial rise in metabolism during the first 18\u00a0h after ingestion of mice amounting to 18% of the snake's body mass by 60%. In another series of the experiments, we showed that infusion of amino acids directly into the stomach or the intestine elicited similar metabolic responses. This indicates a lower gastric contribution to the SDA response than previously reported. To include an assessment of the gastric contribution to the postprandial cardiovascular response, we also measured blood and heart rate. While heart rate increased during digestion in snakes with pyloric blockade, there was no rise in the double-blocked heart rates compared to fasting controls. Thus, the non-adrenergic-non-cholinergic factor that stimulates heart rate during digestion does not stem from the stomach. Finally, there was no growth of the visceral organs in response to digestion when chyme was prevented from reaching the intestine.",

However, a closely related species, Cyprinus carpio, does not possess the ability to produce ethanol and would be expected to accumulate lactate during hypoxic exposure. While the increase in oxygen consumption in fish required following strenuous exercise or low environmental oxygen availability has been frequently considered, the primary contributing mechanism remains unknown. This study utilized the close relationship but strongly divergent physiology between C. carpio and C. carassius to examine the possible correlation between excess post-hypoxic oxygen consumption (EPHOC) and lactate accumulation. No difference in the EPHOC:O2 deficit ratio was observed between the two species after 2.5\u00a0h anoxia, with ratios of 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 (C. carpio) and 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 (C. carassius). As predicted, lactate accumulation dynamics did significantly differ between the species in both plasma and white muscle following anoxic exposure. Significant lactate accumulation was seen in both plasma and muscle in C. carpio, but there was no accumulation of lactate in white muscle tissue of C. carassius. These findings indicate that lactate accumulated as a consequence of 2.5\u00a0h anoxic exposure is not a major determinant of the resulting EPHOC.",

In order to address this question, mRNA expressions of actors of the molecular cascade (Cg-DMl, Cg-SoxE, Cg-\u03b2-catenin, Cg-Foxl2/Cg-Foxl2os) and of Oyvlg, a germ cell marker, were investigated by real-time PCR in spat grown at different temperatures (18, 22, 25 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C). In parallel, gonadic differentiation, gametogenesis and sex ratios were assessed by histology at each of these temperatures. Whatever the temperature, Cg-DMl, Cg-SoxE, Cg-\u03b2-catenin and Oyvlg expressions peaked at the same developmental stage, always after Cg-Foxl2/Cg-Foxl2os (around 40\u201344\u00a0dpf for spat grown at 18\u00a0\u00b0C). Temperatures increased the kinetics of first gonadic differentiation and gametogenesis. At 25\u00a0\u00b0C a significant switch occurred in sex ratio towards males and in the balance of expression between male and female genes, in favor of males. A slight gametogenesis disturbance was also observed. These results strengthen the hypotheses about the sex-determining time window and molecular cascade governing the development of C. gigas, with notably the involvement of Cg-Foxl2/Cg-Foxl2os in the very early steps. They also suggest an influence of temperature on the oyster's sex determination which, associated to genetic control, would induce a mixed sex determination system (GSD\u00a0+\u00a0TSD).",

Although the membrane pacemaker hypothesis posits that desaturation of FAs accounts for variation in resting or basal metabolic rate (BMR), little is known about the FA profiles that underpin variation in maximal metabolic rate (MMR). We examined membrane FA composition of liver and skeletal muscle in mice after seven generations of selection for increased MMR. In both liver and skeletal muscle, unsaturation index did not differ between control and high-MMR mice. We also examined membrane FA composition at the individual-level of variation. In liver, 18:0, 20:3 n-6, 20:4 n-6, and 22:6 n-3 FAs were significant predictors of MMR. In gastrocnemius muscle, 18:2 n-6, 20:4 n-6, and 22:6 n-3 FAs were significant predictors of MMR. In addition, muscle 16:1 n-7, 18:1 n-9, and 22:5 n-3 FAs were significant predictors of BMR, whereas no liver FAs were significant predictors of BMR.

Molecular responses were addressed through the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90, the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases and particularly p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1/2). For the determination of the effect of the oxidative stress caused by food deprivation and/or re-feeding, the (maximum) activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidise (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as the determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were studied. The experimental feeding trials caused a tissue distinct and differential response on the cellular and antioxidant capacity of sea bass not only during the stressful process of starvation but also in re-feeding. Specifically, the intestine phosphorylation of ERKs and antioxidant enzymatic activities increased in the 2S\u20132F fish group, while in the 1F\u20133S group an increase was detected in the levels of the same proteins except for GPx. In the liver and the red muscle of 2S\u20132F fish, decreased Hsp70 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK levels and increased Hsp90 levels were observed. Additionally, SOD activity decreased in the red muscle of 2S\u20132F and 1F\u20133S groups.

Scallops that were experimentally exposed to predators had not only lower antioxidant capacities (superoxide dismutase and catalase), but also lower oxidative damage (protein carbonyls and TBARS\u00a0=\u00a0thiobarbituric acid reactive substances including lipid peroxides) in gills and mantle compared to individuals not exposed to predators. In contrast, oxidative damage in the swimming muscle was higher in predator-exposed scallops. When predator-exposed scallops were on the verge of spawning, levels of oxidative damage increased in gills and mantle in spite of a parallel increase in antioxidant defense in both tissues. Levels of oxidative damage increased also in the swimming muscle whereas muscle antioxidant capacities decreased. Interestingly, post-spawned scallops restored antioxidant capacities and oxidative damage to immature levels, suggesting they can recover from spawning-related oxidative stress. Our results show that predator exposure and gametogenesis modulate oxidative damage in a tissue specific manner and that high antioxidant capacities do not necessarily coincide with low oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Marine bivalves such as the hard shell clams Mercenaria mercenaria and eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica are affected by multiple stressors, including fluctuations in temperature and CO2 levels in estuaries, and these stresses are expected to be exacerbated by ongoing global climate change. Hypercapnia (elevated CO2 levels) and temperature stress can affect survival, growth and development of marine bivalves, but the cellular mechanisms of these effects are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated whether oxidative stress is implicated in cellular responses to elevated temperature and CO2 levels in marine bivalves. We measured the whole-organism standard metabolic rate (SMR), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), and levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in the muscle tissues of clams and oysters exposed to different temperatures (22 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C) and CO2 levels (the present day conditions of ~\u00a0400\u00a0ppm CO2 and 800\u00a0ppm CO2 predicted by a consensus business-as-usual IPCC emission scenario for the year 2100). SMR was significantly higher and the antioxidant capacity was lower in oysters than in clams. Aerobic metabolism was largely temperature-independent in these two species in the studied temperature range (22\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C). However, the combined exposure to elevated temperature and hypercapnia led to elevated SMR in clams indicating elevated costs of basal maintenance. No persistent oxidative stress signal (measured by the levels of protein carbonyls, and protein conjugates with malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal) was observed during the long-term exposure to moderate warming (+\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C) and hypercapnia (~\u00a0800\u00a0ppm CO2). This indicates that long-term exposure to moderately elevated CO2 and temperature minimally affects the cellular redox status in these bivalve species and that the earlier observed negative physiological effects of elevated CO2 and temperature must be explained by other cellular mechanisms.",

Previous work suggests that the hypoxia-induced activation of cardiac ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels serves to increase tolerance of low oxygen in many species. For goldfish, we have previously characterized a nitric oxide (NO)- and cGMP-dependent pathway by which this channel activation occurs in acute hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to resolve alterations in KATP channel activity and relevant gene expression in response to acclimation under moderately hypoxic conditions (2.6\u00a0mg O2/L for seven days at 22\u00a0\u00b0C). Intracellular action potential duration in excised ventricles from hypoxia-acclimated animals was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced at both 50% and 90% of full repolarization relative to those from normoxia-acclimated fish. In cell-attached ventricular membrane patches from hypoxia-acclimated goldfish, sarcolemmal KATP channel open probability (NPo) was significantly enhanced vs. control. Of the two genes coding for the pore-forming subunits of cardiac KATP channels (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2), mRNA transcription of kcnj8 (revealed by quantitative real-time PCR) was unchanged while kcnj11 was downregulated in response to chronic low oxygen. The mRNA levels for hif1a (hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1) in the hearts of hypoxia-acclimated fish were significantly enhanced, as was nitric oxide synthase (nos2) and the sulfonylurea receptor regulatory subunit (sur2, abcc9). These data suggest that prior whole-animal acclimation to chronic hypoxia enhances cardioprotective sarcolemmal KATP currents by altering transcription of regulatory proteins.",

MyoD expression decreased in male PM but not BF cells. MyoD expression in female PM cells and embryonic myoblasts were also unaffected by estradiol administration. Estradiol decreased myogenin expression in male satellite cells, but had no effect on female cells. There was a slight decrease in myogenin expression in embryonic myoblasts. The results demonstrate a direct effect of estradiol on avian satellite cell proliferation independent of glypican-1, and decreased expression of MyoD and myogenin in some myogenic cells, coinciding with increased cellular proliferation.",

The effects of a single important marine ion (K+) on survival and ion regulation of larval Gulf killifish, an estuarine, euryhaline teleost, were determined. A four-week study was completed in four separate recirculating systems with newly hatched larvae. Salinity in all four systems was maintained between 9.5 and 10\u2030. Two systems were maintained using crystal salt (99.6% NaCl) with K+ supplementation (1.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0mmol/L and 2.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0mmol/L K+; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM), one was maintained with crystal salt and no K+ supplementation (0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0mmol/L K+), the fourth system was maintained using a standard marine mix salt (2.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0mmol/L K+), the salt mix also included standard ranges of other ions such as calcium and magnesium. Larvae were sampled throughout the experiment for dry mass, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity, whole body ion composition, relative gene expression (NKA, Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)), and immunocytochemistry staining for NKA, NKCC, and CFTR. Larvae stocked into water with no K+ supplementation resulted in 100% mortality within 24\u00a0h. Mortality and dry mass were significantly influenced by K+ concentration (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). No differences were observed among treatment groups for NKA activity. At 1\u00a0dph NKA mRNA expression was higher in the 0.3\u00a0mmol [K+] group than in other treatment groups and at 7\u00a0dph differences in intestinal NKA and CFTR staining were observed.

We first confirmed a previous study by Brown and colleagues reporting on the depressed substrate oxidation in isolated liver mitochondria of the Djungarian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) during daily torpor. Next, we show that mitochondrial respiration is not depressed in kidneys, skeletal muscle and heart. In liver mitochondria, we found that state 3 and state 4 respirations correlate with body temperature, suggesting inhibition related to torpor depth and to metabolic rate. We conclude that molecular events leading to depression of mitochondrial respiration during daily torpor are specific to liver and linked to a decrease in body temperature. Different tissue-specificity of mitochondrial depression may assist to compare and identify the molecular nature of mitochondrial alterations during torpor.",

Field metabolic rates for species that have not been measured are usually predicted by allometric equations on the basis of their body mass (BM). Phylogenetically informed methods improve estimates of both allometric relationships and species-specific FMR values by considering the evolutionary history of species. Further improvement is possible by incorporating isolated measurements on BM and FMR, but most existing methods force the user to discard such incomplete data. In the present study the FMR of most Australian marsupial species was predicted for the first time using a phylogenetic method that was explicitly designed to handle incomplete data. This allows full use of the dataset containing 35 samples of FMR and 130 samples of BM. Cross-validation demonstrated that FMRs were estimated with high accuracy. The resulting prediction equation was FMR (kJ\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01)\u00a0=\u00a05.27 BM (g)0.69. Field metabolic rate and BM were highly phylogenetically correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.96), i.e. FMR and BM co-evolved. Differences between species-specific and generic marsupial estimates of FMR revealed that herbivores have lower energy expenditure than carnivores. Specifically, herbivorous macropods have on average lower relative FMR (kJ/d) (3.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53 BM0.69; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) than carnivorous dasyurids (7.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84 BM0.69).

Males of L. santolla of commercial size were randomly dissected every 4\u00a0h during a period of 24\u00a0h. Enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase were determined in samples of gills, muscle, hepatopancreas and haemolymph. Ascorbic acid, total glutathione, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were also determined in all tissues. Gills showed the highest enzymatic activity and hepatopancreas the highest concentration of non-enzymatic antioxidants. Maximum antioxidant activity was during the dark phase in gills and during the photophase in the haemolymph. Muscle showed significant daily variations, with peaks during the photophase and scotophase. Overall, an antioxidant protective mechanism is present in all tissues, where SOD and CAT represent the first line of defense. The defense mechanism in L. santolla seems to be more active during the dark phase, with slight differences among the analyzed tissues, indicating a higher metabolic rate.",

     "abstract": "In both mammals and teleost fish, serotonin stimulates cortisol secretion via the 5-HT1A receptor. Additionally, a negative feedback loop exists in mammals whereby increased circulating levels of cortisol inhibit 5-HT1A receptor activity. To investigate the possibility of such a feedback mechanism in teleosts, plasma cortisol levels and signaling in Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) were manipulated and the role of cortisol in the control of 5-HT1A evaluated. Despite a significant 4-fold increase in plasma [cortisol], crowded toadfish expressed similar amounts of 5-HT1A mRNA transcript as uncrowded toadfish; whereas, cortisol-implanted fish possessed 41.8% less 5-HT1A mRNA transcript compared to vehicle-implanted controls. This cortisol effect appeared to be reversed in RU486-injected fish, which blocks glucocorticoid receptors, as these fish expressed nearly twice as much 5-HT1A receptor transcript as the vehicle-injected fish despite significantly elevated cortisol levels. The binding affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor in the brain did not vary between any groups; however, maximum binding was significantly higher in uncrowded toadfish compared to crowded, and the same significant difference was observed between the maximum binding of vehicle and cortisol-implanted fish. The opposite trend was seen in RU486-injected and vehicle-injected fish, with RU486-injected fish having significantly higher maximal binding compared to vehicle-injected controls. Injection with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin revealed an inhibition of cortisol secretion that was independent of 5-HT1A transcript and protein binding. These results suggest that cortisol plays a role in regulating the 5-HT1A receptor via GR-mediated pathways; however, further study is necessary to elucidate how and where this inhibition is mediated.",

We measured the enzymatic activity, food intake rate and changes in body mass of bats feeding at four different sucrose concentrations (from 5 to 35% wt./vol.). Additionally, we used a mathematical model to predict food intake and compared it with the food intake of bats. L. nivalis was able to obtain ~\u00a0111.3\u00a0kJ of energy regardless of the sugar concentration of their food. Also, bats gained ~\u00a02.57\u00a0g of mass during the experimental trials and this gain was independent of sugar concentration. The affinity (1\u00a0/\u00a0Km) of sucrase (EC 3.2.1.48) was one order of magnitude higher relative to that reported for its sister species Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (0.250 and 0.0189\u00a0mmol\u2212\u00a01\u00a0L, respectively), allowing this species to have a higher energy intake rate. We propose that the high ability to acquire energy conferred L. nivalis the faculty to invade cold environments, avoiding in this way the ecological competition with its sympatric species L. yerbabuenae.",

After 12 or 30\u00a0days under optimal laboratory conditions, hemocytes in circulation decreased to less than 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/mL, the lowest number observed being 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0cells/mL. Within 2\u00a0min of a stressful stimulus, cell numbers doubled or increased by a factor of 3 or 4. After stressing mussels by keeping them out of water for 1\u00a0h, cell counts were as high as 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0cells/mL. The quick rate of increase in cell counts is not due to hemocyte proliferation. In mussels, returned to optimal water conditions, cell numbers dropped following an exponential decay curve (y\u00a0=\u00a05.6865\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(0.9936X). Not all hemocyte types decreased in number to the same extent. After a strong decrease in the total cell count induced by injection of LPS, the remaining hemocyte population contained a larger percentage of basophils. This indicated the disappearance of eosinophilic cells from the circulation. Stress situations caused their return. Hemocytopenia or stress-induced hemocytosis in M. edulis, both in conjunction with changes in the percentage of granulocytes present, resembles margination/demargination processes in mammals where the concentration of circulating leukocyte subsets depends on the expression of adhesive receptor\u2013ligand molecules on the surface of specific leukocyte types and vascular endothelial cells. In Mytilus edulis, variations in the concentration of distinct cell groups excluded heart activity to explain cell fluctuations. Furthermore, in this mussel, where hemocyte proliferation is not the reason for rapid hemocytosis, cell divisions were nevertheless demonstrated; they seem to be important in maintaining hemocyte homeostasis as 10\u201320% of cells in circulation possess the capacity to proliferate. They belong to the group of basophilic granulocytes.",

The fertilized eggs from Tibetan chicken and dwarf recessive white chicken breeds were incubated under normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (13% O2) conditions, equivalent to the altitude of 3600\u00a0m. We observed that Tibetan chicken embryos had higher hatchability (48%) in hypoxia than their lowland controls (7.8%). Northern blot showed that globin mRNA expression in Tibetan chicken embryos differed greatly from lowland controls under hypoxia. The expressions of four dominant globin mRNAs, named \u03b1A, \u03b1D, \u03b2A and \u03b2H, were significantly induced under hypoxia. Tibetan chicken embryos had lower globin mRNA level in red cells than that of lowland controls at day 19 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Based on real-time PCR the same result was confirmed. Furthermore, we observed accumulation of globins induced by hypoxia in red cells by performing the separation of globin analysis, showing higher level of globins in red cells of Tibetan chicken embryos than that of lowland chicken embryos. Overall, our results provide new evidence that flexible regulation of globins at the level of transcription and translation may play a role in allowing the Tibetan chicken embryo to resist hypoxia.",

Intact earthworms and skin/muscle tissue extracts were exposed to UV-B radiation for in vivo and in vitro studies. Both in vitro and in vivo results showed that the products of photooxidative damage, MDA and H2O2, increased after UV-B exposure. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase were inhibited immediately after exposure to high doses (3000\u00a0J/m2) of UV-B radiation in vivo. Catalase activity was increased following a low UV-B dose (500\u00a0J/m2) in vivo, but decreased in response to all dosage levels in vitro. These data indicate that a relationship exists between UV-B induced damage and photooxidation and also that catalase and GPx act as important antioxidants to prevent photooxidation.

However, our understanding of corticosteroid receptor expression and its relationship with sociality is still in its infancy. Knowledge of variation in receptor expression is critical to understand the physiological relevance of differences in circulating corticosteroid concentrations. In this study, we examined corticosteroid receptor gene expression in relation to dominance rank, sex, and social behaviour in the highly social cichlid fish, Neolamprologus pulcher. We examined the relative gene expression of the three known teleost corticosteroid receptors: glucocorticoid receptor 1 (GR1), glucocorticoid receptor 2 (GR2), and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in liver and brain tissue of dominant and subordinate N. pulcher males and females. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the N. pulcher gene originally described as GR2, clustered with other teleost GR1 genes, while the originally-described N. pulcher GR1 gene clustered with the GR2 genes of other teleosts. Therefore we propose a change in the original nomenclature of the N. pulcher GRs: GR1 (formerly GR2) and GR2 (formerly GR1) and adopt this new nomenclature throughout this manuscript. Liver MR transcript levels were higher in males than females, and positively related to submissive behaviour. Liver GR2 (formerly GR1) transcript levels were also higher in males than females. Collectively, the results demonstrate sex differences in corticosteroid receptor abundance, and suggest tissue- and receptor-specific roles for corticosteroid receptors in mediating aspects of social behaviour.",

     "abstract": "In the immune system of vertebrates, gender-specific differences in individual immune competence are well known. In general, females possess more powerful immune response than males. In invertebrates, the situation is much less clear. For this purpose we have chosen to study the immune response of the two sexes of the echinoderm Paracentrotus lividus in pre- and post-spawning phases. The coelomic fluid from the echinoderms contains several coelomocyte types and molecules involved in innate immune defenses. In this article we report that the degree of immune responses in the P. lividus differs according to sex in both pre- and post-spawning phases. We found in all tests that females were more active than males. The results indicate that females possess a significant higher number of immunocytes consisting of phagocytes and uncolored spherulocytes. Since the immunological activity is mainly based on immunocytes, it was not surprising that females possessed the highest values of cytotoxicity and hemolysis activity and showed a greater ability to uptake neutral red and phagocyte yeasts cells, while the average number of ingested particles per active phagocyte was not significantly different. Furthermore, agglutinating activity was more evident in the coelomocyte lysate and coelomic fluid of females than in those of males. Finally we found that the acidic extract of female gonads possessed greater antimicrobial activity than that of male gonads. These results make it very likely that gender differences in the immune response are not restricted to vertebrates; rather, they are a general evolutionary phenomenon.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic competitive modes between digestion and locomotion are classified into three categories, termed the additive, digestion- and locomotion-priority modes. In nature, the caudal fin is frequently observed to sustain damage as a result of social rank, predation or disease. To test whether the metabolic mode changed differently for fish with different metabolic mode after caudal fin amputation as a consequence of intensified energy competition, we investigated the swimming performance of fasting and fed fish with and without the caudal fin in juveniles of three cyprinid fish species: qingbo (Spinibarbus sinensis, locomotion-priority mode), common carp (Cyprinus carpio, additive mode) and goldfish (Carassius auratus, digestion-priority mode). The critical swimming speed (Ucrit) of fasting qingbo, common carp and goldfish decreased significantly by 49%, 32% and 35% after caudal fin amputation. The maximum tail beat amplitude (TBAmax) (all three fishes), maximum tail beat frequency (TBFmax) (only common carp and goldfish) and (or) active metabolic rate ( M \u02d9 O 2 active ) (only common carp) increased significantly after caudal fin amputation. In the control fish, digestion let to a significantly lower Ucrit in goldfish but not in qingbo and common carp, and the M \u02d9 O 2 active of digesting common carp was higher than that of fasting fish, suggesting locomotion-priority, additive and digestion-priority metabolic modes in qingbo, common carp and goldfish, respectively. However, after fin amputation, digestion showed no effect on Ucrit in any of the three fishes, and only the digesting common carp showed a higher M \u02d9 O 2 active than their fasting counterparts. This result suggested that the metabolic mode of the goldfish changed from the digestion- to the locomotion-priority mode, whereas the metabolic mode of the other two fishes remained the same after fin amputation. The metabolic mode of the common carp showed no change after fin amputation likely due to the high flexibility of the cardio-respiratory capacity of this fish, as indicated by the increased M \u02d9 O 2 active . Although the metabolic mode remained the same, the feeding metabolism in the fin-amputated qingbo was down-regulated at a lower swimming speed than that of the control group due to the intensified competition between digestion and locomotion. The underlying mechanism for the metabolic mode change in the goldfish is not clear and needs further investigation. However, we speculated that in caudal-fin-intact goldfish, the decreased swimming efficiency, rather than irreducible digestive loading, caused a decreased Ucrit in digesting fish (i.e. false digestion-priority mode), and the metabolic mode should not be judged simply by the relative magnitude of the metabolic rates of fasting and digesting fish.",

Significant gradients (40\u201390% above value in 15\u00a0psu seawater) for osmolality, sodium, magnesium, and potassium were shown by L. variegatus and E. lucunter. A. lixula showed the smallest gradients, displaying the strongest conforming behavior. The esophagus of the three species was challenged in vitro with 20 and 50% osmotic shocks (hypo- and hyperosmotic). A. lixula, the most \u201cconforming\u201d species, showed the highest capacity to avoid swelling of its tissues upon the \u2212\u00a050% hyposmotic shock, and was also the species less affected by salinity changes concerning the observation of spines and ambulacral feet movement in the whole-animal experiments. Thus, the most conforming species (A. lixula) displayed the highest capacity to regulate tissue water/volume, and was also the most euryhaline among the three studied species. In addition, tissues from all three species swelled much more than they shrank under osmotic shocks of same magnitude. This distinct trend to gain water, despite the capacity to hold some gradients upon seawater dilution, helps to explain why echinoderms cannot be fully estuarine, or ever enter fresh water.",

Long-distance migration and winter acclimatization induce similar physiological and biochemical adjustments in passerines. To understand metabolic adaptations, the resting metabolic rate (RMR), the thermogenic properties of mitochondria in liver and muscle, and the activity of thyroid hormones were examined in field-captured little buntings (Emberiza pusilla) between Southeastern (Wenzhou) and Northeastern (Qiqihar) China from March to May in 2008 during their migration. Twelve birds were trapped from March to April in Wenzhou region, Zhejiang Province (27\u00b029\u2032N, 120\u00b051\u2032E) and eleven birds originated from April to May in Qiqihar region, Heilongjiang Province (47\u00b029\u2032N, 124\u00b002\u2032E). We found that RMRs of little buntings were significantly higher in Qiqihar than in Wenzhou. Consistently, mitochondrial state-4 respiration capacities and cytochrome c oxidase activities (COX) in liver and muscle, and circulating levels of plasma triiodothyronine (T3) of little buntings were also significantly higher in Qiqihar than in Wenzhou. Variation in metabolic biochemical markers of liver and muscle, such as state-4 respiration and COX, and variation in thyroid hormone levels were correlated with variation in RMR. There was also a positive relationship between T3 and metabolic biochemical markers. Little buntings mainly coped with a cold environment by enhancing thermogenic capacities through enhanced respiratory enzyme activities and plasma T3. These results support the view that the primary means by which small birds meet energetic challenges of cold conditions is through metabolic adjustments.",

We quantified the relationship between acoustic accelerometer output and oxygen consumption across a range of swim speeds and water temperatures for Harrison River adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). First, we verified that acceleration transmitters with a sampling frequency of 10\u00a0Hz could be used as a proxy for movement in sockeye salmon. Using a mixed effects model, we determined that tailbeat frequency and acceleration were positively correlated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), independent of tag ID. Acceleration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) was positively related to swim speed while fork length (p\u00a0=\u00a00.051) was negatively related to swim speed. Oxygen consumption and accelerometer output (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) had a positive linear relationship and were temperature dependent (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). There were no differences in swim performance (F2,12\u00a0=\u00a01.023, p\u00a0=\u00a00.820) or oxygen consumption (F1,12\u00a0=\u00a00.054, p\u00a0=\u00a00.332) between tagged and untagged individuals. Five tagged fish were released into the Fraser River estuary and manually tracked. Of the five fish, three were successfully tracked for 1\u00a0h.

     "abstract": "In waterfowl, the response to overfeeding differs from one genotype to the other. Pekin ducks generally store lipids in the peripheral tissues while Muscovy and mule ducks promote hepatic lipid storage. A possible reason for these various susceptibilities to hepatic steatosis could be a difference in insulin sensitivity. We suggest a resistance to insulin in Pekin ducks. In the present work we investigate the action of insulin on glucose and lipid metabolisms for the three overfed genotypes. Regardless of the kind of genotype, all ducks appear to be sensitive to insulin: their glycemia is lower when the animals are treated with insulin. Insulin-treated Muscovy and Pekin ducks present a lower increase in total body weight (\u2212\u00a016.5% for Muscovy; \u2212\u00a08.3% for Pekin); and a significantly lower liver weight than the controls (\u2212\u00a09.6% and \u2212\u00a018.3%). The percentage of total lipids in the liver is higher in the controls than in the insulin-treated Pekin and mule ducks (respectively \u2212\u00a040.4% and \u2212\u00a034.7%), which means a decreased hepatic lipogenesis. Pekin ducks present a higher pectoral muscle weight when the individuals are insulin-treated (+\u00a09.7%). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity appears to be significantly higher in insulin-treated Pekin and Muscovy ducks (1.39 and 3.38 times greater than controls). Insulin-treated mule ducks present a decrease of muscle and abdominal lipid storage compared to controls (\u2212\u00a011.6% and \u2212\u00a013.8%). In this experiment, exogenous insulin has induced an increase of lipid oxidation and has led to a less favorable use and storage of dietary glucose.

We show that after short term (1 day after cortisol implantation), when the plasma levels of cortisol emulate an acute stress, the GR2 and MR expression levels were upregulated in the brain and head kidney tissues. This result reflects the role of these organs as regulators of the stress response. In general, the rest of the organs, especially gills, intestine, liver, muscle and spleen, showed decreased transcriptional levels of GR1, GR2 and MR, along with the highest plasma cortisol levels. At day 5 after cortisol implantation, when cortisol levels emulate a chronic stress, the most affected organs were gills and skin, where an upregulation of the CRs was found. In the recovery period, when cortisol levels were basal (day 10), we still found changes in the transcriptional levels of the CRs in gills, spleen and gonads. The cortisol increase at days 1 and 5 after implantation is accompanied by high plasma glucose concentrations, supporting the role of cortisol on carbohydrate metabolism. However, after 10\u00a0days of implantation, glucose returned to control levels suggesting a trade-off on the steady state of the metabolic function. We also observed increased hematocrit and hemoglobin at day 1, indicating a cortisol-induced higher metabolic demand involving an increase in oxygen transport efficiency. Our results demonstrate that increased plasma cortisol induced by a slow-release implant of cortisol mimics the overall effects of stress and affects the expression of the three CRs, generating different transcriptional patterns in a time- and organ-specific manner.",

Being able to respond to weather appropriately is crucial as it can be a threat to survival. The stress response, consisting of increases in heart rate and release of glucocorticoids, is an important mechanism by which animals cope with stressors. This study examined behavioral, heart rate, and corticosterone responses of captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to two aspects of weather mimicked under controlled conditions, a subtle (3\u00a0\u00b0C) decrease in temperature and a short, mild bout of rain. Both decreased temperature and exposure to rain elicited increases in heart rate and corticosterone in non-molting starlings. Molt is an important life history stage in birds that affects feather cover and may require a different response to weather-related stressors. We repeated the experiment in molting starlings and found increases in heart rate in response to rain and cold wind. However, the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA)-axis was suppressed during molt, as molting starlings did not increase corticosterone release in response to either stimulus. These data suggest these stimuli induce increased allostatic load in starlings, and that animals may adjust their response depending on the life-history stage.",

The kinetic properties in various PepT1 orthologs (Dicentrarchus labrax, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Danio rerio) have been explored to determine the transport efficiency of different combinations of lysine, methionine, and glycine. Species-specific differences were observed. Lys-Met resulted the best substrate at all tested potentials in sea bass and rabbit PepT1, whereas in the zebrafish transporter all tested dipeptides (except Gly-Lys) elicited similar currents independently on the charge position or amino acid composition. For the sea bass and rabbit PepT1, kinetic parameters, K0.5 and Imax and their ratio, show the importance of the position of the charged lysine in the peptide. The PepT1 transporter of these species has very low affinity for Lys-Lys and Gly-Lys; this reduces the transport efficiency which is instead higher for Lys-Met and Lys-Gly. PepT1 from zebrafish showed relatively high affinity and excellent transport efficiency for Met-Lys and Lys-Met. These data led us to speculate about the structural determinants involved in substrate interaction according to the model proposed for this transporter.",

To evaluate the effects of E. trivolvis on larval amphibian survival, growth and development, we studied a wide range of infection intensity in wood frog, Rana (=\u00a0Lithobates) sylvatica, tadpoles in laboratory experiments and outdoor mesocosms. To assess potential underlying physiological costs of infection, we measured tadpole energetics and phenotypic plasticity of the intestines as a compensatory mechanism to offset increased energy costs. Survival was high in all tadpoles, but the highest infections decreased the growth and slowed the development of tadpoles raised in mesocosms and the laboratory. However, infections failed to elicit detectable energetic costs or phenotypic changes in intestinal size. The lack of energetic costs observed in our study emphasizes the complex and often context-dependent nature of energetic costs of parasitism and suggests that other mechanisms, such as changes in host behavior, may contribute to sub-lethal effects on growth and development.",

Two concentrations of Escherichia coli LPS (5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u2212\u00a01) were used. Results showed that ROS production, NO production and CF-Ca2\u00a0+ concentration were significantly induced in the LPS-treated haemocytes. Ratio of DNA damaged cell and apoptotic cell increased caused by LPS, while esterase activity increased at the initial 60\u00a0min and dropped later. The initial increase in esterase activity suggested that LPS activated the release of esterase, and the later decrease might result from apoptosis. These results indicated that LPS would induce oxidative stress on shrimp haemocytes, and cause Ca2\u00a0+ release, DNA damage and subsequently cell apoptosis. This process of ROS/RNS-induced Ca2\u00a0+-mediated apoptosis might be one of the toxicity mechanisms of LPS on shrimp haemocytes.",

Here we explore the role that sugar gustatory thresholds and sugar concentration play on sugar selection of Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. We offered bats paired feeders containing sugar solutions of sucrose (S), glucose (G) or fructose (F) vs. pure water, and sucrose vs. 1:1 equicaloric solutions of glucose\u2013fructose at 5, 15 and 35% (wt./vol.). To see the effect of sweetness on sugar selection, we habituated the bats with a diet containing either sucrose or hexoses and subsequently evaluated sugar preferences. Sugar thresholds were S\u00a0<\u00a0G,F for G. soricina and G\u00a0<\u00a0S\u00a0<\u00a0F for L. yerbabuenae. These thresholds did not match with sugar preferences when the bats fed on dilute nectars. L. yerbabuenae changed its sugar preferences with concentration while G. soricina did not. Finally, the bats consistently preferred the sugar they were habituated to. Our results suggest that bats become accustomed to the sugar found in the most abundant plants they use, and thus prefer the most common sugars included in their diet. This could confer an advantage by allowing them shifting sugar preferences on the most common food present in their environment.",

After 20\u00a0days of acclimation to fresh water (FW) and salt water (200\u00a0mM NaCl, SW), SW birds tended to be heavier than FW birds. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Total basal metabolic rate was higher in SW birds as compared with FW birds. Renal and heart masses were also higher in the SW group. We also found greater medullary development and an increase in urine osmolality in the SW group. In spite of Z. capensis' ability to tolerate a moderate salt load in the laboratory, we hypothesize that increased cost of maintenance produced by salt consumption may significantly affect energy budget, dietary, and habitat choices in the field.",

Differences between ruminant foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters were remarkable for example in the way they ingest and digest high fibre diets. Digestion trials based on total collections are difficult to conduct or are sometimes even not possible for wild animals in the field or in zoos. To gain information on the fibre digestion achieved by these animals and the influence of body mass (BM) thereon, a method using spot sampling is desirable. In this study, in vitro fermentation of faecal neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was used as a measure of fibre digestion in large ungulates. Food and faecal samples of 10 ruminant foregut fermenting and 7 hindgut fermenting species/breeds were collected. All animals received 100% grass hay with ad libitum access. The NDF of food and faeces was fermented in vitro in a Hohenheim gas test (HGT) for 96\u00a0h. The digestion type generally had an effect on the gas production (GP) of faecal NDF in the HGT with hindgut fermenters showing higher values than ruminant foregut fermenters. At any time interval of incubation, BM had no influence on GP. The results are in accordance with both findings that ruminant foregut fermenters have longer mean retention times and more comprehensive particle reduction and findings of a lack of influence of BM on digesta mean retention time. It can be stated that the HGT (96\u00a0h) is a useful and quick method to show also small differences within groups in fibre digestion.",

     "abstract": "The objectives of the present study were to characterize the changes in crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) transcript and peptide levels in response to infection of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in a crustacean, Procambarus clarkii. After viral challenge, significant increase in virus load began at 24\u00a0h post injection (hpi) and the increase was much more substantial at 48 and 72\u00a0hpi. The hemolymph CHH levels rapidly increased after viral challenge; the increase started as early as 3\u00a0hpi and lasted for at least 2\u00a0d after the challenge. In contrast, the hemolymph glucose levels did not significantly changed over a 2 d period in the WSSV-infected animals. The CHH transcript and peptide levels in tissues were also determined. The CHH transcript levels in the eyestalk ganglia (the major site of CHH synthesis) of the virus-infected animals did not significantly change over a 2 d period and those in 2 extra-eyestalk tissues (the thoracic ganglia and cerebral ganglia) significantly increased at 24 and 48\u00a0hpi. The CHH peptide levels in the eyestalk ganglia of the virus-infected animals significantly decreased at 24 and 48\u00a0hpi and those in the thoracic ganglia and cerebral ganglia remained unchanged over a 2 d period. These data demonstrated a WSSV-induced increase in the release of CHH into hemolymph that is rapid in onset and lasting in duration. Changes in the CHH transcript and peptide levels implied that the WSSV-induced increase in hemolymph CHH levels primarily resulted from an enhanced release from the eyestalk ganglia, but the contribution of the 2 extra-eyestalk tissues to hemolymph pool of CHH increased as viral infection progressed. The combined patterns of change in the hemolymph glucose and CHH levels further suggest that the virus-enhanced CHH release would lead to higher glycolytic activity and elevated glucose mobilization presumably favorable for viral replication.",

To assess a possible role of Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) in renal osmoregulation, we first identified a partial sequence of cDNA encoding NHE3 from the Japanese eel kidney. For comparison, we also identified cDNAs encoding kidney specific Na+\u2013K+\u20132Cl\u2212 cotransporter 2 (NKCC2\u03b1) and Na+\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NCC\u03b1). In eels acclimated to a wide range of salinities from deionized freshwater to full-strength seawater, the expression of NHE3 in the kidney was the highest in eel acclimated to full-strength seawater. Meanwhile, the NCC\u03b1 expression exhibited a tendency to increase as the environmental salinity decreased, whereas the NKCC2\u03b1 expression was not significantly different among the experimental groups. Immunohistochemical studies showed that NHE3 was localized to the apical membrane of epithelial cells composing the second segments of the proximal renal tubule in seawater-acclimated eel. Meanwhile, the apical membranes of epithelial cells in the distal renal tubule and collecting duct showed more intense immunoreactions of NKCC2\u03b1 and NCC\u03b1, respectively, in freshwater eel than in seawater eel. These findings suggest that renal monovalent-ion reabsorption is mainly mediated by NKCC2\u03b1 and NCC\u03b1 in freshwater eel and by NHE3 in seawater eel.",

Previous studies of anuran freeze tolerance have implicated urea as a cryoprotectant in the wood frog (Lithobates sylvatica). However, a cryoprotective role for urea has been identified only for wood frogs, though urea accumulation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for coping with osmotic stress in amphibians. To identify whether multiple solutes are involved in freezing tolerance in the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata), we examined seasonal and freezing-induced variation in several potential cryoprotectants. We further tested for a cryoprotective role for urea by comparing survival and recovery from freezing in control and urea-loaded chorus frogs. Tissue levels of glucose, urea, and glycerol did not vary significantly among seasons for heart, liver, or leg muscle. Furthermore, no changes in urea or glycerol levels were detected with exposure to freezing temperatures in these tissues. Urea-loading increased tissue urea concentrations, but failed to enhance freezing survival or facilitate recovery from freezing in chorus frogs in this study, suggesting little role for urea as a natural cryoprotectant in this species. These data suggest that urea may not universally serve as a primary cryoprotectant among freeze-tolerant, terrestrially hibernating anurans.",

This could be due to high permeability of the intestines to nutrient-sized molecules (i.e., in the size range of amino acids and glucose, MW 75\u2013180\u00a0Da). We performed intestinal luminal perfusions of an insectivorous bat, Tadarida brasiliensis. Using radio-labeled molecules, we measured the uptake of two nutrients absorbed by paracellular and transporter-mediated mechanisms (l-proline, MW 115\u00a0Da, and d-glucose, MW 180\u00a0Da) and two carbohydrates that have no mediated transport (l-arabinose, MW 150\u00a0Da, and lactulose, MW 342\u00a0Da). Absorption of lactulose (0.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0nmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01) was significantly lower than that of the smaller arabinose (1.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0nmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01). Glucose absorption was significantly lower than that of proline at both nutrient concentrations (10\u00a0mM and 75\u00a0mM). Using the absorption of arabinose to estimate the portion of proline absorption that is paracellular, we calculated that 25.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0% to 66.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8% of proline absorption is not transporter-mediated (varying proline from 1\u00a0mM to 75\u00a0mM). These results confirm our predictions that 1) paracellular absorption is molecule size selective, 2) absorption of proline would be greater than glucose absorption in an insectivore, and 3) paracellular absorption represents a large fraction of total nutrient absorption in bats.",

It has been shown that in the eel (Anguilla anguilla) heart, nitric oxide (NO) exerts a direct myocardial relaxant effect, increasing the sensitivity of the Frank\u2013Starling response (Garofalo et al., 2009). With the use of isolated working heart preparations, this study investigated the relationship between NO modulation of Frank\u2013Starling response and temperature challenges in the eel. The results showed that while, in long-term acclimated fish (spring animals perfused at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and winter animals perfused at 10\u00a0\u00b0C) the inhibition of NO production by L-N5 (1-iminoethyl)ornithine (L-NIO) significantly reduced the Frank\u2013Starling response, under thermal shock conditions (spring animals perfused at 10 or 15\u00a0\u00b0C and winter animals perfused at 15 or 20\u00a0\u00b0C) L-NIO treatment resulted without effect. Western blotting analysis revealed a decrease of peNOS and pAkt expressions in samples subjected to thermal shock. Moreover, an increase in Hsp90 protein levels was observed under heat thermal stress. Together, these data suggest that the NO synthase/NO-dependent modulation of the Frank\u2013Starling mechanism in fish is sensitive to thermal stress.",

     "abstract": "Air-breathing fish of the Anabantoidei group meet their metabolic requirements for oxygen through both aerial and aquatic gas exchange. Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens are anabantoids that frequently engage in aggressive male\u2013male interactions which cause significant increases in metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. These interactions involve opercular flaring behaviour that is thought to limit aquatic oxygen uptake, and combines with the increase in metabolic rate to cause an increase in air-breathing behaviour. Air-breathing events interrupt display behaviour and increase risk of predation, raising the question of how Siamese fighting fish manage their oxygen requirements during agonistic encounters. Using open-flow respirometry, we measured rate of oxygen consumption in displaying fish to determine if males increase oxygen uptake per breath to minimise visits to the surface, or increase their reliance on aquatic oxygen uptake. We found that the increased oxygen requirements of Siamese fighting fish during display behaviour were met by increased oxygen uptake from the air with no significant changes in aquatic oxygen uptake. The increased aerial oxygen uptake was achieved almost entirely by an increase in air-breathing frequency. We conclude that limitations imposed by the reduced gill surface area of air-breathing fish restrict the ability of Siamese fighting fish to increase aquatic uptake, and limitations of the air-breathing organ of anabantoids largely restrict their capacity to increase oxygen uptake per breath. The resulting need to increase surfacing frequency during metabolically demanding agonistic encounters has presumably contributed to the evolution of the stereotyped surfacing behaviour seen during male\u2013male interactions, during which one of the fish will lead the other to the surface, and each will take a breath of air.",

The current study examines responses of the glutathione system of antioxidant defense after temperature acclimation. We measured total glutathione (tGSH), and protein levels of GPx1, GPx4, and GST (cardiac and skeletal muscles), and enzymatic activity (skeletal muscle) of glutathione-dependent antioxidants (GPx, GPx4, and GST) in tissues from striped bass (Morone saxatilis) acclimated for six weeks to 7\u00a0\u00b0C or 25\u00a0\u00b0C. tGSH of cardiac muscle from cold-acclimated animals was 1.2-times higher than in warm-bodied counterparts, but unchanged with temperature acclimation in skeletal muscle. A second low molecular weight antioxidant, ascorbate was 1.4- and 1.5-times higher in cardiac and skeletal muscle, respectively in warm- than cold-acclimated animals. Despite 1.2-times higher oxidative capacities (as indicated by citrate synthase activity), in skeletal muscle from cold- versus warm-acclimated fish, levels and activities of antioxidant enzymes were similar between acclimation groups. Lipid peroxidation products (as indicated by TBARS), normalized to tissue wet weight, were more than 2-times higher in skeletal muscle from cold- than warm-acclimated animals, however, when normalized to phospholipid content there was no statistical difference between acclimation groups.

     "abstract": "Two lines of rainbow trout divergently selected for muscle fat content, fat line (F) and lean line (L) were used to investigate the effect of genetic selection on digestion, intestinal nutrient transport and fatty acid bioconversion, in relation to dietary starch intake. This study involved a digestibility trial for 2\u00a0weeks using Cr2O3 as inert marker, followed by a feeding trial for 4\u00a0weeks. For the entire duration, juvenile trout from the two lines were fed diets with or without gelatinized starch. Blood, pyloric ceca, midgut and hindgut were sampled at 24\u00a0h after the last meal. Transcripts of the proteins involved in nutrient transport and fatty acid bioconversion were abundant in the proximal intestine. GLUT2 transcripts were slightly higher in the F line ceca than in the L line. Dietary starch intake did not enhance the transcription of intestinal glucose transporters, SGLT1 and GLUT2; but it was associated with the higher expression of ApoA1 and PepT1 in the midgut. Significantly, the F line exhibited higher intestinal mRNA levels of MTP, ApoA4, Elovl2, Elovl5 and D6D than the L line, linked to chylomicron assembly and fatty acid bioconversion. Apparent digestibility coefficients of protein, lipid and starch were high in both lines, but not significantly different between them. In conclusion, we found a higher potential of chylomicron synthesis and fatty acid bioconversion in the intestine of F line, but no adaptive transcriptional response of glucose transporters to dietary starch and no genotypic differences in nutrient digestibility.",

This study evaluated growth performance using physiological and molecular markers of growth in response to fasting in six commonly used zebrafish strains [AB, TU, TL, SJA, WIK, and petstore (PET) zebrafish]. Fasting resulted in a standard decrease in whole blood glucose levels, a typical vertebrate glucose metabolism pattern, in AB, PET, TL, and TU zebrafish strains. Alternatively, fasting did not affect glucose levels in SJA and WIK zebrafish strains. Similarly, fasting had no effect on myostatin mRNA levels in AB, PET, TU, and WIK zebrafish strains, but decreased myostatin-1 and \u2212\u00a02 mRNA levels in SJA zebrafish. Consistent with previous work, fasting increased myostatin-2 mRNA levels in TL zebrafish. These data demonstrate that variation is present in growth performance between commonly used inbred strains of zebrafish.

To clarify the effect of salinity, the habitat use history of the eels were determined using otolith microchemistry. Expression levels of mRNA of each hormone were determined using real time PCR. Although GH and PRL have been known to be osmoregulatory hormones, there were no consistent differences in expression levels of these hormones between different salinity habitats. In contrast, SL mRNA expression was higher in eels from freshwater rivers than from the brackish lake. GH mRNA expression clearly decreased during silvering, whereas PRL and SL mRNA expression did not change. We also showed that PRL mRNA and SL mRNA decreased in the brackish lake and PRL mRNA increased in freshwater rivers from autumn to early winter.

In 30 DAH-old herring larvae with well-established exogenous feeding only, very few CCK-producing cells could be identified, indicating that cck production in the gut had shut down after three days of starvation. This suggests that cck transcription is pre-programmed by a local timer in the midgut during the yolk-sac stage, regardless of the nutritional status and presence of nutrients in the gut lumen; however, it becomes strongly influenced by the external nutritional conditions after the yolk has been completely absorbed.

     "abstract": "Amphibians respond to environmental stressors by secreting corticosterone, a stress hormone which promotes physiological and behavioral responses. Capture handling can be used to stimulate physiological stress response in amphibians. The use of single blood sampling and presentation of mean data often limits the quantification of within and between individual variation in baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses in amphibians. It is important for studies of amphibian physiological ecology to determine whether baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses are consistent or not. We quantified repeatability (r), a statistical measure of consistency, in baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses to a standard capture and handling stress protocol in free-living adult male cane toads (Rhinella marina). Corticosterone metabolite concentrations were measured entirely non-invasively in male toad urine samples via an enzyme-immunoassay. During the first sampling occasion, urine samples were collected manually from individual male toads (n\u00a0=\u00a020) immediately upon field capture. Toads were handled for 5\u00a0min then transferred to plastic bags (constituting a mild stressor), and urine samples were collected hourly over 8\u00a0h in the field. The toads were resampled for baseline (0\u00a0h) urine corticosterone with hourly urine sampling over 8\u00a0h (for quantification of the stress induced corticosterone) at 14\u00a0day intervals on three consecutive occasions. Within and between sample variations in urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations were also quantified. All toads expressed a corticosterone stress response over 8\u00a0h to our standard capture and handling stress protocol. Variations both within and between toads was higher for corrected integrated corticosterone concentrations than corticosterone concentrations at baseline, 3 or 6\u00a0h. Baseline urinary corticosterone metabolite concentration of the male toads was highly repeatable (r\u00a0=\u00a00.877) together with high statistical repeatabilities for 3\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.695), 6\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.428) and 8\u00a0h (r\u00a0=\u00a00.775) corticosterone metabolite concentrations, and for the total and corrected integrated corticosterone responses (r\u00a0=\u00a00.807; r\u00a0=\u00a00.743 respectively). This study highlights that baseline and short-term corticosterone stress responses are repeatable in free-living amphibians. Future studies should utilize this non-invasive tool to explore repeatability among seasons and across years, and determine its functional significance in relation to behavioral ecology and reproduction in amphibians generally.",

In N. granulata the metabolic adjustments during starvation and refeeding use different pathways according to the composition of the diet previously offered to the crabs. During starvation, 14CO2 production from 14C-glycine, and 14C-protein synthesis from 14C-leucine were reduced in HC-fed crabs. In crabs maintained on the HP or HC diet, 14C-total lipid synthesis increased after 15\u00a0days of starvation. In crabs fed HP diet, 14C-MeAIB uptake and Na+\u2013K+-ATPase activity decreased in refeeding state. In crabs refeeding HC diet, 14C-MeAIB uptake and 14CO2 production decreased during the refeeding. In contrast, the 14C-protein synthesis increased after 120\u00a0h of refeeding. In both dietary groups, 14C-total lipid synthesis increased during refeeding. Changes in the carbon amino acid flux between different metabolic pathways in muscle are among the strategies used by this crab to face starvation and refeeding.

It is composed of a core protein with covalently attached glycosaminoglycan, and N-linked glycosylated (N-glycosylated) chains, and is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Glypican-1 plays a key role in the growth and development of muscle by regulating fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The GPI anchor of glypican-1 can be cleaved, resulting in glypican-1 being secreted or shed into the extracellular matrix environment. The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of glypican-1 shedding and the glycosaminoglycan and N-glycosylated chains in regulating the differentiation of turkey myogenic satellite cells. A glypican-1 construct without the GPI anchor was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMS-EGFP, and glypican-1 without the GPI anchor and glycosaminoglycan and N-glycosylated chains were also cloned. These constructs were co-transfected into turkey myogenic satellite cells with a small interference RNA targeting the GPI anchor of endogenous glypican-1. The soluble glypican-1 mutants were not detected in the satellite cells but in the cell medium, suggesting the secretion of the soluble glypican-1 mutants. Soluble glypican-1 increased satellite cell differentiation and enhanced myotube formation in the presence of exogenous FGF2. The increase in differentiation was supported by the elevated expression of myogenin. In conclusion, the shedding of glypican-1 from the satellite cell surface acts as a positive regulator of satellite cell differentiation and sequesters FGF2, permitting further differentiation.",

Post-smolts in seawater (average mass 175\u00a0g) that had been reared at 12\u00a0\u00b0C were kept at three temperatures (8, 12 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C) and sampled after one and three months. After three months, the fish kept in 18\u00a0\u00b0C had decreased growth rate and condition factor, and elevated plasma levels of growth hormone (GH) and leptin, compared with fish kept at the lower temperatures. Food conversion efficiency was also decreased at 18\u00a0\u00b0C, while at the same time protein uptake was improved and thus was not a limiting mechanism for growth. Redistribution of energy stores in fish at the highest temperature is evident as a preference of maintaining length growth during times of limited energy availability. NMR-based metabolomics analyses of plasma revealed that several metabolites involved in energy metabolism were negatively affected by temperature in the upper temperature range of Atlantic salmon. Specifically, the high temperature induced a decline of several amino acids (glutamine, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and a shift in lipid metabolism. It appears likely that the decreased food intake at the highest temperature is linked to an anorexigenic function of leptin, but also that the decreased food intake, feed conversion efficiency and condition factor can be linked to changes in GH endocrinology.",

In specimen exposed to elevated pCO2 levels for at least 7\u00a0days, mimicking a future ocean scenario as predicted until the year 2300, hemolymph K+ and ammonia concentrations were significantly elevated, and an increased ammonia excretion rate was observed. A detailed quantitative gene expression analysis revealed that upon elevated pCO2 exposure, mRNA levels of transcripts hypothesized to be involved in ammonia and acid\u2013base regulation (Rhesus-like protein, membrane-bound carbonic anhydrase, Na+/K+-ATPase) were affected predominantly in the non-osmoregulating anterior gills.",

Hatching success was slightly lower for eggs incubated in dry conditions than those in wet conditions, but the difference was not statistically significant. The heart rates of early embryos were lower on moist substrates than those on dry substrates, but this difference disappeared in late embryos. Hatchlings from the moistest substrate were larger (in carapace length and width) and heavier than those from drier substrates.

We report on paracellular absorption in laboratory mice, the smallest nonflying mammal species studied to date.

Absorption of 3OMD-glucose by mice was essentially complete (f\u00a0=\u00a00.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07) and much higher than that for l-arabinose (f\u00a0=\u00a00.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02), indicating that in mice, like other nonflying mammals, >\u00a080% of glucose is absorbed by mediated process(es) rather than the passive, paracellular route. As in all other vertebrates, absorption of cellobiose (f\u00a0=\u00a00.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02) was even lower than that for l-arabinose, suggesting an equivalent molecular size cut-off for flying and nonflying animals and thus a comparable effective TJ aperture.

Experiments were conducted on the two populations of the parasitoid wasp, Venturia canescens, undergoing contrasting thermal regimes in their respective preferential habitat (thermally variable vs. buffered). We predicted the following: i) development at low temperatures improves the cold tolerance of parasitoid wasps, ii) the shape of the cold tolerance reaction norm differs between the two populations, and iii) these phenotypic variations are correlated with their metabolic profiles. Our results showed that habitat origin and developmental acclimation interact to determine cold tolerance and metabolic profiles of the parasitoid wasps. Cold tolerance was promoted when developmental temperatures declined and population originating from variable habitat presented a higher cold tolerance. Cold tolerance increases through the accumulation of metabolites with an assumed cryoprotective function and the depression of metabolites involved in energy metabolism.

     "abstract": "Glucagon is conventionally regarded as a hormone, counter regulatory in function to insulin and plays a critical anti-hypoglycemic role by maintaining glucose homeostasis in both animals and humans. Glucagon performs this function by increasing hepatic glucose output to the blood by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in response to starvation. Additionally it plays a homeostatic role by decreasing glycogenesis and glycolysis in tandem to try and maintain optimal glucose levels. To perform this action, it also increases energy expenditure which is contrary to what one would expect and has actions which are unique and not entirely in agreement with its role in protection from hypoglycemia. Interestingly, glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) from the major fragment of proglucagon (in non-mammalian vertebrates, as well as in mammals) may also modulate response to stress in addition to their other physiological actions. These unique modes of action occur in response to psychological, metabolic and other stress situations and mirror the role of adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) in insects which perform a similar function. The findings on the anti-stress roles of glucagon and glucagon-like peptides in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates may throw light on the multiple stress responsive mechanisms which operate in a concerted manner under regulation by AKH in insects thus functioning as a stress responsive hormone while also maintaining organismal homeostasis.",

The incidence of parasite load, disease and inflammation often rise during the specific energetically demanding time of pregnancy and lactation. In this period, blood leukocytes display decreased DNA synthesis in response to mitogens in vitro. Leukocyte activation, the phase of the cell cycle preceding the DNA synthetic phase has hardly been investigated, but the few studies suggest that leukocyte activation may also be impaired by the limited energy/nutrient availability. Leukocyte activation is characterized by manifold processes, thus, we used the cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as a measure of ATP turnover to support all these processes. We hypothesized that the activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) \u2013 in terms of oxygen consumed over basal levels after in vitro stimulation \u2013 is altered by energy balance around parturition. We studied peripartum high-yielding dairy cows because they undergo substantial fluctuations in energy intake, energy output and body fat mass. We established a fluorescence-based test strategy allowing for long-term (\u2265\u00a024\u00a0h) quantification of O2-consumption and studied the peripartum period from 5\u00a0weeks ante partum to 5\u00a0weeks postpartum. In addition, we determined cellular lactate production, DNA/RNA synthesis and cell size and zoo-technical parameters such as animal energy intake and milk yield were assessed, as well as selected plasma parameters, e.g. glucose concentration. The basal OCR of PBMC from pregnant, non-lactating cows (n\u00a0=\u00a06, \u2212\u00a05\u00a0weeks ante partum) was 1.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0nmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 (107\u00a0cells)\u2212\u00a01 and increased to maximum levels of 2.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49\u00a0nmol\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 (107\u00a0cells)\u2212\u00a01 in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBMC. The basal OCR did not change over the peripartum period. Whereas the activation indices, herein defined as the PHA-induced 24\u00a0h-increase of OCR above baseline, amounted to 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1, 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, and 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 at weeks \u2212\u00a05, \u2212\u00a01, +\u00a01, +\u00a02, and +\u00a05 relative to parturition, respectively. Because the activation index was positively correlated to plasma glucose levels and to energy balance during late pregnancy (week \u2212\u00a05/week \u2212\u00a01) and transition to lactation (week \u2212\u00a01/week +\u00a02), we conclude that PBMC activation is modulated by energy/nutrient availability. In future studies, the activation index should aid the identification of causal mechanisms of disparity in PBMC activation, such as attenuated ion transport or macromolecule synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Most marine teleost fishes residing in a high freeze-risk ecozone, such as the coastal waters of Newfoundland during winter, avoid freezing by secreting high concentrations of antifreeze proteins (AFP) into their blood plasma where they can bind to and prevent the growth of ice that enter the fish. Cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), which overwinter in such shallow waters are the only known exception. Although this species does produce type I AFP, the plasma levels are too low to be of value as a freeze protectant. Southern and Northern blot analyses carried out in this study establish that the cunner AFP genes belong to a multigene family that is predominantly expressed in external epithelia (skin and gill filaments). These results support the hypothesis that the survival of cunner in icy waters is attributable in part to epithelial AFP that help block ice propagation into their interior milieu. In contrast to the cunner, heterospecifics occupying the same habitat have greater freeze protection because they produce AFP in the liver for export to the plasma as well as in external epithelia. Since the external epithelia would be the first tissue to come into contact with ice it is possible that one of the earliest steps involved in the evolution of freeze resistant fish could have been the expression of AFP in tissues such as the skin. We suggest that this epithelial-dominant AFP expression represents a primitive stage in AFP evolution and propose that cunner began to inhabit \u201cfreeze-risk ecozones\u201d more recently than heterospecifics.",

We find that wild-type Mb traits are only superior under specific behavioral and physiological conditions that critically prolong the ADL, action radius, and fitness of the seals. As an extreme example, the mutations in the conserved His-64 reduce ADL up to 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0min for routine aerobic dives, whereas many other mutations are nearly neutral in terms of ADL and the inferred fitness. We also find that the cardiac system, the muscle O2-store, animal behavior (i.e. pre-dive ventilation), and the oxygen binding affinity of Mb, KO2, have co-evolved to optimize dive duration at routine aerobic diving conditions, suggesting that such conditions are mostly selected upon in seals. The model is capable of roughly quantifying the physiological impact of single-protein mutations and thus bridges an important gap between animal physiology and molecular (protein) evolution.",

     "abstract": "Differences in allometric scaling of physiological characters have the appeal to explain species diversification and niche differentiation along a body mass (BM) gradient \u2014 because they lead to different combinations of physiological properties, and thus may facilitate different adaptive strategies. An important argument in physiological ecology is built on the allometries of gut fill (assumed to scale to BM1.0) and energy requirements/intake (assumed to scale to BM0.75) in mammalian herbivores. From the difference in exponents, it has been postulated that the mean retention time (MRT) of digesta should scale to BM1.0\u20130.75\u00a0=\u00a0BM0.25. This has been used to argue that larger animals have an advantage in digestive efficiency and hence can tolerate lower-quality diets. However, empirical data does not support the BM0.25 scaling of MRT, and the deduction of MRT scaling implies, according to physical principles, no scaling of digestibility; basing assumptions on digestive efficiency on the thus-derived MRT scaling amounts to circular reasoning. An alternative explanation considers a higher scaling exponent for food intake than for metabolism, allowing larger animals to eat more of a lower quality food without having to increase digestive efficiency; to date, this concept has only been explored in ruminants. Here, using data for 77 species in which intake, digestibility and MRT were measured (allowing the calculation of the dry matter gut contents (DMC)), we show that the unexpected shallow scaling of MRT is common in herbivores and may result from deviations of other scaling exponents from expectations. Notably, DMC have a lower scaling exponent than 1.0, and the 95% confidence intervals of the scaling exponents for intake and DMC generally overlap. Differences in the scaling of wet gut contents and dry matter gut contents confirm a previous finding that the dry matter concentration of gut contents decreases with body mass, possibly compensating for the less favorable volume\u2013surface ratio in the guts of larger organisms. These findings suggest that traditional explanations for herbivore niche differentiation along a BM gradient should not be based on allometries of digestive physiology. In contrast, they support the recent interpretation that larger species can tolerate lower-quality diets because their intake has a higher allometric scaling than their basal metabolism, allowing them to eat relatively more of a lower quality food without having to increase digestive efficiency.",

Expression of mRNAs for ghrelin and GHS-R1a in both hypothalamus and largest ovarian follicle was measured by RT-PCR. It was observed that food restriction could promote the expression of ghrelin and GHS-R1a in hypothalamus and ovary of the old chickens, but in the young chickens it reduced expression of ghrelin and did not affect expression of GHS-R1a in the ovary. Administration of ghrelin 1\u201318 did not affect hypothalamic or ovarian ghrelin mRNA, but significantly increased the expression of GHS-R1a in hypothalamus, but not in ovary. (D-Lys-3)-GHRP-6, significantly stimulated accumulation of ghrelin, but not GHS-R1a mRNA in hypothalamus or ghrelin or GHS-R1a in the ovary. Ghrelin 1\u201318 and (D-Lys-3)-GHRP-6, when given together, were able either to prevent or to induce effect of these hormones. Obestatin administration increased expression of ghrelin gene in the hypothalamus, but not expression of hypothalamic GHS-R1a, ovarian ghrelin and GHS-R1a. Furthermore, obestatin was able to modify effect of both ghrelin and fasting on hypothalamic and ovarian mRNA for ghrelin GHS-R1a. Our results (1) confirm the existence of ghrelin and its functional receptors GHS-R1a in the chicken hypothalamus and ovary (2) confirm the age-dependent control of ovarian ghrelin by feeding, (3) demonstrate, that nutritional status can influence the expression of both ghrelin and GHS-R1a in hypothalamus and in the ovary (3) demonstrates for the first time, that ghrelin can promote generation of its functional receptor in the hypothalamus, but not in the ovary, (4) show that ghrelin1\u201318 and (D-Lys-3)-GHRP-6 could not only be antagonists in the action on chicken hypothalamus and ovaries, but also independent regulators and even agonists, and (5) provide first evidence for action of obestatin on hypothalamic ghrelin and on the response of hypothalamic and ovarian ghrelin/GHS-R1a system to food restriction.

One species in particular, T. newnesi, displayed no acclimatory response to any of the treatments regardless of acclimation time and may have a reduced capacity to respond to environmental change. Furthermore, we present evidence that temperature and pCO2 act synergistically to further elevate the RMR and slow acclimation when compared to temperature or pCO2 increases alone.",

The present study focused on the dynamic elimination of the Cl\u2212 secretory capacity and illustrated different phases (i.e., acute and regulatory phases) of branchial MR cells in response to hypoosmotic challenge. Time-course remodeling of the cell surfaces and the altered expressions of typical ion transporters were observed in the branchial MR cells of SW-acclimated brackish medaka (Oryzias dancena) when exposed to fresh water (FW). On the 1st day post-transfer, rapid changes were shown in the acute phase: the flat-type MR cells with large apical surfaces replaced the hole-type cells, the gene expression of both Odnkcc1a and Odcftr decreased, and the apical immunostaining signals of CFTR protein disappeared. The basolateral immunostaining signals of NKCC1a protein decreased throughout the regulatory phase (>\u00a01\u00a0day post-transfer). During this period, the size and number of NKA-immunoreactive MR cells were significantly reduced and elevated, respectively.

The results revealed that when SW-acclimated brackish medaka were transferred to hypoosmotic FW for 24\u00a0h, the Cl\u2212 secretory capacity of MR cells was eliminated, whereas NKCC1a protein was retained to maintain the hypoosmoregulatory endurance of the gills.

Similar to the related cyprinodont, Fundulus heteroclitus, Na+ uptake was significantly inhibited when exposed to low pH water. However, it initially appeared that C. v. variegatus increased apparent net acid excretion at low pH relative to circumneutral pH. This result is opposite to previous observations for F. heteroclitus under similar conditions where fish were observed to switch from apparent net H+ excretion at circumneutral pH to apparent net H+ uptake at low pH. Further investigation revealed disparate observations between these studies were the result of using double endpoint titrations to measure titratable alkalinity fluxes in the current study, while the earlier study utilized single endpoint titrations to measure these fluxes (i.e.,. Cyprinodon acid\u2013base transport is qualitatively similar to Fundulus when characterized using single endpoint titrations). This led to a comparative investigation of these two methods. We hypothesized that either the single endpoint methodology was being influenced by a change in the buffer capacity of the water (e.g., mucus being released by the fish) at low pH, or the double endpoint methodology was not properly accounting for ammonia flux by the fish. A series of follow-up experiments indicated that buffer capacity of the water did not change significantly, that excretion of protein (a surrogate for mucus) was actually reduced at low pH, and that the double endpoint methodology does not properly account for NH3 excretion by fish under low pH conditions. As a result, it overestimates net H+ excretion during low pH exposure. After applying the maximum possible correction for this error (i.e., assuming that all ammonia is excreted as NH3), the double endpoint methodology indicates that net H+ transport was reduced to effectively zero in both species at pH 4.5.

Gene expression of fabp2 was observed in all tissues investigated, although differences were observed between isoforms. The highest fabp2a1, fabp2a2, and fabp2b expression was in the intestine. A 15\u00a0kDa protein, corresponding to putative Fabp2 protein, was identified by immunoblotting using anti-human Fabp2 antibody. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry confirmed that Fabp2 protein was present in most Atlantic salmon tissues. Similar to gene expression, intestinal tissues had the highest Fabp2 protein levels, decreasing gradually from proximal to distal intestine. During development of distal intestinal inflammation caused by dietary soybean meal from 0 to 21\u00a0days, Fabp2 decreased significantly on both transcriptional and protein levels. The reduction in Fabp2 was preceded by a down regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar) alpha and gamma, fabp2's presumed regulatory proteins, and followed by a progressive increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) staining. Results illustrate that the early decline of distal intestinal fabp2 was likely caused by a down regulation of their regulatory proteins, but at later time points reduced Fabp2 may largely be due to a less mature enterocyte population resulting from rapid cell turnover.",

Parameters related to glucose and lipid metabolism were then assessed. The results suggest that when both nutrients were administered at the same time, an increased potential for lipogenesis occurred concomitantly with a lower level of glycaemia. In a second experiment we administered intraperitoneally a single FA present in the FO mixture such as oleic acid (60 or 300\u00a0\u03bcg.kg\u2212\u00a01) whereas octanoic acid (60 or 300\u00a0\u03bcg.kg\u2212\u00a01) was used as negative control (absent from the FO). However, the effects of both FA were similar in reducing the potential of lipid synthesis and oxidation, and in enhancing the potential of glucose synthesis and glycogenesis. Differences found between FO and single FA administration show that response to FA was dependent on the treatment (mixture vs. single FA) but also comply with the idea that an interaction between FA and glucose rather than FA alone are in the origin of the results reported. The administration of individual FA such as oleic and octanoic acid failed in enhancing lipogenesis and reducing plasma glucose levels and thus in explaining results obtained with FO. However, results provide evidence that FA even provided at a low dose play a key role in the regulation of several putative components of a FA sensing system present in rainbow trout liver.",

     "abstract": "Glucocorticoid regulates epidermal cell proliferation, and is used to treat certain skin disorders. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, is also linked to skin development in teleost fish. Cortisol increases the number of epithelial ionocytes during environmental acclimation in euryhaline fishes, but it is unclear whether this is due to increased differentiation or proliferation. To investigate, we treated zebrafish embryos with exogenous cortisol (20\u00a0mg/L). The densities of the ionocytes Na+-K+-ATPase rich cells (NaRCs) and H+-ATPase rich cells (HRCs) were significantly increased by cortisol, and this was accompanied by an increase in the respective marker genes. Expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene was decreased. Cortisol treatment also increased ionocytes in cultured adult zebrafish gills, and up-regulated expression of genes encoding forkhead box I3 (foxi3a and foxi3b) transcription factors, which regulate ionocyte progenitor development. GR expression was up-regulated by cortisol in vitro; as such, the observed decrease in vivo reflects a regulatory systemic-negative feedback. Notably, in situ hybridization revealed that foxi3a/b mRNA expression was increased by cortisol at 24\u201348\u00a0h post-fertilization. Cortisol also decreased keratinocytes, but did not affect epidermal stem cells or mucus cells. We conclude that foxi3a/b transactivation by cortisol-GR favors differentiation of ionocyte progenitors, thereby facilitating proliferation of mature ionocytes.",

Zatebradine, a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker, vastly reduced atrial and ventricular contraction rates in a similar concentration-dependent manner, indicating a major role for HCN in setting intrinsic heart rate. When voltage-gated Na+ channels were blocked with tetrodotoxin (TTX), atrial contraction rate declined in a dose-dependent manner, but remained faster than ventricular rate even at very high TTX concentrations. This TTX resistance compared with other fish suggests an important role for a TTX-sensitive inactivation-resistant Na+ current in atrioventricular conduction and chamber synchrony, and a lesser role in setting intrinsic heart rate. T and L-type calcium channel blockers, nickel and nifedipine respectively, also reduced atrial and ventricular contraction rates, nickel having a larger effect on the atrium. These novel results for hagfish are consistent with intrinsic atrial and ventricular rates being set mostly by HCN, with lesser contributions from other ion channels. We suggest that future electrophysiological studies will reveal that hagfishes, with their ancestral position in the evolution of the vertebrate-type chambered heart, share some but not all features of vertebrate intrinsic heart rate control.",

     "abstract": "The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system plays a major role in coordinating the growth of vertebrates including fish. Considerable research on the regulation of growth has focused on the production and secretion of GH from the pituitary. This review will synthesize recent work on regulating extrapituitary aspects of the GH\u2013IGF system, which includes GH binding proteins (GHBP), GH receptors (GHR), IGF binding protein (IGFBP), and IGF receptors (IGFR). These components are widely distributed and they interact to coordinate growth as well as a host of other biological processes such as metabolism, osmoregulation, reproduction, behavior, and immunity. The GH\u2013IGF system of fish is particularly interesting and complex because it consists of multiple subtypes of GHRs, IGFRs, and IGFBPs that arose through gene duplication events associated with the evolution of the teleost lineage. Peripheral regulation of the GH\u2013IGF system results from adjusting peripheral sensitivity to GH and IGFs as well as from modulating the bioavailability and actions of GH and IGFs in target cells. Numerous chemicals, including hormones such as growth hormone, insulin, somatostatin, and sex steroids as well as a variety of transcription factors, proteases, and phosphatases, regulate the synthesis and activity of GHRs, GHBPs, IGFRs, and IGFBPs as well as the synthesis, secretion, and bioavailability of IGFs. In addition, numerous environmental factors such as nutritional state, photoperiod, stress, and temperature have dramatic effects on the expression and activity of peripheral components of the GH/IGF system. The complex regulation of these system components appears to be both organism- and tissue-specific.",

However, basic knowledge of FTO in the chicken is lacking. Therefore, we studied the tissue distribution, age and breed dependent changes, brain localization, as well as the impact of fasting on FTO mRNA expression in the chicken. FTO mRNA was expressed in all the tissues studied, and generally, with high expression in hypothalamus, liver, visceral fat and cerebellum. However it exhibited breed-specific patterns: in broilers, the highest expression was seen in the liver, while in layers, hypothalamus and cerebellum showed relatively higher FTO mRNA expression. One-week-old broilers expressed markedly higher FTO mRNA in liver compared with the layers of the same age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while the breed difference was reversed in visceral fat and cerebellum (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with newly hatched chicks (one week of age), adult layers expressed higher FTO mRNA in liver and visceral fat, while adult broilers showed higher expression in hypothalamus and cerebellum. In situ hybridization demonstrated distribution of FTO mRNA in paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN), nucleus ventromedialis hypothalami (VMN), nucleus lateralis hypothalami (LHy), nucleus dorsomedialis hypothalami (DMN) of the hypothalamus and nucleus habenularis medialis (HM) and stratum cellulare externum (SCE) of the thalamus. Breed-specific expression of FTO mRNA was shown in PVN, but not in VMN, with higher abundance in broilers compared to layers. The decrease in FTO mRNA levels after 24\u00a0h of fasting was seen only in VMN of layer chickens.

Intracerebroventricular administration of glucagon in chicks induced hyperglycemia and anorexia from 30\u00a0min after administration. However, the plasma insulin level did not increase until 90\u00a0min after glucagon administration, suggesting that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells may be suppressed by central glucagon. The plasma corticosterone concentration significantly increased from 30\u00a0min to 120\u00a0min after administration, suggesting that central glucagon activates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis in chicks. However, central administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which activates the HPA axis in chicken hypothalamus, significantly reduced not only food intake but also plasma glucose concentration, suggesting that CRF and the activation of the HPA axis are related to the glucagon-induced anorexia but not hyperglycemia in chicks. Phentolamine, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the glucagon-induced hyperglycemia, suggesting that glucagon induced hyperglycemia at least partly via \u03b1-adrenergic neural pathway. Co-administration of phentolamine and \u03b1-helical CRF, a CRF receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated glucagon-induced hyperglycemia and anorexia. It is therefore likely that central administration of glucagon suppresses food intake at least partly via CRF-induced anorexigenic pathway in chicks.",

We investigated these relationships through focal observations of males calling naturally, followed by blood sampling for hormonal radioimmunoassay. We additionally used an experimental approach, which consisted of broadcasting recorded advertisement calls for 10\u00a0min to simulate an invasion in the territory of the focal subjects, followed by behavioral observation and blood sampling for hormonal radioimmunoassay. Results showed a pattern of co-variation between CORT and T across the breeding season. Furthermore, individual variation in CORT and T was related to different aspects of behavior: individuals with higher CORT showed higher calling rates, and individuals with higher steroid levels, mainly T, showed higher responsivity to social stimulation by other males in the chorus. Experimental simulation of territorial intrusion by using playback of advertisement calls of this species did not elicit consistent changes in agonistic behavior and CORT, but decreased T in focal males.",

The effects of some environmental factors, like temperature and photoperiod, are now well understood. There are only a few studies regarding the effects of hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the reproductive cycle, in spite of its importance as a ubiquitous factor in all biological environments and affecting all living organisms. Hydrostatic pressure is of particular importance in fish because they can also experience rapid and cyclic changes in HP due to vertical movements in the water column. The aim of the present research was to investigate the effects of vertical migrations on the reproductive steroids of maturing female flounder. After a 14\u00a0day exposure to cyclic hydrostatic pressure (with a period of 12.4\u00a0h and with a maximum peak of 800\u00a0kPa of absolute hydrostatic pressure), fish showed significantly lower plasmatic concentrations of \u201c5\u03b2,3\u03b1\u201d steroids, metabolites of the putative maturation-inducing steroid in flounder (17\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one).

Therefore, modulation of NKA expression or activity and its regulatory subunit, FXYD protein, is essential for teleosts in salinity adaptation. To understand the mechanisms for modulation of NKA in catadromous fishes, NKA expression and activity, cloning and mRNA expression of FXYD11 (AjFXYD11) were examined in Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) exposed to fresh water (FW) and seawater (SW; 35\u2030). Expression and activity of NKA as well as mRNA expression of AjFXYD11 in gills were elevated in SW eel compared to FW eel. Conversely, NKA responses in eel kidneys were higher in FW group than SW group, whereas no significant difference was found in renal AjFXYD11 expression between the two groups. Comparison of NKA activity and AjFXYD11 expression between two osmoregulatory tissues suggested that AjFXYD11 plays a specific, functional role in gills. However, since cortisol plays an important role for regulation of ion transport in teleost SW acclimation and gill AjFXYD11 expression was elevated in SW eel, the organ culture approach was used to study the effect of cortisol on gill AjFXYD11 mRNA expression. Our results revealed that cortisol treatment increased the levels of gill AjFXYD11 transcripts. This finding suggested that cortisol could be involved in the regulation of NKA by altering AjFXYD11 expression during the process of SW acclimation in A. japonica. Taken together, the differential expression of branchial and renal NKA and AjFXYD11 implicated their roles in the osmotic homeostasis of Japanese eel exposed to environments of different salinities.",

We applied both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate Casr gene and CaSR protein expression, respectively, in skeletal tissues of a cichlid teleost, the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). By RT-PCR, CaSR gene (Casr) expression was observed in skull and vertebral column (including notochordal tissues). Relative to skeleton, IHC revealed CaSR protein expression in notochordal sheath cells within the vertebral canal, in scleroblasts associated with body surface scales, and in chondrocytes within hyaline cartilage. Although closely apposed cells border the acellular bone in tilapia, these cells were only weakly immunostained.

     "abstract": "Based on early pharmacological work, the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor subtype is believed to be involved in the regulation of toadfish pulsatile urea excretion. The goal of the following study was to characterize the toadfish 5-HT2A receptor at a molecular level, to determine the tissues in which this receptor is predominantly expressed and to further investigate the pharmacological specificity of toadfish pulsatile urea excretion by examining the effect of ketanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, on resting rates of pulsatile urea excretion. The full-length toadfish 5-HT2A receptor encodes a 496 amino acid sequence and shares 57\u201380% sequence identity to 5-HT2A receptors of other organisms, with 100% conservation among important ligand-binding residues. Toadfish 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression was highest in the swim bladder and gonad, followed by the whole brain. All other tissues tested (esophagus, stomach, anterior intestine, posterior intestine, rectum, liver, kidney, heart, muscle and gill) had mRNA expression levels that were significantly less than whole brain. Toadfish 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression within the brain was highest in the hindbrain, telencephalon and midbrain/diencephalon regions. Treatment with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, resulted in a significant decrease in the pulsatile component of spontaneous urea excretion due to a reduction in urea pulse size with no significant change in pulse frequency. These results lend further support for the 5-HT2A receptor in the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion in toadfish.",

We examined the effects of fasting (7\u00a0days) on metabolic strategies in goldfish and common carp at different swimming levels. Fasting had no significant effect on swimming performance (Ucrit) of either species. Feeding and swimming profoundly elevated total ammonia (Tamm) excretion in both species. In fed goldfish, this resulted in increased ammonia quotients (AQ), and additionally plasma and tissue ammonia levels increased with swimming reflecting the importance of protein contribution for aerobic metabolism. In carp, AQ did not change since oxygen consumption (MO2) and Tamm excretion followed the same trend. Plasma ammonia did not increase with swimming suggesting a balance between production and excretion rate except for fasted carp at Ucrit. While both species relied on anaerobic metabolism during exhaustive swimming, carp also showed increased lactate levels during routine swimming. Fasting almost completely depleted glycogen stores in carp, but not in goldfish. Both species used liver protein for basal metabolism during fasting and muscle lipid during swimming. In goldfish, feeding metabolism was sacrificed to support swimming metabolism with similar MO2 and Ucrit between fasted and fed fish, whereas in common carp feeding increased MO2 at Ucrit to sustain feeding and swimming independently.",

     "abstract": "We examine here the thermal physiology of the ash-grey mouse, as there is a paucity of data to explain how Australian rodents meet thermoregulatory demands. Most ash-grey mice remained normothermic over a range of ambient temperatures (10\u00a0\u00b0C to 30\u00a0\u00b0C), although they became hyperthermic at high ambient temperatures. One individual entered torpor at ambient temperatures of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, with minimal body temperatures of 24.5\u00a0\u00b0C and 28.4\u00a0\u00b0C respectively, before spontaneously arousing. This is the first evidence of torpor use by an Australian murine rodent. Our data suggest that although ash-grey mice have the physiological ability to use torpor, it is used rarely, presumably due to other behavioural and physiological adaptations. Their higher-than-expected basal metabolic rate (1.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25\u00a0mL\u00a0O2\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01\u00a0h\u2212\u00a01) indicates that ash-grey mice do not have a frugal approach to energy expenditure. Other standard physiological variables were typical of a generalised rodent. A readily-available omnivorous diet, nocturnal activity, semi-fossorial habit and social behaviour presumably allow a high energy lifestyle. A reluctance to use torpor, despite an apparent physiological ability to do so, supports the idea that the use of torpor reflects a net balance between the costs and benefits of a heterothermic thermoregulatory strategy.",

     "abstract": "Although off-channel habitats in the estuaries of large rivers impart many benefits to fish that rear within them, it is less clear how these habitats benefit migrating anadromous species that utilize these habitats for short periods of time. We evaluated the physiological correlates (nutritional condition, growth, and smoltification) of habitat utilization (main-channel vs. off-channel) by juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha during emigration. Fish from the off-channel had higher condition factor scores and relative weights than fish from the main-channel throughout the study period. Plasma triglyceride and protein concentrations were significantly different between habitat types and across the sampling period, suggesting that fish utilizing the off-channel habitats were compensating for energy losses associated with emigration as compared to main-channel fish. Growth potential (RNA to DNA ratio) did not vary by habitat or sampling period, presumably due to short residency time. There were no differences in osmoregulatory capacity (gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity) based on habitat type. Our results indicate that short-term off-channel habitat use may mitigate for energy declines incurred during migration, but likely does not impart significant gains in energy stores or growth.",

For our comparisons, we sourced juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from one hatchery and a second strain of rainbow trout from another. The hatcheries maintain genetic stocks obtained several decades ago from very different environments. We tested competing hypotheses: that there would be greater interspecific (across species) variation or that there would be greater intraspecific (within species) variation, owing to regional adaptations. To test these hypotheses, individual and small schools of five fish were taken to fatigue using the critical swimming speed test (Ucrit), and three post-exercise physiological metrics, packed red cell volume (hematocrit), citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activity, were assessed. The majority of the results in swimming performance and hematocrit support that intraspecific variation was greater than interspecific variation, i.e. the location had a stronger effect than did genus. Variation in lactate dehydrogenase activity supported neither intra- nor interspecific variation as determining factors. In sum, our findings suggest that the performance of different species of salmonids from the same locale can be more similar than those of the same species from different areas.",

Cryptochromes (CRY), blue light photoreceptors, belong to the negative elements of the transcriptional feedback loop into the molecular clock. This paper describes the cloning and characterization of two cryptochromes (cry1 and 2) in European seabass, which is considered an interesting chronobiology model due to its dual (diurnal/nocturnal) behavior. The cloned cDNA fragments encoded for two proteins of 567 and 668 amino acids, which included the FAD-binding and the DNA-photolyase domains. Moreover, both proteins had a high homology with cryptochrome proteins (Cry) of other teleost fish. These cry1 and 2 genes were expressed in several tissues of seabass (brain, liver, heart, retina, muscle, spleen, gill and intestine). In addition, the daily expression of cry1 was rhythmic in brain, heart and liver with the acrophase around ZT 03:15\u00a0h (after the onset of lights). Similarly, the cry2 daily expression was rhythmic in liver, peaking at ZT 03:28\u00a0h, whereas in brain the acrophase was at ZT 11:08\u00a0h (shortly prior to the offset of lights).

Dietary protein reduction increased LPO levels though no major alterations were found on antioxidant enzyme activities between dietary treatments. At 12\u00a0\u00b0C GR activity was higher and SOD activity was lower than 18\u00a0\u00b0C but LPO levels were not affected. In both thermal shock cases, LPO levels increased in 55P group, probably due to insufficient antioxidant enzyme activation. In contrast, fish of 45P group under acute exposition to warmer and colder temperature exhibited no substantial changes and a significant decrease on LPO levels, respectively, along with no major changes in antioxidant enzymes.

The primary aim of this study was to quantify the relationship between oxidative stress parameters (antioxidant capacity and levels of reactive oxygen metabolites) and circulating testosterone and cortisol in a common and widespread teleost fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta, L.). Results show that trout with higher testosterone levels prior to spawning have higher levels of oxidative damage at the time that they spawn (although by the time of spawning testosterone levels had dropped, leading to a negative relationship between testosterone and oxidative damage at that time). Cortisol levels were not directly related to oxidative damage or antioxidant capacity, but concentrations of this hormone were positively related to levels of fungal infection, which was itself associated both with lower antioxidant capacity and lower levels of oxidative damage. These results highlight the complexity of interactions between different components of the endocrine system and metabolism and suggest that caution be used in interpreting relationships between a single hormone and indicators of oxidative balance or other fitness proxies.",

The intra and extracellular build-up of osmolytes represent a common strategy to attenuate acute hyperosmotic stress in several arthropod species. In the present study, we aimed to determine the impact of substrate and trophic resource salinities on salt tolerance in the female wolf spider, Arctosa fulvolineata, which is considered a specialist salt marsh species. We evaluated adult female survival and egg laying, and quantified the osmo-induced accumulation of compatible solutes (GC\u2013MS). Three concentrations of substrate salinity were tested (0\u2030, 35\u2030 and 70\u2030) under three trophic conditions (starved spiders, spiders fed with salt prey [intertidal amphipods] and spiders fed with unsalted prey [freshwater amphipods]). We found no support for diet preferences in female A. fulvolineata, which exhibited similar predation rates on freshwater and marine amphipods. Survival and egg-laying were significantly impaired when female A. fulvolineata were exposed to hypersaline conditions for 12\u00a0days. Our results showed an increase in the level of several compatible solutes when spiders were exposed for 12\u00a0days to saline conditions. For instance, \u03b1-alanine, \u03b2-alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, homoserine, glutamine, glycine, proline and serine levels were 4\u201310 times higher under hypersaline conditions. The osmo-induced accumulation of amino acids may increase the osmolality of body fluids, thus enhancing the smooth regulation of body fluids and survival ability of wolf spider under extreme saline conditions.",

Plasma calcium and phosphate and parameters of bone metabolism were analysed. Gastrointestinal calcium transport was characterised in vitro in Ussing chambers. The expression of apical epithelial calcium channels, calbindin-D9K, and the basolateral plasma membrane Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In contrast to sheep, the goats were able to compensate for low dietary calcium supply by increasing active calcium absorption in the small intestine, especially in the jejunum. As in sheep, the observed ruminal calcium transport of goats was affected neither by the calcium restricted diet nor by the calcitriol treatment, thus indicating the presence of an alternative, vitamin D-independent mechanism of calcium transport in the forestomachs.

The expression of FATP1 increased with adipocyte and that of CD36 with myocyte in vitro differentiation suggesting a different role for each transporter during the two cell differentiation programs. Food deprivation (15, 25 and 35\u00a0days) increased FATP1 and CD36 mRNA expression in white muscle, red muscle and adipose tissue while insulin administration decreased the FATP1 expression in adipose tissue in vivo (21.6\u00a0pmol/g body mass) and in vitro (1\u00a0\u03bcM) in adipocytes. In trout myotubes insulin (1\u00a0\u03bcM) decreased FATP1 and increased CD36 mRNA expression. Thus, regulation of FA transporters expression by insulin is complex and directed to specific tissue needs. Although FATP1 and CD36 mRNA levels are controlled by insulin, it appears that FATP1 respond more clearly to situations of hyper and hypo-insulinemia in trout muscle and adipose tissue than CD36. FATP1 and CD36 transcription was also modulated by growth hormone in cultured myotubes and isolated adipocytes. Lipopolysaccharide administration (E. coli, serotype O26:B6, 6\u00a0\u03bcg/g body mass) decreased FATP1 mRNA expression in red muscle, adipose tissue and liver after 24\u00a0h according to changes in lipid metabolism during infection. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) (100\u00a0ng/ml) reduced FATP1 expression in isolated adipocytes. Further, insulin (1\u00a0\u03bcM) and IGF-I (100\u00a0nM) increased the FA uptake in rainbow trout myotubes through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overall, we demonstrated not only that feeding condition regulates FATP1 and CD36 mRNA expression in a tissue-specific manner, but also that insulin is an important regulator of these genes in vivo and in vitro and also it stimulates FA uptake in trout muscle cells.",

Herein the effect of development and season on glutathione (GSH) metabolism and the effect of development on the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed. The ratio GSSG:GSH-eq increased in lung, liver, kidney and brain by 1.8- to 4-fold in the embryo/hatchling to juvenile transition. No changes occurred in juvenile\u2013adult transition. GSSG:GSH-eq across seasons was significantly elevated in summer. Total-glutathione content was mostly stable in various organs; in liver it increased in the embryo\u2013juvenile transition.

The pattern of nitrogen excretion of the green iguana, Iguana iguana, was determined during embryonic development using samples from allantoic fluid and from the whole homogenized egg, and in hatchlings and adults using samples of blood plasma. Urea was the major excretory product over the course of embryonic development. It was found in higher concentrations in the allantoic sac, suggesting that there is a mechanism present on the allantoic membrane enabling the concentration of urea. The newly hatched iguana still produced urea while adults produced uric acid. The time course of this shift in the type of nitrogen waste was not determined but the change is likely to be related to the water relations associated with the terrestrial habit of the adult. The green iguana produces parchment-shelled eggs that double in mass during incubation due to water absorption; the eggs also accumulate 0.02\u00a0mM of urea, representing 82% of the total measured nitrogenous residues that accumulate inside the allantois.

     "abstract": "Using morphological and physiological approaches we provided, for the first time, a structural and functional characterization of Carassius auratus L. heart. Besides to the classical four chambers, i.e. sinus venosus, atrium, ventricle, bulbus, we described two distinct structures corresponding to the atrio-ventricular (AV) region and the conus arteriosus. The atrium is very large and highly trabeculated; the ventricle shows an outer compacta, vascularized by coronary vessels, and an inner spongiosa; the bulbus wall is characterized by a high elastin/collagen ratio, which makes it extremely compliant. Immunolocalization revealed a strong expression of activated \u201ceNOS-like\u201d isoforms both at coronary endothelium and, to a lesser extent, in the myocardiocytes and the endocardial endothelium (EE). The structural design of the heart appears to comply with its mechanical function. Using an in vitro working heart preparation, cardiac performance was evaluated at different filling and afterload pressures. The hearts were very sensitive to filling pressure increases. Maximum Stroke volume (SV\u00a0=\u00a01.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0mL/kg body mass) was obtained with an input pressure of 0.4\u00a0kPa. The heart was not able to sustain afterload increases, values higher than 1.5\u00a0kPa impairing its performance. These morpho-functional features are consistent with a volume pump mechanical performance.",

     "abstract": "In centrarchid fishes, such as bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Lacep\u00e8de), the contractile properties of feeding and swimming muscles show different scaling patterns. While the maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) and rate of relaxation from tetanus of swimming or myotomal muscle slow with growth, the feeding muscle shows distinctive scaling patterns. Cranial epaxial muscle, which is used to elevate the head during feeding strikes, retains fast contractile properties across a range of fish sizes in both species. In bass, the sternohyoideous muscle, which depresses the floor of the mouth during feeding strikes, shows faster contractile properties with growth. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular basis of these different scaling patterns. We examined the expression of two muscle proteins, myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and parvalbumin (PV), that affect contractile properties. We hypothesized that the relative contribution of slow and fast MyHC isoforms will modulate Vmax in these fishes, while the presence of PV in muscle will enhance rates of muscle relaxation. Myotomal muscle displays an increase in sMyHC expression with growth, in agreement with its physiological properties. Feeding muscles such as epaxial and sternohyoideus show no change or a decrease in sMyHC expression with growth, again as predicted from contractile properties. PV expression in myotomal muscle decreases with growth in both species, as has been seen in other fishes. The feeding muscles again show no change or an increase in PV expression with growth, contributing to faster contractile properties in these fishes. Both MyHC and PV appear to play important roles in modulating muscle contractile properties of swimming and feeding muscles in centrarchid fishes.",

     "abstract": "A number of species of euryhaline teleosts have the remarkable ability to adapt and survive in environments of extreme salinity, up to two or even three times the osmolality of seawater. This review looks at some of the literature describing the adaptive changes that occur, primarily with intestinal water absorption and with the properties of the gill epithelium. While there is much that is still not completely understood, recent work has begun to look at these adaptations at the cellular and molecular level. As with seawater osmoregulation, fish adapting to hypersaline conditions generally increase drinking rates and water absorption across the intestine by solute-linked transport. This process requires increased activity, expression levels and possibly changes in subunit isoforms of Na+/K+-ATPase pumps, along with increases in other components of the NaCl absorptive pathway. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of luminal anion exchange activity and of luminal alkalinization, which can support absorption against increasing osmotic gradients by promoting divalent ion precipitation (CaCO3) and by conversion of HCO3\u2212 ions to CO2. The steepness of the lumen to blood osmotic gradient vis-a-vis the NaCl absorptive capacity, along with the accumulation of non-absorbed Mg++ and SO4\u2212\u2212, likely become the limiting factors for survival in hypersaline conditions. Of interest is the observation of predicted hyperosmotic fluid absorption by the intestine in several species. Adaptive changes in the gill epithelium are also critical in this process, allowing for secretion of absorbed NaCl from the extracellular fluids. Most notably there are important changes in the numbers and size of mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells, the sites of active secretion of Cl\u2212, which ultimately drives the overall process of NaCl secretion. Balance studies of intake and output clearly indicate that a decrease in the osmotic permeability of the gill epithelium must also occur. The molecular correlates of this effect are not known, although decreased expression of one or more aquaporins seems to be a likely possibility. Finally, the regulatory changes seen with hypersaline adaptation may provide important new insights into epithelial function, including the role of organized transport assemblies (\u201cmetabolons\u201d) and changes in the expression of tight junction proteins such as claudins or occludins, which may modulate electrolyte permeabilities.",

     "abstract": "Feeding, fasting and re-feeding is a common experimental paradigm for studying growth endocrinology. Herein we demonstrate dynamic changes in the livers of coho salmon under these conditions and how changes in liver composition can influence quantification and interpretation of liver gene expression data. A three-week fast resulted in decreases in hepatosomatic index (liver size), liver glycogen content, and liver DNA concentration. In addition, significant differences were found in liver transcript levels from fed and fasted fish for the reference genes, arp and ef1a, when these were normalized to total RNA. We took the additional step of normalizing reference gene transcript levels to the liver homogenate RNA/DNA ratio to account for differences in RNA yield/cell and the number of cells sampled, normalizing to transcript number per cell rather than transcript number per unit RNA. After this additional step no significant differences in liver transcript levels of reference genes were found. The significance of these results was illustrated by normalizing liver transcript levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) to ef1a transcript levels or ef1a transcript levels by RNA/DNA. The different normalization strategies resulted in differing patterns of change in igf1 transcript levels between fed and fasted fish. The novelty of this work rests in a two-step normalization process, attempting to account for both 1) technical errors in reverse transcription and qPCR reactions, and 2) biological variance in liver samples.",

P. clarkii from normoxic and hypoxic natural habitats did not display significantly different hemolymph lactate or glucose concentrations; however, mean hemolymph protein concentration was significantly lower in crayfish from hypoxic areas. P. clarkii exposed to severe hypoxia in laboratory experiments had significantly higher hemolymph lactate and glucose concentrations for all three exposure times, whereas large differences in protein concentrations were not observed. These results suggest that elevated hemolymph lactate and glucose concentrations are responses to acute hypoxia in P. clarkii, while differences in protein concentrations are the result of chronic hypoxic exposure.",

     "abstract": "When stressed, toadfish become ureotelic and excrete almost all of their nitrogenous waste in 1\u20133 daily pulses of urea-N across the gills. Intravascular injections of 5-hydroxytyptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and analogues also elicit marked excretory pulses of urea-N from toadfish in vivo, suggesting that 5-HT release is the proximate trigger for spontaneous pulses. However it is unclear whether 5-HT is acting on the gills directly or elsewhere to cause the effect indirectly. A perfused whole gill preparation which maintained normal pressure relationships and stable vascular resistance was employed to address this question. Bolus injections into the ventral aortic perfusate of either 5-HT (1, 10\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) or the specific 5-HT2 receptor agonist \u03b1-methyl 5-HT (1, 10\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) elicited rapid urea-N pulses from perfused toadfish gills. The effective doses, the post-injection delays (5.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0min, range\u00a0=\u00a02\u201322), the percent occurrences (57\u201385%), and the magnitude of the induced urea-N pulses (615.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0131.3\u00a0\u03bcmol-N\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01, range 66.0\u20132634.0), were all similar to those previously reported when these agents were injected in vivo. Bolus injections of 5-HT and \u03b1-methyl 5-HT also elicited a biphasic response in ventral aortic pressure, reflecting an initial rapid short-lived vasodilation and a subsequent longer-lasting vasoconstriction. These events were similar to those which have been recorded to occur at a greater frequency during spontaneous urea-N pulsing in vivo. Neither the urea-N pulsing nor the cardiovascular responses to 5-HT were inhibited by the 5-HT2A receptor subtype blocker, ketanserin (pre-injection with 10\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 plus 33\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 in the perfusate). Overall, these results provide strong support for the idea that the proximate stimulus for natural urea pulsing in vivo is 5-HT mobilization, acting directly in the gills.",

Using two groups of four ostriches (mean body mass 75.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.3\u00a0kg) kept on fresh alfalfa, we tested the effect of two intake levels (17 and 42\u00a0g dry matter kg\u2212\u00a00.75\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01) on the mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and three different-sized (2, 10, 20\u00a0mm) particle markers, mean faecal particle size (MPS), and digestibility. Intake level did not affect MRT, but MPS (0.74 vs. 1.52\u00a0mm) and dry matter digestibility (81 vs. 78%). The solute marker (MRT 22\u201326\u00a0h) was excreted faster than the particle markers; there was no difference in the MRT of 10 and 20\u00a0mm particles (MRT 28\u201332\u00a0h), but 2\u00a0mm particles were retained longer (MRT 39\u201340\u00a0h). Because the solute marker was not selectively retained, and wet\u2010sieving of gut contents of slaughtered animals did not indicate smaller particles in the caeca, the long MRT of small particles is interpreted as intermittent excretion from the gizzard, potentially due to entrapment in small grit. The marker excretion pattern also showed intermittent peaks for all markers in five of the animals, which indicates non-continuous outflow from the gizzard. When adding our data to literature data on avian herbivores, a dichotomy is evident, with ostrich and hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) displaying long MRTs, high digestibilities, and gut capacities similar to mammalian herbivores, and other avian herbivores such as grouse, geese or emus with shorter MRTs, lower fibre digestibilities and lower gut capacities. In the available data for all avian herbivores where food intake and MRTs were measured, this dichotomy and food intake level, but not body mass, was related to MRT, adding to the evidence that body mass itself may not be sole major determinant of digestive physiology. The most striking difference between mammalian and avian herbivores from the literature is the fundamentally lower methane production measured in the very few studies in birds including ostriches, which appears to be at the level of reptiles, in spite of general food intake levels of a magnitude as in mammals. Further studies in ostriches and other avian herbivores are required to understand the differences in digestive mechanisms between avian and mammalian herbivores.",

     "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to examine cardiac responses to some of the temperature challenges that eels encounter in their natural environment. The contractile properties of ventricular muscle was studied on electrically paced tissue strips after long term acclimation at 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 10\u00a0\u00b0C, or 20\u00a0\u00b0C, and following acute \u00b1\u00a010\u00a0\u00b0C temperature changes. The time-course of contraction, and thus maximal attainable heart rates, was greatly influenced by working temperature, but was independent of acclimation history. The absolute force of contraction and power production (i.e. the product of force and stimulation frequency) was significantly influenced by acute temperature decrease from 20\u00a0\u00b0C to 10\u00a0\u00b0C. The role of adrenaline as a modulator of contraction force, power production, rates of contraction and relaxation, and minimum time in contraction was assessed. Increased adrenergic tonus elicited a positive inotropic, temperature-dependent response, but did not influence twitch duration. This suggests that adrenaline acts as an agent in maintaining an adequate contractile force following temperature challenges. A significant increased relative ventricular mass was observed in 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 10\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated eels compared to 20\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated, which suggests that at low temperatures, eels secure cardiac output by heart enlargement. Inhibition of specific sarcolemmal Ca2\u00a0+ channels by selective drug treatment revealed that, depending on temperature, L-type channels is the major entry site, but also that reverse-mode Na+/Ca2\u00a0+-exchange and store operated calcium entry contribute to the pool of activator Ca2\u00a0+.",

We measured energy use until metamorphosis in two related frogs, Crinia georgiana and Pseudophryne bibronii. Mass and energy content of fresh ova were comparable between the species. However, development to metamorphosis was 1.7 times faster in C. georgiana while P. bibronii produced nine times the dry biomass at metamorphosis and had lower mass-specific oxygen requirements. DEB theory explained these patterns through differences in ontogenetic energy allocation to maturation. P. bibronii partitioned energy in the same (constant) way throughout development whereas C. georgiana increased the fraction of energy allocated to maturation over growth between hatching and the onset of feeding. DEB parameter estimation for additional, direct-developing taxa suggests that a change in energy allocation during development may result from a selective pressure to increase development rate, and not as a result of development mode.",

The gastrointestinal tract is the organ system displaying the most rapid and dramatic changes in response to nutrient deprivation. To date, little is known about starvation phases and effects on the organ morphology and digestive function in small passerine birds. In this study, we determined the phases of starvation and examined the effect of final stage of starvation in the organ morphology and, intestinal histology and enzymatic function in the small intestine. Our results show the three phases of the classical model of fasting in a shorter period of time. The mass of heart, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and liver of long-term fasted birds was reduced between 20 and 47%. The mass decrease in small intestine was correlated with reduction in small intestinal histology: perimeter, mucosal thickness, villus height and width. In contrast, the enzyme activity of sucrase\u2013isomaltase and aminopeptidase-N in enterocytes, all expressed per \u03bcg of protein, was higher in long-term fasted birds than fed animals. This suggest that, while autophagy of digestive organs is induced by starvation, consistent with phenotypic plasticity, the activity of sucrase\u2013isomaltase and aminopeptidase-N remains high, probably as an anticipatory strategy to optimize digestion at re-feeding time.",

The experimental groups included: control (capsules containing cocoa butter alone), low cortisol (C5; 5\u00a0mg cortisol/kg body mass\u00a0+\u00a0cocoa butter) and, high cortisol (C50; 50\u00a0mg cortisol/kg body mass\u00a0+\u00a0cocoa butter). The capsules containing hormones and cocoa butter were intraperitoneally implanted into 3-year-old female fish at pre-vitellogenic stage (mean initial body mass 6809.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a073\u00a0g) every 6\u00a0weeks over a 6-month period from January to June. The serum levels of cortisol, glucose, cholesterol and sex steroids (testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol) were determined at the initial time and three weeks after each implantation. Oocyte histological characteristics (the diameter and area of the oocyte, the diameter and area of the nucleus and the ratio of the nucleus area to the oocyte area) were measured at the end of the experiment and compared to those at the initial time. Ovarian cortisol content was measured at the end of the experiment. The results showed that serum cortisol levels varied in a dose-independent manner, so that the highest cortisol concentrations were observed in C5-treated fish throughout the experiment. Serum glucose levels were significantly higher in cortisol-treated groups than those in the control group. The high dose of cortisol elicited a significant constant increase in serum cholesterol concentrations. Fish implanted with the high cortisol dose showed significant declines in serum testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol concentrations throughout the experiment. No significant differences were found in oocyte histological characteristics among experimental groups. The cortisol implants elicited a dose-dependent increase in ovarian cortisol content. At the end of trial, body-growth indices were the lowest in C50-implanted fish, while the low cortisol dose had no effect on growth relative to the controls. These results indicated that chronic stress induced by cortisol implantation in great sturgeon suppressed gonadal steroidogenesis and somatic growth but had no effect on ovarian growth and development.",

Lipolysis was measured after incubation with one of the LXR agonists and LXR expression was compared with levels of lipolysis. LXR expression was also analyzed during the differentiation of adipocytes in culture. The incubations with agonists in isolated adipocytes indicated that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is an LXR target gene, but lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARs) are not. LXR agonists also induced LXR expression and raised lipolysis levels. Besides, LXR expression was upregulated in parallel with basal lipolysis. LXR mRNA expression was regulated by unsaturated fatty acids, insulin, TNF\u03b1 and GH in isolated adipocytes. Besides, LXR showed an upregulation during adipocyte differentiation. All these data indicate that LXR is involved in orchestrating the transcriptional regulatory network in trout adipocyte lipid metabolism, specifically, in cholesterol transport, adipocyte differentiation and lipolysis.",

The profiles were determined for fish at different nutritional states (i.e. fed or unfed on sampling day) and held at different photoperiods (i.e. 16L:8D photoperiod vs. constant light LL). Our results show that under a 16L:8D photoperiod, both fed and unfed goldfish exhibit clear antiphasic daily rhythms of hypothalamic Clock2 and Per1 mRNA expression levels, whereas under LL, daily Clock2 rhythms are seen in both fed and unfed fish while significant rhythms of Per1 mRNA expression only persist in unfed fish. In fish held under 16L:8D, but not under LL, there was significantly higher Per1 expression in fed fish at feeding time than in unfed fish. Daily variations in hypothalamic OX mRNA expression levels with peaks observed prior to both feeding time and the onset of darkness, were displayed under a 16L:8D photoperiod, whereas exposure to LL resulted in lower expression levels with no significant daily variations. Fish held under LL, but not under 16L:8D, showed significant daily variations in NPY mRNA expression with a peak prior to feeding time. Taken together, our results suggest that the mRNA expression of both appetite-regulating and circadian proteins display daily variations and that these patterns can be affected by external cues such as feeding and photoperiod.",

We then examined the effects of acute exposure (1\u00a0h) to hypoxia (H) and hypercapnic hypoxia (HH) on relative transcript abundance for hif-\u03b1 and arnt/hif-\u03b2 in different tissues (glycolytic muscle, oxidative muscle, hepatopancreas, gill, and gonads) using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Our results indicate that hif-\u03b1 and arnt/hif-\u03b2 mRNAs were constitutively present under well-aerated normoxia (N) conditions in all tissues examined. Further, H and HH exposure resulted in both tissue-specific and muscle fiber type-specific effects on relative hif-\u03b1 transcript abundance. In the gill and glycolytic muscle, relative hif-\u03b1 mRNA levels were significantly lower under H and HH, compared to N, while no change (or a slight increase) was detected in oxidative muscle, hepatopancreas and gonadal tissues. H and HH did not affect relative transcript abundance for arnt/hif-\u03b2 in any tissue or muscle fiber type.

Variation in SMR stems not only from diverse intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but also from the use of diverse methods for metabolic measurements.

Both respirometry modes yielded similar and repeatable V \u02d9 C O 2 values. Although V \u02d9 O 2 was highly repeatable, continuous respirometry produced lower V \u02d9 O 2 than the intermittent method. During intermittent measurements, the total number of activity bouts was higher than during continuous respirometry trials. Statistical correction for disparate activity levels minimized variation in oxygen consumption between respirometry modes. We conclude that use of either method of flow-through respirometry, if properly applied, introduced less noise to SMR estimates than a variation in activity levels.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate SGLT1 mediated glucose absorption in the jejunum and ileum of growing pigs (Sus scrofa) in more detail. In Ussing chambers, basal short-circuit currents were significantly more positive in the jejunum. It could be demonstrated that the electrogenic ileal glucose transport was significantly more pronounced in different breeds and occurred at 5\u00a0mmol\u2219L\u2212\u00a01 glucose 7 times faster in the ileum, although slightly higher jejunal expression of glycosylated SGLT1 was detected by Western blotting. This expression pattern was connected to significantly lower phlorizin sensitivity in the jejunum. As the more efficient ileal glucose absorption was also observable with glucose uptake studies into isolated brush-border membrane vesicles without differences in abundance and activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase in both segments, we conclude that the segmental differences in porcine glucose transport characteristics may be based on direct or indirect modulations of SGLT1 activity.",

Despite the apparent critical role of calcium in regulating ecdysteroidogenesis, the level of Ca++ in Y-organ cells has not been previously measured during a natural molting cycle for any crustacean species. In studies reported here, a fluorescent calcium indicator (Fluo-4) was used to measure Ca++ levels in Y-organs during a molting cycle of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Mean calcium fluorescence increased 5.8-fold between intermolt (C4) and stage D3 of premolt, and then dropped abruptly, reaching a level in postmolt (A) that was not significantly different from that in intermolt (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The level of ecdysteroids in hemolymph of Y-organ donor crabs (measured by radioimmunoassay) showed an overall pattern similar to that observed for calcium fluorescence, rising from 2.9\u00a0ng/mL in intermolt to 357.1\u00a0ng/mL in D3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and then dropping to 55.3\u00a0ng/mL in D4 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

NES platelets undergo cold-induced activation when chilled to 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and 3 distinct phase transitions can be measured using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. NES platelet membrane lipid composition was determined using thin layer chromatography and NES platelets were found to have three times the amount of cholesterol (21% by weight) as human platelets. When exposed to high pressure-rapid decompression excursion, NES platelets did not undergo morphological shape change nor bind increased amounts of fibrinogen, while human platelets were significantly activated by the same excursion. These results demonstrate that while NES platelets are activated by the physical stimulus of cold temperatures, they are resistant to decompression-induced activation.

Results from the current study showed that avoidance was associated with numerous physiological perturbations, including a significant endocrine response, haematological changes, osmoregulatory disturbance and metabolic adjustments in the heart, liver and muscle. Snapper clearly experienced physiological stress at the point of avoidance but they were not however in a state of physiological exhaustion since some fuel reserves were still available. In addition to avoidance, snapper also showed a subtle reduction in swimming speed \u2014 this energy-saving response may have helped snapper minimise the physiological challenge of low O2 residence. It is therefore concluded that snapper can reside in water below their Pcrit threshold for brief periods of time and, without any evidence of physiological exhaustion at the point of avoidance, fish should recover quickly once normoxia is selected. Lastly, with signs of anaerobic metabolism in cardiac tissue at the point of avoidance, we tentatively suggest that snapper may leave hypoxia to protect heart function.",

However, studies on these interactions, especially during larval development, are scarce. Recently, cDNAs coding for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP), two key players in the regulation of the neuroendocrine stress response, were characterized for the flatfish Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). To investigate the involvement of stress and thyroid systems in this species, the effects of food deprivation during early development of S. senegalensis were assessed. Growth was arrested in food-deprived post-larvae, which was also reflected by decreased carbon and nitrogen contents, indicating increased catabolism. Food deprivation induces chronic stress, as illustrated by enhanced whole-body cortisol levels, as well as an up regulation of crh and a decrease of crh-bp expression levels. Furthermore, whole-body total T3 concentrations of food-deprived post-larvae were reduced, although tsh\u03b2 subunit expression levels remained unaffected. Our results show that food deprivation is a chronic stressor that induces energy-releasing catabolic processes that compensate for the reduced energy intake, and inhibits anabolic processes via the peripheral thyroid system.",

Processes studied included heat shock protein expression and protein kinase activation. The cellular stress response was addressed through the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinases and particularly p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3). Due to a general metabolic depression during winter hibernation, the induction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNKs and ERKs are retained at low levels of expression in the examined tissues of P. ridibundus. Recovery from hibernation induces increased levels of the specific proteins, probably providing stamina to the animals during their arousal.",

     "abstract": "The present study examined the effects of feeding pike perch larvae Artemia, enriched with either docosahexanoic acid (DHA), arachidonic acid (ARA), oleic acid (OA), olive oil (OO) or a commercial enrichment DHA Selco (DS) on tissue lipid deposition, stress tolerance, growth and development, and metabolic rate. There was higher tissue retention of ARA than DHA at comparable inclusion levels. No differences were observed between diets on the percentage contribution of ARA or DHA to the fatty acid profile of tissues (head and trunk). Total fatty acid content (mg\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01) was significantly higher in the head, reflecting its high content of neural tissue. Observations on larval erratic behaviour and mortality following exposure to salinity stress suggested that high inclusions levels of DHA had an alleviating effect, while ARA did not. Particularly larval groups reared for 16\u00a0days on diets enriched with OO and OA had mortality rates approaching 100% within two hours. Interestingly, this tendency, although not as pronounced, was also apparent in juvenile fish after 120\u00a0days of rearing on a common diet. Standard metabolic rate in larvae on an OO enriched diet was significantly elevated, but otherwise no groups had significant changes to their respiratory physiology. In addition to increased stress challenge sensitivity, early feeding with OA had long term impact on pike perch neural development indicated by a smaller brain size in juvenile fish. In conclusion, lack of DHA in the diet of pikeperch larvae suggests that this long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid is involved in processes that increase stress tolerance and that lack of dietary DHA in early larval stage caused increased stress sensitivity and long-term impaired neural development, while it does not appear to affect metabolic rate at rest.",

SD-acclimation increased testosterone levels, VP treatment decreased expression of aldosterone mRNA receptor in the testes of SD-acclimated males. FR under SD-conditions resulted in testosterone decrease and elevation of VP- receptor gene expression in testes. Aldosterone receptor mRNA expression was also detected in WAT. These results support the idea that water and food availability in the habitat may be used as signals for activating the reproductive system through direct effects of VP, aldosterone and leptin on the testes or through WAT by indirect effects.",

To our knowledge, this paper reports the longest elevated hydrostatic pressure exposures ever performed on a shallow-water marine organism. Behavioural analysis showed a 100% survival rate of P. varians after 7\u00a0days at 10\u00a0MPa and 5 or 10\u00a0\u00b0C, whilst cannibalism was observed at elevated temperature (27\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting no impairment of specific dynamic action. A significant interaction of pressure and temperature was observed for both behavioural and molecular responses. Elevated pressure was found to exacerbate the effect of temperature on the behaviour of the animals by reducing activity at low temperature and by increasing activity at high temperature. In contrast, only high pressure combined with low temperature increased the expression of hsp70 genes. We suggest that the impressive tolerance of P. varians to sustained elevated pressure may reflect the physiological capability of an ancestral species to colonise the deep sea. Our results also support the hypothesis that deep-sea colonisation may have occurred during geological periods of time when the oceanic water column was warm and vertically homogenous.",

However, our current understanding of its function in fish and how it integrates with other hormones is incomplete due to the high diversity of this group of animals and a still limited amount of available data. This study examined the temporal and spatial changes in expression of kisspeptin, gonadotropins and their respective receptors in the Senegalese sole during a full reproductive cycle. Kiss2 and kiss2r expression was determined by qRT-PCR in the forebrain and midbrain while expression of fsh\u03b2 and lh\u03b2 was determined in the pituitary and fshr and lhr in the gonads. Plasma levels of testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and estradiol-17\u03b2 were measured by ELISA and gonadal maturation was assessed histologically. In males, kiss2 and kiss2r expression in the brain areas examined was highest towards the end of winter, just before the spawning season, which took place the following spring. This coincided with maximum levels of pituitary fsh\u03b2 and lh\u03b2, plasma T and 11-KT and the highest number of maturing fish. However, these associations were not evident in females, since the highest expression of kiss2, kiss2r and gonadotropins were observed in the fall, winter or spring, depending upon the variable and tissue considered. Taken together, these data show not only temporal and spatial, but also sex-specific differences in the expression of kisspeptin and its receptor. Thus, while expression of kiss2 in Senegalese sole males agrees with what one would expect according to its proposed role as a major regulator of the onset of reproduction, in females the situation was not so clear, since kiss2 and kiss2r expression was highest either before or during the spawning season.",

     "abstract": "Scorpions successfully inhabit some of the most arid habitats on earth. During exposure to desiccating stress water is mobilized from the scorpion hepatopancreas to replenish the hemolymph and retain hydration and osmotic stability. Carbohydrate catabolism is advantageous under these conditions as it results in high metabolic water production rate, as well as the release of glycogen-bound water. Hypothesizing that metabolic fuel utilization in scorpions is regulated in order to boost body water management under stressful conditions we used a comparative approach, studying energy metabolism during prolonged desiccation in four species varying in resistance performance. We used respirometry for calculating respiratory gas exchange ratios, indicative of metabolic fuel utilization, and measured metabolic fuel contents in the scorpion hepatopancreas. We found that hydrated scorpions used a mixture of metabolic fuels (respiratory exchange rates, RER\u00a0~\u00a00.9), but a shift towards carbohydrate catabolism was common during prolonged desiccation stress. Furthermore, the timing of metabolic shift to exclusive carbohydrate oxidation (RER not different from 1.0) was correlated with desiccation resistance of the respective studied species, suggesting triggering by alterations to hemolymph homeostasis.",

In this study, five tight junction proteins were examined in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): tight junction associated tricellulin, occludin and claudin-3 isoforms (a, b, c). A survey of tissue distribution in freshwater (FW) salmon showed that tricellulin expression was highest in the intestine. Occludin was detected in tissues with importance for epithelial transport and the order of expression was gill\u00a0>\u00a0intestine\u00a0>\u00a0kidney. The three claudin-3 isoforms were expressed at highest level in kidney tissue. Transfer of juvenile FW salmon to seawater (SW) elevated intestinal tricellulin and occludin mRNA, and these transcripts were also elevated at the time of best SW-tolerance during the course of smoltification. In the kidney, expression of tricellulin and claudin-3 isoforms was elevated after SW-transfer and tricellulin, occludin, claudin-3a and -3b increased in March before the peak smolt stage. In the gill, none of the examined tight junction proteins were impacted by SW-transfer. The data suggest that expression of tricellulin and occludin is dynamically involved in reorganization of intestinal epithelium and possibly changed paracellular permeability during SW-acclimation. The increased renal tricellulin and claudin-3 expression in SW suggests a role in remodeling of the kidney during SW-acclimation.",

     "abstract": "The functional link between food as an energy source and metabolizable energy is the digestive tract. The digestive organs may change in size, structure, or retention time in response to energetic demands of the animal. Very efficient digestive tracts may be better at processing food but require higher energetic investments for maintenance even when post-absorptive. These costs influence the resting metabolic rate (RMR) that is defined as the energy necessary to fuel vital metabolic functions in a resting animal. In bats a trade-off between the necessity for a highly efficient digestive tract and moderate energetic maintenance costs may be particularly important. We hypothesized that low RMR coincides with low digestive efficiency (defined as apparent metabolizable energy coefficient (MEC)) and that phases of increased energetic demand are compensated for by increased digestive efficiency. We measured RMR and apparent MEC in the bats species Myotis nattereri, M. bechsteinii, and Plecotus auritus. In support of our hypothesis, M. nattereri has the lowest mass-specific RMR of the three species and the lowest apparent MEC. However, apparent MEC did not change during phases with differing energetic demands in any of the bat species, probably because bats operate at the limit of their sustainable energy demand.",

Intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption was measured as well as the gene and protein expressions of molecules involved in the Ca2\u00a0+ transcellular pathway. NaDOC inhibited the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption, which was concentration dependent. Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase mRNA decreased by the bile salt and the same occurred with the protein expression of Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase, calbindin D28\u00a0k and Na+/Ca2\u00a0+ exchanger. NaDOC produced oxidative stress as judged by ROS generation, mitochondrial swelling and glutathione depletion. Furthermore, the antioxidant quercetin blocked the inhibitory effect of NaDOC on the intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption. Apoptosis was also triggered by the bile salt, as indicated by the TUNEL staining and the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. As a compensatory mechanism, enzyme activities of the antioxidant system were all increased. In conclusion, a single high concentration of NaDOC inhibits intestinal Ca2\u00a0+ absorption through downregulation of proteins involved in the transcellular pathway, as a consequence of oxidative stress and mitochondria mediated apoptosis.",

Maintenance of organismal performance occurs by alterations in metabolic fluxes and pathways, resulting in habitat-specific metabolic signatures. Several insects of sub-Antarctic Islands, including the wingless flies Anatalanta aptera and Calycopteryx moseleyi, are exposed to saline organic matter accumulated along littoral margins. However, C. moseleyi has long been considered restricted to a habitat of lower salinity, the Kerguelen cabbage. High C. moseleyi densities identified in saline decaying seaweeds are intriguing, and may involve osmoregulatory adjustments including accumulation of osmoprotectants. In the present work, we examined quantitative metabotypes (metabolic phenotypes) among wild C. moseleyi individuals from seaweeds versus non-saline Kerguelen cabbages. They were compared to metabotypes from wild A. aptera, a common fly on seaweed. Statistical procedures designed to magnify between-class differences failed to clearly separate C. moseleyi metabotypes from cabbage and seaweed, despite contrasted morphotypes, diets, and salinities. A. aptera exhibited higher glycerol, inositol, trehalose, and other osmoprotectants concentrations that may enhance its performance under saline environments. Seaweed may represent a secondary niche in C. moseleyi, promoted by the marked reduction in Kerguelen cabbage frequency subsequent to climate change, and herbivorous pressures caused by rabbit invasion.",

During summer, blood oxygen stores were significantly greater and muscle oxygen stores were significantly lower than in winter. Total oxygen stores, body condition and body temperature did not change between seasons but variations in body temperature were greater during summer.

In this study, we used a single cohort of the short-lived catarina scallop Argopecten ventricosus, to investigate the effects of somatic growth, reproduction and aging on oxidative damage parameters (protein carbonyls, TBARS and lipofuscin) and cellular maintenance mechanisms (antioxidant activity and apoptosis) in scallops, caged in their natural environment. The concentrations of protein carbonyls and TBARS increased steeply during the early period of fast growth and during reproduction in one-year-old scallops. However, oxidative damage was transient, and apoptotic cell death played a pivotal role in eliminating damage in gill, mantle and muscle tissues of young scallops. Animals were able to reproduce again in the second year, but the reduced intensity of apoptosis impaired subsequent removal of damaged cells. In late survivors low antioxidant capacity and apoptotic activity together with a fast accumulation of the age pigment lipofuscin was observed. Rates of oxygen consumption and oxidative stress markers were strongly dependent on somatic growth and reproductive state but not on temperature. Compared to longer-lived bivalves, A. ventricosus seems more susceptible to oxidative stress with higher tissue-specific protein carbonyl levels and fast accumulation of lipofuscin in animals surviving the second spawning. Superoxide dismutase activity and apoptotic cell death intensity were however higher in this short-lived scallop than in longer-lived bivalves. The life strategy of this short-lived and intensely predated scallop supports rapid somatic growth and fitness as well as early maturation at young age at the cost of fast cellular degradation in second year scallops.",

Globally sugar preferences, concentration preference and digestive ability of avian nectarivores have been extensively researched. In contrast, relatively little is known about mammalian nectarivores or frugivores in terms of these, particularly Old World species. Consequently effect of sugar type and concentration on food preference in Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bat Epomophorus wahlbergi was investigated. Pair-wise choice tests were conducted using equicaloric hexose and sucrose solutions at five different concentrations (5%\u201325%). It was expected that they would prefer hexose sugars as these are dominant in available indigenous fruits. However, bats preferred hexoses only when offered dilute (5%) concentrations. From 10% to 25% they showed a decrease in volume intake. Their body mass was generally higher and similar after feeding during the night with the exception of 5% concentration where the mean body mass decreased. When E. wahlbergi were offered a range of sucrose or hexose solutions (10%\u201325%) respectively, they showed no concentration preference in terms of total volume consumed, nor energy intake. These findings suggest that these fruit bats do not appear to act as a selective pressure on sugar composition in Old World fruit. In fruit bats with high energy requirements, dietary flexibility may be an advantage when faced with seasonal and unpredictable fruit availability.",

Further, serum leptin levels were negatively correlated with body mass. Together, these data supported our hypothesis that ambient temperature was a cue to induce changes in body mass and metabolic capacity. Serum leptin, as a starvation signal in the cold and satiety signal in rewarming, was involved in the processes of thermogenesis and body mass regulation in tree shrews.",

Although we have shown that the increase in gill SGK1 does not require activation of the glucocorticoid receptor, the mechanisms that mediate the rise SGK1 during acute acclimation is unknown. To test the hypothesis that mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK14) is responsible for the rise in SGK1 we identified the coding sequence of killifish MAPK14-1 and designed a translational blocking vivo-morpholino targeting MAPK14-1. Injection of the MAPK14-1 vivo-morpholino resulted in a 30% reduction of MAPK14-1 and a 45% reduction in phosphorylated-MAPK14-1 protein in the gill of killifish transitioned from freshwater to seawater. Knock down of phosphorlyated-MAPK14-1 completely blocked the rise in SGK1 mRNA and protein in the killifish gill, providing the first direct and in vivo evidence that MAPK14-1 is necessary for acute seawater acclimation.",

In the present study we investigate transcriptomic changes in Daphnia magna in response to different algal food organisms substantially differing in their PUFA composition using quantitative real-time PCR and relate them to concomitantly documented life history data. The selection of target genes includes representatives that have previously been shown to be responsive to the eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitor ibuprofen. The beneficial effect of C20 PUFA-rich food on reproduction and population growth rates was accompanied by an increased vitellogenin (DmagVtg1) gene expression in D. magna. Additionally, genes involved in eicosanoid signaling were particularly influenced by dietary C20 PUFA availability.

     "abstract": "Within mammalian species, standard metabolic rate (SMR) increases disproportionately with body mass (Mb), such that the mass-specific SMR correlates negatively with Mb. This phenomenon can be explained in part by reduced cellular metabolic rates in larger species. To better understand the cause(s) of this cellular metabolic rate allometry we have used an ex vivo approach to isolate and identify potential contributors. Skeletal myoblasts from mammalian species ranging in Mb from 30\u00a0g to over 300,000\u00a0g were isolated and differentiated into myotubes in vitro. Oxygen consumption rates, citrate synthase (CS) activity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity were measured in myotubes under standardized conditions. No correlation of any of these parameters was observed with species Mb, suggesting that there is no genetic contribution to between-species differences in cellular metabolic rates. Myotubes were incubated in serum from species ranging from 30\u00a0g to 400,000\u00a0g to determine whether between-species differences in the levels of metabolically important hormones might produce allometric trends in the cultured cells. However, there was no observed effect of serum donor Mb on any of the metabolic characteristics measured. Thus, there is no evidence for a relationship between skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism and Mb in an ex vivo model.",

RT-PCR results showed that Grvas is expressed specifically in the gonads of male and female, it is maternally deposited into the eggs for embryos and is continuously expressed in the embryos from the zygote to larvae and adult. Grvas mRNA and/or protein is restricted to the germ cells of ovary and testis. Temporal expression of Grvas mRNA is similar to that of zebrafish vasa during embryogenesis.

In this study, we measured urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations and Bd infections within free-living populations of male Stony Creek frog (Litoria wilcoxii) in Queensland, Australia.

A urinary corticosterone enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) was validated using adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Urinary corticosterone concentrations of male frogs increased within 1\u20132\u00a0days after ACTH challenge and returned to baseline levels within 3\u00a0days post-ACTH injection. None of the frogs showed any rise in urinary corticosterone after saline injections. Individual male frogs showed either low or high baseline corticosterone concentrations. Male frogs identified as positive for Bd infection had significantly higher baseline urinary corticosterone concentrations in comparison to Bd negative male frogs. Urinary corticosterone EIA provides a reliable indication of stress in this frog species and this non-invasive physiological tool can be used to further assess the dynamics of Bd infections and physiological stress responses in other native amphibians.",

Owing to the tight coupling between Na+ and Cl\u2212 uptake and, respectively, H+ and HCO3\u2212 loss at the gill, ionoregulatory changes associated with social status may affect acid\u2013base regulation. The present study assessed the responses of dominant, subordinate and control trout to hypercapnia (1% CO2) to test this hypothesis. Social status appeared to impact net acid excretion (JnetH+) as subordinate individuals failed to increase net acid flux in response to hypercapnia. However, blood acid\u2013base status was found to be unaffected by social status before or during hypercapnic exposure, indicating that subordinate fish were as effective as dominant or control trout in achieving compensation for the acid\u2013base disturbance induced by hypercapnic exposure. Compensation in all groups involved decreasing Cl\u2212 uptake in response to hypercapnia. The branchial activities of both Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase were affected by social interactions and/or exposure to hypercapnia. Branchial NKA activity was higher but V-ATPase activity was lower in control fish than in dominant or subordinate trout. In addition, control and subordinate but not dominant trout exposed to 24\u00a0h of hypercapnia exhibited significantly higher branchial V-ATPase activity than fish maintained in normocapnia. Collectively, the data suggest that subordinate trout are able to regulate blood pH during a respiratory acidosis.",

In the present study, goldfish were subjected to a 2-week 5 or 25\u00a0\u00b0C acclimation in order to modulate the degree of ILCM gill coverage and determine potential effects on Jamm. 25\u00a0\u00b0C-fish displayed gill coverage which was significantly lower than the 5\u00a0\u00b0C-fish, though the ILCM was not completely absent in these fish. 5\u00a0\u00b0C-fish demonstrated Jamm values approximately 60% lower than those of 25\u00a0\u00b0C-fish. The magnitude of anterior (branchial) Jamm strongly correlated with gill coverage (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.83), suggesting that the ILCM may impede branchial Jamm. Divided chamber experiments demonstrated that relative to the 25\u00a0\u00b0C-fish, 5\u00a0\u00b0C-fish relied more upon posterior routes of excretion. In response to high external ammonia (HEA; 1.5\u00a0mM NH4HCO3) exposures, 25\u00a0\u00b0C-fish displayed ammonia uptake while 5\u00a0\u00b0C-fish maintained excretion against HEA, suggesting that the ILCM may act as a barrier preventing ammonia uptake. In summary, the ILCM appears to impede branchial Jamm, such that 5\u00a0\u00b0C-rely more on extra-branchial routes of excretion.

This is the first observation that LEA proteins may play a role in thermostability and the first report of a VTG-like protein in the phylum Rotifera.

The GI tract and associated organs are also very metabolically active in animals. Hence, animals may reduce the size and function of their GI tract to conserve energy when deprived of food. The main aims of this study were to investigate how Silurus meridionalis regulates the function and structure of its GI tract and associated organs during starvation. Starvation induced a decrease in both maintenance metabolism (MO2rest, decreased by approximately 50%) and respiratory frequency (indicated by double side gill activity and notated as fR, decreased by 29%). Lipase, trypsin and aminopeptidase-A showed a similar reduction in mass-specific activities during starvation, but pepsin and \u03b1-amylase did not. The starvation of experimental fish resulted in a significant reduction in body weight, the wet mass of the liver and the digestive-somatic system, the hepato-somatic index and the condition factor whereas the wet masses of the GI tract, pancreas, gall bladder and the relative intestinal length did not vary significantly during starvation. The reduction in liver wet mass was the main reason for the decrease in the wet mass of digestive-somatic system in this species. Only the mucosal area of the PI was affected significantly by starvation, decreasing by 34% at the end of the experiment. S. meridionalis displayed a decreasing intestinal mucosal area towards the distal intestine, and this gradient was not affected by starvation. The morphology and structure of both the GI tract and the liver were greatly down-regulated, as indicated by decreases in liver cell size, the mucosal thickness of the stomach and intestine, the density of goblet cells and microvilli surface area (MVSA), implying that food deprivation greatly impaired the digestive and absorptive functions of the GI tract in S. meridionalis. When deprived of food, S. meridionalis can endure harsh periods of starvation and adaptively down-regulate the function and structure of the digestive tract with physiological and biochemical strategies.",

     "abstract": "In species that provide parental care, care for offspring is often accompanied by an increase in locomotor activity and a decrease in feeding opportunities which can negatively impact endogenous energy reserves. Depletion of parental energy stores and declines in nutritional condition can cause physiological disturbances, such as an imbalance between free radical production and available antioxidants, known as oxidative stress. Using the teleost smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) as a model, we tested if the energetic challenge associated with sole paternal care was associated with oxidative stress. Blood samples from parental males were collected throughout parental care, during egg, embryo, and larval stages of offspring development, and assayed for both antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage. A reduction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity was observed during the parental care period, indicating a decrease in resistance to oxidative stress. Although no change was observed in the reduced:total thiol ratio, a significant increase in the concentration of both oxidized and total thiols occurred during the parental care period. No increase in the oxidative stress markers 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, protein carbonyls and lipid peroxides was observed. We concluded that oxidative stress did not occur as a result of parental care in the male smallmouth bass. This study provides evidence that participation in energetically taxing activities, such as parental care, can result in a decrease in antioxidant resources, but may not always result in oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "An interaction of two essential nutrients, thiamine and magnesium (Mg) has been documented in in vitro and in vivo studies in mammalian metabolism. However, the role of this association in poikilothermic vertebrates, such as fish, remains elusive. The purpose of this study was first to investigate the effects of dietary thiamine and Mg, and their interaction in lake trout and second to better understand the mechanism leading to early mortality syndrome (EMS), which is caused by a low thiamine level in embryos of many species of salmonids in the wild. Semi-purified diets (SPD) were prepared to accomplish 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial design that were either devoid of or supplemented with thiamine mononitrate (20\u00a0mg/kg diet), magnesium oxide (700\u00a0mg/kg diet), or both. Lake trout alevins at the swim-up stage were fed for 10\u00a0wk one of the SPD diets or a commercial diet at the same rate (2.0\u20131.5%) based on recorded biomass. Our results showed that the concentrations of thiamine in the trunk muscle and Mg of whole body were closely associated with the dietary level of two nutrients. The interaction of low dietary Mg and thiamine resulted in apparently worsened overt symptoms of thiamine deficiency in lake trout leading to a higher mortality of fish during the seven week long trial (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The fish fed a thiamine-devoid and Mg-supplemented diet were presumed to survive longer (10\u00a0wk) than the fish fed diets devoid of both nutrients (discontinued after 7th wk due to high mortality). However, we did not observe histopathological changes in the brain and liver corresponding to thiamine concentrations in tissues. These data suggest that Mg enhanced utilization of the thiamine remaining in the fish body and its interdependence was consistent with observations in mammals. EMS severity might be worsened when Mg is deficient in parental diets (and consequently in yolk sac) and/or first feed.",

In this study, we examined hypothalamic mRNA expression of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) to understand the effect of HT on an orexigenic neuropeptide. We examined the effects of HT (35\u00a0\u00b0C ambient temperature for 1, 24 or 48\u00a0h) on 14-day old chicks. HT significantly increased rectal temperature and suppressed food intake, and also influenced plasma metabolites. The expression of GnIH precursor mRNA in the diencephalon was significantly increased in chicks at 24-and 48\u00a0h of HT when food intake was suppressed significantly, whilst no change was observed for GnIH precursor mRNA and food intake at 1\u00a0h of HT. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry further revealed the cellular localization of chicken GnIH precursor mRNA and its peptide in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the chick hypothalamus. We examined plasma metabolites in chicks exposed to HT for 1 or 48\u00a0h and found that triacylglycerol concentration was significantly higher in HT than control chicks at 1\u00a0h. Total protein, uric acid and calcium were significantly lower in HT chicks than control chicks at 48\u00a0h. These results indicate that not only a reduction in food intake and alteration in plasma metabolites but also the PVN-specific expression of GnIH, an orexigenic agent, may be induced by HT. The reduced food intake at the same time as GnIH expression was increased during HT suggests that HT-induced GnIH expression may oppose HT-induced feeding suppression, rather than promote it. We suggest that the increased GnIH expression could be a consequence of the reduced food intake, and would not be a direct response to HT.",

The TUNEL assay showed that apoptotic cells in the gills were significantly increased at 1\u00a0day after transfer, which was supported by an electron-microscopic observation that gill MR cells underwent morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis such as an irregularly shaped electron-dense nucleus and distension of the tubular system. To further examine MR\u2013cell recruitment, freshwater-acclimated tilapia were transferred either to freshwater or to 70% seawater after BrdU injection. Immunohistochemical detection of BrdU-labeled nuclei and Na+/K+-ATPase-rich MR cells allowed us to classify BrdU-labeled MR cells into two subtypes: a single MR cell and an MR\u2013cell complex. Although newly generated single MR cells were observed similarly in both freshwater and 70% seawater-transferred fish, the density of MR\u2013cell complexes was much higher in 70% seawater than in freshwater.

Here, we present the first morphological and physiological data quantifying the cumulative effects of four acute dehydration events on the embryonic American alligator, Alligator mississipiensis. We hypothesized that dehydration would alter embryonic morphology, reduce blood volume and augment the response to angiotensin II (Ang II), a key osmotic and blood volume regulatory response element in adult vertebrates. Drying events at 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of embryonic incubation reduced total egg water content by 14.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0g, a 3.4 fold increase relative to controls.

Dehydration altered the morphological phenotype and resulted in an overall reduction in embryonic mass at both incubation time points measured. Dehydration also altered the physiological phenotype, resulting in embryonic alligators that were relatively bradycardic at 90% of incubation. Arterial Ang II injections resulted in a dose dependent hypertension, which increased in intensity over the span of incubation studied. While progressive incubation altered the Ang II response, dehydration had no impact on the cardiovascular responses to the peptide. Quantification of Ang II type-1 receptor protein using western blot analysis illustrated that dehydration condition and incubation time point did not alter protein quantity.

     "abstract": "The crystalline lens of the eyes of vertebrates focuses light on the retina. Therefore, maintaining the lens clear is necessary for proper visual function. However, oxidative damage to proteins of the lens leads to opacification and lens dysfunction, termed cataract. Antioxidants thus have a role in avoiding the development of cataracts through their reduction of oxidative stress, and glutathione (GSH), a key intracellular antioxidant, belongs to the primary antioxidant defence mechanism of the lens. Other physiological mechanisms that require GSH may compete with the antioxidant mechanism of the eye. Pheomelanin is a main type of melanin, the most common pigment in vertebrates, and its synthesis consumes GSH. Here, we use data on 81 bird species to test the hypothesis that species producing large amounts of pheomelanin should have diminished capacity to use GSH to protect their eyes and, as a consequence, higher prevalence of cataracts. As predicted, the proportion of pheomelanic plumage was positively associated with the proportion of individuals with cataracts across species, suggesting that production of pheomelanin may have profound fitness consequences, as birds with cataracts have limited ability to perform vital activities.

Moreover, in sexually mature fish, kisspeptin treatment led to increased gonad weight, gonadosomatic index, and spermatocrit in some white and striped bass. Additionally, mature white bass treated with kisspeptins showed an advancement in oocyte development as determined by histological examination. These gonadal changes occurred in the absence of any photothermal manipulation or hormone injections. To date, this is the first description of kisspeptin-mediated pubertal initiation in fish, and the first evidence that kisspeptins could modulate gonad maturation. Although it remains to be determined how kisspeptins may best be utilized in practice, our findings are a basis for future studies to characterize the molecular underpinnings of the KISS system in various fish species.",

Since the seasonal expression of torpor of both placental and marsupial hibernators in the wild is poorly documented by quantitative data, we investigated torpor and activity patterns of the eastern pygmy-possum Cercartetus nanus (17.4\u00a0g) over two seasons. We used radio telemetry to track animals during winter (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and summer (n\u00a0=\u00a05) in a warm-temperate habitat and found that torpor was used in both seasons. In winter all animals entered periods of short-term hibernation (from 5 to 20\u00a0days) containing individual torpor bouts of up to 5.9\u00a0days. In summer, torpor bouts were always <\u00a01\u00a0day in duration, only used by males and were not related to daily mean Ta. Pygmy-possums entered torpor at night as Ta cooled, and rewarmed during the afternoon as Ta increased. Individuals interspersed torpor bouts with nocturnal activity and the percentage of the night animals were active was the same in summer and winter. Our study provides the first information on torpor patterns in free-ranging C. nanus, and shows that the use of torpor throughout the year is important for energy management in this species.",

However, only a few species have been studied to date. The aquatic frog Pipa carvalhoi inhabits lakes, ponds and marshes that are rich in nutrients but low in O2. There are no studies of the respiratory pattern of this species and its ventilation during hypoxia or hypercarbia. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to characterize the breathing pattern and the ventilatory response to aquatic and aerial hypoxia and hypercarbia in this species. With this purpose, pulmonary ventilation (VI) was directly measured by the pneumotachograph method during normocapnic normoxia to determine the basal respiratory pattern and during aerial and aquatic hypercarbia (5% CO2) and hypoxia (5% O2). Our data demonstrate that P. carvalhoi exhibits a periodic breathing pattern composed of single events (single breaths) of pulmonary ventilation separated by periods of apnea. The animals had an enhanced VI during aerial hypoxia, but not during aquatic hypoxia. This increase was strictly the result of an increase in the breathing frequency. A pronounced increase in VI was observed if the animals were simultaneously exposed to aerial and aquatic hypercarbia, whereas small or no ventilatory responses were observed during separately administered aerial or aquatic hypercarbia. P. carvalhoi primarily inhabits an aquatic environment. Nevertheless, it does not respond to low O2 levels in water, although it does so in air. The observed ventilatory responses to hypercarbia may indicate that this species is similar to other anurans in possessing central chemoreceptors.",

Much of the research has focussed on teleost fish and so the endocrine mechanisms for cortisol production, transport and action at the target site have received significant attention. However, corticosteroidogenesis in elasmobranchs is exceptional on a number of levels. Unlike teleost fish the interrenal tissue is anatomically distinct from both renal and chromaffin (catecholamine producing) tissue; further the final product, 1\u03b1-hydroxycorticosterone (1\u03b1-OH-B), is unique to chondrichthyans where the carbon atom at position 1 of corticosterone has a hydroxyl group attached in the \u03b1 orientation. The homologous nature of interrenal tissue in elasmobranchs presents an obvious advantage in the study of corticosteroidogenesis, however, the unique chemical nature of 1\u03b1-OH-B has presented distinct disadvantages as it has proven to be difficult to synthesise, and therefore studies examining the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid actions of this steroid are limited. Over the last decade molecular techniques have provided significant insight in the involvement of corticosteroiogenic enzymes in the elasmobranch interrenal in addition to the evolution of corticosteroid receptors. Given the number of excellent reviews focussing on the role of cortisol in the stress response of teleost fish, this short review aims to synthesise the endocrine basis for the synthesis, release, and action, of the enigmatic 1\u03b1-OH-B in elasmobranch fish.",

Mature, male Atlantic sharpnose sharks were acutely stressed and serially sampled for one-hour, during spring, summer, and fall. An elevated stress response was observed for plasma glucose, lactate and osmolality during summer compared to spring and fall. Glucose also exhibited elevated initial concentrations, followed by a linear response during summer; varying from the asymptotic response during spring and fall. Hematocrit did not show differences over time or season; however, the power of the analysis was low due to the small sample size. When an additional 120 samples were included in the analysis, significantly higher initial hematocrit values were found during summer.

To investigate effects of gill-net capture on the acid\u2013base balance of sharks, we exposed gummy sharks, Mustelus antarcticus, to 60\u00a0min of gill-net capture in a controlled setting, and obtained multiple blood and muscle tissue samples during a 72-h recovery period following the capture event. Overall mortality of gummy sharks was low (9%). Blood pH was significantly depressed immediately after the capture event due to a combination of respiratory and metabolic acidosis. Maximum concentrations of plasma lactate (9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121) were measured 3\u00a0h after the capture event.

Sharks in poor condition had low blood pH and high intramuscular lactate concentration, but blood pH does not appear to be a reliable predictor of survival. Suitability of intramuscular lactate concentration as predictor of delayed mortality deserves further investigation.",

To quantify the sub-lethal effects of longline capture in the commonly exploited Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), 37 individuals were captured using standard, mid-water longlines. Hook timers provided hooking duration to the nearest minute. Once sharks were landed, blood samples were taken and used to measure a suite of physiological parameters. Control data were obtained by sampling an additional three unrestrained Caribbean reef sharks underwater at an established shark feeding site. The greatest level of physiological disruption occurred after 120\u2013180\u00a0min of hooking, whereas sharks exposed to minimal and maximal hook durations exhibited the least disturbed blood chemistry. Significant relationships were established between hooking duration and blood pH, pCO2, lactate, glucose, plasma calcium and plasma potassium. Longline capture appears more benign than other methods assessed to date, causing a shift in the stress response from acute at the onset of capture to a sub-acute regime as the capture event progresses, apparently facilitating a degree of physiological recovery. Continued investigation into the physiological response of elasmobranchs to longline capture is vital for the effective management of such fisheries.",

Among species, stress response to capture was similar for all parameters; however, pH declined and lactate concentrations rose over time, indicating continued insult from capture and/or response to additional handling stress. pCO2 rose faster for S. tiburo than for C. leucas, and lactate concentrations rose faster for S. tiburo than for N. brevirostris. All species caught in gillnets experienced lower pH and higher lactate concentrations than on longlines. Discriminant analysis justified the use of blood gas analysis to assess physiological stress induced by different capture methods.

Recent studies have used hematological profiling to assess the secondary stress response, but little is known about how, and to what degree, these indicators vary interspecifically. Moreover, there is little understanding of the extent to which the level of relative swimming activity (e.g., sluggish vs. active) or the general ecological classification (e.g., coastal vs. pelagic) correlates to the magnitude of the exercise-induced (capture-related) stress response. This study compared plasma electrolytes (Na+, Cl\u2212, Mg2\u00a0+, Ca2\u00a0+, and K+), metabolites (glucose and lactate), blood hematocrit, and heat shock protein (Hsp70) levels between 11 species of longline-captured sharks (n\u00a0=\u00a0164). Statistical comparison of hematological parameters revealed species-specific differences in response to longline capture, as well as differences by ecological classification. Taken together, the blood properties of longline-captured sharks appear to be useful indicators of interspecific variation in the secondary stress response to capture, and may prove useful in the future for predicting survivorship of longline-captured sharks where new technologies (i.e., pop-up satellite tags) can verify post-release mortality.",

To address this, venous blood samples were collected and evaluated from little skates (Leucoraja erinacea) subjected to discrete aerial exposure durations (0, 15, and 50\u00a0min) coupled with differing abrupt thermal changes (gradient between seawater and air; winter: \u0394T\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a03\u00a0\u00b0C; summer: \u0394T\u00a0=\u00a0+\u00a09\u00a0\u00b0C) in two distinct laboratory studies. In general, blood acid\u2013base properties (e.g. decline in pH; elevation in PCO2) and select metabolites (elevated whole-blood lactate) and electrolytes (elevated plasma K+) were significantly disrupted by aerial exposure, and were most disturbed after skates were exposed to air for 50\u00a0min. However, the magnitude of the blood acid\u2013base perturbations, metabolic contribution to the resulting blood acidosis, elevations to ionic and metabolic parameters, and delayed mortality were more extreme during the summer study, suggesting that acute thermal stress exacerbates the physiological impairments associated with aerial exposure in little skates. Conversely, a reduced thermal gradient (from seawater to air) may attenuate the magnitude of metabolic and ionic perturbations, resulting in a high physiological threshold for coping with extended aerial exposure.",

There was a significant stepwise increase in corticosterone levels in stingrays over transport time in combination with osmoregulatory disturbances suggesting a stress related role of this corticosteroid. There were significant increases in water conductivity, Na+ and K+ losses and ammonia excretion. Blood parameters such as glucose, hematocrit, red blood count and urea did not change significantly during the experiment. Glucose levels did not increase significantly during transport and this may be due to the fact that other elasmobranchs have been shown to rely more on ketone bodies for energy rather than glucose and produce ammonia as their main nitrogenous waste. The mineralocorticoid action of this hormone has been shown in elasmobranchs and most likely plays a role in osmotic homeostasis. The use of probiotic and especially antibiotic should be avoided since no beneficial effects were observed.",

     "abstract": "Elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates) are currently facing substantial anthropogenic threats, which expose them to acute and chronic stressors that may exceed in severity and/or duration those typically imposed by natural events. To date, the number of directed studies on the response of elasmobranch fishes to acute and chronic stress are greatly exceeded by those related to teleosts. Of the limited number of studies conducted to date, most have centered on sharks; batoids are poorly represented. Like teleosts, sharks exhibit primary and secondary responses to stress that are manifested in their blood biochemistry. The former is characterized by immediate and profound increases in circulating catecholamines and corticosteroids, which are thought to mobilize energy reserves and maintain oxygen supply and osmotic balance. Mediated by these primary responses, the secondary effects of stress in elasmobranchs include hyperglycemia, acidemia resulting from metabolic and respiratory acidoses, and profound disturbances to ionic, osmotic, and fluid volume homeostasis. The nature and magnitude of these secondary effects are species-specific and may be tightly linked to metabolic scope and thermal physiology as well as the type and duration of the stressor. In fishes, acute and chronic stressors can incite a tertiary response, which involves physiological changes at the organismal level, thereby impacting growth rates, reproductive outputs or investments, and disease resistance. Virtually no studies to date have been conducted on the tertiary stress response in elasmobranchs. Given the diversity of elasmobranchs, additional studies that characterize the nature, magnitude, and consequences of physiological stress over a broad spectrum of stressors are essential for the development of conservation measures. Additional studies on the primary, secondary, and tertiary stress response in elasmobranchs are warranted, with particular emphasis on expanding the range of species and stressors examined. Future studies should move beyond simply studying the effects of known stressors and focus on the underlying physiological mechanisms. Such studies should include the coupling of stress indicators with quantifiable aspects of the stressor, which will allow researchers to test hypotheses on survivorship and, ultimately, derive models that effectively link physiology to mortality. Studies of this nature are essential for decision-making that will result in the effective management and conservation of these species.",

We also explored the capacity of baseline haptoglobin concentrations to predict an array of physiological changes associated with a subsequent experimentally-induced inflammatory response. Maximum repeatability, which occurred over a short mid-winter interval, equaled 0.57. Baseline haptoglobin concentrations predicted response haptoglobin concentrations better than any other endotoxin-induced change.

Incubation to 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C led to a temperature induced increase of tissue aerobic status (reduced intracellular cCO2 with increased O2 consumption, PLA (phospho-L-arginine) and ATP). At the highest acute temperature (7.5\u00a0\u00b0C) the increase in anaerobic pathways (summed acetate/succinate and propionate) was less after 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C than 0.0\u00a0\u00b0C incubation. No other metric shifted its reaction norm in response to acute temperature elevation and so whole animal acclimation had not occurred, even after 3\u00a0months at 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C.

Thus, our results show that the two studied predator species inhabiting in the same stream present specializations on their feeding behaviors, facilitating their coexistence, and also differences in their capacity of use the resources. One of the main findings of this study is that D. cephalotes is able to assimilate a wider trophic resource spectrum and this could be one of the reasons why this species has a wider global distribution in all its geographical range.",

The expression patterns of vitellogenin, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, metallothionein, and cytochrome P450 1A genes in mosquitofish varied according to tissue as well as the specificity of steroids. Treatment by progesterone or testosterone alone inhibited target gene expression in the livers. The expression levels of both vitellogenin A and vitellogenin B mRNAs were up-regulated by17\u03b2-estradiol, and a parallel induction of estrogen receptor \u03b1 mRNA expression was also observed in the livers. In addition, 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment alone suppressed androgen receptor \u03b1, metallothionein and cytochrome P450 1A mRNA expression in the livers. In general, multiple hormone treatments had different effects on target gene expression compared with corresponding hormone alone. The results demonstrate that steroid hormones cause multiple biological responses including the expression of vitellogenin, estrogen receptor and androgen receptor mRNA in the hormone signaling pathways and the expression of metallothionein and cytochrome P450 1A mRNA in the xenobiotic signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "The adult phenotype of an organism is the result of its genotype, the environment, and the interaction between the two. Assessing the relative contribution of these factors to the final adult phenotype continues to occupy researchers. Studies have shown clutch effects early in development but few have investigated the persistence of clutch effects on a longer time scale. Five clutches of American alligators were reared for 1\u00a0year in a common environment then assessed for the presence of clutch effects as they related to morphological and physiological characteristics. After 1\u00a0year, significant clutch effects were evident in all size related variables despite open access to food. Additionally, lung and liver masses remained different between clutches after animal mass was taken into account. Although clutch had no effect on resting heart rate, it significantly contributed to mean arterial pressure. During swimming and exhaustive exercise, the resulting respiratory and metabolic acidoses were strongly dependent on clutch. Therefore, while the environment can have significant influences on the American alligator from hatching to death, the measureable contribution of genetics to the morphology and physiology of the organism remains evident, even after 1\u00a0year of common rearing conditions. It behooves researchers to acknowledge and control for clutch effects when designing experiments.",

The insect metabolism is predominantly controlled by neuropeptides belonging to the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone family (AKH/RPCH). The main goal of this study was to obtain the sequence of AKH transcripts and analyze its expression in all polyphenic female forms of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The neuropeptide is expressed in the brain of all female forms and in the ovaries of the both (wingless and winged) parthenogenetic forms. The form of active Acypi-AKH decapeptide was confirmed by the LC/MS and +\u00a0ESI tandem mass spectrometry. The highest relative amount of Acypi-AKH was recorded in winged virginoparae. Furthermore, a potential role of this hormone when directly applied to the aphid was studied as well. Interestingly, no significant increase of trehalose in the wingless virginoparae after application of synthetic Acypi-AKH was detected. Yet this treatment did affect the level of protective polyol (mannitol) and furthermore led to increased activity of the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase. The possible physiological function of AKH in A. pisum under the stress conditions is discussed.",

However, no study has been conducted to compare the effect of different diets containing different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) and essential fatty acids (EFA) on lipid deposition in fish larvae and early juveniles. Thus, we evaluated the effects of six isolipidic diets (enriched Artemia salina), differing in their fatty acid profile, on the lipid accumulation patterns in selected target tissues (intestine, liver and vascular system) in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) larvae and early juveniles. Results showed that the profile of fat accumulation in these three tissues was significantly affected by the dietary treatments, the developmental stage of the fish (premetamorphosis, metamorphosis or postmetamorphosis), as well as by the interaction between these two factors that were responsible for changes in the histological organization of the tissues. Histological results revealed that a slight variation in the EFA levels (e.g. EPA, DHA or ARA) or in their ratios (EPA/DHA, ARA/EPA, ARA/DHA, (n-3)/(n-6) HUFA, OA/PUFA) modified the metabolism of lipids and disrupted the pattern of lipid accumulation in the target tissues, leading to intestinal and hepatic steatosis.",

The mechanisms of action include receptor-coupled processes, direct binding and modulation of calmodulin and protein kinase C, and direct scavenging of free radicals. While melatonin is produced in invertebrates and has influences on their physiology and behavior, little is known about its mechanisms of action. We studied the influence of melatonin on neuritogenesis in well-differentiated, extensively-arborized crustacean x-organ neurosecretory neurons. Melatonin significantly increased neurite area in the first 24\u00a0h of culture. The more physiological concentrations, 1\u00a0nM and 1\u00a0pM, increased area at 48\u00a0h also, whereas the pharmacological 1\u00a0\u03bcM concentration appeared to have desensitizing effects by this time. Luzindole, a vertebrate melatonin receptor antagonist, had surprising and significant agonist-like effects in these invertebrate cells. Melatonin receptors have not yet been studied in invertebrates. However, the presence of membrane-bound receptors in this population of crustacean neurons is indicated by this study. Melatonin also has significant neuroprotective effects, reversing the inhibition of neuritogenesis by 200 and 500\u00a0\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide. Because this is at least in part a direct action not requiring a receptor, melatonin's protection from oxidative stress is not surprisingly phylogenetically-conserved.",

In this study a positive effect of co-feeding preserved copepods in sole larviculture was observed since larvae fed this diet growth and survived better, showed a better tolerance to captive conditions and had a better response to the final thermal/density stress-test with respect to larvae fed a traditional diet. Morphometric data were fully supported by molecular and biochemical ones. Moreover, liver histological investigations, revealed that the inclusion of preserved copepods in the larval diet was able to improve lipid assimilation. In conclusion, preserved copepods may be considered a suitable food for sole when used as a supplement to the traditional diet based on rotifers and Artemia nauplii.",

Thus, the present study investigated the mechanism underlying the anorexigenic effect of CCK in neonatal chicks. Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sulfated CCK(26\u201333) (CCK8S) significantly decreased food intake in chicks at 60 and 300\u00a0nmol/kg. Non-sulfated CCK(26\u201333) (CCK8) also significantly decreased food intake, but its anorexigenic effect was observed only at the highest dose (300\u00a0nmol/kg) and short-lived. However, CCK(30\u201333) (CCK4) had no effect on food intake. Also, the intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of CCK8S (0.2 and 1\u00a0nmol) significantly decreased food intake in chicks. Similar to IP administration, the anorexigenic effect of CCK8 was weak and CCK4 did not affect food intake. IP and ICV injections of CCK8S caused conditioned aversion and increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, suggesting that their anorexigenic effects might be related to stress and/or malaise. This might be true in ICV-injected CCK8S because co-injection of astressin, a corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist, tended to attenuate the effect of CCK8S. The present study revealed that N-terminal amino acids and the sulfation of Tyr are important for the anorexigenic effect of CCK8S after IP and ICV administered in chicks. Additionally, the effect of central CCK8S might be related to stress and/or malaise.",

We cloned and sequenced two novel full-length cDNAs that encode Fundulus heteroclitus PepT1-type oligopeptide transporters, and examined their expression and functional properties in freshwater- and seawater-acclimated fish and in response to fasting and re-feeding. Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate SLC15A1 sequences confirms the presence of two PepT1 isoforms, named SLC15A1a and SLC15A1b, in fish. Similar to other vertebrate SLC15A1s, these isoforms have 12 transmembrane domains, and amino acids essential for PepT1 function are conserved. Expression analysis revealed novel environment-specific expression of the SLC15A1 isoforms in F. heteroclitus, with only SLC15A1b expressed in seawater-acclimated fish, and both isoforms expressed in freshwater-acclimated fish. Fasting and re-feeding induced changes in the expression of SLC15A1a and SLC15A1b mRNA. Short-term fasting resulted in up-regulation of PepT1 mRNA levels, while prolonged fasting resulted in down-regulation. The resumption of feeding resulted in up-regulation of PepT1 above pre-fasted levels. Experiments using the in vitro gut sac technique suggest that the PepT1 isoforms differ in functional characteristics. An increased luminal pH resulted in decreased intestinal dipeptide transport in freshwater-acclimated fish but suggested an increased dipeptide transport in seawater-acclimated fish. Overall, this is the first evidence of multiple isoforms of PepT1 in fish whose expression is environmentally dependent and results in functional differences in intestinal dipeptide transport.",

     "abstract": "We measured metabolic hormones and several key metabolites in breeding adult male northern elephant seals to examine the regulation of fuel metabolism during extended natural fasts of over 3\u00a0months associated with high levels of energy expenditure. Males were sampled twice, early and late in the fast, losing an average of 23% of body mass and 47% of adipose stores between measurements. Males exhibited metabolic homeostasis over the breeding fast with no changes in glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, or blood urea nitrogen. Ketoacids increased over the fast but were very low when compared to other fasting species. Changes within individuals in total triiodothyronine (tT3) were positively related to daily energy expenditure (DEE) and protein catabolism. Differences in levels of thyroid hormones relative to that observed in weaned pups and females suggest a greater deiodination of T4 to support the high DEE of breeding males. Relative levels of leptin and ghrelin were consistent with the suppression of appetite but a significant reduction in growth hormone across the fast was contrary to expectation in fasting mammals. The lack of the increase in cortisol during fasting found in conspecific weaned pups and lactating females may contribute to the ability of breeding males to spare protein despite high levels of energy expenditure. Together these findings reveal significant differences with conspecifics under varying nutrient demands, suggesting metabolic adaptation to extended high energy fasts.",

According to the life-history theory, this variation is caused by the costs of immune responses to the hosts. We studied one of such potential costs, depletion of somatic resources in wintering wild-caught captive passerines, the great tits (Parus major) by immune challenging the birds with a novel antigen, killed Brucella abortus (BA) suspension. We found that despite mild temperature conditions in captivity and ad libitum availability of food, immune challenge depleted somatic resources (as indicated by a body mass loss) and elevated relative proportion of heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L ratio) in the peripheral blood of birds. However, body mass loss did not covary with an increase in H/L ratios between two sampling events, which indicates that these two markers of health state describe different aspects of individual physiological condition. Antibody titres were not associated with the extent of body mass loss during the development of immune response, which shows that the somatic cost of immune response was not proportional to the amount of antibody produced. Birds with high pre-immunisation H/L ratios mounted weaker antibody response, which is indicative of stress-induced suppression of humoral immune response and is consistent with the concept of an antagonistic cross-regulation between different components of the immune system. The latter finding suggests a novel diagnostic value of H/L ratios, which reinforces the utility of this simple haematological index for prediction of the outcomes of complicated immune processes.",

We measured the oxygen consumption of permeabilized fibers from Nereis (Neanthes) virens with different substrates and the presence of ADP. To estimate the alternative oxidase (AOX) activity, antimycin A was introduced in order to inhibit complex III. Moreover, the apparent complex IV (COX) excess capacity was evaluated using different substrates to assess the implication of this complex in the partitioning of electrons during its progressive inhibition. Our in situ method enabled to quantify the activity of the normal COX pathway as well as the AOX pathway when different substrates were oxidized by either complex I, complex II or both. Using this approach, we confirmed that according to the substrates used, each pathway has a different role and consequently is otherwise involved in the partitioning of electrons through the electron transport system, and suggested that the AOX activity is triggered not only by the redox state of the cell but also by the type of substrates provided to mitochondria.",

     "abstract": "Salinity is an important parameter that affects survival and metabolism in fish. In fish, pituitary growth hormone (GH) regulates physiological functions including adaptation to different salinity as well as somatic growth. GH is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and exerts its function via binding to growth hormone receptor (GHR). As Kryptolebias marmoratus is a euryhaline fish, this species would be a useful model species for studying the adaptation to osmotic stress conditions. Here, we cloned GH, -GHR, somatolactin (SL), and somatolactin receptor (SLR) genes, and analyzed their expression patterns in different tissues and during early developmental stages by using real-time RT-PCR. We also further examined expression of them after acclimation to different salinity. Tissue distribution studies revealed that Km-GH and -SL mRNAs were remarkably expressed in brain and pituitary, whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNAs were predominantly expressed in liver, followed by gonad, muscle, pituitary, and brain. During embryonic developmental stages, the expression of their mRNA was increased at stage 3 (9\u00a0dpf). The Km-GH and -SL mRNA transcripts were constantly elevated until stage 5 (5\u00a0h post hatch), whereas Km-GHR and -SLR mRNA levels decreased at this stage. After we transferred K. marmoratus from control (12\u00a0psu) to hyper-osmotic condition (hyperseawater, HSW; 33\u00a0psu), Km-GH, -SL, and GHR mRNA levels were enhanced. In hypo-osmotic conditions like freshwater (FW), Km-GH and -SL expressions were modulated 24\u00a0h after exposure, and Km-SLR transcripts were significantly upregulated. This finding suggests that Km-GH and -SL may be involved in the osmoregulatory mechanism under hyper-osmotic as well as hypo-osmotic stress. This is the first report on transcriptional modulation and relationship of GH, GHR, SL, and SLR during early development and after salinity stress. This study will be helpful to a better understanding on molecular mechanisms of adaptation response to salt stress in euryhaline fish.",

Autumn collected slugs were cold acclimated in the laboratory and subjected to freezing conditions simulating likely winter temperatures in their habitat. Slugs spontaneously froze at about \u2212\u00a04\u00a0\u00b0C when cooled under dry conditions, but freezing of body fluids was readily induced at \u2212\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C when in contact with external ice crystals. All three species survived freezing for 2\u00a0days at \u2212\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C, and some A. rufus and A. lusitanicus also survived freezing at \u2212\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C. 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that freezing of body fluids resulted in accumulation of lactate, succinate and glucose. Accumulation of lactate and succinate indicates that ATP production occurred via fermentative pathways, which is likely a result of oxygen depletion in frozen tissues. Glucose increased from about 6 to 22\u00a0\u03bcg/mg dry tissue upon freezing in A. rufus, but less so in A. ater and A. lusitanicus. Glucose may thus act as a cryoprotectant in these slugs, although the concentrations are not as high as reported for other freeze tolerant invertebrates.",

The cerebroid ganglion has been considered a plausible site for the circadian pacemaker of this rhythm and for the retinular photoreceptors, as the corresponding effectors. The pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) appears to synchronize ERG rhythm, but its characterization as a synchronizer cue remains incomplete. The main purposes of this work were a) to determine whether PDH acts on the cerebroid ganglion, and b) to complete its characterization as a non-photic synchronizer. Here we show that PDH increases the number of the spontaneous potentials of the cerebroid ganglion, reaching 149.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.42% of the activity recorded in the controls, and that daily application of PDH for 15 consecutive days adjusts the ERG circadian rhythm period to 24.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0h and the end of the activity period of the rhythm coincides with the injection of the hormone. In this work, we hypothesized that in crayfish, PDH transmits the \u201cday\u201d signal to the ERG circadian system and acts upon both the presumptive circadian pacemaker and the corresponding effectors to reinforce the synchronization of the system.",

The olfactory rosettes were surgically removed in silver sea bream adapted to hypo- (6\u00a0ppt) and hyper-osmotic (33\u00a0ppt) salinities and the mRNA expression of the two previously identified freshwater-adapting factors, prolactin (PRL) and prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP), in silver sea bream was measured. The elevation of pituitary PRL and PrRP mRNA expression levels as seen in 6\u00a0ppt-adapted fish was abolished by surgical removal of the olfactory rosettes. The PRL and PrRP expression levels in fish adapted to 6\u00a0ppt were significantly lowered following olfactory rosette removal. On the other hand, hypothalamic PrRP mRNA expression in 6\u00a0ppt-adapted fish did not change. Specific signals for Na+\u2013K+-ATPase but not CFTR mRNA expression were detected in the surface layers of olfactory epithelial cells by in situ hybridization. The mRNA abundance of CFTR and Na+\u2013K+-ATPase \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits remained unchanged in the olfactory rosette of silver sea bream adapted to 0, 6, 12, 33 and 50\u00a0ppt for 4\u00a0weeks and in fish abruptly transferred from 33\u00a0ppt to 6\u00a0ppt.

Analysis of tissues by a CHH-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed the presence of CHH in hemocytes, the levels of which were much lower than those in the sinus gland, but 2 to 10 times higher than those in the thoracic and cerebral ganglia. Total hemocytes were separated by density gradient centrifugation into layers of hyaline cell (HC), semi-granular cell (SGC), and granular cell (GC). Analysis of extracts of each layer using ELISA revealed that CHH is present in GCs (202.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a086.7\u00a0fmol/mg protein) and SGCs (497.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049.4\u00a0fmol/mg protein), but not in HCs. Finally, CHH stimulated the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity of hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner. These data for the first time confirm that a crustacean neuropeptide-encoding gene is expressed in cells essential for immunity and its expression in hemocytes is cell type-specific. Effect of CHH on the membrane-bound GC activity of hemocyte suggests that hemocyte is a target site of CHH. Possible functions of the hemocyte-derived CHH are discussed.",

When the sunflower stars were fed clam flesh totalling 5%, 10%, or 20% of their body weight there was a step-wise increase in the scope, time to peak oxygen consumption, duration of the response and total SDA. The change in the rate of oxygen consumption was slower than other organisms, and oxygen uptake remained elevated for over 12\u00a0d following consumption of the largest meal. There were also differences in the characteristics of the SDA if sunflower stars consumed a whole clam versus the shucked flesh of a clam. The time to reach peak oxygen consumption was greater for sunflower stars consuming a whole clam. This occurred because the clam had to be opened before they could digest the flesh; a smaller initial peak comprising 3.5% of the total SDA represented the energy require to open the clam valves. When the sunflower stars were fed different prey items (e.g. butter clam, purple urchin and herring) of similar wet organic mass, there was no difference in the time to peak, peak oxygen uptake or total SDA despite the fact that the prey items differed in protein, lipid and caloric content. There was an increased duration for which oxygen uptake remained elevated for sea stars that consumed the urchin meal. Five of the seven sunflower stars that consumed urchins exhibited a smaller second peak in oxygen uptake, totalling approximately 8.5% of the SDA energy budget. This likely represented the energy required to eject the urchin test from the stomach. Although the sunflower star is much larger and more active than other sea stars, it displayed similar SDA responses to other members of the Asteroidea, indicative of the low metabolic rate of this class.",

Studies have demonstrated that pollinators have preferences according to the sugar composition presented in their diet, and these preferences may be caused by sugar assimilation capacities.

We evaluated the sugar gustatory thresholds of the broad-billed hummingbird Cynanthus latirostris for sucrose, glucose, fructose and a 1:1 mixture of glucose\u2013fructose. We presented eight C. latirostris to paired feeders containing either a sugar solution or pure water. Additionally, we conducted sugar preference tests at three different concentrations (146, 730 and 1022\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), to relate sugar preferences with sugar gustatory thresholds. C. latirostris had different gustatory thresholds for the three different sugars tested. At low sugar concentrations (146\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), sugar selection followed the gustatory thresholds. Hummingbird sugar preference patterns can be affected by different mechanisms, both pre- and post-ingestive. At low concentrations gustatory thresholds may play an important role to determine sugar selection. However, at intermediate and high concentrations, sugar assimilation rates, and velocity of food processing generated by osmotic constraints, can be the mechanisms that explain the sugar selection of these animals.",

Relative chick and muscle weights were used as a measure of growth rate and development. AgNano but not AuNano increased the rates of O2 consumption and HP of the layer embryos. The metabolic rate of broiler embryos was not affected by either of the treatments, but it was significantly higher compared to the layer embryos. Neither of the nanoparticles promoted nor depressed growth and development of the embryos, irrespective of breed. Although the metabolic rate of AgNano-injected layer embryos was significantly increased, their BW and muscle weights at hatching were similar to those of the control group, which suggests that the concentration of AgNano used was adequate for increasing the metabolic rate but not enough to affect growth and development. The results show that AgNano could be a potential metabolic modifier for layer embryos; however, the exact mechanism of action should be elucidated in future research.",

Although ion transport in killifish gills during acclimation to increased salinity has been studied extensively, no studies have examined the role of aquaglyceroporin 3 (AQP3), a water, glycerol, urea, and ammonia transporter, during acclimation to increased salinity in this sentinel environmental model organism. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that transfer from freshwater to seawater decreases AQP3 gene and protein expression in the gill of killifish. Transfer from freshwater to seawater decreased AQP3 mRNA in the gill after 1\u00a0day, but had no effect on total gill AQP3 protein abundance as determined by western blot. Quantitative confocal immunocytochemistry confirmed western blot studies that transfer from freshwater to seawater did not change total AQP3 abundance in the gill; however, immunocytochemistry revealed that the amount of AQP3 in pillar cells of secondary lamellae decreased in seawater fish, whereas the amount of AQP3 in mitochondrion rich cells (MRC) in primary filaments of the gill increased in seawater fish. This response of AQP3 expression is unique to killifish compared to other teleosts. Although the role of AQP3 in the gill of killifish has not been completely elucidated, these results suggest that AQP3 may play an important role in the ability of killifish to acclimate to increased salinity.",

During the experiment mussels were exposed to air from 0 to 72\u00a0h. Mussels from all sampling sites displayed high tolerance to aerial exposure with moderate levels of mortality after 12 to 48\u00a0h of exposure. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), a biomarker of general stress, changed notably between minimum values after 12\u00a0h and maximum values after 24\u00a0h of aerial exposure in intertidal mussels. In contrast, labilization times of mussels from the hanging culture increased continuously up to 48\u00a0h of exposure. Intertidal mussels from the island of Heligoland exhibited significantly decreased membrane stability after 72\u00a0h of air exposure, correlating to higher mortality rates. Intertidal mussels, although adapted to daily aerial exposure in their natural environment, showed a similar pattern of mortality and lower LMS values during the experiment than mussels from the suspended culture site. The increase of LMS values of mussels under hypoxic conditions at the beginning of the experiment at all sites was tested for the influence of macro-autophagic processes using immune labelling techniques. With this approach it could be demonstrated that high LMS values significantly correlate with low autophagic activity. However, hypoxic conditions do not enhance autophagic processes during the early periods of aerial exposure. Only at the end of the experiment, high values for autophagy were measured in mussels from an intertidal site accompanied with high mortalities. The results indicate that autophagic processes are not involved in the early adaptive processes that enable the mussel to cope with periods of aerial exposure.",

Cortisol variability was related to Fulton's condition factor and size (eviscerated mass) where smaller fish in poor condition exhibited increased cortisol variability.

We predicted that the sugar type and concentration would affect the total amount of solution consumed, while the total energy gained and the apparent assimilation efficiency would be high, irrespective of sugar type or concentration. Equicaloric solutions of two sugar types, glucose and sucrose, at low (10%), medium (15%) and high (25%) concentrations were offered in separate trials to bats.

Bats had higher total volumetric intake of glucose and sucrose at the low concentrations than at the higher concentrations. However, bats maintained similar total energy intake on the respective glucose and sucrose concentrations. Bats were found to have high assimilation efficiencies on both glucose and sucrose irrespective of concentration.

In contrast to parallel selection of desiccation and starvation tolerance under laboratory selection experiments, opposite clines were observed in wild populations of D. melanogaster. If resistance to desiccation and starvation occurs in opposite directions under field conditions, we may expect a trade-off for energy metabolites but such correlated changes are largely unknown. We tested whether there is a trade-off for storage as well as actual utilization of carbohydrates (trehalose and glycogen), lipids and proteins in D. melanogaster populations collected from different altitudes (512\u20132500\u00a0m). For desiccation resistance, darker flies (>\u00a050% body melanization) store more body water content and endure greater loss of water (higher dehydration tolerance) as compared to lighter flies (<\u00a030% body melanization). Based on within population analysis, we found evidence for coadapted phenotypes i.e. darker flies store and actually utilize more carbohydrates to confer greater desiccation resistance. In contrast, higher starvation resistance in lighter flies is associated with storage and actual utilization of greater lipid amount. However, darker and lighter flies did not vary in the rate of utilization of carbohydrates under desiccation stress; and of lipids under starvation stress. Thus, we did not find support for the hypothesis that a lower rate of utilization of energy metabolites may contribute to greater stress resistance. Further, for increased desiccation resistance of darker flies, about two-third of total energy budget is provided by carbohydrates. By contrast, lighter flies derive about 66% of total energy content from lipids which sustain higher starvation tolerance. Our results support evolutionary trade-off for storage as well as utilization of energy metabolites for desiccation versus starvation resistance in D. melanogaster.",

Water-soluble vitamins were not detected with this metabolomics platform, but could be measured with standard assays. Concentrations of measured vitamins varied independently, but all were maintained at detectable levels over extended fasts, suggesting that defense of vitamin levels is a component of fasting adaptation in the seals. Metabolomics was not ideal for generating complete vitamin profiles in this species, but gave novel insights into vitamin metabolism by detecting key related metabolites. For example, niacin level reductions in lactating females were associated with significant reductions in precursors suggesting downregulation of the niacin synthetic pathway. The ability to detect individual vitamins using metabolomics may be impacted by the large number of novel compounds detected. Modifications to the analysis platforms and compound detection algorithms used in this study may be required for improving water-soluble vitamin detection in this and other novel wildlife systems.",

Such changes in the structure of prey communities may alter the energy management (storage and expenditure) of this predator. In this species, we monitored survival and body mass during food deprivation, in addition to evaluating the effects of two distinct diets (maggots versus enchytraeids) on the consumption and restoration of body reserves (sugars and triglycerides).

We recorded higher predation rates on maggots, associated with steeper body mass variations, compared to enchytraeids. Sugars and triglycerides were significantly consumed during food deprivation and restored after refeeding, but varied similarly among individuals supplied on the distinct diets. Other parameters may determine the food preferences observed, such as salt content in prey tissues, because M. soledadinus mainly feeds in hypersaline foreshore habitats, and may limit the consumption of osmotic conformers.",

The expression profile of genes involved in VA metabolism (crbp2, rbp, crabp1), lipid transport (i-fabp, l-fabp), nuclear receptors for VA and fatty acids (rar\u03b11, rxr\u03b1, ppar\u03b2), growth (igf1, igf2 and their receptor igf1r) and development (bgp) was analyzed at 22, 30 and 38\u00a0days post hatching. The main results suggested that the amount of VA absorbed by larvae is controlled at the intestinal level by crbp2 in both groups, preventing excessive accumulation of this vitamin in the target tissues. The stable expression of i-fabp in the ES group with age could cause an excessive fat accumulation in the intestine inducing, in turn, the steatosis found in the liver and vascular system of these specimens. In liver, the regulation of rbp and fabp expression reflected the status of the physiological functions demanding VA and lipids. The findings revealed that dietary composition induced different strategies for VA and lipid absorption and metabolism affecting, in turn, larval development, growth and health.",

The birds were subsequently socially isolated in individual opaque brown paper box for 2 hours. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentration and heart and brain heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) expressions were determined before stress and immediately after stress. Two hours of isolation stress elevated CORT concentration significantly in the control and BE birds but not in the BC, BCE and BM birds. There was a significant reduction in CORT concentration after isolation stress in the BCO group. Isolation stress increased Hsp 70 expression in the brain and heart of control and BM birds. However, brain and heart Hsp 70 expressions were not significantly altered in the isolated BC, BCE and BE birds. Although, the CORT concentration of BM birds was not affected by isolation stress, Hsp70 expression in both brain and heart were significantly increased. Moreover, exogenous corticosterone supplementation did not result in elevation of Hsp 70 expression. It can be concluded that, although Hsp 70 induction had not been directly affected by CORT concentration, it may be modulated by the HPA axis function via activation of ACTH.",

In this study, we not only investigated the effect of culture density on the naupliar production and specific gene expressions of P. nana, but also the effect of several antioxidants under the conditions of a high density culture. The naupliar production of the copepod decreased with increasing culture density. The expression of glutathione reductase (GR), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (SeGPx), glutathione S-transferase kappa (GST kappa), heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), and Hsp70 genes of P. nana increased in the high density treatment but vitellogenin genes (Vg1 and Vg2) showed downregulation. In the condition with 20\u00a0inds./mL, vitamin C had a significant decrease but sodium selenite induced the naupliar production of P. nana greatly. The expressions of GR, SeGPx, Hsp70, and Vg genes increased with the vitamin C treatment. Sodium selenite caused a decrease of SeGPx and Hsp40 but GST kappa increased in the treatment with 20\u00a0inds./mL.

Studies in fish, birds, and reptiles have shown that GCs may alter whole-animal energy expenditure, but results are conflicting and often involve GC levels that are not physiologically relevant. A previous study in red-legged salamanders found that male courtship pheromone increased plasma corticosterone (CORT; the primary GC in amphibians) concentrations in males, which could elevate metabolic processes to sustain courtship behaviors. To understand the possible metabolic effect of elevated plasma CORT, we measured the effects of male courtship pheromone and exogenous application of CORT on oxygen consumption in male red-legged salamanders (Plethodon shermani). Exogenous application of CORT elevated plasma CORT to physiologically relevant levels. Compared to treatment with male courtship pheromone and vehicle, treatment with CORT increased oxygen consumption rates for several hours after treatment, resulting in 12% more oxygen consumed (equivalent to 0.33\u00a0J) during our first 2\u00a0h sampling period. Contrary to our previous work, treatment with pheromone did not increase plasma CORT, perhaps because subjects used in this study were not in breeding condition. Pheromone application did not affect respiration rates. Our study is one of the few to evaluate the influence of physiologically relevant elevations in CORT on whole-animal metabolism in vertebrates, and the first to show that elevated plasma CORT increases metabolism in an amphibian.",

The present study investigates the physiological adaptations of this species to life on land through measurements of osmoregulation and respiration. Over the salinity range of 1\u201340\u2030, T. longicornis regulated its hemolymph hyperosmotically at low salinities and hypoosmotically at high salinities. The isosmotic point was about 27\u2030. Analogously, hemolymph chloride levels were well regulated being hyperionic at low salinities and hypoionic at high salinities. This species is capable of respiration in both air and water. Slopes (b values) of the relationship between weight and oxygen uptake rates ranged from 0.316 to 0.590. Oxygen uptake rates were higher in air than water and at night versus day. Q10 values were slightly below 2.0 for respiration in air for amphipods, irrespective of weight. These physiological adaptations, along with its behaviors, habitat, and morphology, place T. longicornis within the Group III sandhoppers of the Talitridae.",

Two different osteoblast specific osteocalcin/bone gla protein isoforms were discovered in cod. Transcription of both isoforms was up-regulated following RA treatment of 65\u00a0dph cod lower jaw explants. In contrast, transcripts coding for genes related to bone resorption and osteoclast activity, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and cathepsin K were down-regulated following RA treatment. This could be linked to the decreased transcriptional ratio between receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand rankl and osteoprotegerin observed in the same tissue samples. RA treatment of juvenile explants had no effect on runt-related transcription factor 2 and osterix mRNA levels. However, osterix was significantly down-regulated in 25\u00a0dph cod head explants following RA treatment. In situ hybridizations revealed differential spatial distribution of the two isoforms and the predominant expression of cathepsin K in bone surrounding tissues. The present study indicates that RA causes a shift in the balance between osteoclast activity and osteoblast activity in favor of the latter.",

In the adults, DE-1 PLA2 mRNA was expressed in pancreatic acinar cells. By contrast, DE-2 PLA2 mRNA was detected not only in digestive tissues, such as pancreatic acinar cells, gastric glands of the stomach, epithelial cells of the pyloric caeca, and intestinal epithelial cells, but also in non-digestive ones, including cardiac and lateral muscle fibers and the cytoplasm of the oocytes. In the larvae, both DE-1 and DE-2 PLA2 mRNAs first appeared in pancreatic tissues at 3\u00a0days post-hatching (dph) and in intestinal tissue at 1 dph, and expression levels for both gradually increased after this point. In the juvenile stage at 32 dph, DE-1 PLA2 mRNA was highly expressed in pancreatic tissue, and DE-2 PLA2 mRNA was detected in almost all digestive tissues, including pancreatic tissue, gastric glands, pyloric caeca, and intestine, including the myomere of the lateral muscles. In conclusion, both DE-1 and DE-2 PLA2 mRNAs are already expressed in the digestive organs of red sea bream larvae before first feeding, and larvae will synthesize both DE-1 and DE-2 PLA2 proteins.",

The PGs degenerate around the time of adult emergence, yet presence of PTTH has been reported in the brains of several adult insects. Using an in vitro bioassay system, we confirm that PTTH is present in the adult female brain of Rhodnius prolixus. The material is electrophoretically, immunologically and biologically indistinguishable from larval PTTH. The amount of PTTH in the brain shows a daily rhythm during egg development. We show that brains in vitro release PTTH with a daily rhythm over this period of time. PTTH is released at each scotophase. This is the first report that PTTH is released from the adult brain and functions as a hormone, inviting explanation of its function. Larval PTTH is also known to be released with a daily rhythm, and the clock in the brain controls both larval and adult rhythms.

In this study, we examined moisture preferences and physiological characteristics of Macrotermes carbonarius (Hagen) and M. gilvus (Hagen) as both exhibit conspicuous patterns of foraging activity. Despite both species showing no significant differences in calculated cuticular permeability, and percentage of total body water, they differed greatly in rate of water loss and surface area to volume ratio. For example, M. carbonarius which had a lower surface area to volume ratio (29.26\u201353.66) showed lower rate of water loss and percentage of total body water loss. This also resulted in higher LT50 when exposed to extreme conditions (\u2248\u00a02% RH). However, contrasting observations were made in M. gilvus that has smaller size with higher surface area to volume ratio of 40.28\u201369.75. It is likely that the standard equation for calculating insect surface areas is inadequate for these termite species. The trend was further supported by the result of a moisture preference bioassay that indicated M. carbonarius had a broader range of moisture preference (between 5% and 20%) than M. gilvus which had a relatively narrow moisture preference (only 20%). These results explain why M. carbonarius can tolerate desiccation stress for a longer period foraging above-ground in the open air; while M. gilvus only forages below ground or concealed within foraging mud tubes.",

The lipids of the SC are structured in the intercellular spaces of the mammalian epidermis in ordered layers, called lamellae, which have been postulated to prevent water loss. Lipids in the mammalian SC are mainly cholesterol, free fatty acids and ceramides, the latter forming the structural support for the lamellae. However, knowledge on how the lipid composition of the SC alters cutaneous water loss (CWL) in mammals is rudimentary, and is largely derived from studies on laboratory animals and humans. We measured CWL of individuals of two species of syntopic bats, Tadarida brasiliensis and Myotis velifer. In the first study of its kind on wild mammals, we correlated CWL with the lipid composition of the SC, measured using thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry. Surface-specific CWL was 20.6% higher in M. velifer than in T. brasiliensis, although differences were not significant. Compared with individuals of M. velifer, individuals of T. brasiliensis had more classes, and a higher proportion, of polar ceramides in the SC, a feature associated with lower CWL. Individuals of T. brasiliensis also had a class of non-polar ceramides that presumably spans the lamellae and gives more cohesiveness to the lipid matrix of the SC. We conclude that qualitative and quantitative modifications of the lipid composition of the SC contribute to regulate CWL of these two species of bats.",

     "abstract": "Feral goats (Capra hircus) are ubiquitous across much of Australia's arid and semi-arid rangelands, where they compete with domestic stock, contribute to grazing pressure on fragile ecosystems, and have been implicated in the decline of several native marsupial herbivores. Understanding the success of feral goats in Australia may provide insights into management strategies for this and other invasive herbivores. It has been suggested that frugal use of energy and water contributes to the success of feral goats in Australia, but data on the energy and water use of free-ranging animals are lacking. We measured the field metabolic rate and water turnover rate of pregnant and non-pregnant feral goats in an Australian rangeland during late summer (dry season). Field metabolic rate of pregnant goats (601\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a00.73\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01) was 1.3 times that of non-pregnant goats (456\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0kJ\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a00.73\u00a0d\u2212\u00a01).

There was no significant difference in estimated dry matter digestibility between pregnant and non-pregnant goats (mean ca. 58%), blood or urine osmolality, or urine electrolyte concentrations, indicating they were probably eating similar diets and were able to maintain osmohomeostasis. Overall, the metabolic and hygric physiology of non-pregnant goats conformed statistically to the predictions for non-marine, non-reproductive placental mammals according to both conventional and phylogenetically independent analyses. That was despite the field metabolic rate and estimated dry matter intake of non-pregnant goats being only 60% of the predicted level. We suggest that general allometric analyses predict the range of adaptive possibilities for mammals, but that specific adaptations, as present in goats, result in ecologically significant departures from the average allometric curve. In the case of goats in the arid Australian rangelands, predictions from the allometric regression would overestimate their grazing pressure by about 40% with implications for the predicted impact on their local ecology.",

We use conventional regression and phylogenetically independent contrasts to evaluate whether trait diversity is correlated with gravitational habitat related to evolutionary transitions within the composite tree topology. We demonstrate that snake species living in arboreal habitats, or which express strongly climbing behaviors, possess relatively short blood columns between the heart and the head, as well as relatively short vascular lungs, compared to terrestrial species. Aquatic species, which experience little or no gravity stress in water, show the reverse \u2014 significantly longer heart\u2013head distance and longer vascular lungs.

     "abstract": "The capacity of the digestive tract is an important parameter in understanding digestive adaptations, particularly in herbivores. Measures of this capacity (\u2018gut fill\u2019) are commonly performed in killed animals, which has ethical and logistical implications. Alternatively, dry matter gut contents (DMC) can be estimated in live animals from food intake, digesta retention and digestibility, based on physical principles (Holleman and White, Can. J. Zool. 67, 488\u2013494, 1989). Although this method has been used to some extent, it still awaits thorough validation. Here we estimated DMC in seven tammar wallabies during 5-day feeding trials and compared the results to those gained from dissections immediately after the trials. Calculated DMC exceeded that actually measured by 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022%. A closer inspection of the data suggested that this was partly due to the fact that DMC as measured by dissection is susceptible to short-term influences such as daily variation in food intake, whereas the calculated DMC represents an integrative measure over the whole period of the feeding trial. Correlations between both the measured digesta retention times, and the calculated DMC, with the measured wet contents mass suggest that it is particularly the DMC determined via dissection that needs to be measured with care. For a comparison of gut capacities, the calculated DMC therefore can be considered adequate, but should for a more widespread use be validated in further studies including more species and experimental regimes controlling food intake variation. Additionally, we tested whether very small (100\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm) and small (500\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcm) particles were retained differently in the tammar wallabies. There was no indication of such a difference. Whether the macropod forestomach selectively passes a certain particle fraction (that represents microbes) with the generally faster-passing fluids remains to be investigated with even smaller markers, e.g. labelled bacteria.",

Among the different intestinal segments, the duodenum showed significant and highest active Ca2\u00a0+ absorption. The findings from RT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggest that the epithelial Ca2\u00a0+ channel TRPV6, the cytosolic calcium binding protein calbindin-D9K and the plasma membrane calcium ATPase PMCA may be involved in active transcellular Ca2\u00a0+ transport. Regarding the Pi transport, the results indicate significant active Pi secretion in the jejunum, but the contributing mechanisms remain unclear. A significant inhibiting effect of ouabain as an antagonist of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase on the serosal-to-mucosal Pi transport suggests a pivotal role of Na+ in jejunal Pi transport in the horse.",

     "abstract": "House mice (genus Mus) harbor extensive allelic variation at two tandemly duplicated genes that encode the \u03b2-chain subunits of adult hemoglobin (Hb). Alternative haplotypes differ in the level of sequence divergence between the two \u03b2-globin gene duplicates: the Hbbd and Hbbp haplotypes harbor two structurally distinct \u03b2-globin genes, whereas the Hbbs haplotype harbors two \u03b2-globin duplicates that are identical in sequence. One especially salient difference between the s-type Hbs relative to the d- and p-type Hbs relates to the number of reactive \u03b2-chain cysteine residues. In addition to the highly conserved cysteine residue at \u03b293, the d- and p-type Hbs contain an additional reactive cysteine residue at \u03b213. To assess the functional consequences of allelic variation in \u03b2-globin cysteine content, we measured O2-binding properties and H2O2-induced oxidation rates of mono- and dicysteinyl \u03b2-Hbs from 4 different inbred strains of mice: C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, MSM/Ms, and CAROLI/EiJ. The experiments revealed that purified Hbs from the various mouse strains did not exhibit substantial variation in O2-binding properties, but s-type Hb (which contains a single reactive \u03b2-chain cysteine residue) was far more readily oxidized to Fe3\u00a0+ metHb by H2O2 than other mouse Hbs that contain two reactive \u03b2-chain cysteine residues. These results suggest that the possession of an additional reactive cysteine residue may protect against metHb formation under oxidizing conditions. The allelic differences in \u03b2-globin cysteine content could affect aspects of redox signaling and oxidative/nitrosative stress responses that are mediated by Hb-S-nitrosylation and Hb-S-glutathionylation pathways.",

The core protein is divided into extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The cytoplasmic domain has two conserved regions and a variable region in the middle. The Ser residue in the conserved region 1 and the Tyr residue in the variable region are important in regulating protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1) membrane localization and focal adhesion formation. The objective of the current study was to investigate the role of syndecan-4 Ser and Tyr residues in combination with the GAG and N-glycosylated chains in turkey satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) responsiveness, and PKC\u03b1 membrane localization. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate Ser and Tyr mutants with or without GAG and N-glycosylated chains. The wild type and mutant syndecan-4 constructs were transfected into turkey satellite cells. The over-expression of Ser and Tyr mutants increased cell proliferation and differentiation and decreased membrane localization of PKC\u03b1. Furthermore, Ser mutants enhanced cellular responsiveness to FGF2. The results from this study are the first demonstration of a role of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain Ser and Tyr residues in regulating satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and the modulation of cellular responsiveness to FGF2.",

     "abstract": "Hummingbirds represent an end point for small body size and water flux in vertebrates. We explored the role evaporative water loss (EWL) plays in management of their large water pool and its use in dissipating metabolic heat. We measured respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL) in hovering hummingbirds in the field (6 species) and over a range of speeds in a wind tunnel (1 species) using an open-circuit mask respirometry system. Hovering REWL during the active period was positively correlated with operative temperature (Te) likely due to some combination of an increase in the vapor-pressure deficit, increase in lung ventilation rate, and reduced importance of dry heat transfer at higher Te. In rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus; 3.3\u00a0g) REWL during forward flight at 6 and 10\u00a0m/s was less than half the value for hovering. The proportion of total dissipated heat (TDH) accounted for by REWL during hovering at Te\u00a0>\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C was <\u00a040% in most species. During forward flight in S. rufus the proportion of TDH accounted for by REWL was ~\u00a035% less than for hovering. REWL in hummingbirds is a relatively small component of the water budget compared with other bird species (<\u00a020%) so cutaneous evaporative water loss and dry heat transfer must contribute significantly to thermal balance in hummingbirds.",

The model allows a quantification of the functional proficiency of myoglobin (Mb) mutants under various physiological conditions, i.e. O2-consumption rate resembling workload, O2 partial pressure resembling hypoxic stress, muscle cell size, and Mb concentration, resembling different organism-specific and compensatory variables. We find that O2-storage and -transport are distinct functions that rank mutants and wild type differently depending on O2 partial pressure. Specifically, the wild type is near-optimal for storage at all conditions, but for transport only at severely hypoxic conditions. At normoxic conditions, low-affinity mutants are in fact better O2-transporters because they still have empty sites for O2, giving rise to a larger [MbO2] gradient (more varying saturation curve). The distributions of functionality reveal that many mutants are near-neutral with respect to function, whereas only a few are strongly affected, and the variation in functionality increases dramatically at lower O2 pressure. These results together show that conserved residues in wild type (WT) Mb were fixated under a selection pressure of low PO2.",

Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) juveniles (24.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0g wet mass) were weekly subjected to an acute handling stressor (HDLG) or remained undisturbed (CTL). Additionally, both treatments were fed a control or a high protein (HP) diet (CTL, CTL HP, HDLG and HDLG HP). The HP diet slightly increased the levels of digestible indispensable AA, together with tyrosine and cysteine. Repeated handling induced a stress response after 14 and 28\u00a0days in fish held at both HDLG and HDLG HP treatments. While dietary treatment and handling stress activated the serotonergic system at 14\u00a0days, these effects were not observed after 28\u00a0days. In addition, the HP diet minimized the decrease in plasma indispensable AA due to repeated handling stress after 28\u00a0days. It was concluded that HP diet decreased post-stress plasma glucose and lactate levels in HDLG HP specimens only at 14\u00a0days of treatment. Moreover, dietary treatment was also effective in stimulating DA synthesis and release, thus dietary phenylalanine supplementation can increase DA biosynthesis in fish.",

Stripped colonic tissue from both the dogfish and ratfish was mounted in an Ussing chamber and in both species bi-directional urea flux was found to be negligible. Urea uptake by the mucosa and serosa of the isolated colonic epithelium through accumulation of 14C-urea was determined to be 2.8 and 6.2 fold greater in the mucosa of the dogfish compared to the serosa of the dogfish and the mucosa of the ratfish respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference between serosal and mucosal accumulation of 14C-urea in the ratfish. Through the addition of 2\u00a0mM NH4Cl to the mucosal side of each preparation the potential for ammonia flux was also examined. This was again found to be negligible in both species suggesting that the colon is an extremely tight epithelium to the movement of both urea and ammonia. Plasma, chyme and bile fluid samples were also taken from the agastric ratfish and were compared with solute concentrations of equivalent body fluids in the dogfish. Finally molecular analysis revealed expression of 3 isoforms of the urea transport protein (UT) and an ammonia transport protein (Rhbg) in the gill, intestine, kidney and colon of the ratfish. Partial nucleotide sequences of the UT-1, 2 and 3 isoforms in the ratfish had 95, 95 and 92% identity to the equivalent UT isoforms recently identified in another holocephalan, the elephantfish, Callorhinchus milii. Finally, the nucleotide sequence of the Rhbg identified in the ratfish had 73% identity to the Rhbg protein recently identified in the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea.",

Research on Artemia POU homeobox gene function will enhance our understanding of the physiological and developmental processes of POU homeobox gene in animals. Herein, a full-length cDNA encoding an Artemia POU homeobox protein gene 1 (APH-1) from Artemia sinica (designated as As-APH-1) was cloned and characterized by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) method. The As-APH-1 gene encoded a protein of 388 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 42.85\u00a0kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.90 and the protein belongs to the POU III family. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that A. sinica As-APH-1 protein sequence shared a conserved POU homeobox domain with other species. The early and persistent expression of As-APH-1 in the naupliar stages by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and whole-mount embryonic immunohistochemistry suggest that As-APH-1 functions very early in the salt gland and may be required continuously in this organ. Later in development, expression of As-APH-1 begins to dramatically decrease and disappear in salt gland of the sub-adult Artemia. In addition, we also discovered that As-APH-1 increased obviously as the salinity increased, indicating that As-APH-1 might be used as a good indicator of salinity stress. In summary, we are the first to identify the As-APH-1 gene and to determine its gene expression patterns in early embryogenesis stages and in different salinity stress in brine shrimp, A. sinica. The result of expression of As-APH-1 affected by salinity changes will provide us further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of osmoregulation in Artemia early embryonic development.",

Using both RT-PCR and immunoblotting approaches, we showed that NKCC and CFTR are expressed, both in proximal tubule primary cultures and in a proximal tubule fraction of non-cultured (native tissue) fragments. We also used electrophysiological methods to assess the functional contribution of NKCC and CFTR to forskolin-activated ISC responses in filter grown cultured monolayers. Bumetanide (10\u00a0\u03bcM), a specific blocker of NKCC, inhibited forskolin activated ISC by about 40%, suggesting that basolateral uptake of Cl\u2212 is partially mediated by NKCC transport. In monolayers permeabilized on the basolateral side with nystatin, forskolin activated an apical Cl\u2212 conductance, manifested as bidirectional diffusion currents in the presence of oppositely directed Cl\u2212 gradients. Under these conditions the apical conductance appeared to show some bias towards apical-to-basolateral Cl\u2212 current. Two selective CFTR blockers, CFTR Inhibitor 172 and GlyH-101 (both at 20\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibited the forskolin activated diffusion currents by 38\u201368%, with GlyH-101 having a greater effect.

How this regulatory response affects whole animal metabolic rate is unknown. Accordingly, we characterized oxygen consumption rate ( M \u02d9 O 2 ) and metabolically-relevant organismal and cellular responses in white sturgeon during exposure to hypercarbia. White sturgeon were able to protect intracellular pH (pHi) in liver and white muscle as early as 6\u00a0h (the earliest time period investigated) following exposure to severe (sub-lethal) hypercarbia (45 and 90\u00a0mmHg PCO2). Sturgeon exposed to 15 and 30\u00a0mmHg PCO2 exhibited pHe compensation and significant increases in M \u02d9 O 2 (up to 80% greater than control values). In contrast, severe hypercarbia (\u2265\u00a045\u00a0mmHg PCO2) elicited an uncompensated reduction in pHe (up to ~\u00a01.0 pH units) and red blood cells (as great as ~\u00a00.5 pH units), and was accompanied by 30 and 60% reductions in M \u02d9 O 2 , respectively. While behavioral, respiratory and cellular responses to hypercarbia were observed, none corresponded well with the pattern or magnitude of changes in M \u02d9 O 2 . The findings of this research provide empirical support for the hypothesis that preferential pHi regulation is not metabolically costly, and thus may have been a strategy strongly selected for in fishes encountering short-term hypercarbia.",

Females had higher thyroid hormone levels than males throughout fasting and showed a reduction in cortisol midway through the fast that was not seen in males. This may reflect sex-specific fuel allocation or development. Neither handling frequency nor cumulative contact time affected plasma cortisol or thyroid hormone levels, the rate of increase in cortisol over the first five minutes of physical contact or the pattern of mass loss during fasting in either sex.

Therefore, we investigated lizard caudal biochemical content before and after regeneration in three gecko and one skink species. Specifically, we integrated biochemical and morphological analyses to quantify protein and lipid content in original and regenerated tails. All lizards lost significant body mass, mostly protein, due to autotomy and biochemical results indicated that original tails of all species contained a greater proportion of protein than lipid.

Although troglitazone alone (1\u00a0\u03bcM) did not stimulate lipid accumulation in the cells neither in growth nor in differentiation medium, the simultaneous presence of troglitazone (1\u00a0\u03bcM) and insulin (1\u00a0\u03bcM) increased significantly the content of triglycerides in adipocyte cells maintained in growth medium (days 7 to 12). These results indicate that insulin and troglitazone regulate LPL gene expression during adipocyte differentiation and suggest that both factors may have combined effects in the modulation of adipogenesis.",

These syntopic species have similar ecologies and morphologies and thus potential for large overlaps in diet and habitat use. Unexpectedly, they displayed different Tb patterns. Western rock elephant shrews were heterothermic, with all individuals decreasing Tb below 30\u00a0\u00b0C on at least 34% of nights. The level of heterothermy expressed was similar to other species traditionally defined as daily heterotherms and was inversely related to Ta, as is commonly seen in small heterothermic endotherms. In contrast, Cape rock elephant shrews rarely allowed their Tb to decrease below 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The level of heterothermy was similar to species traditionally defined as homeotherms and there was no relationship between the level of heterothermy expressed and Ta. In both species, the minimum daily Tb was recorded almost exclusively at night, often shortly before sunrise, although in some individuals minimum Tb occasionally occurred during the day. The interspecific variation in Tb patterns among Elephantulus species recorded to date reiterates the importance of ecological determinants of heterothermy that interact with factors such as body mass and phylogeny.",

D2 mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus is affected by photoperiod, which influences reproductive processes in temperate birds and mammals. We examined whether D2 mRNA is expressed in the hypothalamus (located in the forebrain within the diencephalon area) and whether its abundance is affected by day length, temperature, or food availability in the tropical spinefoot, Siganus guttatus, which is endemic to tropical monsoon areas. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that D2 mRNA is expressed in various brain regions. The abundance of hypothalamic D2 mRNA was higher at 12.00\u00a0h than at 06.00\u00a0h or 24.00\u00a0h. Rearing fish under constant dark conditions resulted in a decrease in D2 mRNA abundance during the subjective night. A single injection of melatonin lowered D2 mRNA abundance within 3\u00a0h. Collectively, it appears that hypothalamic D2 mRNA abundance is regulated by the circadian system and/or melatonin. No differences in D2 mRNA abundance were observed, when fish were reared at 20, 25, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C. However, food deprivation stimulated D2 mRNA expression during the daytime. These results suggest that photoperiodic and nutritive conditions affect hypothalamic D2 mRNA expression in S. guttatus.",

We looked for sources of variation of nutritional biochemical parameters (i.e. triglycerides, cholesterol, uric acid and urea) of both nestlings and adults. Reference values indicated that, as a rule, lesser kestrel showed more elevated triglycerides, urea and uric acid levels than other raptors. All analyzed factors except gender (i.e. year, colony, sampling time, presence/absence of a geolocator, body mass, laying date and capture date) reached significance for at least one biochemical parameter. In the morning, we found an important postprandial increase in the concentration of all biochemical parameters in nestlings, and uric acid and urea levels in adults. A positive relationship was detected between triglycerides and body mass in nestlings and adults. Although we did not find differences between blood biochemical parameters of the oldest and youngest chick of each brood, we found that cholesterol levels were lower in nestlings from larger broods. Coloration of tarsi (measured as brightness) was related to triglycerides and urea levels of nestlings and adults, respectively. The feeding habits of lesser kestrel probably explain the different levels and patterns of variation of metabolites in comparison to more carnivorous raptors eating mammals or birds.",

     "abstract": "In humans and other vertebrates, mental or physical stressors may trigger a variety of symptoms generally referred to as the fight/flight response (Cannon 1929). The processes also include variability of the heart frequency as well as leukocytosis. We monitored both body responses in disturbed hibernating vineyard snails, H. pomatia, to obtain information on the stress sensitivity of these \u201csleeping\u201d invertebrates. The first mild stressor, a 100\u00a0meter transport of hibernating snails from the cold room to the laboratory, caused cardiac arrhythmia in the animals. This reaction could have been provoked by mechanical disturbances and/or by raising the body temperature to room temperature. But a change in the ambient temperature did not trigger an abnormal heart rhythm. Different from this observation, we recorded instant heart rate changes in response to knocking on the shell and a very irregular heartbeat occurred when a hole was punched in the shell. With a short time delay upon damaging the shell, a large increase in the number of circulating cells also occurred. This was not observed after knocking on the shell or when snails were adapted to different temperatures for each 48\u00a0h. Thus, hibernating snails sense environmental variations which cause an immediate change of the heart frequency and an elevated stimulus level initiates in addition leukocytosis which occurs at a post-stimulus latency. This disparity could indicate the activity of two different stress regulation pathways.Furthermore, the assays demonstrate an increasing linear relation between rising temperature and frequency of heart pulsations (y\u00a0=\u00a01.01x\u00a0\u2212\u00a02.1); but the results do not indicate a correlation between heartbeat frequency and the number of cells in circulation.

In this study we examined the expression profiles in vitro as well as in vivo of the IGF-I gene of fish Danio rerio (vertebrate) and the IGF-like gene (IGFl) of amphioxus Branchiostoma japonicum (protochordate) following T3 treatment. Our results showed that T3 was able to enhance hepatic IGF-I/IGFl gene expression in vitro in both zebrafish and amphioxus in a dose-dependent manner. This T3-induced hepatic expression of IGF-I/IGFl genes in both species was significantly inhibited by the T3-specific inhibitor DEA, indicating the specificity of IGF-I/IGFl gene regulation by T3. At 100\u00a0nM T3, in both the long (42\u00a0h) and short (8\u00a0h) time course experiments, the IGF-I/IGFl gene expression profiles following T3 treatment in the tissue cultures of both species exhibited closely similar pattern and trend. Moreover, exposure of zebrafish and amphioxus to T3in vivo for 72\u00a0h induced a significant increase in the expression of IGF-I/IGFl genes in both the liver and the hepatic caecum. These data together suggest that amphioxus and zebrafish both share a similar regulatory mechanism of IGF gene expression in response to T3, providing an evidence for the presence of a vertebrate-like TH/IGF signaling pathway in the protochordate amphioxus.",

     "abstract": "Megachile rotundata (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), the primary pollinator used in alfalfa seed production, may need to be exposed to low-temperature storage to slow the insects' development to better match spring emergence with the alfalfa bloom. It has been demonstrated that using a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) improves the tolerance of pupae to low temperatures. Carbon dioxide emission rates were compared between four different FTRs, all with a base temperature of 6\u00a0\u00b0C and a daily high-temperature pulse. Four different high-temperature pulses were examined, 15 or 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h and 20\u00a0\u00b0C for 1 or 2\u00a0h. A subset of pupae at the FTR base temperature of 6\u00a0\u00b0C exhibited continuous gas exchange and, once ramped to 20 or 25\u00a0\u00b0C, shifted to cyclic gas exchange. As temperatures were ramped down from the high-temperature pulse to 6\u00a0\u00b0C, the pupae reverted to continuous gas exchange. The following conclusions about the effect of FTR on the CO2 emissions of M. rotundata pupae exposed to low-temperature storage during the spring incubation were reached: 1) the high temperature component of the FTR was the best predictor of respiratory pattern; 2) neither pupal body mass nor days in FTR significantly affected which respiratory pattern was expressed during FTRs; 3) cyclic gas exchange was induced only in pupae exposed to temperatures greater than 15\u00a0\u00b0C during the FTR high temperature pulse; and 4) a two hour pulse at 25\u00a0\u00b0C doubled the number of CO2 peaks observed during the FTR pulse as compared to a two hour pulse at 20\u00a0\u00b0C.",

Previous studies suggest that red light is more effective than green and blue lights for inducing ovarian development.

The present study aimed to clone the red-light-sensitive cone opsin (sdLWS) of this species, to demonstrate its expression in the brain, and to confirm the effectiveness of red light on the initiation of ovarian development. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that sdLWS belongs to the long-wavelength-sensitive opsin (LWS opsin) group, showing high identity (77\u201392%) with the LWS opsin of other fishes. RT-PCR showed that sdLWS is expressed in the eye, brain, and ovary. In situ hybridization indicated that sdLWS is expressed in the third ventricle periventricular area in the anterior hypothalamus. Exposing fish to long-day conditions of red light resulted in the appearance of vitellogenic oocytes in the ovary and an increase in the gonadosomatic index within 2\u00a0weeks, suggesting that fish immediately undergo oocyte development under red light conditions. These results indicate that sdLWS is a possible candidate of deep brain photoreceptor molecule involved in photoperiodic ovarian development in the sapphire devil.",

Retention time impacts digestive efficiency and among herbivores affects plant\u2013animal interactions including herbivory and seed dispersal. Poorly studied yet iconic Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises are large-bodied generalist herbivores and ecosystem engineers which migrate seasonally. Potentially variable digesta retention times due to strong seasonal and altitudinal temperature gradients may influence tortoise seed dispersal abilities and rates of herbivory. We fed captive adult tortoises living in semi-natural conditions on Gal\u00e1pagos with inert particles and seeds from locally available fruits to determine whether seed size and ambient temperature influenced retention time. Median retention time varied from 6 to 28\u00a0days, with a mode of 12\u00a0days. Seed size had no effect on any of our measures of retention time, but ambient temperature was inversely correlated with retention times. Long retention time facilitates long distance seed dispersal by Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises, which may improve effectiveness. The effect of temperature, which may double from hot lowlands to cold highlands through the seasonal cycle, on tortoise digesta retention time will strongly influence seed dispersal efficiency and may influence patterns of food selection and migration in this species.",

Bullfrog tadpoles have large fat bodies throughout their long larval life. Fat bodies increase in absolute weight, and weight relative to body mass, during late stages of prometamorphosis, peaking just before climax, and then decreasing, especially during the latter stages of transformation into the froglet. The climax decrease is accompanied by a reduction in size of adipocytes and a change in histology of the fat body such that interstitial tissue becomes more prominent. Food deprivation for a month during early prometamorphosis significantly decreased fat body weight and adipocyte size but did not affect the rate of development. However, food restriction just before climax retarded development, suggesting that the increased nutrient storage in the fat body before climax is necessary for metamorphic progress. Melatonin, which might be involved in the regulation of seasonal changes in fat stores, stayed approximately at the same level during most of larval life, but increased sharply in the fat body during the late stages of climax. The findings show that the rate of development of these tadpoles is not affected by starvation during larval life as long as they can utilize fat body stores for nourishment. They also suggest that the build up of fat body stores just before climax is necessary for progress during the climax period when feeding stops.",

     "abstract": "Reproductive effort has been defined as the proportion of an organism's energy budget that is allocated to reproduction over a biologically meaningful time period. Historically, studies of reproductive bioenergetics considered energy content of gametes, but not costs of gamete production. Although metabolic costs of vitellogenesis (MCV) fundamentally reflect the primary bioenergetic cost of reproductive allocation in female reptiles, the few investigations that have considered costs of reproductive allocation have focused on metabolic costs of pregnancy (MCP) in viviparous species. We define MCP as energetic costs incurred by pregnant females, including all costs of maintaining gestation conditions necessary for embryogenesis. MCP by our definition do not include fetal costs of embryogenesis. We measured metabolic rates in five species of viviparous snakes (Agkistrodon contortrix, Boa constrictor, Eryx colubrinus, Nerodia sipedon, and Thamnophis sirtalis) during vitellogenesis and pregnancy in order to estimate MCV and MCP. Across all species, MCV were responsible for 30% increases in maternal metabolism. Phylogenetically-independent contrasts showed that MCV were significantly greater in B. constrictor than in other species, likely because B. constrictor yolk energy content was greater than that of other species. Estimates of MCP were not significantly different from zero in any species. In viviparous snakes, MCV appear to represent significant bioenergetic expenditures, while MCP do not. We suggest that MCV, together with yolk energy content, represent the most significant component of reptilian reproductive effort, and therefore deserve greater attention than MCP in studies of reptilian reproductive bioenergetics.",

     "abstract": "Extensive use of fossil fuels is leading to increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and causes changes in the carbonate chemistry of the oceans which represents a major sink for anthropogenic CO2. As a result, the oceans' surface pH is expected to decrease by ca. 0.4 units by the year 2100, a major change with potentially negative consequences for some marine species. Because of their carbonate skeleton, sea urchins and their larval stages are regarded as likely to be one of the more sensitive taxa. In order to investigate sensitivity of pre-feeding (2\u00a0days post-fertilization) and feeding (4 and 7\u00a0days post-fertilization) pluteus larvae, we raised Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryos in control (pH 8.1 and pCO2 41\u00a0Pa e.g. 399\u00a0\u03bcatm) and CO2 acidified seawater with pH of 7.7 (pCO2 134\u00a0Pa e.g. 1318\u00a0\u03bcatm) and investigated growth, calcification and survival. At three time points (day 2, day 4 and day 7 post-fertilization), we measured the expression of 26 representative genes important for metabolism, calcification and ion regulation using RT-qPCR.After one week of development, we observed a significant difference in growth. Maximum differences in size were detected at day 4 (ca. 10% reduction in body length). A comparison of gene expression patterns using PCA and ANOSIM clearly distinguished between the different age groups (two-way ANOSIM: Global R\u00a0=\u00a01) while acidification effects were less pronounced (Global R\u00a0=\u00a00.518). Significant differences in gene expression patterns (ANOSIM R\u00a0=\u00a00.938, SIMPER: 4.3% difference) were also detected at day 4 leading to the hypothesis that differences between CO2 treatments could reflect patterns of expression seen in control experiments of a younger larva and thus a developmental artifact rather than a direct CO2 effect. We found an up regulation of metabolic genes (between 10%and 20% in ATP-synthase, citrate synthase, pyruvate kinase and thiolase at day 4) and down regulation of calcification related genes (between 23% and 36% in msp130, SM30B, and SM50 at day 4). Ion regulation was mainly impacted by up regulation of Na+/K+-ATPase at day 4 (15%) and down regulation of NHE3 at day 4 (45%). We conclude that in studies in which a stressor induces an alteration in the speed of development, it is crucial to employ experimental designs with a high time resolution in order to correct for developmental artifacts. This helps prevent misinterpretation of stressor effects on organism physiology.",

Growth and development was assessed by measuring total body length, body rod length, postoral rod length and posterolateral rod length. Comparing these parameters between treatments suggests that larvae suffer from a developmental delay (by ca. 8%) rather than from the previously postulated reductions in size at comparable developmental stages. Further, we found maximum increases in respiration rates of +\u00a0100% under elevated pCO2, while body length corrected feeding rates did not differ between larvae from both treatments. Calculating scope for growth illustrates that larvae raised under high pCO2 spent an average of 39 to 45% of the available energy for somatic growth, while control larvae could allocate between 78 and 80% of the available energy into growth processes.

For both fed and fasted fish, gluconeogenesis accounted for 98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% of the glucose that was produced during the 72-h 2H2O administration period. For fasted fish, gluconeogenic contributions measured after 6\u00a0h were identical to 72-h values (94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%). For fed fish, the apparent gluconeogenic contribution at 6-h was significantly lower compared to 72-h (79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% versus 98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This may reflect a brief augmentation of gluconeogenic flux by glycogenolysis after feeding and/or selective enrichment of plasma glucose position 2 via futile glucose-glucose-6-phosphate cycling.",

Active animals had moderate lymph osmolality (252\u00a0mOsm\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01), but urea concentrations remained low. Urine was highly variable in active frogs, suggesting that they tolerate variation in hydration state. Despite prolonged periods in dry soil, osmolality increase in C. australis was not severe. Aestivation in a cocoon facilitates survival in shallow burrows, but such a strategy may only be effective in environments with seasonally reliable rainfall.",

     "abstract": "The relation between body mass (BM) and digesta mean retention time (MRT) in herbivores was the focus of several studies in recent years. It was assumed that MRT scaled with BM0.25 based on the isometric scaling of gut capacity (BM1.0) and allometric scaling of energy intake (BM0.75). Literature studies that tested this hypothesis produced conflicting results, arriving sometimes at higher or lower exponents than the postulated 0.25. This study was conducted with 8 ruminants (n\u00a0=\u00a02\u20136 per species) and 6 hindgut fermenting species/breeds (n\u00a0=\u00a02\u20136, warthog n\u00a0=\u00a01) with a BM range of 60\u20134000\u00a0kg. All animals received a ration of 100% grass hay with ad libitum access. Dry matter intake was measured and the MRT was estimated by the use of a solute and a particle (1\u20132\u00a0mm) marker. No significant scaling of MRTparticle with BM was observed for all herbivores (32 BM0.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.518) and hindgut fermenters (32 BM0.00, p\u00a0=\u00a01.00). The scaling exponent for ruminants only showed a tendency towards significance (29 BM0.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.071). Ruminants on average had an MRTparticle 1.61-fold longer than hindgut fermenters. Whereas an exponent of 0.25 is reasonable from theoretical considerations, much lower exponents were found in this and other studies. The energetic benefit of increasing MRT is by no means continuous, since the energy released from a given food unit via digestion decreases over time. The low and non-significant scaling factors for both digestion types suggest that in ungulates, MRT is less influenced by BM (maximal allometric exponent\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.1) than often reported.",

Principal component analysis of enzymes detected by the API ZYM system for 19 enzymes plus EnzChek assays for protease, \u03b1-amylase, lipase, cellulase, and lysozyme identify four distinct regions of the gut: 1) crystalline style and style sac, 2) digestive gland, 3) salivary glands, and 4) esophagus and intestine. Heterogeneity in enzymatic activity was observed in regions of the gut with similar cell morphology (middle and posterior esophagus and intestine) as well as regions with different cell morphology (salivary glands, digestive gland and crystalline style). Enzyme activity in each of these regions is compared to other gastropods, in particular the abalone. Although much of the length of the digestive tract is lined by a morphologically similar epithelium, different regions of the alimentary tract produce a different suite of enzymes which may contribute to the digestive process. These data will help enhance our limited understanding of the digestive physiology of Megathura crenulata and lead to improvement of its culture for clinical research.",

Although all birds increased weight during the Food Restriction period, only non-molting birds increased food intake. Morning baseline heart rates increased during the Food Restriction period and all birds showed a decrease in heart rate when food was absent from the cage. In non-molting birds, there were no differences in either baseline or stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) concentrations, whereas molting birds showed attenuated baseline CORT, stress-induced CORT, and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels over the Food Restriction period. Although several parameters, such as increased morning heart rate, are consistent with chronic stress, the majority of these data suggest that restricting food availability is not chronically stressful. Furthermore, making the timing of food removal less predictable by randomizing when food was removed during the day did not enhance any of the above responses, but did alter the frequency of maintenance and feeding behaviors.

Here, we compare the morphology and molecular biology of specialized salt-secreting glands from a marine snake (Laticauda semifasciata) with the cephalic glands from semi-marine (Nerodia clarkii clarkii) and freshwater (N. fasciata) watersnakes to look for evidence of a salt gland in the former and to develop hypotheses about the evolution of snake salt glands. Like the salt gland of L. semifasciata, the nasal and anterior/posterior sublingual glands in both species of Nerodia exhibit a compound tubular shape, and express basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212cotransporter (NKCC); however, the abundance of NKA and NKCC in N. fasciata appears lower than in N. c. clarkii. Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is also basolateral in the sublingual glands of both species of Nerodia, as is abundant neutral mucin; both AQP3 and mucin are absent from the salt gland in L. semifasciata. Thus, we propose that the evolution of the snake salt gland by co-option of an existing gland involved at least two steps: (i) an increase in the abundance of NKA and NKCC in the basolateral membranes of the secretory epithelia, and (ii) loss of AQP3/mucus secretion from these epithelia.",

However, adrenergic tone originates entirely from circulating catecholamines and is not altered by chronic hypoxic incubation, as neither cholinergic blockade with atropine nor ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium altered baseline cardiovascular variables in N21 or H10 embryos. In addition, both atropine and hexamethonium injection did not alter the generally depressive effects of acute hypoxia \u2014 bradycardia and hypotension. However, H10 embryos showed significantly higher levels of noradrenaline and adrenaline at 70% of development, as well as higher noradrenaline at 80% of development, suggesting that circulating catecholamines reach maximal levels earlier in incubation for H10 embryos, compared to N21 embryos.

The enzymatic activities of digestive amylase, lipase, protease, trypsin and chymotrypsin were determined for each species at the same developmental stage. The results show that H. flaviventris has a greater digestive enzymatic pool and higher relative and absolute protease, lipase and trypsin activities than I. morenica. The latter has a relative higher amylase activity. As higher amylase activity is typical of phytophagous species and higher protease activity typical of carnivorous species; these results reveal that H. flaviventris is a more efficient zoophagous species than I. morenica. The ecological implications of these findings, including the higher secondary production of H. flaviventris in its habitat, are discussed.",

Similar to mammalian brain hemispheres, these invertebrates possess symmetrical pairs of ganglia albeit visceral (only one) ganglion and the parietal ganglia (the right ganglion is bigger than the left one). Furthermore, there are two major regulatory drives into the compartments (pericard, auricle, and ventricle) and cardiomyocytes of the heart. These are the excitatory and inhibitory signals that originate from a few designated neurons and their putative neurotransmitters. Many of these neurons are well-identified, their specific locations within the corresponding ganglion are mapped, and some are termed as either heart excitatory (HE) or inhibitory (HI) cells. The remaining neurons are classified as cardio-regulatory, and their direct and indirect actions on the heart's function have been documented. The cardiovascular anatomy of frequently used experimental animals, Achatina, Aplysia, Helix, and Lymnaea is relatively simple. However, as in humans, it possesses all major components including even trabeculae and atrio-ventricular valves. Since the myocardial cells are enzymatically dispersible, multiple voltage dependent cationic currents in isolated cardiomyocytes are described. The latter include at least the A-type K+, delayed rectifier K+, TTX-sensitive Na+, and L-type Ca2+ channels.",

In addition, we measured oxygen consumption (VO2) at resting conditions. We also performed enzyme assays (sucrase, maltase, trehalase and aminopeptidase N) and measurements of organ morphology. We found that D. gliroides cannot fulfil its nutrient requirements only from insects or fruit. It needs a mixed diet in order to maintain its body mass and energy balance. However, as a response of diet acclimation, individuals showed several-fold changes in the activities of aminopeptidase-N, maltase and sucrase (but not trehalase). This result, both the magnitude of change and the simultaneous effects on three enzymes suggests that D. gliroides could exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the activity of intestinal enzymes.

In mammals, this receptor is already known as a transcriptional factor that regulates diverse aspects of cholesterol, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism in various tissues, including muscle. Here we examined LXR in trout myocytes. For this purpose, we analyzed LXR target gene expression and gene profile during myocyte development. In addition, we studied the transcriptional regulation of LXR by hormones, a pro-inflammatory mediator and unsaturated fatty acids. Trout myocytes were incubated with LXR agonists (T091317, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol) and unsaturated fatty acids for 24\u00a0h. Furthermore, differentiated myocytes were incubated with insulin and growth hormone (GH) for 3\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h and 18\u00a0h, and with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) for 24\u00a0h. Samples were also obtained in various stages of cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 and \u03b2 (PPAR\u03b1, \u03b2) are target genes of LXR in trout muscle. LXR agonists increased LXR expression, thereby indicating that this receptor is autoregulated. Unsaturated fatty acids downregulated LXR gene expression. This observation suggests a regulatory mechanism of these molecules on LXR-mediated fatty acid synthesis and uptake. TNF\u03b1 did not modulate LXR gene transcription. Expression of the LXR gene was activated by insulin and GH. These results suggest that LXR may play a lipogenic role through insulin stimulation and a tendency to promote anabolic effects through GH on trout myocytes.",

Our experimental study evaluated the effect that changes in sugar concentration of nectar have on the foraging behavior of the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in captivity. We measured foraging behavior and food intake when bats fed at different concentrations of sucrose (5, 15, 25 and 35%\u00a0wt/vol.). To compensate for low-energy intake, both bat species reduced their flight time, and increased feeding time when sugar concentration decreased. Our results suggest that nectar-feeding bats in nature confront two scenarios with complementary ecological effects: 1) bats feeding on dilute nectars (i.e. \u2264\u00a015%\u00a0wt/vol.) should increase the number of flowers visited per night enhancing pollination, and 2) bats feeding on concentrated nectars could spend more time flying, including long- and short-distance-flights increasing food patch exploration for use during subsequent nights, and thus enhancing plant gene flow.

We examined HSP levels in the foot tissue of two Sphincterochila species, S. cariosa and S. zonata, before and after laying eggs, and analyzed the albumen gland (reproductive organ) of both species and eggs of S. cariosa for the presence and quantity of various HSPs. Our study shows reduction in the expression level of Hsp70 isoforms and Hsp90 in S. zonata foot and of Hsp74 in S. cariosa foot during the period preceding egg laying compared to the post-reproductive stage. Hsp70 isoforms and Hsp25 were highly expressed in both large albumen glands and in freshly laid eggs of S. cariosa, whereas large albumen glands of S. zonata expressed mainly Hsp70 isoforms. We conclude that a trade-off between survival and fertility is responsible for the expression level of HSPs in the foot tissue of Sphincterochila snails. Our study shows that HSPs are involved in the reproductive process. We propose that parental provision of HSPs may be part of a \u201cbe prepared\u201d strategy of Sphincterochila snails, and that HSPs may play important roles in the survival strategy of land snails during the early life stages. Our observations also highlight the importance of the reproductive status in study of whole organisms, especially when assessing the HSP response to stress.",

     "abstract": "The common killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, has historically been a favorite organism for the study of euryhalinity in teleost fish. Despite the species' large range of salinity tolerance, studies of osmoregulation in high salinity are rare, with most previous studies focused on fish transferred between freshwater and seawater. Similarly, while branchial transport properties have been studied extensively, there are relatively few studies investigating the role of the intestine in osmoregulation in killifish. This study sought to characterize the fluid and ion transport occurring in the intestinal tract of killifish adapted to seawater, and furthermore to investigate the adjustments that occur to these mechanisms following acute transfer to high salinity (70\u00a0ppt). In vivo samples of blood plasma and intestinal fluids of seawater-acclimated killifish indicated absorption of Na+, Cl\u2212, and water, the relative impermeability of the intestine to Mg2+ and SO42\u2212, and active secretion of HCO3\u2212 into the intestinal lumen. The details of these processes were investigated further using in vitro techniques of isolated intestinal sac preparations and an Ussing chamber pH-stat titration system. However, these methods were discovered to be of limited utility under physiologically relevant conditions due to tissue deterioration. Results that could be validly interpreted suggested that there are few changes to intestinal transport following transfer to high salinity, and that adjustments to epithelial permeability occur in the first 24\u00a0h post-transfer.",

Sperm motility was activated at hypoosmolality relative to seminal plasma and suppressed at 175 mOsmol kg\u2212\u00a01. Sperm activation was totally suppressed by 0.35\u00a0mM K+, but Ca2+ could fully reverse K+ inhibitory effect at Ca2+: K+ ratio of 0.25. Neither EGTA (a chelator of Ca2+ ions) nor nifedipine (a Ca2+ channel blocker) prevented sperm activation. But, sperm motility and velocity were significantly decreased by EGTA, nifedipine and an inhibitor for Ca2+/calmodulin activated phosphodiesterase (w-7) that suggest role of Ca2+ signaling after triggering sperm activation through hypoosmolality. Symmetric flagellar beating was also turned to asymmetric after activation in w-7, which is an evidence for modulation of Ca2+-binding proteins activity. Sturgeon sperm, similar to salmonids, is immotile in seminal plasma due to high K+ concentrations, but the mechanism of sperm activation seems to be closer to other fish species where osmolality prohibits sperm activation in seminal plasma. In these species, hypoosmolality is the primary signal for sperm Ca2+-dependent signaling of axonemal beating.",

Intralymphatic sac injection of arginine vasotocin (AVT) decreased the uptake of GFP in hydrated frogs. A high negative correlation between the AVT dose and the uptake of GFP was revealed. The effect of AVT was inhibited by a V1-receptor antagonist. A noted decrease in the average number of fluorescent PT profiles per kidney section and their irregular distribution after AVT injections suggest that not all of the glomeruli or preglomerular vessels are equally responsive to AVT.

Direct effects of this maternal cortisol may allow embryos to display phenotypic plasticity to cope with postnatal environments (i.e., pre-programming). The potential for maternal hormone induced-adaptation may be of considerable evolutionary significance in viviparous animals. However, to date, there is no such direct evidence that circulating maternal corticosterone passes through the placenta and into the embryos of viviparous reptiles. In this study, we assessed the transfer of 3H-corticosterone injected into females of the lizard Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii into maternal blood, maternal liver, the embryo, the yolk and the amniotic fluid during mid-to-late gestation. We provide direct evidence that circulating maternal corticosterone passes through the placenta into the embryos in this species. Transfer of maternal corticosterone into the embryos significantly decreased at the end of embryonic development. We discuss these results in terms of the relationships between the degree of corticosterone transfer and embryonic stage. These results demonstrate the potential for direct effects of maternal corticosterone, including endocrine pre-programming, upon the developing embryos in viviparous lizards.",

Enzyme activity levels for the key digestive enzyme, trypsin, was also measured. Specifically, transcripts for trypsin, amylase, lipolytic enzymes: bile salt activated lipase (BAL), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and Acyl CoA dehydrogenase (ACADM), regulatory peptides: neuropeptide Y (NPY), orexin (OX) cholecystokinin (CCK) and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART), the somatotropic factors: growth hormone (GH), preprosomatostatin 1 (PPSS1) and thyroid hormone receptors (TR\u03b1 and TR\u03b2) were analyzed using quatitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Trypsin and BAL mRNA levels peaked at approximately day 17 and 25 post-hatch, respectively, and thereafter displayed a decreasing pattern until metamorphosis. GH mRNA levels decreased moderately from 3 to 33\u00a0dph, and thereafter, an increase was observed until 46\u00a0dph. TR\u03b1 mRNA levels showed a fluctuating pattern peaking at day 39 post-hatch. TR\u03b2 mRNA levels were too low to obtain quantitative measurements. Amylase mRNA slightly increased from day 3 to 17 post-hatch, and thereafter showed a steady decrease until day 60. Interestingly, PLA2 mRNA expression showed a consistent increase throughout the study period, indicating an increasingly important role during larval development. Overall, data from this study indicate that cod larvae show differential developmental mode of expression patterns for key genes and endocrine factors that regulate digestive capability, growth and development.

Previous studies suggest that leptin-like immunoreactive substance deposited in the egg may serve as a maternal signal to program posthatch growth. To test the hypothesis that maternal leptin may affect early posthatch growth through modifying hepatic activation of THs, we injected 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg of recombinant murine leptin into the albumen of breeder eggs before incubation. Furthermore, chicken embryo hepatocytes (CEHs) were treated with leptin in vitro to reveal the direct effect of leptin on expression and activity of Ds. In ovo leptin administration markedly accelerated early posthatch growth, elevated serum levels of total and free triiodothyronine (tT3 and fT3), while that of total thyroxin (tT4) remained unchanged. Hepatic mRNA expression and activity of D1 which converts T4 to T3 or rT3 to T2, were significantly increased in leptin-treated chickens, while those of D3 which converts T3 to T2 or T4 to rT3, were significantly decreased. Moreover, hepatic expression of GHR and IGF-I mRNA was all up-regulated in leptin-treated chickens. Males demonstrated more pronounced responses. A direct effect of leptin on Ds was shown in CEHs cultured in vitro. Expression and activity of D1 were increased, whereas those of D3 were decreased, in leptin-treated cells. These data suggest that in ovo leptin administration improves early posthatch growth, in a gender-specific fashion, probably through improving hepatic activation of THs and up-regulating hepatic expression of GHR and IGF-I.",

     "abstract": "The relevance of the mean retention time (MRT) of particles through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is well understood and MRTparticleGIT is an important parameter in digestion models. Solute markers have been used to estimate MRTsoluteGIT (or \u2018fluid passage\u2019) in animals, but the relevance of this measure is less evident and is usually sought in its relation to MRTparticleGIT. The ratio between the two measures indicates the degree of \u2018digesta washing\u2019, with little washing occurring at ratios of 1, aborad washing at ratios >\u00a01 (where the solute marker travels faster than the particle marker), and orad (retrograde) washing at ratios <\u00a01 (where the solute marker travels slower than the particle marker). We analysed digesta washing in a dataset of 98 mammalian species including man of different digestion types (caecum, colon and nonruminant foregut fermenters, and ruminants), controlling for phylogeny; a subset of 72 species allowed testing for the influence of food intake level. The results indicate that MRTsoluteGIT and the degree of digesta washing are related to digestion type, whereas variation in MRTparticleGIT is influenced mainly by effects of body mass and food intake. Thus, fluid throughput and digesta washing emerge as important correlates of digestive anatomy. Most importantly, primates appear constrained to little digesta washing compared to non-primate mammalian herbivores, regardless of their digestion type. These results may help explain the absence of primates from certain herbivore niches and represent a drastic example of a physiologic limitation in a phylogenetic group. More experimental research is required to illuminate relative benefits and costs of digesta washing.",

SOD and CAT activities and plasma H2O2 and melatonin levels were also significantly higher for the red spectra than those for the other light spectra. These results indicate that red light induces oxidative stress. To investigate the effects of melatonin on oxidative stress, we injected melatonin into live fish (in vivo) or treated cultured pineal organ (in vitro) with melatonin. We found that AANAT2, SOD, and CAT mRNA expression levels, SOD and CAT activities, and plasma H2O2, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and melatonin levels were significantly lower than those for the controls.

     "abstract": "A prediction of the seasonal investment hypothesis is that overall energy investment needs to be greater for young being produced at colder temperatures. Then, that energy cost is lower as temperature becomes warmer. To evaluate this assumption, I performed a series of measures of food intake and reproductive output throughout four successive bouts of lactation in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) exposed to a constant warm temperature (Warm, 21\u00a0\u00b0C) or exposed to consecutive decreases in ambient temperatures from warm to cold (Warm\u2013Cold, 30\u20130\u00a0\u00b0C). Warm hamsters showed similar asymptotic food intake, litter size and mass over the course of four successive bouts of lactation. Warm\u2013Cold females consumed more food, but raised lighter litters during the third bout than first bout of lactation. Ambient temperatures had significant effects on energy budget and reproductive output, by which resting metabolic rate, nonshivering thermogenesis and activity of cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) of brown adipose tissue were increased, but reproductive output was decreased with declines of temperatures. These findings suggest that a trade-off occurs between different components of energy expenditure during the successive course of four bouts of lactation. Seasonal hamsters decrease their reproductive output, but increase the energy spent on thermogenesis as the ambient temperature becomes colder. It may also indicate that temperature has a direct effect on metabolism, leading to an increase in overall energy expenditure at lower temperatures.",

A 1821-nt cDNA was isolated and found to contain a single initiation site 387-nt from the most 5\u2032 end, an open reading frame of 1116-nt, and a single putative polyadenylation site 189-nt from the most 3\u2032 end. The encoded protein contains 372 amino acids and contains seven membrane-spanning domains. Based on structural analysis, the protein was identified as a subtype 2 SSTR. These data support the emergence of a multigenic SSTR family early in the course of vertebrate evolution, concomitant with or perhaps prior to the divergence of boney fish. The distribution of SSTR 2 mRNA in tissues was determined by quantitative real time-PCR (QRT-PCR). SSTR 2 was most abundant in the brain (where it was detected in the telencephalon, optic tectum, and hypothalamus), skeletal muscle, and liver, but it also was present in the endocrine pancreas (Brockmann body) and various regions of the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, intestine). SSTR 2 mRNA was most abundant in the brain, muscle, and liver. In vitro the Brockmann body and liver with increasing concentrations of glucose (1, 4, 10\u00a0mM) resulted in increased expression of SSTR 2 mRNA. These findings contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the SSTR family and provide insight into the roles of SSTR 2 in fish.",

The hysteresis between the equilibrium melting and freezing points ranged from 0.18\u00a0\u00b0C to 0.30\u00a0\u00b0C. No signs of THFs activity were found in the autumn- and spring-sampled insects.

Two amino acids, Pro and \u03b1-Ala most significantly contributed to the seasonal increase, while Gln showed the most dramatic seasonal decrease.

During this initial period, branchial RhMM and H+-ATPase (subunit B) mRNA expression levels roughly doubled. After 14\u00a0days of HEA exposure, hemolymph ammonia raised up to environmental levels, whereas urea levels increased by ca. 30%. At the same time, whole animal ammonia and urea excretion vanished. Additionally, branchial RhMM, H+-ATPase, Na+/K+-ATPase and NHE mRNA levels decreased significantly after long term HEA exposure, whereas expression levels of RhMM in the internal tissues increased substantially. Interestingly, crabs acclimated to HEA showed no mortality even after 4\u00a0weeks of HEA exposure.

Although not previously examined, we hypothesized that aerobic training, as shown for human studies, could strengthen disease resistance in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Thus, we exercised salmon pre-smolts for 6\u00a0weeks at two different aerobic training regimes; a continuous intensity training (CT; 0.8\u00a0bl\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) and an interval training (IT; 0.8\u00a0bl\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 16\u00a0h and 1.0\u00a0bl\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 8\u00a0h) and compared them with untrained controls (C; 0.05\u00a0bl\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01). The effects of endurance training on disease resistance were evaluated using an IPN virus challenge test, while the cardiac immune modulatory effects were characterized by qPCR and microarray gene expression analyses. In addition, swimming performance and growth parameters were investigated. Survival after the IPN challenge was higher for IT (74%) fish than for either CT (64%) or C (61%) fish. While both CT and IT groups showed lower cardiac transcription levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 prior to the IPN challenge test, IT fish showed the strongest regulation of genes involved in immune responses and other processes known to affect disease resistance. Both CT and IT regimes resulted in better growth compared with control fish, with CT fish developing a better swimming efficiency during training. Overall, interval aerobic training improved growth and increased robustness of Atlantic salmon, manifested by better disease resistance, which we found was associated with a modulation of relevant gene classes on the cardiac transcriptome.",

     "abstract": "Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, is important for regulating circadian rhythms in many animals. Light at night causes an acute suppression of melatonin in nearly all vertebrate species. A previous study found that light failed to suppress melatonin in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. This is a surprising result given that the Anolis pineal gland is intrinsically photosensitive, is a key pacemaker controlling locomotor activity, and can be directly entrained to a light\u2013dark cycle. To find out if the lack of photic suppression is widespread in the Anolis genus, we investigated the acute effects of light on melatonin secretion in five different species of Anolis using flow-through tissue culture. We administered a two-hour pulse of bright light to isolated pineal glands during the night. The results show photic suppression of melatonin in all five Anolis species, but the suppression is weak relative to that seen in other vertebrates. Moreover, Anolis species differ in the magnitude of the effect. These findings are discussed in the context of vertebrate pineal evolution and the ecology of Anolis lizards. Given their extensive phylogenetic and ecological divergence, Anolis lizards provide a promising system for investigating the ecology and evolution of circadian organization.",

     "abstract": "In 1960, C.G. Wilber in a laboratory-based study described for the first time the changes in heart rate with submergence in the American alligator noting in particular the marked bradycardia that occurred during forced dives. This short review summarizes the major advances in our understanding of diving and the responses and role of the cardiovascular system of crocodilians during submergence in the 50\u00a0years since Wilber published his findings. These advances are attributable in part to the technological advances made in physiological monitoring devices and wildlife telemetry that have not only provided greater elucidation of the hemodynamics of the unique crocodilian cardiovascular system but also allowed the natural diving behaviors and heart rates in free-ranging crocodiles to be recorded. Of note, telemetric field-based studies have revealed that wild free-ranging crocodiles typically undertake only short dives, less than 20\u00a0min, yet crocodiles are also capable of dives of many hours in duration. In contrast to Wilber's study, dives recorded from free-ranging crocodiles were found to be accompanied by only a modest bradycardia, highlighting the often confounding effects associated with captive animals monitored under laboratory conditions. More recent studies have also documented the complex central flow and pressure patterns of crocodilians, including a pulmonary to systemic shunt that can be initiated by a unique intracardiac valve located in the subpulmonary conus. The role and significance of this cardiac shunt remains controversial and the focus of recent lab-based studies. We contend that elucidation of the role and significance of the cardiac shunt in crocodilians will only be achieved by monitoring telemetrically the central cardiovascular flows and pressures in non-captive animals that are undisturbed and free-ranging. This presents the challenge ahead in the next 50\u00a0years.",

The predictive model obtained during the fastest growth period (at the age of 12\u00a0days) explained 65\u201368% of the chicks' growth rates, with fasting triglyceride level explaining most of the variation in growth rate. At the end of pre-fledging period, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate level was also a good predictor of growth rates. Finally, we carried out a field test to check the predictive capacity of the models in two colonies of wild Gull-billed Tern, comparing field-measured and model-predicted growth rates between groups. Both, measured and predicted growth rates, matched statistically. Plasma metabolite levels can thus be applied in comparative studies of chick growth rates when semi-precocial birds can be captured only once.",

In order to provide more insight in the potential signal function and underlying mechanisms of such colorations we here quantified patterns of variation of leg coloration in adult male and female Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus tinnunculus) over the breeding season, and evaluated the relationship between coloration and levels of carotenoids, androgens and estrogens, oxidative damage and plasma non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity. We studied both reproducing wild and non-reproducing captive birds to test for the effect of diet and breeding effort. Males were more colored than females only during mating, and independently of diet, suggesting that leg-color is a sexually selected trait. Seasonal variation in leg color was associated with circulating carotenoids, but concentrations of these molecules were not related to antioxidant capacity, body condition or oxidative damage. These results indicate that carotenoid-based colorations may not be an honest signal of health status in this species. Production of carotenoid rich eggs coincided with low levels of circulating carotenoids in females, indicating that carotenoids might be a limited resource for laying female kestrels. Finally, young rearing males had higher levels of oxidative damage than females, and wild birds of both sexes had higher levels of these parameters than captive birds. These results may indicate that parental effort and physical activity are costly, independently from hormonal status. Since androgens did not explain carotenoid variation we suggest that multiple interacting factors can regulate carotenoid levels along the season.",

     "abstract": "Pythons are renowned for a rapid and pronounced postprandial growth of the heart that coincides with a several-fold elevation of cardiac output that lasts for several days. Here we investigate whether ventricular morphology is affected by digestive state in two species of pythons (Python regius and Python molurus) and we determine the cardiac right-to-left shunt during the postprandial period in P. regius. Both species experienced several-fold increases in metabolism and mass of the digestive organs by 24 and 48\u00a0h after ingestion of meals equivalent to 25% of body mass. Surprisingly there were no changes in ventricular mass or dimensions as we used a meal size and husbandry conditions similar to studies finding rapid and significant growth. Based on these data and literature we therefore suggest that postprandial cardiac growth should be regarded as a facultative rather than obligatory component of the renowned postprandial response. The cardiac right-to-left shunt, calculated on the basis of oxygen concentrations in the left and right atria and the dorsal aorta, was negligible in fasting P. regius, but increased to 10\u201315% during digestion. Such shunt levels are very low compared to other reptiles and does not support a recent proposal that shunts may facilitate digestion in reptiles.",

Exposure to acidic water significantly affected the mRNA levels of 14 claudin and two occludin isoforms, tight junction proteins thought to be involved in regulating paracellular efflux. Despite these changes, Na+ efflux as well as uptake of polyethylene glycol (PEG), a marker for paracellular pathway, was persistently elevated during the 2-week period of acid exposure, although there was a transient recovery between 12- and 72-h. Pre-exposing fish to acidic water for 2\u00a0weeks failed to attenuate the increase in Na+ efflux associated with acute exposure to acidic water of low [Ca2+]. However, during recovery in water of circumneutral pH following exposure to acidic water, normal rates of Na+ efflux were restored within 5\u00a0h. The rate of Na+ uptake was significantly elevated between 4 and 7\u00a0days of exposure to acidic water; the increase was associated with significant increases in maximal Na+ uptake capacity (JMAXNa+) and affinity constant (KM). These results demonstrate that in acidic water, zebrafish maintain their whole body Na+ balance primarily by regulating Na+ uptake, rather than Na+ efflux.",

     "abstract": "This study examined the impact of fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs) on cold tolerance of the polyphagous beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. Daily pulses of elevated temperatures can provide breaks in chronic cold stress, potentially allowing for physiological recovery and improving survival. Perturbations in central metabolism appear to be a common physiological response in insects exposed to low temperatures. It has been suggested that energy supplies, which may be depleted during cold exposure, can be regenerated during the warming pulses of FTRs. This study tested the assumption that chronic cold stress may induce ATP depletion and that recovery during FTR warming pulses may allow re-establishment of ATP supplies. In this study, A. diaperinus were exposed to cold stress under different thermal regimes (constant or fluctuating). The results did not confirm the aforementioned assumption. No cold-induced ATP depletion was observed. The lowest ATP levels were repeatedly detected in the untreated controls. The data show that homoeostasis of ATP is lost when adults A. diaperinus are exposed to cold stress, whatever thermal regime (constant or fluctuating). ATP accumulation may be viewed as a symptom of a production/consumption imbalance under cold stress conditions. Periodic short (2-h) warming pulses clearly improved cold survival. Cellular homeostasis, however, probably requires a longer recovery period to be fully restored.",

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of insulin on the uptake and metabolic fate of lactate and glucose at rest in skeletal muscle of the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeiana, under varying temperature regimens. We hypothesize that lactate and glucose metabolic pathways will respond differently to the presence of insulin in cold versus warm acclimated frog tissues, suggesting an interaction between temperature and metabolism under varying environmental conditions. We employed radiolabeled tracer techniques to measure in vitro uptake, oxidation, and incorporation of glucose and lactate into glycogen by isolated muscles from bullfrogs acclimated to 5\u00a0\u00b0C (cold) or 25\u00a0\u00b0C (warm). Isolated bundles from Sartorius muscles were incubated at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, 15\u00a0\u00b0C, or 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and in the presence and absence of 0.05\u00a0IU/mL bovine insulin. Insulin treatment in the warm acclimated and incubated frogs resulted in an increase in glucose incorporation into glycogen, and an increase in intracellular [glucose] of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/g (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Under the same conditions lactate incorporation into glycogen was reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in insulin-treated muscle. When compared to the warm treatment group, cold acclimation and incubation resulted in increased rates of glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis, and a reduction in free intracellular glucose levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When muscles from either acclimation group were incubated at an intermediate temperature of 15\u00a0\u00b0C, insulin's effect on substrate metabolism was attenuated or even reversed. Therefore, a significant interaction between insulin and acclimation condition in controlling skeletal muscle metabolism appears to exist. Our findings further suggest that one of insulin's actions in frog muscle is to increase glucose incorporation into glycogen, and to reduce reliance on lactate as the primary metabolic fuel.",

To assess if the observed stimulation of these cellular responses resulted from changes of ARA-related prostaglandin (PG) production, we analysed prostaglandin E2 metabolite (PGEM) content on the same oysters fed three levels of ARA. Dietary supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) could also induce an oxidative stress that could similarly increase cellular responses; therefore, two indicators of oxidative stress were analysed: peroxidation level and antioxidant defence status. Together the observed positive correlation between ARA and PGEM levels and the absence of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant activity changes supports the hypothesis of an immune stimulation via PG synthesis. Although ARA proportion in oyster tissues increased by up to 7-fold in response to ARA dietary supplementation, peroxidation index did not change because of a compensatory decrease in n-3 fatty acid proportion, mainly 22:6n-3. To further confirm the involvement of PG in the changes of haemocyte count, phagocytosis and ROS production upon ARA supplementation, it would be interesting to test cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase inhibitors in similar experiments.",

Generally they are induced by a variety of stressors whose effect could be disastrous on the organism, but they are also widely constitutively expressed in the absence of stress. Varied HSP expressions seem to be very essential in the critical steps of embryonic and extra-embryonic structures formation and may correspond to cell movements, proliferation, morphogenesis and apoptosis, which occur during embryonic development. While our knowledge of detailed HSP expression patterns is in constant progress, their functions during embryonic development are not yet fully understood. In the paper, we review available data on HSP expression and discuss their role during vertebrate development.",

     "abstract": "Melatonin is a key neuroendocrine transducer in the circadian organization of vertebrates. However, its role in gastrointestinal physiology has not been explored in depth. In goldfish, a role for melatonin as a modulator of intestinal motility has been reported, whereby it attenuates the cholinergic contraction. The aim of the present work was to investigate this relaxation induced by melatonin in the gut smooth muscle of the goldfish, studying the possible involvement of nitric oxide. An in vitro model of isolated goldfish intestine was used to test the effects on intestinal motility. The addition of melatonin (10\u00a0pM\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM) to the organ bath relaxed acetylcholine- and serotonin-stimulated gut strips, but no effect was observed on KCl-contracted preparations. The addition of L-NAME (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) increased the amplitude of the spontaneous slow waves, while sodium nitroprusside (SNP, nitric oxide donor) abolished them. All these results support a role for the nitrergic system in goldfish gut motility. However, neither L-NAME, nor SNP nor the nitric oxide precursor, l-arginine, modified the melatonin relaxing effect. These results highlight the existence of a basal nitrergic tone in the gut of goldfish, where melatonin would exert a calcium-dependent, nitric oxide-independent relaxing effect on serotonergic and cholinergic contraction.",

     "abstract": "The melanin-synthesis pathways, phenoloxidase (PO) and laccases, are staple components of invertebrate immunity and have been shown to be vital in disease resistance. The importance of this pathway in immunity is a consequence of the release of oxygen radicals with cytotoxic effects and the production of insoluble melanin, which aids in the encapsulation of pathogens and parasites. Recently, melanization has been demonstrated as a critical immune response in several coral systems, although the biochemical components have not been thoroughly investigated. Coral diseases are posing a serious threat to coral reef survival, necessitating a full understanding of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we take a comparative approach to probe potential pathway components of melanin-synthesis in seven species from four different families of healthy Caribbean reef-building corals. Using different quinone substrates, we tested for the activity of the POs catecholase and cresolase, as well as laccase activity in each coral species. Since many invertebrate POs demonstrate some dependence on cations such as copper, calcium and magnesium, we treated the coral extracts with the chelators EDTA and EGTA to test the reliance of coral catecholase on these cations. The activity of the antioxidants peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase was also tested in each coral and correlated to PO activity. All corals had demonstrable catecholase, cresolase and laccase activities, but only catecholase and cresolase activities varied significantly among species. Catecholase activity in each coral species was reduced by treatment with EDTA and EGTA, although some coral species were less affected than the others. Overall, these data show remarkable heterogeneity among the seven coral species of boulder-like reef building Caribbean coral. These differences may originate from the level of investment of each coral species into immunity and may explain disease ecology on the reef.",

     "abstract": "One of the most ubiquitous consequences of feeding in animals is specific dynamic action (SDA), a drastic increment in metabolic rate after a meal, which lasts from a few hours to several days. According to a recent exhaustive review by Secor (2009), studies in SDA are abundant, encompassing all kinds of vertebrates and invertebrates. However, important exceptions are arachnids, as few studies have characterized SDA in this group. Here, we measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the Chilean tarantulas Euathlus truculentus (body mass\u00a0=\u00a07.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0g; N\u00a0=\u00a032; TA\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C), its inter-individual variation (i.e., repeatability) and its SDA. We measured SMR three or four times in each individual, and we also conducted predation experiments where a prey was consumed by each spider, during a respirometry trial. The SMR of E. truculentus was 0.00049\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.000079 mlCO2 g\u22121 min\u22121 which corresponds to 1524\u00a0\u03bcW (assuming a protein-based diet), 108.4% of the predicted value for arachnids. According to the standard nomenclature for SDA studies, the scope of the SDA for a meal size of 1.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0g (18% of the spider size) was 6.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 times the baseline, the time to peak was 45\u00a0min, and the magnitude of the SDA was 0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 kj, which is 85% of the expected value for invertebrates. Our SMR data are in concordance with previous findings suggesting remarkably low energy metabolism in arachnids, compared with other arthropods. On the other hand, the exceedingly high scope of the postprandial response contrasts with the comparatively low SDA. This fact suggests that spiders spend most of the energy for digestion in a short period after prey capture, which could be a consequence of their external digestion.",

Hemocyte membrane lipids of both species revealed similar general composition: i) their free sterol/PL ratio was above 0.4 and ii) their PL were predominated by the diacyl\u00a0+\u00a0alkyl forms of glycerophosphatidylcholine (PC), the plasmalogen form of glycerophosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and ceramide aminoethylphosphonate (CAEP). Free sterols were predominated by cholesterol in both species. Plasmalogen forms of PE and glycerophosphatidylserine (PS) represented 82\u201383% and 46\u201355% of total PE and PS, respectively. When compared to their respective diacyl\u00a0+\u00a0alkyl forms, plasmalogen forms of PE and PS were specifically enriched in non-methylene-interrupted (NMI) FA and 20:1n-11, suggesting a functional significance of these PL molecular species in bivalve hemocytes. Lysoglycerophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) levels were found to be fairly high in hemocytes, accounting for about 8% of the PL. Some species-specific features were also found. LysoPC and glycerophosphatidylinositol (PI) FA compositions differed between Ruditapes philippinarum and Crassostrea gigas. CAEP proportion was higher in R. philippinarum than in C. gigas (14.5% and 27.9% of the PL, respectively).

The first investigation focused on the scaling of evaporative water loss to body mass in passerine birds; the second was concerned with the influence of body size on field metabolic rates of rodents; and the third addressed interspecific variation in kidney mass among primates. Straight lines were fitted to logarithmic transformations by Ordinary Least Squares and Generalized Linear Models, and the resulting equations then were re-expressed as two-parameter power functions in the original arithmetic scales. The re-expressed models were displayed on bivariate graphs together with tracings for equations fitted directly to untransformed data by nonlinear regression. In all instances, models estimated by back-transformation failed to describe major features of the arithmetic distribution whereas equations fitted by nonlinear regression performed quite well. The poor performance of equations based on models fitted to logarithms can be traced to the increased weight and leverage exerted in those analyses by observations for small species and to the decreased weight and leverage exerted by large ones. The problem of rotational distortion can be avoided by performing exploratory analysis on untransformed values and by validating fitted models in the scale of measurement.",

AICAR caused a quadratic dose-dependent decrease in food intake in LWS but not HWS chicks. Compound C caused a quadratic dose-dependent increase in food intake in HWS but not in LWS chicks. Key aspects of the AMPK pathway, including upstream kinases mRNA expression, AMPK subunit \u03b1 mRNA expression and phosphorylation, and a downstream target acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation were not affected by either AICAR or Compound C in either line. The exception was a significant inhibitory effect of AICAR on ACC phosphorylation ratio due to increased total ACC protein content without changing phosphorylated ACC protein levels. Thus, the anorexigenic effect of AICAR in LWS chicks and orexigenic effect of Compound C in HWS chicks resulted from activation or inhibition of other kinase pathways separate from AMPK. These results suggest genetic variation in feeding response for central AICAR and Compound C in chickens, which may contribute to the different body weights between the HWS and LWS lines.",

Human and chicken skeletal muscles are reported to have the highest level of Nampt expression among various tissues whose functional significance remains undetermined. Expression of Nampt is regulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), an essential cytokine for postnatal muscle growth in mammals. The objective of the current study was to characterize expression of Nampt in chicken (Gallus gallus) myogenic cells and to determine the effect of Nampt on expression of IL-6, myogenic transcription factors, and glucose uptake. We also sought to determine the effect of IL-6 on Nampt expression in chicken myogenic cells. Nampt mRNA and protein were identified in both myoblasts and myocytes, although expression did not differ between the two cell types. Treatment with recombinant human Nampt was found to decrease myoD and mrf4 expression but to increase myf5 expression in myocytes, while glucose uptake was unaffected. In response to treatment with recombinant Nampt, IL-6 expression in myocytes was increased at 24\u00a0h but decreased when treated for 48 or 72\u00a0h. Forced over-expression of chicken Nampt cDNA significantly decreased myf5 expression in myoblasts. Treatment of myogenic cells with lower levels (1\u00a0ng.mL\u2212\u00a01) of recombinant IL-6 increased Nampt expression, whereas a higher IL-6 concentration (100\u00a0ng.mL\u2212\u00a01) decreased Nampt mRNA abundance. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Nampt, regulated in part by IL-6, alters the expression of key myogenic transcription factors and thereby may influence postnatal myogenesis.",

In this study, we examined the involvement of orexigenic peptide neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the difference in food intake between broiler and layer chicks (Gallus gallus). First, we compared the hypothalamic mRNA levels of NPY and its receptors (Y1 and Y5 receptors) between these strains at 1, 2, 4, and 8\u00a0days of age. Daily food intake was significantly higher in broiler chicks than layer chicks after 2\u00a0days of age. However, the hypothalamic NPY mRNA level was significantly lower in broiler chicks than layer chicks except at 8\u00a0days of age. In addition, the mRNA levels of NPY receptors were also significantly lower in broiler chicks than layer chicks at 2 and 4\u00a0days of age (Y1 receptor) or 2\u00a0days of age (Y5 receptor). These results suggest that the differences in the expressions of hypothalamic NPY and its receptors do not cause the increase in food intake in broiler chicks. To compare the orexigenic effect of NPY between broiler and layer chicks, we next examined the effects of central administration of NPY on food intake in these strains. In both strains, central administration of NPY significantly increased food intake at 2, 4 and 8\u00a0days of age.

First, we cloned cDNAs encoding NKCC2\u03b2 and NCC\u03b2 from the intestinal tract of Japanese eel. In both freshwater- and seawater-acclimated eels, quantitative PCR analysis showed that NKCC2\u03b2 was predominantly expressed in the anterior and posterior intestines, and that NCC\u03b2 expression was specifically high in the rectum. According to immunohistochemistry with anti-eel NKCC2\u03b2 (reacting with NKCC2\u03b2 but not with NCC\u03b2) and T4 antibody (reacting with both NKCC2\u03b2 and NCC\u03b2), NKCC2\u03b2 was localized in the apical surface of the epithelial cells in the anterior and posterior intestines, whereas NCC\u03b2 was likely to be distributed to that in the rectum. Furthermore, a specific NCC inhibitor, hydrochlorothiazide, inhibited of Na+ and Cl\u2212 absorption, as well as water absorption, in the rectal sac preparations from seawater eel, indicating the involvement of NCC\u03b2 in ion absorption in the rectum.

Concentration-dependent contractions to 15-E2t-IsoP and U46619 in DA rings were competitively inhibited by the TP receptor antagonist SQ29548 (0.1\u00a0\u03bcM to 10\u00a0\u03bcM) with no decrease in the Emax values. SQ29548 also inhibited concentration-dependent contraction to 15-F2t-IsoP but this inhibition was associated with a decrease in Emax. Pre-incubation of DA rings with 15-F2t-IsoP inhibited responses to U46619 and, in vessels contracted with U46619 (1\u00a0\u03bcM), 15-F2t-IsoP (>\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM) evoked a relaxant response. Enzyme immunoassay did not show a measurable release of 15-F2t-IsoP by DA rings. In conclusion, 15-E2t-IsoP is a potent and efficacious constrictor of chicken DA, acting through TP receptors. In contrast, 15-F2t-IsoP is probably acting as a partial agonist at TP receptors. We speculate that IsoPs play a role in the control of chicken DA tone and could participate in its closure.",

Therefore, in recent decades, a great amount of research has been directed towards the development of lipid enrichment in order to improve larval fish survival and growth. However, in fish, the biochemical and molecular processes related to highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) administration are still poorly understood. In the current study, the false percula clownfish, a short larval phase marine species, was used as an experimental model and the effects of a standard and a HUFAs-enriched diet were tested through a molecular, biochemical, ultrastructural and morphometric approach. Our results support the hypothesis that HUFA administration may improve larval development through the presence of better structured mitochondria, a higher synthesis of energy compounds and coenzymes with a central position in the metabolism, with respect to controls. This higher energy status was confirmed by better growth performance and a shorter larval phase in larvae fed with an enriched diet with respect to the control. This strategy of rapid growth and early energy storage may be considered positively adaptive and beneficial to the survival of this species.",

Four primary amino acid motifs: polyalanine, (GA)n, GPGXX, and GGX (X\u00a0=\u00a0G,A,S,Q,L,Y) will be considered in this study. Although synthetic mimetics of many of these amino acid motifs have been produced in several biological systems, the source of spider silk's mechanical integrity remains elusive. Mechanical robustness may be a product not only of the amino acid structure but also of the tertiary structure of the silk. Historically, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) has been used to reveal the crystalline structure of the polyalanine motif; however, limitations in amino acid labeling techniques have obscured the structures of the GGX and GPGXX motifs thought to be responsible for the structural mobility of spider silk.

Despite the presence of basal levels of Na+ uptake in PVC, this transport was not enhanced by acidification, nor was it inhibited by independent treatment with bafilomycin (i.e., a V-type H+-ATPase inhibitor), phenamil (i.e., a specific inhibitor of ENaC), or Ag (a specific inhibitor of active Na+ transport in fish). In contrast, Na+ uptake in PNA\u2212 MR cells was increased by ~\u00a0220% above basal levels following acidification of near 0.4 pH units in the presence of 1.0\u00a0mM external Na+. Acid-stimulated Na+ transport was entirely inhibited by both phenamil and bafilomycin. Silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), which are known to interfere with active Na+ transport in fish, were also responsible for inhibiting acid stimulated Na+ uptake in PNA\u2212 MR cells, but by themselves had no effect on basal Na+ transport. Thus, we demonstrate that Ag specifically prevented acid-stimulated Na+ uptake in PNA\u2212 MR cells in a dose-dependent manner. We also demonstrate rapid (<\u00a01\u00a0min) and significant inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA) by Ag in PNA\u2212 MR cells, but not in PVC. These data lend further support to the idea of a PNA\u2212 MR cell type as the primary site for Na+ uptake in the freshwater (FW) gill phenotype of rainbow trout. Moreover, these findings provide support for the importance of intracellular protons in regulating the movement of Na+ across the apical surface of the fish gill.",

     "abstract": "Global climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity; one of the most important effects is the increase in the mean earth surface temperature. However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.",

The net effect of parasite infection is to increase the likelihood of transmission to the definitive host. Osmoregulation is an energetically expensive mechanism that allows G. pulex to survive in dilute media. Any factor influencing osmoregulation is thus likely to affect the allocation of resources to other areas. This study investigated whether P. minutus infection alters sodium regulation in G. pulex. Haemolymph sodium concentration, water permeability and sodium fluxes were measured over the salinity acclimation range of G. pulex. Water permeability was unaltered by either acclimation salinity or parasite infection. Acclimation to 12\u2030 significantly raised the haemolymph sodium concentration, reduced the sodium influx, and increased the sodium efflux, to the same extent in both uninfected and infected G. pulex. However, parasite infection induced a significant increase in haemolymph sodium concentration in G. pulex acclimated to 6\u2030, which was not observed in uninfected G. pulex acclimated to the same salinity. Also, both sodium influx and sodium efflux were significantly lower in parasitized G. pulex acclimated to 6\u2030, when compared to uninfected G. pulex acclimated to the same salinity. It was concluded that the parasite induced disturbances to sodium regulation in G. pulex acclimated to 6\u2030 were a functional consequence of the manipulative strategy employed to alter behaviour, rather than a primary target.",

Both taxon and temperature had significant effects on the resting oxygen consumption rate ( M \u02d9 Orest), SDA and swimming performance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the effect of temperature differed significantly among the different species (interaction effect, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Under the low temperature condition, digestion had no effect on either critical swimming speed (Ucrit) or the active M \u02d9 O2 ( M \u02d9 Oactive) for all fish species (additive metabolic mode). When the temperature was increased from 15 to 25\u00a0\u00b0C, the metabolic scope (MS) for digestion increased approximately 182, 49 and 17%, and the MS for locomotion increased approximately 129, 58 and 138% in goldfish, common carp and qingbo, respectively. The total metabolic demands for both digestion and locomotion (i.e., the sum of digestive MS and locomotive MS) increased approximately 143, 56 and 112% in goldfish, common carp and qingbo, respectively. The total MS for both digestion and locomotion (the difference between M \u02d9 Oactive in fed fish and M \u02d9 Orest in fasting fish) increased approximately 106, 58 and 78% in goldfish, common carp and qingbo, respectively. Thus, the MS for locomotion in fed goldfish decreased due to the large increase in digestive function at the high temperature, and the Ucrit of fed goldfish decreased by 11% compared to that of fasting fish (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) (digestion-priory metabolic mode). The metabolic mode of qingbo changed to locomotion-priority mode, as illustrated by the large increase in locomotive MS in response to the increase in temperature. In the common carp, temperature had no effect on metabolic mode as illustrated by the parallel increases in cardio-respiratory capacity and metabolic capacity of digestive and locomotive organs. A discussion on the changes in metabolic mode in response to temperature and its possible relationship with the metabolic characteristics of a given fish species was also documented in this paper.",

In contrast, limited information exists on gut proteases of lower termites, their origins and roles in termite nutrition. The objective of this study was to characterize gut proteases of the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae). The protease activity of extracts from gut tissues (fore-, mid- and hindgut) and protozoa isolated from hindguts of termite workers was quantified using hide powder azure as a substrate and further characterized by zymography with gelatin SDS-PAGE. Midgut extracts showed the highest protease activity followed by the protozoa extracts. High level of protease activity was also detected in protozoa culture supernatants after 24\u00a0h incubation. Incubation of gut and protozoa extracts with class-specific protease inhibitors revealed that most of the proteases were serine proteases. All proteolytic bands identified after gelatin SDS-PAGE were also inhibited by serine protease inhibitors. Finally, incubation with chromogenic substrates indicated that extracts from fore- and hindgut tissues possessed proteases with almost exclusively trypsin-like activity while both midgut and protozoa extracts possessed proteases with trypsin-like and subtilisin/chymotrypsin-like activities. However, protozoa proteases were distinct from midgut proteases (with different molecular mass). Our results suggest that the Formosan subterranean termite not only produces endogenous proteases in its gut tissues, but also possesses proteases originating from its protozoan symbionts.",

     "abstract": "With global climate changes, biological invasions are considered to be one of the main causes of the decline of freshwater biodiversity. In this context, predicted increases in global temperature may alter the geographical distributions of native and invasive species. The purpose of our study was to examine the metabolic, behavioral and physiological responses to short-term temperature acclimation of two widely distributed species (the most successful European invader, Dikerogammarus villosus, and its main victim, Gammarus pulex), in order to estimate the potential effect of global warming on its invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Our results show that D. villosus is more vulnerable to high temperatures than G. pulex. The native species seems to be best adapted to intermediate temperatures (10\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C) with a possibility of adjustment to \u201cextreme\u201d temperatures (5\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C), whereas the \u201ckiller shrimp\u201d D. villosus seems best adapted to lower temperatures (5\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C) with a limited possibility of adjustment above 20\u00a0\u00b0C. In the light of our results, global warming is likely to be less favorable to the invasive species. However, D. villosus showed reduced metabolic and activity rates, associated with higher glycogen content. This adaptive strategy was interpreted as having functional advantages, allowing D. villosus to successfully invade harsh and/or unpredictable biotopes. In addition, our results show that glycogen stores may be used as a powerful indicator of the optimal thermal window for aquatic ectotherms.",

Maturity does not depend on food or temperature contrary to age and to some extent length. We compile the maturity levels for each developmental milestone recorded in staging atlases. The analysis of feeding, growth, reproduction and aging patterns throughout the embryo, juvenile and adult life stages are well-captured by a simple extension of the standard DEB model and reveals that embryo development is slow relative to adults. A threefold acceleration of development occurs during the larval period. Moreover we demonstrate that growth and reproduction depend on food in predictable ways and their simultaneous observation is necessary to estimate parameters. We used data on diverse aspects of the energy budget simultaneously for parameter estimation using the covariation method. The lowest mean food intake level to initiate reproduction was found to be as high as 0.6 times the maximum level. The digestion efficiency for Tetramin\u2122 was around 0.5, growth efficiency was just 0.7 and the value for the allocation fraction to soma (0.44) was close to the one that maximizes ultimate reproduction.",

We tested this assumption in a series of feeding experiments with 12 adult Phillip's dikdiks (Madoqua saltiana phillipsi) on three different intake levels per animal, using cobalt-EDTA as a solute marker and a \u2018conventional\u2019 chromium-mordanted fibre (<\u00a02\u00a0mm; mean particle size 0.63\u00a0mm) marker for the particle phase. Body mass had no influence on retention measurements, whereas food intake level clearly had. Drinking water intake was not related to the retention of the solute marker. In contrast to our expectations, the particle marker was retained distinctively longer than the solute marker. Comparisons with results in larger ruminants and with faecal particle sizes measured in dikdiks suggested that in these small animals, the chosen particle marker was above the critical size threshold, above which particle delay in the forestomach is not only due to selective particle retention (as compared to fluids), but additionally due to the ruminal particle sorting mechanism that retains particles above this threshold longer than particles below this threshold. A second study with a similar marker of a lower mean particle size (0.17\u00a0mm, which is below the faecal particle size reported for dikdiks) resulted in particle and fluid retention patterns similar to those documented in other \u2018moose-type\u2019 ruminants. Nevertheless, even this smaller particle marker yielded retention times that were longer than those predicted by allometric equations based on quarter-power scaling, providing further support for observations that small ruminants generally achieve longer retention times and higher digestive efficiencies than expected based on their body size.",

Fish were maintained under constant short-photoperiod (9L:15D) from the winter solstice onwards (experimental group) or under naturally-changing photoperiod (control group), and water temperature naturally oscillated in both groups. Blood samples were collected during the reproduction season at pre-spawning (March), spawning (April) and post-spawning (May) to determine the endocrine status. Spawning events and egg quality parameters were also monitored. The results revealed a significant increase in nocturnal melatonin concentration from March to May in the control group, while in the experimental group such seasonal change did not occur. As to plasma levels of vitellogenin, testosterone, estradiol and 11keto-testosterone, differences between groups were found mostly in March, while in April and May levels were often similar. Spawning was observed in both groups, although the experimental group started slightly earlier and also finished earlier than the control group, perhaps as a result of the increase in sex steroids and VTG observed at pre-spawning. Briefly, reproduction rhythms persisted in the absence of the natural lengthening of photoperiod, although photoperiod manipulation altered the seasonal modulation of melatonin, increased sex steroids and vitellogenin at pre-spawning, and slightly advanced the timing of spawning.",

Juvenile fish were fed at three different levels for 11\u00a0weeks: i) full ration until visual satiety (R100 group), ii) 70% of satiation (R70 group) and iii) 70% of satiation with two finishing weeks at the maintenance ration (20% of the satiation level) (R70\u201320 group). The thirty percent feed restriction improved fish performance, increasing feed conversion efficiency and circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Fish of the R70\u201320 group showed reduced growth and low circulating levels of IGF-I in combination with increased circulating concentrations of growth hormone and free fatty acids. Feed restriction did not alter UCP3 transcript levels in white skeletal muscle, but improved this tissue's oxidative capacity as assessed by changes in glycolytic and oxidative mitochondrial enzyme activities. In contrast, in cardiac and red skeletal muscle tissues, this dietary treatment primarily increased UCP3 mRNA expression. The respiratory control ratio of freshly isolated heart mitochondria was slightly lower in R70\u201320 fish than in R100 fish, which suggests that there was an increase in mitochondrial uncoupling concomitant with the enhanced UCP3 mRNA expression. Altogether, these findings highlight the different adaptive mechanism of glycolytic and highly oxidative muscle tissues for their rapid adjustment to varying feed intake.",

Periods of post-hypoxia recovery were analyzed in two crayfish species, where Parastacus defossus is a fossorial species, and Parastacus brasiliensis lives in lotic environments with higher oxygen levels. After 4\u00a0h of hypoxia (2\u00a0mg O2/L), groups of animals were placed in tanks with oxygenated water and were then removed at intervals of 1, 3, 6, and 9\u00a0h. Hemolymph and tissues (hepatopancreas, muscle, and anterior and posterior gills) were extracted for the determination of glucose, lactate, free glucose, glycogen, total proteins, total lipids, arginine phosphate, and arginine. As expected, lactate levels were restored more rapidly in P. defossus than in P. brasiliensis. P. defossus restored its glycogen reserves of the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue. Free glucose was quickly restored in all tissues of both species. In relation to arginine phosphate reserves, P. defossus showed a greater ability to restore this metabolite in the hepatopancreas. Both species recovered their arginine phosphate reserves, but they also used this metabolite in longer periods of recovery. Mainly in P. brasiliensis the reserves of total lipids seem to be an important source of energy during the recovery period. The animals developed various metabolic strategies to post-hypoxia recovery, mainly P. defossus which restored its reserves more completely and more rapidly than did P. brasiliensis.",

     "abstract": "One of the hypotheses that attempt to explain physiological limitations of energy budgets is the symmorphosis hypothesis, which proposes that if matching structures to functional needs were combined with the strict economy of energy and materials, the result would be an optimal organ design for the specific function it serves. Evidence in favor of symmorphosis in adults is as abundant as evidence against it, but the plasticity of some morphological traits may be dependent on the ontogenetic stage at which acclimation acts. Thus, here we studied the adjustment of structure and function in lungs at different stages of development in the quail Coturnix coturnix japonica under two thermal regimes. Our main results show that i) resting metabolic rate, maximum thermogenic oxygen consumption and oxygen diffusion capacity did not exhibit developmental plasticity for two thermal environments; and ii) oxygen diffusion capacity fully adjusted to resting metabolic rate and maximum oxygen consumption during development. C. coturnix has a low safety factor close to 1 which is consistent with the symmorphosis hypothesis.",

     "abstract": "Sperm are highly susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage sperm DNA and structure, resulting in reduced fertilizing capacity. Exposure to radioactive contamination can also impair sperm swimming behavior and fertilizing ability, both through a reduction of sperm DNA integrity and via an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the relationship between individual oxidative status and sperm swimming behavior has never been investigated in any wild population of animals exposed to radioactive contamination. We studied the motility of sperm collected from barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, breeding under different levels of radioactive contamination following the Chernobyl accident in 1986, in relation to individual oxidative status. We tested the hypothesis that the degree of impairment of sperm swimming behavior by radioactive contamination depended on plasma antioxidant capacity, the level of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) and oxidative stress (sensu Costantini et al. 2006), a better oxidative status being associated with higher sperm motility. Sperm behavior parameters were subjected to principal component (PC) analysis, which extracted four PCs explaining 86% of the variance in sperm motility. PC2, representing sperm with high track velocity and ample lateral head displacement, was significantly predicted by the interaction between radiation level and either oxidative damage or oxidative stress. Contrary to our predictions, the highest values of PC2 were associated with relatively high radiation levels, particularly for high levels of either ROMs or oxidative stress. In addition, there was a tendency for values of PC3 (representing the percent of motile sperm) and PC4 (representing slow sperm with high beat cross frequency) to depend on the interaction between radiation level and total plasma antioxidant protection. Our results confirm the importance of oxidative status in determining the genetic and physiological outcome of exposure to radioactive contamination, complementing previous studies relating sperm abnormality to circulating levels of specific antioxidants. Our results also complement previous evidence that oxidative damage of sperm was negatively related to sperm motility, thus indicating a possible trade-off in quenching pro-oxidant compounds in the plasma and the seminal fluid.",

     "abstract": "Studies have shown linoleate could not only promote cell viability but also affect lipid metabolism in mammals. However, to what degree these effects are mediated by steatosis in goose primary hepatocytes is unknown. In this study, the effect of linoleate on the lipid metabolic homeostasis pathway was determined. We measured the mRNA levels of genes involved in triglyceride synthesis, lipid deposition, \u03b2-oxidation, and assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs in goose (Anser cygnoides) primary hepatocytes. Linoleate significantly increased goose hepatocyte viability, and linoleate at 0.125\u00a0mM, 0.25\u00a0mM, 0.5\u00a0mM and 1.0\u00a0mM all showed a significant effect on TG accumulation. However, with increasing linoleate concentrations, the extracellular TG concentration and extracellular VLDL gradually decreased. DGAT1, DGAT2, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, FoxO1, MTP, PLIN and CPT-1 mRNA was detected by real-time PCR. With increasing linoleate concentrations, the changes in DGAT1, DGAT2, PPAR\u03b1 and CPT-1 gene expression, which regulates hepatic TG synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, first increased and then decreased. Additionally, FoxO1 and MTP gene expression was reduced with increasing linoleate concentrations, and the change in PLIN gene expression was increased at all concentrations, similar to the regulation of intracellular TG accumulation. In conclusion, linoleate regulated TG accumulation and increased hepatocyte viability. The data suggest that linoleate does promote goose hepatocyte viability and steatosis, which may up-regulate TG synthesis-relevant gene expression, suppress assembly and secretion of VLDL-TGs, and increase fatty acid oxidation properly to function of goose primary hepatocytes.",

Receptor expression of Mel1b was more prominent than Mel1a at all the time points during both the reproductive phases. The expression of AR was inversely related to both the melatonin and its receptor expression at the 24\u00a0h time scale during both the reproductive phases. Results also reflected a parallel relationship of melatonin, melatonin receptors and all the immune parameters (total leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, % stimulation ratio) suggesting that peripheral melatonin might be responsible for daily periodicity of LAIS. The presence of androgen receptors in lung led us to propose that gonadal steroid does influence the LAIS. Therefore melatonin along with testosterone might be acting as a temporal synchronizer for daily rhythms in lung associated immunity in Perdicula asiatica during different reproductive phases.",

Inulin space measurements showed that the hemolymph comprises 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2% of the hydrated water content but contributes 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8% of water losses during desiccation. Hemolymph concentrations of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ were measured in variably dehydrated animals using ion-selective microelectrodes and compared with predicted concentrations assuming no regulation. Na+ and Ca2+ are quite tightly regulated, showing respective concentration increases of 20.8% and 7.1% following a 50% reduction in hemolymph volume, but K+ showed no measurable regulation. The excreted cation fraction during desiccation is negligible. Sites of ion sequestration were examined by injecting 22Na and 45Ca into the hemolymph of hydrated animals and assaying tissue-specific activities following dehydration. Na+ is apparently sequestered non-specifically by an unknown mechanism. Ca2+ accumulates in the dorsal somatic tissues, possibly in the calcium pool of the cuticle. How A. vulgare avoids significant disruptions of Em and neuromuscular function in the absence of K+ regulation, and how it sequesters Na+, both pose intriguing challenges for future work.",

     "abstract": "The influence of changing composition and content of RNA on the results of expression profiling was studied in the group-synchronous ovaries of roach (Rutilus rutilus) over the course of their maturation. The highest yield of total RNA was detected in the primary growth and early cortical alveolus stages. The total RNA yield gradually decreased through the late cortical alveolus and late vitellogenic stages. In the primary growth and early cortical alveolus stages, total RNA was characterized by a low percentage of 18S and 28S rRNA and a high percentage of smaller-sized RNAs (tRNA, 5S and 5.8S rRNA), whereas 18S and 28S rRNA had increased by the late cortical alveolus stage and dominated by the late vitellogenic stage. The ratio of mRNA to total RNA was highest at the primary growth stage but decreased significantly in later ovarian stages. When total RNA was used for reverse transcription (RT), the shift in the mRNA/total RNA ratio influenced the results of qPCR expression profiling of several commonly used reference genes (ribosomal protein L8, elongation factor-1\u03b1, RNA polymerase-subunit B5, and \u03b22-microglobulin) and of two target genes, gonad-type aromatase (cyp19a1a) and follistatin (fst). We conclude that the expression of target genes should be related to the mRNA pool using the same input of either mRNA to RT or cDNA to qPCR.

The amount of energy and protein lost varied according to both size and temperature and was consistent with the function of a\u00a0\u204e\u00a0Wb, where a is a temperature dependent coefficient, W the animal's weight and b an exponent relating energy loss to live-weight. The coefficient for energy or protein loss varied and was described by a polynomial function, with a general increase from 23\u00a0\u00b0C to 32\u00a0\u00b0C, before a dramatic decline after 35\u00a0\u00b0C. In contrast, the exponent for energy loss was relatively constant between 23\u00a0\u00b0C and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, but showed a rapid increase at 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Both the coefficients and exponents of protein loss mirrored that of energy loss. Analysis of the protein and lipid contributions to energy loss shows that typically lipid loss accounts for the greater part of energy loss (~\u00a067%), but also shows that above 35\u00a0\u00b0C protein energy loss increases (from ~\u00a033% to ~\u00a039%) while the losses seen from lipid catabolism remain the same.

Per3 exhibits a significant daily oscillation in retina and optic tectum but not in diencephalon and cerebellum. Our results suggest an important role of Per3 in the circadian clockwork machinery of visually-related areas of sole.",

Swimming velocities of wild cod spermatozoa were significantly faster than those of cultivated males. Wild males had a significantly larger spermatozoa head area, perimeter, and length, while cultivated males had more circular heads. Total monounsaturated fatty acids and the ratio of n\u22123/n\u22126 were significantly higher in sperm from wild males, while total n\u22126 from cultivated males was significantly higher than the wild males. Significantly higher concentrations of the fatty acids C14:0, C16:1n\u22127, C18:4n\u22123, C20:1n\u221211, C20:1n\u22129, C20:4n\u22123, C22:1n\u221211, and C22:6n\u22123 were observed in wild males, while significantly higher concentrations of C18:2n\u22126, C20:2n\u22126, and C22:5n\u22123 occurred in cultivated males. Osmolality, protein concentration, lactate dehydrogenase and superoxide dismutase activity of SP of wild males were significantly higher than the cultivated males. Antioxidant capacity of SP was significantly higher in cultivated males, while pH and anti-trypsin did not differ between fish origins. Four bands of anti-trypsin activity and nine protein bands were detected in SP. Performing a discriminant function analysis, on morphology and fatty acid data showed significant discrimination between wild and cultivated fish.

We examined bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), two species commonly found in the same water bodies, though pumpkinseed are considered more hypoxia tolerant, and survive in hypoxic lakes that exclude bluegill. Freshly caught Lake Opinicon pumpkinseed possessed significantly higher glycolytic enzyme activities (PGI, ALD, GAPDH, ENO, and LDH) than bluegill, but after holding the fish in an oxygenated environment for 7\u00a0days, pumpkinseed glycolytic enzymes (PGI, ALD, and LDH) and mRNA (LDHA and HIF1\u03b1) declined to bluegill's levels. When glycolytic enzymes and mRNA were compared in pumpkinseed populations from seven lakes, only Penyck Lake pumpkinseed had significantly elevated glycolytic enzyme activity that did not diminish with normoxic holding. The levels of mRNA for LDHA and HIF1\u03b1 did not differ between lakes and did not change in response to normoxic holding in the Penyck Lake fish. Collectively, these studies on sunfish show that hypoxia tolerance contributes to ecological niche specialization between species, and provides an example of a population that has adapted chronically elevated glycolytic enzyme activity independent of current dissolved oxygen in the water.",

Urban adult male thrashers showed greater responsiveness than desert birds to an injection of arginine vasotocin or adrenocorticotropin hormone, suggesting a population difference in pituitary and adrenal gland sensitivity. Plasma corticosterone in response to corticotropin-releasing factor injection did, however, not differ between populations. The differential corticosterone response to arginine vasotocin and corticotropin-releasing factor may reflect effects of chronic stress or habituation, which are known to favor arginine vasotocin over corticotropin-releasing factor sensitivity. Efficacy of HPA negative feedback by glucocorticoids was determined by measuring plasma corticosterone in response to acute administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. This administration decreased plasma corticosterone similarly in urban and desert thrashers, suggesting that the negative feedback of glucocorticoids on the HPA axis in the two populations was equally effective. The higher sensitivity of urban than desert thrashers to adrenocorticotropin hormone and arginine vasotocin may result from up-regulation of the HPA axis in urban birds. This up-regulation may in turn make it easier for city birds to cope with urban environment-associated stressors.",

A transmural gradient in repolarization durations in frogs (Endo\u00a0>\u00a0Epi, P\u00a0<\u00a00.024) corresponds to the gradient in repolarization times. No significant transmural difference in repolarization duration is observed in pike that produces a repolarization sequence from Endo to Epi (Endo\u00a0<\u00a0Epi, P\u00a0<\u00a00.02) according to the activation sequence.

Changes in Hb concentration as well as Hb subunit composition, which modulate Hb oxygen affinity, guarantee the oxygen supply of tissues under these environmental conditions. Based on the sequenced D. pulex genome, Hb genes were related to the properties of haemolymph Hb, which included its concentration and oxygen affinity (both measured by spectrophotometry) as well as the Hb subunit composition (determined by 2-D gel electrophoresis and ESI-MS analysis). Permanent cultures of D. pulex acclimated to different oxygen conditions (normoxia and hypoxia) and temperatures (10\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0\u00b0C, and 24\u00a0\u00b0C), showed characteristic changes in Hb concentration, subunit composition and oxygen affinity. Several subunits (Hb4, Hb7, Hb8, and Hb10) were obviously responsible for changes in oxygen affinity including those, which carry a number of hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) upstream of the respective gene (hb4 and hb10). Analysing the effects of different oxygen- or temperature-acclimations on Hb subunit expression in D. pulex and D. magna on a common basis (Hb concentration or oxygen affinity) revealed a general pattern of oxygen and temperature effects on Hb, which implies that Hb quantity and quality are mostly influenced by the degree of tissue hypoxia. Differences between both species in the onset of hypoxia-induced differential Hb expression and Hb oxygen affinity, which are probably related to different HRE patterns and functionally important differences in the amino acid sequence of only a few subunits, cause a reduced ability of D. pulex to adjust Hb function to temperature changes in comparison to D. magna.",

Electrical stimuli applied to the anterior and posterior connectives of single-ganglion preparations, containing either the 2nd or 3rd thoracic ganglion alone, and each of three paired ganglionic nerve roots produced excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the cell body of a CA neuron. Artificial movements of appendages, such as the thoracic limbs and the swimmerets, also evoked EPSPs in the CA neuron. Electrical stimuli applied to the peripheral nerves running to appendages induced inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in a CI neuron. Since artificial movements of the appendages caused decrease of CI impulse rate, these IPSPs in the CI neuron may be caused by mechanoproprioceptors in the appendages. Since tachycardia was accompanied by excitation of CA neurons and inhibition of CI neurons, activation of the mechanoproprioceptors may be responsible for tachycardia. EPSPs in CA neurons produced by stimulation of peripheral nerves were augumented by eserinization and blocked by curarization. The activation of CA neurons by ganglionic roots may be mediated by cholinergic processes ascending from mechanoproprioceptors.",

     "abstract": "Atlantic salmon can differ markedly in their growth and in the timing of reproductive maturation, leading to the dramatic contrast between the large anadromous adults and the diminutive mature male parr. This study examined the growth rates, anatomical and physiological characteristics of parr during the adoption of their discrete life histories to ascertain whether these properties can explain tactic choice. To minimise the impact of habitat differences upon these attributes, salmon were reared in the laboratory until 1.5\u00a0years of age, when the \u201cdecisions\u201d to undergo smoltification or to mature as parr had been taken. At 1.5\u00a0years, both males and females showed bimodal size-frequency distributions. Neither the population of origin nor the paternal reproductive tactic influenced the \u201cdecision\u201d to mature or the growth trajectories. Growth rate (% mass\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01 during their final 10\u00a0months) and the % male and female offspring in the upper modal group were strongly correlated and varied markedly among families. Mean growth rate per family was negatively correlated with mean metabolic rate per family at emergence. Growth rate decreased as a function of parr size in January and the growth rates of upper modal fish were displaced upwards relative to those of lower modal fish. Most males in the smaller size mode matured, whereas all other fish began smoltification. Mature male parr did not differ from similarly sized female pre-smolt in routine metabolic rate, but these smaller fish had higher metabolic rates than larger male and female pre-smolts. However, mature parr differed markedly from similarly sized females and from larger male and female pre-smolts in possessing higher oxidative and lower glycolytic capacities in muscle. Overall, these data are consistent with the interpretation that growth rates dictate the distribution of parr between upper and lower modal groups. Individuals from faster growing families would be more likely to pass the threshold for smoltification and to accelerate growth, whereas those from slower growing families would remain in the lower mode. The use of metabolic capacities, e.g. metabolic rate, was linked with modal group, whereas muscle oxidative capacity was linked with male maturity. Mean family metabolic rate at emergence was negatively linked with mean growth during the subsequent year, suggesting that metabolic efficiency facilitates growth and eventually smoltification.",

Briefly, F1 and F4 juveniles were submitted to chronic confinement and investigated on days 5, 15 and 30. Capture and 15\u00a0min-anesthesia were imposed on fish to assess the effect of preceding confinement on acute stress response. On day 30, the fish were finally challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila and sampled after 5 and 10\u00a0days for immune parameter measurements. Cortisol and glucose levels were not affected by confinement but increased significantly after acute stressor exposure. Moreover, cortisol rise following capture and anesthesia was higher in F1 confined-fish, suggesting that they have previously been affected by chronic confinement. A higher HSP70 level was also observed on day 30 in F1 confined-juveniles. During bacterial challenge, regardless of confinement level, F4 juveniles displayed higher lysozyme activity and agglutination response than F1 which may indicate a higher immune capacity in domesticated fish. In conclusion, chronic confinement stressor induced few physiological responses but may increase the responsiveness to other aquacultural stressors. Domestication process also seems to improve chronic stress resistance, growth as well as the immune status of the fish.",

In this new scenario, it is of paramount relevance to understand the mechanistic basis of animal responses to environmental change. Here we analyze to what extent seasonal changes in the digestive function of the lizard Liolaemus moradoensis is under endogenous (i.e., hard wired) or exogenous (i.e., environmentally determined) control. For this purpose we compared animals collected in the field during autumn, winter and summer, against (experimental) specimens collected in the field at the beginning of autumn and reared in the laboratory under simulated summer conditions until winter. We found that different aspects of the digestive function are under different types of control: small intestine length appears to be under endogenous control (i.e., experimental animals were similar to winter animals), small intestine mass appears to be under exogenous control (i.e., experimental animals were similar to summer animals), and specific enzyme activities did not change throughout the year. Thus, we suspect that processes related with gut length, such as cell division, may be under endogenous control, while others related with gut mass, such as enterocyte size and content, may be determined by exogenous factors, such as the presence of food in the intestinal lumen. Faced with accelerated changing conditions, the ability of vertebrates to cope will be closely related with their plasticity in fitness-associated traits. More studies aimed at determining the levels and limits of physiological flexibility will be necessary to understand this phenomenon.",

We simulated a 3-day migratory stopover for garden warblers (Sylvia borin) and compared body temperatures (Tb) and rates of refueling under conditions of a heat wave (Ta\u00a0=\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C by day, and 15\u00a0\u00b0C at night) with those under more moderate conditions (Ta\u00a0=\u00a027\u00a0\u00b0C by day, and 15\u00a0\u00b0C at night). We measured Tb with implanted thermo-sensitive radio transmitters. Birds had significantly lower rates of body mass gain on the first day of stopover (repeated measures mixed model ANOVA, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) affecting body mass during the entire stopover (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and higher maximum Tb during the day when exposed to high Ta than when exposed to moderate Ta (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In addition, the birds exposed to high Ta by day had significantly lower minimum Tb at night than those exposed to moderate daytime Ta (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), even though Ta at night was the same for both groups. We interpret this lower nighttime Tb to be a means of saving energy to compensate for elevated daytime thermoregulatory requirements, while higher Tb by day may reduce protein turnover. All effects on Tb were significantly more pronounced during the first day of stopover than on days two and three, which may be linked to the rate of renewal of digestive function during stopover. Our results suggest that environmental factors, such as high Ta, constrain migratory body mass gain. Extreme high Ta and heat waves are predicted to increase due to global climate change, and thus are likely to pose increasing constraints on regaining body mass during stopover and therefore migratory performance in migratory birds.",

In this study we determined the heat tolerance in a geographically diverse group of 11 Antarctic species as their critical thermal maximum (CTMax). When acclimatized to their natural freezing water temperatures, environmental CTMaxs ranged from 11.95 to 16.17\u00a0\u00b0C, well below those of fishes endemic to warmer waters.

In posterior gills, 24-h exposure to hyperosmotic stress increased PEPCK, FBPase and G6Pase activities. Increase in 14C-lipid synthesis was associated to the decrease in PEPCK activity after 72-h exposure to hyperosmotic stress. Hypo-osmotic stress decreased PEPCK and G6Pase activities in posterior gills; however, 14C-lipids increased after 72-h exposure to stress. In anterior gills, decreases in the G6Pase activity after 72-h of hyperosmotic stress and in 14C-lipogenesis after 144-h were observed, while PEPCK activity increased after 144\u00a0h. Exposure to hypo-osmotic stress increased 14C-lipid synthesis and PEPCK activity in anterior gills. Muscle G6Pase activity increased after 72-h exposure to hypo-osmotic stress; however, no significant change was observed in the lipogenesis. PEPCK decreased in muscle after 144-h exposure to hyperosmotic, coinciding with increased 14C-lipid synthesis. In the hepatopancreas, a decrease in the 14C-lipogenesis occurred after 24-h exposure to hyperosmotic stress, accompanied by increase in 14C-lipid synthesis. Additionally, PEPCK activity returned to control levels. The hepatopancreatic lipogenesis from amino acids was not involved in the metabolic adjustment during hypo-osmotic stress. However, gluconeogenesis is one of the pathways involved in the adjustment of the intracellular concentration of nitrogenated compounds.",

GERs were significantly different between species and they were not affected by diet. Similarly, species-specific patterns were revealed in the distribution of digesta and water content along the gastrointestinal tract. In sea bream, stomach digesta and water content decreased with time, whereas in sea bass stomach retained the highest digesta and water content throughout the sampling period. The anterior and distal intestine exhibited the lowest accommodating capacities of digesta and water in either species. Overall, sea bream performed stomach digestion at lower hydration levels and higher pH compared with sea bass. Diet affected stomach moisture in both species and pH of stomach digesta in sea bass and of all intestinal sections in sea bream. The results obtained indicated that water and inorganic ion exchanges through the gut may differentiate between the species and warrant further investigation.",

Bioinformatics analysis reveals a protein coding region with length of 445 amino acids containing all characteristic features of desaturase enzyme, including a cytochrome b5-domain with the heme-binding motif, two transmembrane domains and three histidine-rich regions. The striped snakehead fads amino acid sequence shares high similarity with known fads of other teleosts.

Under fed conditions, glycogen was increased 54% in ventricles from males compared with females, and elevated in the liver (87%) and white muscle (70%) in sexually-maturing versus immature males. Acid soluble glycogen predominated over the acid insoluble fraction in all tissues and was similar between sexes. Food deprivation 1) selectively reduced glycogen and free glucose in male ventricles by ~\u00a030%, and 2) did not change glycogen in the liver or white muscle, or triglyceride, protein or water levels in any tissues for both sexes. These data highlight sex differences in teleost cardiac stores and the metabolism of carbohydrates, and contrast with mammals where cardiac glycogen increases during fasting and acid insoluble glycogen is a significant fraction. Increased glycogen in the hearts of male rainbow trout appears to pre-empt sex-specific cardiac growth while storage of acid soluble glycogen may reflect a novel strategy for efficient synthesis and mobilization of glycogen in fishes.",

     "abstract": "Calcium (Ca) is critical for crustaceans due to their molting cycle and its presence in the carapace as calcium carbonate, apart from the usual functions of Ca, such as cell signalling. Ca transport in Dilocarcinus pagei, a freshwater crab, was studied in isolated cells from hepatopancreas to further characterize Ca transport mechanisms in these crabs. Cells were isolated and loaded with Fluo-3, a calcium fluorescent dye. Three different cell treatments were performed: Group 1 cells were Ca free during cell dissociation, and calcium was present (at 1\u00a0mM) for fluorescence cell loading and transport experiments (FC); Group 2 cells were calcium free during cell dissociation and for transport experiments, but not during cell loading (LC); and Group 3 cells were Ca free during cell dissociation, cell loading and transport experiments (WC). Intracellular Ca was recorded through time after ATP was added to the cells and ATP caused an increase in Ca efflux within 30\u00a0s in all cells. WC cells showed the smallest Ca efflux compared to the other cells, probably because it was intracellularly Ca \u201cdepleted\u201d. Vanadate and amiloride decreased the Ca efflux when ATP was added to the cells, while verapamil did not cause any effect in Ca efflux, confirming the presence of a Ca2+-ATPase sensitive to vanadate in hepatopancreas of D. pagei. In a different set of experiments, cells were also exposed to a Ca pulse of 1 and 10\u00a0mM during 180\u00a0s. 10\u00a0mM Ca increased intracellular Ca compared to 1\u00a0mM, and the increase was not recovered during the experimental time. Additionally, Ca influx was reduced by verapamil and amiloride, but not completely. The results suggest that Ca influx probably occurs through an undefined exchanger, apart from Ca channels (verapamil sensitive) and electrogenic 1Na+(1H+)/1 Ca2+ exchanger (amiloride-sensitive). Similarities between freshwater and seawater crabs, lobsters and crayfish in relation to plasma membrane Ca transporters, although the environment where they live is quite diverse, suggest that universal mechanisms for Ca homeostasis are widespread among crustaceans.",

Therefore, some tissues are rendered ischemic during a dive; with the first breath after a dive, blood flow to all tissues is reestablished. In terrestrial mammals, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production increases in response to ischemia/reperfusion and oxidative damage can occur. The capacity of marine mammals to tolerate repeated ischemia/reperfusion cycles associated with diving appears to be due to an enhanced antioxidant system. However, it is not known if diving depth and/or duration elicit differences in tissue capacity to produce ROS and antioxidant defenses in marine mammals. The objective of this study was to analyze ROS production, antioxidant defenses and oxidative damage in marine mammal species that perform shallow/short vs. deep/long dives. We measured production of superoxide radical (O2\u2022\u2212), oxidative damage to lipids and proteins, activity of antioxidant enzymes, and glutathione levels in tissues from shallow/short divers (Tursiops truncatus) and deep/long divers (Kogia spp.). We found that differences between the diving capacity of dolphins and Kogia spp. are reflected in O2\u2022\u2212 production and antioxidant levels. These differences suggest that shallow/short and deep/long divers have distinct mechanisms to successfully maintain redox balance.",

The present study was performed to investigate whether similar fatty acid sparing effects are developing in lactating sows. We considered PPAR\u03b1 and its target genes involved in fatty acid utilization in biopsy samples from muscle and adipose tissue of lactating compared to non-lactating sows. In muscle, PPAR\u03b1 target genes involved in fatty acid utilization were up-regulated during lactation indicating that the fatty acid utilization in muscle was increased. Activation of PPAR\u03b1 was probably due to increased concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids in plasma observed in the lactating sows. In contrast to muscle, PPAR\u03b1 and its target genes involved in \u03b2-oxidation in white adipose tissue were down-regulated in early lactation. Overall, the present study shows that sows, unlike rats, are not able to reduce the fatty acid utilization in muscle in order to spare fatty acids for milk production. However, fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissue is lowered during early lactation, an effect that might be helpful to conserve fatty acids released from adipose tissue for the delivery into other tissues, including mammary gland, via the blood.",

The head compartment representing the neural pool was quantitatively dominant (>\u00a080% of the total CCK content) while the digestive tract pool represented 6\u201310%. During ontogeny the CCK level in whole larvae increased almost 15-fold from 0 to 40 DAH, being particularly marked from 14 to 20 DAH. Larvae of 24 to 26 DAH were examined for potential occurrence of a circadian rhythm and to analyze the effects of feeding. Fed and fasted larvae were significantly different, where fed larvae showed higher CCK levels. There were large fluctuations in CCK levels analyzed at 3\u00a0h intervals without an apparent diurnal pattern. Shorter sampling intervals of 1\u00a0h in the morning when lights were switched gradually on and food was offered to the larvae demonstrated a marked drop in the relative gut CCK levels and a concurrent increase in the CCK carcass to gut ratio, 1\u00a0h after introduction of food followed by a return to prefeeding levels after 2\u00a0h. This response probably results from a release and re-synthesis of CCK in the gut after initiation of feeding. Taken together, these results support earlier reports that CCK participates in the regulation of digestive processes in herring larvae, but CCK does not seem to have a circadian rhythm independent of feeding.",

     "abstract": "As metabolism of motile fish sperm is not well understood, the current study examined the metabolism of saline-activated zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm. Activation of sperm with inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (potassium cyanide, 2,4 dinitrophenol or carbonyl cyanide 3-cholorophenylhydrazone) negatively impacted sperm motility by 60\u201390\u00a0s postactivation. Incubation of quiescent sperm with 2,4 dinitrophenol prior to activation resulted in a 67% decrease in the percent motile sperm assessed 15\u00a0s postactivation. Thus, production of ATP in quiescent sperm is important for motility upon activation and nascent ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation by motile sperm appears important at 60\u201390\u00a0s postactivation. Exposure of sperm to iodoacetamide, an inhibitor of creatine kinase, at activation was without effect. However, incubation of quiescent sperm with iodoacetamide prior to activation resulted in a 77% reduction in percent motile sperm and decreased velocity and wobble at 15\u00a0s postactivation. These results suggest that creatine kinase and phosphocreatine shuttle are physiologically important at, or shortly after the initiation of motility. Finally, sperm were exposed to lactate, pyruvate, or acetate as well as to several monosaccharides upon activation. The results provided no evidence supporting any metabolic role of exogenous organics (potentially from the female via ovarian fluid) in sperm once motility has begun.",

Digestion only caused a significantly lower Ucrit and MS in both the 0- and 1-week fasting groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The M \u02d9 O 2 increased greatly with the swimming speed, and digestion caused a higher M \u02d9 O 2 when compared to that of the fasting fish in any groups. The M \u02d9 O 2 of fish in the 4-week fasting group was significantly lower than that of other groups when the swimming speed was the same. In conclusion, both digestive and locomotive functions were down-regulated during fasting. In the 0- and 1-week fasting groups, the decreased MS for swimming during digestion caused a lower Ucrit (i.e., a digestion priority model). However, because the M \u02d9 O 2 active of digesting fish decreased much more slowly than that of fasting fish, the MS of the 2- and 4-week fasting groups did not change during digestion, and the fish could handle both physiological activities independently (i.e., an additive model).",

     "abstract": "The physiological ability to estivate is relevant for the maintenance of population size in the invasive Pomacea canaliculata. However, tissue reoxygenation during arousal from estivation poses the problem of acute oxidative stress. Uric acid is a potent antioxidant in several systems and it is stored in specialized tissues of P. canaliculata. Changes in tissue concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), uric acid and allantoin were measured during estivation and arousal in P. canaliculata. Both TBARS and uric acid increased two-fold during 45\u00a0days estivation, probably as a consequence of concomitant oxyradical production during uric acid synthesis by xanthine oxidase. However, after arousal was induced, uric acid and TBARS dropped to or near baseline levels within 20\u00a0min and remained low up to 24\u00a0h after arousal induction, while the urate oxidation product allantoin continuously rose to a maximum at 24\u00a0h after induction, indicating the participation of uric acid as an antioxidant during reoxygenation. Neither uric acid nor allantoin was detected in the excreta during this 24\u00a0h period. Urate oxidase activity was also found in organs of active snails, but activity shut down during estivation and only a partial and sustained recovery was observed in the midgut gland.",

In order to study metabolic and physiological responses to low oxygen conditions vs. no oxygen in mantle, gill, adductor muscle and hemocytes of the ocean quahog, specimens from the German Bight were maintained for 3.5\u00a0days under normoxia (21\u00a0kPa\u00a0=\u00a0controls), hypoxia (2\u00a0kPa) or anoxia (0\u00a0kPa). Tissue levels of anaerobic metabolites octopine, lactate and succinate as well as specific activities of octopine dehydrogenase (ODH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were unaffected by hypoxic incubation, suggesting that the metabolism of A. islandica remains fully aerobic down to environmental oxygen levels of 2\u00a0kPa. PO2-dependent respiration rates of isolated gills indicated the onset of metabolic rate depression (MRD) below 5\u00a0kPa in A. islandica, while anaerobiosis was switched on in bivalve tissues only at anoxia. Tissue-specific levels of glutathione (GSH), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicate no anticipatory antioxidant response takes place under experimental hypoxia and anoxia exposure. Highest specific ODH activity and a mean ODH/LDH ratio of 95 in the adductor muscle contrasted with maximal specific LDH activity and a mean ODH/LDH ratio of 0.3 in hemocytes. These differences in anaerobic enzyme activity patterns indicate that LDH and ODH play specific roles in different tissues of A. islandica which are likely to economize metabolism during anoxia and reoxygenation.",

The nicotinic agonists acetylcholine (ACh), carbacholine (CCh) and nicotine depolarize the RMP at concentrations of 5\u00a0\u03bcM and higher. The nicotinic antagonists (+)tubocurarine, \u03b1-bungarotoxin, muscarinic antagonists atropine and hexamethonium do not remove or prevent the CCh-induced depolarization. Verapamil, tetrodotoxin, removal of Cl\u2212 and Ca2+ from the solution also cannot prevent the depolarization by CCh. In a Na+-free medium, however, CCh lost this depolarization ability and this indicates that the drug opens the sodium permeable pathway. Serotonin, glutamate, glycine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (GABAC receptor antagonist) had no effect on the RMP. On the other hand, isoguvacin, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) hyperpolarized the RMP. Ouabain, bicucullin (GABAA antagonist) and phaclofen (GABAB antagonist), as well as the removal of Cl\u2212, suppressed the effect of GABA and baclofen. CCh did not enhance the depolarization generated by ouabain but, on the other hand, hindered the hyperpolarizing activity of baclofen both in the absence and presence of atropine and (+)tubocurarine. The long-term application of CCh depolarizes the RMP primarily by inhibiting the Na+/K+-ATPase. The muscle membrane also contains A and B type GABA binding sites, the activation of which increases the RMP at the expense of increasing the action of ouabain- and Cl\u2212 -sensitive electrogenic pumps.",

The goal of this study was to verify whether the scope for growth is principally dictated by the proteolytic capacity of the digestive system by examining the effect of protein hydrolysates (PH) and trypsin inhibitor dietary inclusion on protein digestion/assimilation capacities, growth and survival. Four experimental diets were examined: C (control) I (supplemented with 750\u00a0mg/kg soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI)) H (supplemented with 20% PH) and HI (supplemented with 20% PH and 750\u00a0mg/kg SBTI). Protein hydrolysate supplementation gave significantly higher body mass than control at day 15 post-hatching. Unexpectedly, at day 30 and 60, fish administered diet HI (containing trypsin inhibitor) were heavier than the other groups. Suggested mechanisms are presented and discussed. The main conclusions of this study are that wolffish larval stage lasts roughly 15\u00a0days and that juvenile growth is linked to proteolytic capacity, but also very likely to absorption capacity of peptides and amino acids.",

We tested the hypothesis whether genetic variation or phenotypic plasticity of cuticular traits confer adaptive protection against desiccation stress in two melanic Drosophila species living under drier montane localities. For D. melanogaster, changes in melanisation are known to be associated with reduced water loss but there are no data on D. busckii. We investigated changes in body melanisation, cuticular lipids, desiccation resistance, water loss, extractable hemolymph volume (%), and dehydration tolerance in six sympatric populations of D. busckii and D. melanogaster over an altitudinal range of 640\u20132236\u00a0m. D. busckii is a melanic species but changes in cuticular water loss are negatively correlated with cuticular lipid mass and not with body melanisation. In D. melanogaster, there are no plastic effects (14\u201328\u00a0\u00b0C) for cuticular lipid mass but variation in body melanisation is associated with desiccation-related traits. Effects of organic solvents (hexane or chloroform: methanol), developmental plasticity and seasonal variation in cuticular lipids affect body water loss in D. busckii but no such changes occur in D. melanogaster. Thus, sympatric populations of D. busckii and D. melanogaster have evolved different water balance mechanisms under shared environmental conditions in the western Himalayas. Multiple measures of desiccation resistance in these species show clinal variation with altitude, consistent with adaptation to increased desiccation stress.",

B. caissarum maintains tissue hydration through mucus production and dome-shape formation when challenged with air exposure or extreme salinities (fresh water or hypersaline seawater, 45\u00a0psu) for 1\u20132\u00a0h. Upon exposure to mild osmotic shocks for 6\u00a0h (hyposmotic: 25\u00a0psu, or hyperosmotic: 37\u00a0psu), B. caissarum was able to maintain its coelenteron fluid (CF) osmolality stable, but only in 25\u00a0psu. A. sargassensis CF osmolality followed the external medium in both salinities. Isolated cells of the pedal disc of B. caissarum showed full capacity for calcium-dependent regulatory volume decrease (RVD) upon 20% hyposmotic shock, at least partially involving the release of KCl via K+\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransport, and also of organic osmolytes. Aquaporins (HgCl2-inhibited) likely participate in this process. Cells of A. sargassensis showed partial RVD, after 20\u00a0min. Cells from both species were not capable of regulatory volume increase upon hyperosmotic shock (20%). Whole organism and cellular mechanisms allow B. caissarum to live in the challenging intertidal habitat, frequently facing air exposure and seawater dilution.",

Here we tested the effects of chronic leptin and anti-leptin treatments on the NO production and phytohaemagglutinin- (PHA) induced cutaneous inflammatory response in a wild passerine, the greenfinch (Carduelis chloris). Plasma leptin levels of individual birds were consistent in time but could be still temporarily increased by administration of recombinant chicken leptin. Increase of plasma leptin was also induced by administration of anti-leptin, which can be most likely explained by increased endogenous leptin production due to disruption of signalling pathways. Contrary to previous findings in mammals, leptin administration reduced systemic NO production. Leptin increased cutaneous swelling response to PHA. This immune-enhancing effect was observable despite the similar plasma leptin levels of leptin-treated and control birds at the time of measurement of immune responses, i.e., 9\u00a0days after start of the treatments. This provides evidence for a delayed or long-term potentiation of the cells and cytokines involved. The effects of leptin administration on NO production and immune responsiveness were age-dependent, which indicates the complexity of underlying regulatory mechanisms.",

Furthermore, exposure of cells to 10\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM curcumin for 24\u00a0h induced HSP30 and HSP70 accumulation. This phenomenon was controlled at the transcriptional level since pre-treatment of cells with KNK437, a heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) inhibitor, repressed HSP accumulation. Additionally, elevation of the incubation temperature from 22 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C greatly enhanced the curcumin-induced accumulation of HSP30 and HSP70. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that curcumin-induced HSP30 was detectable primarily in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern with minimal detrimental effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, prior exposure of cells to curcumin conferred a state of thermotolerance since it protected them against a subsequent cytotoxic thermal challenge. These findings are of importance given the interest in identifying agents that can upregulate HSP levels with minimal effects on cell structure or function as a therapeutic treatment of protein folding diseases.",

Direct calorimetry, however, can accurately quantify HP and thus metabolic rate (MR) in both metabolically normal and abnormal states, whereas respirometric indirect calorimetry relies on important assumptions that apparently have never been tested in animals with genetic or pharmacologically-induced alterations that dysregulate metabolic fuel partitioning and storage so as to promote obesity and/or diabetes. Contemporary obesity and diabetes research relies heavily on metabolically abnormal animals. Recent data implicating individual and group variation in the gut microbiome in obesity and diabetes raise important questions about transforming aerobic gas exchange into HP because 99% of gut bacteria are anaerobic and they outnumber eukaryotic cells in the body by \u223c\u00a010-fold. Recent credible work in non-standard laboratory animals documents substantial errors in respirometry-based estimates of HP. Accordingly, it seems obvious that new research employing simultaneous direct and indirect calorimetry (total calorimetry) will be essential to validate respirometric MR phenotyping in existing and future pharmacological and genetic models of obesity and diabetes. We also detail the use of total calorimetry with simultaneous core temperature assessment as a model for studying homeostatic control in a variety of experimental situations, including acute and chronic drug administration.

     "abstract": "Many birds spend important portions of their time and energy flying. For this reason, quantification of metabolic rates during flight is of crucial importance to understanding avian energy balance. Measurement of organismal gas exchange rates using a mask enclosing the whole head or respiratory orifices has served as an important tool for studying animal energetics because it can free the rest of the body, permitting movement. Application of so-called \u201cmask respirometry\u201d to the study of avian forward flight energetics presents unique challenges because birds must be tethered to gas analysis equipment thus typically necessitating use of a wind tunnel. Resulting potential alterations to a study organism's behaviour, physiology, and aerodynamics have made interpretation of such studies contentious. In contrast, the study of hovering flight energetics in hummingbirds using a specialized form of mask respirometry is comparatively easy and can be done without a wind tunnel. Small size, hovering flight, and a nectarivorous diet are characteristics shared by all hummingbird species that make these birds ideally suited for this approach. Specifically, nectar feeders are modified to function as respirometry masks hummingbirds voluntarily respire into when hover-feeding. Feeder-mask based respirometry has revealed some of the highest vertebrate metabolic rates in hovering hummingbirds. In this review I discuss techniques for the successful measurement of metabolic rate using feeder-mask respirometry. I also emphasize how this technique has been used to address fundamental questions regarding avian flight energetics such as capacities for fuel use and mechanisms by which ecology, behaviour and energy balance are linked.",

     "abstract": "Under most circumstances heart rate (fH) is correlated with the rate of oxygen consumption ( V \u02d9 o 2 ) and hence the rate of energy expenditure or metabolic rate (MR). For over 60\u00a0years this simple principle has underpinned the use of heart rate to estimate metabolic rate in a range of animal species and to answer questions about their physiology, behaviour and ecology. The heart rate method can be applied both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative approach is a two-stage process where firstly fH and MR are measured simultaneously under controlled conditions and a predictive calibration relationship derived. Secondly, measurements of heart rate are made and converted to estimates of MR using the calibration relationship. The qualitative approach jumps directly to the second stage, comparing estimates of fH under different circumstances and drawing conclusions about MR under the assumption that a relationship exists. This review describes the range of studies which have adopted either the quantitative or qualitative approach to estimating the MR of birds, mammals and reptiles. Studies have tended to focus on species, states and questions which are hard to measure, control or define using other techniques. For example, species studied include large, wide-ranging species such as ungulates, marine predators, and domestic livestock while research questions have concerned behaviours such as flight, diving and the effects of stress. In particular, the qualitative approach has applied to circumstances and/or species where it may be hard or impossible to derive a calibration relationship for practical reasons. The calibration process itself can be complex and a number of factors such as body mass, activity state and stress levels can affect the relationship between fH and V \u02d9 o 2 . I recommend that a quantitative approach be adopted wherever possible but that this may entail deriving a calibration relationship which is practical and applicable, rather than the most accurate possible. I conclude with a series of recommendations for the application and development of this method.",

Acceleration data loggers are generally easy to deploy and the measures recorded appear robust to slight variation in location and orientation. This review discusses important issues concerning the accelerometry technique for estimating energy expenditure and ODBA; deriving ODBA, calibrating ODBA, acceleration logger recording frequencies, scenarios where ODBA is less likely to be valid, and the power in recording acceleration and heart rate together. While present evidence suggests that ODBA may not quantify energy expenditure during diving by birds and mammals, several recent studies have assessed changes in mechanical work in such species qualitatively through variation in ODBA during periods of submergence. The use of ODBA in field metabolic studies is likely to continue growing, supported by its relative ease of use and range of applications.",

     "abstract": "The doubly labeled water (DLW) method has been essential for understanding animal energetics of free-ranging individuals. The first published studies on free-ranging seabirds were conducted on penguins in the early 1980s. Since then, nearly 50 seabird species with representatives from each major taxonomic order have been studied using DLW. Although the basic methodology has not changed, there are at least nine different equations, varying with respect to assumptions on fractionation and the total body water pool, to estimate field metabolic rate (FMR) from isotopic water turnover. In this review, I show that FMR can vary by as much as 45% depending on the equation used to calculate CO2 production in five albatross species. Energy budgets derived from DLW measurements are critical tools for understanding patterns of energy use and allocation in seabirds. However, they depend on accurate and representative measurements of FMR, so analyses that include greater partitioning of activity specific FMR yield more realistic cost estimates. I also show how the combined use of DLW and biologging methods can 1) provide greater clarity for explaining observed variation in FMR measurements within a species and 2) allow FMRs to be viewed in a wider physiological, behavioral, or ecological context. Finally, I update existing allometric equations with new FMR data. These updates reaffirm that albatrosses have the lowest at-sea FMRs per equivalent body mass and that individuals of other seabird orders have FMRs ranging between 1.39 and 2.24 times higher than albatrosses.",

     "abstract": "During starvation, energy production occurs at the expense of body reserve utilisation which results in body mass loss. Knowing the role of the fuels involved in this body mass loss, along with their energy density, can allow an energy equivalent of mass loss to be calculated. Therefore, it is possible to determine daily energy expenditure (DEE) if two body mass loss measurements at an interval of a few days are obtained. The technique can be cheap, minimally stressful for the animals involved, and the data relatively simple to gather. Here we review the use of body mass loss to estimate DEE in birds through critiquing the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, and detail the methodology and considerations that must be adhered to for accurate measures of DEE to be obtained. Owing to the biology of the species, the use of the technique has been used predominantly in Antarctic seabirds, particularly penguins and albatrosses. We demonstrate how reliable the technique can be in predicting DEE in a non-Antarctic species, common eiders (Somateria mollissima), the female of which undergoes a fasting period during incubation. We conclude that using daily body mass loss to estimate DEE can be a useful and effective approach provided that (1) the substrate being consumed during mass loss is known, (2) the kinetics of body mass loss are understood for the species in question and (3) only species that enter a full phase II of a fast (where substrate catabolism reaches a steady state) and are not feeding for a period of time are appropriate for this method.",

     "abstract": "Infrared thermography (IRT) is a technique that determines surface temperature based on physical laws of radiative transfer. Thermal imaging cameras have been used since the 1960s to determine the surface temperature patterns of a wide range of birds and mammals and how species regulate their surface temperature in response to different environmental conditions. As a large proportion of metabolic energy is transferred from the body to the environment as heat, biophysical models have been formulated to determine metabolic heat loss. These models are based on heat transfer equations for radiation, convection, conduction and evaporation and therefore surface temperature recorded by IRT can be used to calculate heat loss from different body regions. This approach has successfully demonstrated that in birds and mammals heat loss is regulated from poorly insulated regions of the body which are seen to be thermal windows for the dissipation of body heat. Rather than absolute measurement of metabolic heat loss, IRT and biophysical models have been most useful in estimating the relative heat loss from different body regions. Further calibration studies will improve the accuracy of models but the strength of this approach is that it is a non-invasive method of measuring the relative energy cost of an animal in response to different environments, behaviours and physiological states. It is likely that the increasing availability and portability of thermal imaging systems will lead to many new insights into the thermal physiology of endotherms.",

     "abstract": "The relationship between body mass (M) and metabolic rate (MR) typically accounts for most (>\u00a090%) of the inter-specific variation in MR. As such, when measurement of a species of interest is not possible, its MR can often be predicted using M. However, choosing an appropriate relationship to make such predictions is critical, and the choice is complicated by ongoing debate about the structure of the relationship between M and MR. The present study examines a range of methods including ordinary least squares (OLS), reduced major axis (RMA), and phylogenetically-informed (PI) approaches for estimating log(MR) from log(M), as well as non-linear approaches for estimating the relationship between MR and M without the need for log-transformation. Using data for the basal metabolic rates of mammals, it is shown that RMA regression overestimates the scaling exponent of MR (b, where MR\u00a0=\u00a0aMb), suggesting that OLS regression is appropriate for these data. PI approaches are preferred over non-PI ones, and the best estimates of log(MR) are obtained by including information on body temperature, climate, habitat, island endemism, and use of torpor in addition to log(M). However, the use of log-transformed data introduces bias into estimates of MR, while the use of non-linear regression underestimates MR for small mammals. This suggests that no single relationship is appropriate for describing the relationship between MR and M for all mammals, and that relationships for more narrow taxonomic groups or body mass ranges should be used when predicting MR from M.",

     "abstract": "Studying energetics of marine top predators is essential to understand their role within food-webs and mechanisms associated with their survival and population dynamics. Several methods exist to estimate energy expenditure in captive and free-ranging animals. However, most of them are difficult to implement, restrained to specific periods, and are consequently inappropriate for seabirds. Supplementary and complementary approaches are therefore needed, and the use of modelling appears as an excellent option allowing energetic studies when field data collection is challenging. Currently three main energetics models are used, with various degrees of complexity and accuracy: allometric equations, time\u2013energy-budget analyses and thermodynamic models. However, a comparison of their practicability and accuracy was still lacking. Here, we present an overview of these 3 model types, their characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and areas of application in seabirds. We then investigate their accuracy by using them in parallel for the same dataset, and by comparing outputs with direct measurements (doubly-labelled water technique). We show that, when detailed data are available, time\u2013energy\u2013budget analysis is the best model to accurately predict seabird energy expenditures. Conversely, thermodynamic modelling allows reasonably accurate calculations when field data are scarce, and is therefore ideal to study energetics during the inter-breeding season.",

HIF-1 is composed of an oxygen-regulated \u03b1 subunit (HIF-1\u03b1) and a constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit (HIF-1\u03b2). Taiwan voles (Microtus kikuchii) are an endemic species in Taiwan, found only in mountainous areas greater than 2000\u00a0m above sea level. In this study, the full-length HIF-1\u03b1 cDNA was cloned and sequenced from liver tissues of Taiwan voles. We found that HIF-1\u03b1 of Taiwan voles had high sequence similarity to HIF-1\u03b1 of other species. Sequence alignment of HIF-1\u03b1 functional domains indicated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) and C-terminal transactivation (TAD-C) domains were conserved among species, but sequence variations were found between the oxygen-dependent degradation domains (ODDD). To measure Taiwan vole HIF-1\u03b1 responses to hypoxia, animals were challenged with cobalt chloride, and HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression in brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, and muscle was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Upon induction of hypoxic stress with cobalt chloride, an increase in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels was detected in lung, heart, kidney, and muscle tissue. In contrast, protein expression levels showed greater variation between individual animals. These results suggest that the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 may be important to the Taiwan vole under cobalt chloride treatments. But more details regarding the evolutionary effect of environmental pressure on HIF-1\u03b1 primary sequence, HIF-1\u03b1 function and regulation in Taiwan voles remain to be identified.",

Most studies have focused on low salinity acclimation, the activation of osmoregulatory mechanisms, and the induction of transport protein and transport-related enzyme activity and gene expression. In this study we followed the changes in hemolymph osmolality, carbonic anhydrase activity, and mRNA expression of three proteins through a complete cycle of low (15\u00a0ppt) and high (32\u00a0ppt) salinity acclimation. One week of low salinity acclimation resulted in hemolymph osmoregulation and a four-fold induction of branchial carbonic anhydrase activity. Relative mRNA expression increased for two CA isoforms (CAc 100-fold, and CAg 7-fold) and the \u03b1-subunit of the Na/K-ATPase (8-fold). Upon re-exposure to high salinity, hemolymph osmolality increased to 32\u00a0ppt acclimated levels by 6\u00a0h, and mRNA levels returned to high salinity, baseline levels within 1\u00a0week. However, CA activity remained unchanged in response to high salinity exposure for the first week and then gradually declined to baseline levels over 4\u00a0weeks. The relative timing of these changes suggests that while whole-organism physiological adaptations and regulation at the gene level can be very rapid, changes at the level of protein expression and turnover are much slower. It is possible that the high metabolic cost of protein synthesis and/or processing could be the underlying reason for long biological life spans of physiologically important proteins.",

This study was aimed at characterizing patterns of expression for genes encoding receptors for the GH/PRL-family of hormones in the gill and kidney of Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) during freshwater (FW)-acclimation. Transfer of seawater (SW)-acclimated tilapia to FW elicited rapid and sustained increases in plasma levels and pituitary gene expression of PRL177 and PRL188; plasma hormone and pituitary mRNA levels of GH were unchanged. In the gill, PRL receptor 1 (PRLR1) mRNA increased markedly after transfer to FW by 6\u00a0h, while increases in GH receptor (GHR) mRNA were observed 48\u00a0h and 14\u00a0d after the transfer. By contrast, neither PRLR2 nor the somatolactin receptor (SLR) was responsive to FW transfer. Paralleling these endocrine responses were marked increases in branchial gene expression of a Na+/Cl\u2212 cotransporter and a Na+/H+ exchanger, indicators of FW-type mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs), at 24 and 48\u00a0h after FW transfer, respectively. Expression of Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter, an indicator of SW-type MRCs, was sharply down-regulated by 6\u00a0h after transfer to FW. In kidney, PRLR1, PRLR2 and SLR mRNA levels were unchanged, while GHR mRNA was up-regulated from 6\u00a0h after FW transfer to all points thereafter. Collectively, these results suggest that the modulation of the gene expression for PRL and GH receptors in osmoregulatory tissues represents an important aspect of FW-acclimation of tilapia.",

     "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. They play a crucial role in lipid metabolism processes such as bile acid and fatty acid synthesis, as well as minor or limited roles in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in mammals. In avian species, however, little is known about the role of LXRs except for the fact that they are involved in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis. In this study, we characterize the expression profile of genes related to bile acid, cholesterol, and fatty acid synthesis and VLDL secretion in chicken primary hepatocytes treated with T0901317, a synthetic agonist of LXR. The activity of chicken cholesterol 7\u03b1 hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in bile acid synthesis, mRNA expression, and bile acid excretion, was stimulated by supplementation of the culture medium with a low concentration (0.01 \u03bcM) of T0901317. In contrast, the levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1, fatty acid synthase mRNA, and VLDL-triacylglycerol in cells cultured in the presence of a high concentration (10 \u03bcM) of T0901317 were higher than those cultured in zero or low concentrations of T0901317. These results suggest that cellular responses to this LXR agonist were similar to those present in mammals. A novel finding of this study concerned changes to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes treated with T0901317. Levels of SREBP-2,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) mRNA expression increased as a function of increasing T0901317 (up to 1.0 \u03bcM), but remained similar to those in cells cultured under control conditions when the concentration of T0901317 was increased to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. These results suggest that LXRs play an important role in cholesterol synthesis and uptake in chicken hepatocytes and, as such, differ to findings in mammals where the effect of LXR agonists on cholesterol synthesis plays only a minor role in the regulation of cellular sterol homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Air-breathing fish are common in the tropics, and their importance in Asian aquaculture is increasing, but the respiratory physiology of some of the key species such as the striped catfish, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus Sauvage 1878 is unstudied. P. hypophthalmus is an interesting species as it appears to possess both well-developed gills and a modified swim bladder that functions as an air-breathing organ indicating a high capacity for both aquatic and aerial respiration. Using newly developed bimodal intermittent-closed respirometry, the partitioning of oxygen consumption in normoxia and hypoxia was investigated in P. hypophthalmus. In addition the capacity for aquatic breathing was studied through measurements of oxygen consumption when access to air was denied, both in normoxia and hypoxia, and the critical oxygen tension, Pcrit, was also determined during these experiments. Finally, gill ventilation and air-breathing frequency were measured in a separate experiment with pressure measurements from the buccal cavity. The data showed that P. hypophthalmus is able to maintain standard metabolic rate (SMR) through aquatic breathing alone in normoxia, but that air-breathing is important during hypoxia. Gill ventilation was reduced during air-breathing, which occurred at oxygen levels below 8 kPa, coinciding with the measured Pcrit of 7.7 kPa. The findings in this study indicate that the introduction of aeration into the aquaculture of P. hypophthalmus could potentially reduce the need to air-breathe. The possibility of reducing air-breathing frequency may be energetically beneficial for the fish, leaving more of the aerobic scope for growth and other activities, due to the proposed energetic costs of surfacing behavior.",

Therefore, these strains might adapt differently on extreme environmental factors such as exposure to high CO2. The aim of this study was to compare broiler and layer embryos in their adaptation to 4% CO2 from embryonic days (ED) 12 to 18. Due to hypercapnia, blood pCO2 increased in both strains. Blood bicarbonate concentration was ~\u00a010\u00a0mmol/L higher in embryos exposed to high CO2 of both strains, while the bicarbonates of broilers had ~\u00a05\u00a0mmol/L higher values than layer embryos. In addition, the pH increased when embryos of both strains were exposed to CO2. Moreover, under CO2 conditions, the blood potassium concentration increased in both strains significantly, reaching a plateau at ED14. At ED12, the layer strain had a higher increase in CAII protein in red blood cells due to incubation under high CO2 compared to the broiler strain, whereas at ED14, the broiler strain had the highest increase. In conclusion, the most striking observation was the similar mechanism of broiler and layer embryos to cope with high CO2 levels.",

However, the function of Ctsb during embryogenesis, particularly in marine teleosts, has been poorly documented. In this study, the spatio-temporal expression of Ctsb and Ctsla, their enzymatic activities, and the processing of the Ctsb and its cellular localization, was investigated in developing embryos of the killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). Both fhctsb and fhctsla transcript levels, as well as cathepsin B- and L-like activities, gradually increased in embryos from the 2\u20134 cell stage up to 7 days post-fertilization. During the morula to gastrula transition an increase of the active FhCtsb single chain form was followed by a rise in cathepsin B activity, which were apparently regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. During neurulation, a 8-fold increase in cathepsin B activity was accompanied by a more moderate increase in cathepsin L activity, which was 6-fold enhanced by 7\u00a0dpf. These increased catalytic activities were well-correlated to changes in the electrophoretic pattern of yolk proteins and a strong expression of fhctsb and its protein product in the yolk syncytial layer. The increase of cathepsin B activity was further correlated with an increment of the relative amount of the FhCtsb single and double chain forms, both active forms of FhCtsb. These results suggest that FhCtsb may be involved in the mechanisms underlying the onset of gastrulation in F. heteroclitus embryos, and may play complementary roles with FhCtsla during yolk metabolism.",

In this study, we examined respiration and oxidative stress in adult Alphitobius diaperinus exposed to FTRs and to constant low temperatures. We hypothesized that cold exposure will cause oxidative stress and that FTRs would reduce the amount of chill injuries, via activation of the antioxidant system. We measured V \u02d9 CO 2 , activities of super oxide dismutase (SOD), amounts of total (GSHt) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) during cold and warm periods of FTRs. Increased severity of cold exposure caused a decrease in the glutathione pool. SOD levels increased during the recovery period in the more severe FTR. The antioxidant response was sufficient to counter the reactive oxygen species production, as the GSH:GSSG ratio increased. We conclude that cold stress causes oxidative damage in these beetles, and that a warm recovery period activates the antioxidant system allowing repair of cold-induced damage, leading to the increased survival previously noted in beetles exposed to fluctuating versus constant temperatures.",

     "abstract": "In seasonal climatic regimes, animals have to deal with changing environmental conditions. It is reasonable to expect that seasonal changes are reflected in animal overall energetics. The relation between daily energy expenditure (DEE) and seasonally variable ecological determinants has been studied in many free-living small mammals; however with inconsistent results. Subterranean mammals, i.e. fossorial (burrowing) mammals which live and forage underground, live in a seasonally and diurnally thermally stable environment and represent a suitable model to test seasonality in DEE in respect to seasonal changes, particularly those in soil characteristics and access to food supply. Both factors are affected by seasonal rainfall and are supposed to fundamentally determine activity of belowground dwellers. These ecological constraints are pronounced in some tropical regions, where two distinct periods, dry and rainy seasons, regularly alternate. To explore how a tropical mammal responds to an abrupt environmental change, we determined DEE, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and sustained metabolic scope (SusMS) in a solitary subterranean rodent, the silvery mole-rat, at the end of dry season and the onset of rainy season. Whereas RMR did not differ between both periods, mole-rats had 1.4 times higher DEE and SusMS after the first heavy rains. These findings suggest that rainfall is an important environmental factor responsible for higher energy expenditure in mole-rats, probably due to increased burrowing activity. SusMS in the silvery mole-rat is comparable to values in other bathyergids and all bathyergid values rank among the lowest SusMS found in endothermic vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "Elevated stress experienced by a mother can compromise both her own reproductive success and that of her offspring. In this study, we investigated whether chronically stressed mothers experienced such effects in cooperatively breeding species, in which helpers at the nest potentially compound the negative effects of maternal stress. Using Neolamprologus pulcher, a group-living cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika, we observed the effects of experimentally increased stress on female reproductive success (measured as inter-spawn interval, and number of eggs) as well as egg characteristics including egg size and cortisol concentrations. Stress levels were manipulated by repeated exposure to the acute stresses of chasing and netting. Stressed females had longer inter-spawn intervals and laid fewer, smaller eggs. Although no significant differences in egg cortisol concentrations were detected between control and stressed females, egg cortisol concentration fell between spawns in control but not in stressed fish. No effect of helper number was detected for any parameter examined, except there appeared to be less change in egg cortisol content in groups with helpers present. Our results suggest that stress imposes fitness costs on breeding females, and social regulation of a dominance hierarchy does not appear to exacerbate or alleviate the negative effects of maternal stress.",

Groups of fish were fed 1.5% of the body weight per day or offered no feed for 4\u00a0weeks. Another group of fish was not fed for 3\u00a0weeks and feed was offered during the fourth week. Fish in each group were sampled immediately before or after a 15-min low water confinement stressor after each week of the experiment. Liver mass and liver glycogen content were decreased after one week of fasting and remained low until the end of the study. However, both recovered after a week of refeeding. Intraperitoneal fat was significantly lower after two weeks of fasting and did not recover after a week of refeeding. None of these components were affected by confinement stress. Plasma glucose in unstressed fish was generally unaffected by fasting or refeeding; however, plasma glucose increased after confinement stress in fed but not in fasted fish. The cortisol stress response was unaltered by fasting and remained robust. Plasma IGF-I generally decreased in fasted fish but was not significantly lower than fed fish until the fourth week. A week of refeeding did not restore plasma IGF-I concentrations. Plasma IGF-I concentrations were higher in confinement stressed fed fish after two and four weeks but were unchanged in the fourth week. There was no change in the plasma IGF-I concentrations in fasted or refed fish due to the stress. Liver weight and liver glycogen were essentially depleted after 2\u00a0weeks of fasting. The reduction of liver glycogen greatly reduced the glucose response to stress; however, the cortisol stress response was maintained for at least four weeks of fasting. Intraperitoneal fat was decreased very little after 4\u00a0weeks of fasting. Plasma IGF-I concentrations were reduced only after 3\u00a0weeks of fasting.",

Removal of RY did not affect survival, shell growth, or resting metabolic rates of turtles for 40 d after hatching. Our estimates of metabolic rate suggest that RY can fuel maintenance and activity metabolism for approximately 25\u00a0days. A. mutica absorb more than 1\u00a0g of water in the first 2 weeks of life, which appears to be the basis of post-hatch shell expansion rather than yolk-provisioned growth. Post-hatch growth may be limited by the magnitude of RY remaining at hatching, but RY protein and lipid proportions do not differ from those of freshly-laid eggs. In addition, A. mutica did not use RY to fuel nest emergence. Our results suggest that RY does not fulfill several hypothetical functions in A. mutica, including postnatal growth, catabolic fuel for nest emergence, and long-term nutritional sustenance for maintenance, activity, or hibernation. Instead, A. mutica appear to absorb most yolk prior to hatching, and are left with a minimum of RY. Variation in RY mass with incubation regime in other species suggests that mothers may overprovision their eggs to ensure successful development across a diversity of possible incubation conditions.",

     "abstract": "Somatostatin is well known as an inhibitor of growth hormone release from the anterior pituitary. Its effects are exerted via 5 subtypes of receptors, which are named SSTR1 through 5. We recently reported that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of somatostatin stimulates feeding behavior in chicks. However, the specific receptors which mediate this orexigenic effect have not been identified in chicks. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to identify the receptor subtypes involved in somatostatin-induced feeding using 5 somatostatin analogs. Chicks that received vapreotide and octreotide (less than 3\u00a0nmol), which are agonist of SSTR2 and SSTR5, increased their food intake. Additionally, chicks ICV injected with BIM23056 or L-817,818 (SSTR3 and SSTR5 agonists, respectively) also had increased food intake. However, ICV injection of the SSTR4 agonist L-803,087 did not cause an orexigenic effect, suggesting that SSTR4 might not be important in somatostatin-induced feeding behavior. In summary, results from this study may be interpreted as SSTR2, SSTR3 and SSTR5 are related to somatostatin-associated feeding behavior in chicks.",

     "abstract": "Teleost fish store lipids among several tissues primarily as triacylglycerol (TG). Upon metabolic demand, stored TGs are hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). In this study, two distinct cDNAs encoding HSL were isolated, cloned, and sequenced from adipose tissue of rainbow trout. The full-length cDNAs, designated HSL1 and HSL2, were 2562-bp and 2887-bp in length, respectively, and share 82% nucleotide identity. Phylogentic analysis suggests that the two HSLs derive from paralogous genes that may have arisen during a teleost-specific genome duplication event. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that HSL1 and HSL2 were differentially expressed, both in terms of distribution among tissues as well as in terms of abundance within selected tissues of juvenile trout. HSL1 and HSL2 mRNAs were detected in the brain, spleen, pancreas, kidney, gill, intestine, heart, and white muscle, but were most abundant in the red muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. HSL1 mRNA was more abundant than HSL2 mRNA in the adipose tissue, whereas HSL2 mRNA was more abundant than HSL1 mRNA in the liver. Short term fasting (4\u00a0weeks) increased HSL1 and HSL2 mRNA expression in the adipose tissue, but only HSL1 mRNA levels increased in the liver and the red muscle. During a prolonged fast (6\u00a0weeks), there was continued elevation of HSL1 and HSL2 mRNA levels in the liver and muscle; HSL mRNA expression in mesenteric fat declined, coincident with depletion of mesenteric fat mass. Refeeding fish reduced HSL expression to levels seen in continuously fed fish. These findings indicate that the pattern of HSL expression is consistent with the diverse lipid storage pattern of fish and suggest that distinct mechanisms serve to regulate differential expression of the two HSLs in tissues and during a progressive fast.",

     "abstract": "Climate change affects organisms that inhabit not only in aerial but also in aquatic environments by making water more hypoxic and acidic. In the past, we evaluated morphological and functional variations in the gills of 12 species of aquatic air-breathing fishes. The aim of the present study is to examine the degree of gill modification in the aquatic air-breathing fish, Trichogaster lalius, in response to acidic stress. This provides a link between the ecological and physiological studies. We evaluated the changes in morphology and function of the gills, labyrinth organ, and kidney when the fish were subjected to acidic water and deionized water (DW). In the first experiment, fish were sampled at 1, 2, 4, and 7\u00a0days after acidic treatment. Apparent morphological modification was observed on day 4 and recovery was noted on day 7. Protein expression and enzyme activity of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA) and the protein expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) of the 1st and 4th gill arches both increased in the 4-day and 7-day acidic groups while the enzyme activity of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) decreased. In the second experiment, fish were tested for changes in the 1st and 4th gill arches and kidney after exposure to DW and acidic water for 4\u00a0days. The gill structure of the fish in the DW was not different from that of the control group (fresh water). The protein expression and enzyme activity of the VHA of the 1st and 4th gill arches increased in both the DW and acidic groups for 4\u00a0days. We found a decrease in the protein expression of NKA in the kidney and in the enzyme activity of NKA in the 1st and 4th gill arches in the DW and acidic groups. From these results, we suggest that T. lalius exhibited significantly different ionic regulation and acid-base regulatory abilities in the DW and acidic groups in the 1st and 4th gill arches and kidney. The responses of the gills in T. lalius were different from those fish that show apparent morphological variations between the 1st and 4th gill arches.",

We found that relative lung mass is 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% of body mass which is significantly less than it is in other mammals (1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1%). Total lung volume is significantly smaller (46.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121) than in similar sized mammals (75.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121). The lung volume:body mass ratio decreases during growth rather than increase as it does in other mammals. Tracheal diameter is significantly narrower than in similar sized mammals but dead space volume (2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121) is larger than in similar sized mammals (2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121). Our calculations suggest that tidal volume (10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121) is increased compared to that in other mammals(10.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mL\u00a0kg\u22121) so that the dead space:tidal volume ratio is the same as in other mammals.

Calculated dynamic lung volumes were the same as in similar sized mammals. We have concluded that giraffe morphology has resulted in lung volumes that are significantly different to that of similar sized mammals, but these changes do not compromise ventilatory capacity.",

There are large sequence differences among mammalian and teleost Lep, both at the gene and protein level. Therefore, in order to characterize Lep function in fish, the use of species-specific Lep is crucial. In this study, the cDNA sequence of salmon leptin a1 (lepa1) was used to establish a production protocol for recombinant salmon LepA1 (rsLepA1) in Escherichia coli, that enabled a final yield of 1.7\u00a0mg\u00a0pure protein\u00a0L\u22121 culture. The effects of 20-day administration of rsLepA1 on growth and brain neuroendocrine peptide gene expression [npy, cart, agrp (-1 and -2), pomc (-a1, -a2, -a2s, and -b)] were studied in juvenile, immature Atlantic salmon (96.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0g) fed a commercial diet to satiation. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were used to deliver rsLepA1 at four different concentrations (calculated pumping rates were 0, 0.1, 1.0 and 10\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0h\u22121). In the highest dosage group (10\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0h\u22121), the growth rate was significantly reduced, and pomc-a1 gene expression was higher than in controls. The results support the lipostatic hypothesis and suggest that sLepA1 reduces growth in Atlantic salmon by affecting food intake through the central pro-opiomelanocortin pathway.",

Changes in plasma osmolality levels and sex steroids are known to affect AVT gene expression. The present study reports the effect of water deprivation and testosterone treatment independently, as well as simultaneously, on the pituitary vasotocin receptor VT2R expression and adrenal steroidogenic activity in sexually immature male chicken (Gallus gallus). Birds were divided into four groups\u2014 control, water deprived (WD), testosterone injected (TE) and TE treated water deprived (TE\u00a0+\u00a0WD). WD decreased and TE treatment alone or in combination with WD (TE\u00a0+\u00a0WD) increased VT2R expression compared to the control. Expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) was also studied since this gene is a polypeptide precursor of ACTH and is under the negative feedback of adrenal corticoids. TE treatment as well as WD separately or when coupled together decreased the POMC mRNA expression in the pituitary but stimulated adrenal steroidogenic activity. Further, VT2R expression decreased in TE\u00a0+\u00a0WD compared to TE group, but it was not different from the vehicle treated control group suggesting that the suppressive effect of WD on VT2R expression was inhibited by the stimulatory effect of testosterone. Similarly, although both TE and WD decreased POMC expression and increased steroidogenic activity, no further decrease or increase in these parameters was observed when these two (WD and TE) treatments were combined together. Although, the exact mechanism is not clear, data indicate a stimulatory action of testosterone on VT2R expression and adrenal function despite a decreased expression of POMC mRNA. Results also suggest that testosterone treatment to sexually immature birds, in addition to its effect on hypothalamic AVT neurons (earlier study) and pituitary VT2R expression (present study), masks or inhibits osmotic stress-induced alterations in pituitary\u2013adrenal activity.",

     "abstract": "Differences in the allometric scaling between gut capacity (with body mass, BM1.00) and food intake (with BM0.75) should theoretically result in a scaling of digesta retention time with BM0.25 and therefore a higher digestive efficiency in larger herbivores. This concept is an important part of the so-called \u2018Jarman\u2013Bell principle\u2019 (JBP) that explains niche differentiation along a body size gradient in terms of digestive physiology. Empirical data in herbivorous mammals, however, do not confirm the scaling of retention time, or of digestive efficiency, with body mass. Here, we test these concepts in herbivorous reptiles, adding data of an experiment that measured food intake, digesta retention, digestibility and gut capacity in 23 tortoises (Testudo graeca, T. hermanni , Geochelone nigra, G. sulcata, Dipsochelys dussumieri) across a large BM range (0.5\u2013180\u00a0kg) to a literature data collection. While dry matter gut fill scaled to BM1.07 and dry matter intake to BM0.76, digesta mean retention time (MRT) scaled to BM0.17; the scaling exponent was not significantly different from zero for species >\u00a01\u00a0kg. Food intake level was a major determinant of MRT across reptiles and mammals. In contrast to dietary fibre level, BM was not a significant contributor to dry matter digestibility in a General Linear Model. Digestibility coefficients in reptiles depended on diet nutrient composition in a similar way as described in mammals. Although food intake is generally lower and digesta retention longer in reptiles than in mammals, digestive functions scale in a similar way in both clades, indicating universal principles in herbivore digestive physiology. The reasons why the theoretically derived JBP has little empirical support remain to be investigated. Until then, the JBP should not be evoked to explain niche differentiation along a body size axis in terms of digestive physiology.",

     "abstract": "Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from several subpopulations undergo extended fasting during the ice-free season. However, the animals appear to conserve protein despite the prolonged fasting, though the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We hypothesized that elevated concentrations of corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), the primary cortisol binding protein in circulation, lead to cortisol resistance and provide a mechanism for protein conservation during extended fasting. The metabolic state (feeding vs. fasting) of 16 field sampled male polar bears was determined based on their serum urea to creatinine ratio (>\u00a025 for feeding vs. <\u00a05 for fasting). There were no significant differences in serum cortisol levels between all male and female polar bears sampled. Serum CBG expression was greater in lactating females relative to non-lactating females and males. CBG expression was significantly higher in fasting males when compared to non-fasting males. This leads us to suggest that CBG expression may serve as a mechanism to conserve protein during extended fasting in polar bears by reducing systemic free cortisol concentrations. This was further supported by a lower serum glucose concentration in the fasting bears. As well, a lack of an enhanced adrenocortical response to acute capture stress supports our hypothesis that chronic hunger is not a stressor in this species. Overall, our results suggest that elevated serum CBG expression may be an important adaptation to spare proteins by limiting cortisol bioavailability during extended fasting in polar bears.",

Type-III MR cells with a concave surface or pit were transformed into type-IV MR cells with an enlarged pit, via a transitory surface. Our findings indicate functional plasticity of type-III/IV MR cells to switch ion-transport functions, whereas type-II MR cells are considered to be specific for freshwater adaptation.",

     "abstract": "The response of isolated hepatocytes of Sparus aurata to hypotonic shock was studied by the aid of videometric and light scattering methods. The isolated cells exposed to a rapid change (from 370 to 260\u00a0mOsm/kg) of the osmolarity of the bathing solution swelled but thereafter underwent a decrease of cell volume tending to recovery the original size. This homeostatic response RVD (regulatory volume decrease) was inhibited in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and in the presence of TMB8, an inhibitor of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. It is likely that Ca2+ entry through verapamil sensitive Ca2+-channels, probably leading to a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is responsible for RVD since the blocker impaired the ability of the cell to recover its volume after the hypotonic shock. RVD tests performed in the presence of various inhibitors of different transport mechanisms, such as BaCl2, quinine, glybenclamide and bumetanide as well as in the presence of a KCl activator, NEM, led us to suggest that the recovery of cell volume in hypotonic solution is accomplished by an efflux of K+ and Cl\u2212 through conductive pathways paralleled by the operation of the KCl cotransport, followed by an obliged water efflux from the cells.",

     "abstract": "Molting in decapod crustaceans is regulated by ecdysteroids produced by a pair of Y-organs (YOs) located in the cephalothorax. YO ecdysteroidogenesis is suppressed by molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a neuropeptide produced in the X-organ of the eyestalk (ES) ganglia. MIH signaling may involve nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC-I). A full-length cDNA encoding Carcinus maenas NOS (Cm-NOS; 3836 base pairs) of 1164 amino acid residues (estimated mass 131,833\u00a0Da) was cloned with 88% identity to Gecarcinus lateralis NOS (Gl-NOS). End-point reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that Cm-NOS was expressed at varying levels in the YO, testis, ovary, hepatopancreas, midgut, hindgut, heart, thoracic ganglion, and skeletal muscle and was not detected in the gill. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed localization of NOS and cGMP in the steroidogenic cells and the surrounding connective tissue layer of the C. maenas YO. ES ablation (ESA) induced molting in G. lateralis; hemolymph ecdysteroid titers increased during premolt and reached a peak of about 400\u00a0pg/\u03bcL at 20\u00a0days and 24\u00a0days post-ESA. By contrast, ESA did not induce molting in C. maenas; hemolymph ecdysteroid titers increased about 2-fold (53 to 121\u00a0pg/\u03bcL) by 3\u00a0days post-ESA and remained at that level at 7\u00a0days post-ESA. Real time PCR was used to quantify the effects of ESA on the expression of NOS in C. maenas and G. lateralis YOs. ESA caused 32-fold and 5-fold increases in Gl-NOS and Cm-NOS transcripts by 24\u00a0days and 7\u00a0days post-ESA, respectively, which were correlated with hemolymph ecdysteroid levels. In addition, GC-I catalytic subunit (Gl-GC-I\u03b2) mRNA level increased 7.4-fold by 24\u00a0days post-ESA, but there was no significant effect of ESA on membrane GC (Gl-GC-II) mRNA level. These data indicate that the YO up-regulates NO signaling components in response to withdrawal of ES neuropeptides.",

We performed Ussing chamber studies with porcine (Sus scrofa) colon epithelium under physiological conditions and examined individual mucosal disappearance, metabolized loss, tissue concentrations and serosal release of acetate, propionate and butyrate by gas chromatography. Reduction of initial SCFA concentrations from 80 to 40\u00a0mmol/L resulted in diminished absolute flux rates, but the relative proportions of mucosal disappearance and intracellular metabolization of individual SCFA were slightly enhanced. Simulation of high fermentation rates by lowering the mucosal pH induced an increase in mucosal disappearance and serosal release of all SCFA, while their tissue contents trended to lower levels. With respect to the metabolization at lowered pH we found increased acetate concentrations and a decrease of propionate and butyrate. Our data indicate that the colon epithelium possesses a high adaptive capacity to ensure its energetic maintenance under various intraluminal fermentation rates by utilizing the unique features of individual SCFA as energy sources.",

A respiratory chamber experiment was conducted with six rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus, 1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31\u00a0kg body mass) and six guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus, 0.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0kg) offered grass hay ad libitum.

Methane production was similar for both species (0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0L d\u2212\u00a01 and 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0L d\u2212\u00a01) and represented 0.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 and 1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29% of gross energy intake in rabbits and guinea pigs, respectively. In relation to body mass (BM) guinea pigs produced significantly more methane. The data on methane per unit of BM obtained in this study and from the literature on the methane output of elephant, wallabies and hyraxes all lay close to a regression line derived from roughage-fed horses, showing an increase in methane output with BM. The regression, including all data, was nearly identical to that based on the horse data only (methane production in horses [L d\u2212\u00a01]\u00a0=\u00a00.18 BM [kg]0.97 (95%CI 0.92\u20131.02)) and indicates linear scaling. Because feed intake typically scales to BM0.75, linear scaling of methane output translates into increasing energetic losses at increasing BM. Accordingly, the data collection indicates that an increasing proportion of ingested gross energy is lost because relative methane production increases with BM. Different from ruminants, such losses (1%\u20132% of gross energy) appear too small in non-ruminant herbivores to represent a physiologic constraint on body size. Nevertheless, this relationship may represent a physiological disadvantage with increasing herbivore body size.",

Here I review the evidence that dietary lipid fat composition affects exercise in birds. Seasonal changes in adipose composition and diet choice experiments have yet to provide strong evidence that fatty acid composition can affect flight performance. Direct manipulations of dietary fat, however, have been demonstrated to affect exercise performance in both avian and non-avian species. I also describe the major hypotheses for the mechanisms by which dietary fat affects exercise, focusing on the role of fatty acids as oxidative substrates and as structural components of membranes. Evidence is accumulating that fatty acids that are shorter or have more double bonds increase peak performance due to their higher transport rates en route to oxidation. Endurance and efficiency of flight may or may not be affected in similar ways. Other mechanisms requiring further investigation include membrane composition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and eicosanoid-mediated inflammation. Finally, I develop a theoretical framework for studying the composition of fat stores in migrants, focusing on the tradeoffs between fatty acid transport rates, energy storage, and assimilation during stopover refueling.",

Iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (dio2) did not differ among strains but showed a sex-specific expression pattern. When supplemented with selenium, all strains spent a greater proportion of time near the front of the tank, but the response of vertical swimming depth varied by strain. Selenium supplementation also caused changes in selenoprotein expression in the brain that varied by strain for sepp1a, secp43, and dio2, and varied by strain and sex for txnrd1. Expression of gpx3 was unaffected by selenium. Our data indicate that selenium homeostasis in the brain may be a regulator of behavior in zebrafish, and the strain-specific effects of selenium supplementation suggest that genetic heterogeneity among populations can influence the results of selenium supplementation studies.",

Modulation of C. limacina swimming speed involves changes that occur at the network and cellular levels. Intracellular recordings from interneurons of the swim central pattern generator show the presence of a sag potential that is indicative of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih). Here we provide evidence that Ih in primary swim interneurons plays a role in C. limacina swimming speed control and may be a modulatory target. Recordings from central pattern generator swim interneurons show that hyperpolarizing current injection produces a sag potential that lasts for the duration of the hyperpolarization, a characteristic of cells possessing Ih. Following the hyperpolarizing current injection, swim interneurons also exhibit postinhibitory rebound (PIR). Serotonin enhances the sag potential of C. limacina swim interneurons while the Ih blocker, ZD7288, reduces the sag potential. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between the amplitude of the sag potential and latency to PIR. Because latency to PIR was previously shown to influence swimming speed, we hypothesize that Ih has an effect on swimming speed. The Ih blocker, ZD7288, suppresses swimming in C. limacina and inhibits serotonin-induced acceleration, evidence that supports our hypothesis.",

Mstn inhibits skeletal muscle growth in vertebrates and may play a role in crustacean muscle as a suppressor of protein synthesis. Sequence analysis and three-dimensional modeling of the Ha-Mstn protein predicted a high degree of conservation with vertebrate and other invertebrate myostatins. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated ubiquitous expression of transcript in all tissues, including skeletal muscles. Quantitative PCR analysis was used to determine the effects of natural molting and eyestalk ablation (ESA) on Ha-Mstn expression in the cutter claw (CT) and crusher claw (CR) closer muscles and deep abdominal (DA) muscle. In intermolt lobsters, the Ha-Mstn mRNA level in the DA muscle was significantly lower than the mRNA levels in the CT and CR muscles. Spontaneous molting decreased Ha-Mstn mRNA during premolt, with the CR muscle, which is composed of slow-twitch (S1) fibers, responding preferentially (82% decrease) to the atrophic signal compared to fast fibers in CT (51% decrease) and DA (69% decrease) muscles. However, acute increases in circulating ecdysteroids caused by ESA had no effect on Ha-Mstn mRNA levels in the three muscles. These data indicate that the transcription of Ha-Mstn is differentially regulated during the natural molt cycle and it is an important regulator of protein turnover in molt-induced claw muscle atrophy.",

The highest plasma glucose and insulin levels were observed 6\u00a0h after feeding in fish receiving the 30%PGS diet. Although plasma IGF-I was higher at 6\u00a0h than at 24\u00a0h after feeding, no effect of dietary carbohydrate level was noticed within each sampling time. Increasing dietary carbohydrate level resulted in an increase of liver but not of muscle glycogen content. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities increased with the dietary carbohydrate content, whereas pyruvate kinase (PK) activity was higher in fish fed the carbohydrate containing diets than the carbohydrate-free diet. GK activity was higher 6\u00a0h than 24\u00a0h after feeding, whereas the opposite was observed for G6PD activity. Data suggest that under the nutritional conditions assayed plasma glucose is an insulin secretagogue.

We found that most blood parameters of lizards varied significantly following captivity, and this variation was sex-, morph- and size-dependent.

This trend was reversed in red females, where smaller individuals presented raised H:L index at release. Our study indicated that response to long-term stressful conditions, such as those induced by captivity, differed among common wall lizard colour morphs, implying a sex-, size-(i.e. age) and morph-specific sensitivity to stress, and hence a different physiological profile of colour morphs, which may contribute to the maintenance of colour polymorphism in this species.",

Concentrations in other brain regions, while highly variable among individuals, were not different between groups.

     "abstract": "The critical swimming speed (Ucrit, cm\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) of whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, exposed to various temperatures (17, 20, 25, and 29\u00a0\u00b0C), salinities (20, 25, 30, 35, and 40), and starvation days (1, 4, and 8\u00a0d), was determined in a flume tank. Body length (5.5, 6.6, 7.3, 9.4, and 10.0\u00a0cm) was also studied in relation to the Ucrit. Temperature, salinity, body length and starvation significantly affected the Ucrit of whiteleg shrimp. The Ucrit increased as temperature increased from 17 to 29\u00a0\u00b0C. The relationship between temperature (t, \u00b0C) and Ucrit can be described by the linear model as Ucrit\u00a0=\u00a01.5916t\u00a0+\u00a00.8892, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9992 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The Ucrit increased and then decreased as salinity increased from 20 to 40. The optimum salinity and the corresponding maximum Ucrit are 36.17 and 42.87\u00a0cm\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, respectively. The relationship between salinity (s) and Ucrit can be described by the quadratic model as Ucrit\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.0171\u00a0s2\u00a0+\u00a01.2371\u00a0s\u00a0+\u00a020.497, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.7667 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.234). The Ucrit increased as body length increased from 5.5 to 10.0\u00a0cm, whereas relative critical swimming speed (Ucrit\u2032, BL\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) decreased. The relationship between body length (l, cm) and Ucrit or Ucrit\u2032 can be described by the quadratic model as Ucrit\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.6233\u00a0l2\u00a0+\u00a012.302\u00a0l\u00a0\u2212\u00a020.264, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9942 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) or Ucrit\u2032\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.0514\u00a0l2\u00a0+\u00a00.5351\u00a0l\u00a0+\u00a03.8132, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9862 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The Ucrit decreased as starvation days increased from 1 to 8\u00a0d.

     "abstract": "In holometabolous insects, the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), in coordination with juvenile hormone, regulates the major developmental events that promote larval development and the transition from the larval to the pupal stage. Intimately entwined with the hormonal control of development is the control of larval growth and the acquisition of energy stores necessary for the development of the non-feeding pupa and immature adult. Studies of the coordination of insect development and growth have suggested that the larval fat body plays a central role in monitoring animal size and nutritional status by integrating 20E signaling with the insulin signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that tissue-specific loss of 20E signaling in the fat body causes pupal lethality (Cherbas et al., 2003). Because the fat body is the major organ responsible for nutrient homeostasis, we hypothesized that the observed pupal mortality is due to a metabolic defect. In this paper we show that disruption of 20E signaling in the fat body does not disrupt nutrient storage, animal size at pupariation, or nutrient utilization. We conclude that 20E signaling in the fat body is not necessary for normal pupal metabolism.",

     "abstract": "The nature of ammonia and urea excretion was examined in the Pacific hagfish (Eptatretus stoutii), which, under resting conditions, excreted similar quantities of nitrogen as either ammonia or urea. In the presence of high external ammonia (HEA) concentrations, ammonia was taken up at high rates and then excreted at similarly high rates upon return to normal water. However, although elevated by HEA, plasma ammonia levels were maintained at approximately 1\u20134\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0N\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01, reflecting time-dependent decreases in the rates of ammonia uptake, the possible conversion of ammonia to urea, and the potential active excretion of ammonia against a gradient. Internal injections of NH4Cl caused marked increases in the rate of ammonia excretion and a delayed increase in urea excretion that may have resulted from increasing urea levels in the plasma. Conversely, when the rate of urea excretion was reduced in the presence of 0.1\u00a0mM phloretin, ammonia excretion was significantly elevated. Rates of urea excretion were initially increased by approximately 1000-fold following internal urea injections while the presence of high external urea levels (5\u2013100\u00a0mM final concentration) resulted in associated linear increases in plasma urea levels. Using hagfish skin mounted in Ussing chambers, the rate of diffusion of ammonia across the skin exceeded that of urea by approximately four times when equivalent gradients were imposed. Based on western blotting and immunocytochemistry, hagfish gill appears to possess Rh proteins (Rhag, Rhbg and Rhcg1) and urea transporter proteins. Despite the tolerance of hagfish to high levels of ammonia and urea, it is suggested that the presence of ammonia and urea transporter proteins may be required during the period of time hagfish spend in burrows or while feeding, when conditions of high ammonia and/or urea might be encountered.",

In experiment I, chickens were fed either 0, 25 or 50\u00a0mg lutein in a diet with 3% PUFA fat. In experiment II, chickens were fed either 3 or 6% PUFA fat with 25\u00a0mg lutein. At 23\u00a0d of age, chickens were injected with LPS. LPS injection decreased the lutein content and increased the fat content in the liver and spleen in both experiments. Increasing dietary PUFA fat to 6% ameliorated the LPS-induced lutein depletion in experiment II. LPS injection increased IL-1 and decreased splenic PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, RXR\u03b1 mRNA in experiment I and II. The LPS-induced PPAR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b1 downregulation were partially reversed by increasing the dietary lutein content to 50\u00a0mg/kg feed in experiment I and by increasing the dietary PUFA fat content to 6% in experiment II. Increasing dietary lutein content to 50\u00a0mg/kg feed increased PPAR\u03b3 mRNA amount only in the LPS untreated groups in experiment I. Increasing dietary PUFA fat or LPS injection in the 6% PUFA fat group upregulated PPAR\u03b3 mRNA in experiment II. Increasing dietary PUFA fat to 6% blunted the increase in IL-1 mRNA due to LPS. It is concluded that dietary lutein and PUFA fat were anti-inflammatory due to modification of immune tissue lutein content, PPAR, RXR isomers and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels in liver and spleen.",

Our results showed that differences in organ mass were not good predictors for the observed variations in BMR, while variations in the activity of thyroid hormones and the metabolic biochemical markers of tissues, such as mitochondria density, cytochrome c oxidase activity and state 4 respiration, were strongly correlated with variations in BMR, and there was also a positive relationship between residuals of T3/T4 and state 4 respiration, suggesting that thyroid hormones play an important role in the determination of BMR variations.",

     "abstract": "To investigate the effect of dissolved oxygen level ([O2]) on maintenance metabolism, feeding metabolism, aerobic swimming performance and their metabolic interaction in juvenile southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis Chen), we measured the following: (1) the resting oxygen consumption rate (MO2rest) over a range of water [O2] and from this we calculated the critical oxygen tension (Pcrit) of fasting fish; (2) the postprandial MO2 response (10% body mass meal size) at water [O2] of 1, 2, 4 and 8\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01; and (3) the swimming performance of fasting and digesting fish at water [O2] of 1, 2, 4 and 8\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The MO2rest remained constant over a broad range of water [O2] but then dropped markedly upon reaching the Pcrit (16.4% saturation). Hypoxic groups presented lower peak postprandial MO2 (MO2peak) (1\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 group), larger energy expenditure and longer digestive process (both 1 and 2\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) than those of normoxic groups. Both critical swimming speed (Ucrit) and the active metabolic rate (MO2active) of fasting fish remained unchanged over a decrease in water [O2] from 8 to 4\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 and then decreased significantly with further decreases in water [O2]. These parameters in fed fish showed a pronounced decrease as water [O2] decreased from 8 to 1\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. Feeding caused a significantly lower Ucrit in the 2\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 water [O2] group, a significantly higher MO2active in both the 2 and 8\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 water [O2] groups and a significantly higher metabolic scope (MO2active\u00a0\u2212\u00a0MO2rest) in both the 2 and 4\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 water [O2] groups compared to fasting fish. The MO2 increased greatly with swimming speed in the higher water [O2] groups, whereas it leveled off as swimming speeds approached the Ucrit in the lower water [O2] groups. Within all water [O2] groups, feeding caused a higher MO2 compared to fasting fish when fish swam at the same speeds, except in the 1\u00a0mgO2\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 group. This finding showed that the critical water [O2] for maintenance of metabolism, digestion, swimming and postprandial swimming increased sequentially due to the increasing O2 demand, which challenges respiratory capacity. With the administration of the medium-sized meal that was used in this study, the metabolic mode of juvenile southern catfish changed from an additive mode during normoxia to a digestion-priority mode under moderate hypoxia and to locomotion-priority mode under hypoxia.",

The ontogeny of osmoregulation in Sparus aurata was studied at successive stages, from day 1 (D1) post-hatch to the late juvenile stage (D300) after exposure to different salinities ranging from fresh water to 45.1\u2030, at 18\u00a0\u00b0C. Survival ranged from between 5.1 and 39.1\u2030 at D3, and from 1.0 to 45.1\u2030 from D75. The fish were hyper-hypo-osmotic regulators at all studied stages. The acquisition of the full ability to hypo- and hyper-regulate occurred in four steps. The osmoregulatory capacity appeared age-dependent and reached its maximum level after D96, and the localization of ionocytes in the integument and gills occurred concurrently during development of the sea bream. However, the main site of osmoregulation shifted from the integument to the gills from D30 to D70, with a corresponding sharp increase in the osmoregulatory ability. Our results suggest that the early development of osmoregulatory ability, and thus of salinity tolerance in the sea bream may provide an advantageous flexibility for the timing of the migration between sea and estuaries and lagoons.",

Similar to diapause and hibernation, it is characterized by low levels of activity, a drastically suppressed metabolic rate and enhanced stress resistance. We tested the hypothesis that Achatina fulica, a pulmonate land snail, enhances stress resistance during estivation and/or arousal by upregulating intracellular antioxidant defenses in the heart, kidney, hepatopancreas and foot tissues. No statistically significant changes in mitochondrial or cytosolic superoxide dismutase levels or activities, or glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase or catalase activities were associated with estivation in any tissue, however. In contrast, during arousal from estivation, activities of several antioxidant enzymes increased in heart, hepatopancreas and foot. In heart, a rapid increase in MnSOD protein levels was observed that peaked at 2\u00a0h post arousal, but no such change was observed in CuZnSOD protein levels. Glutathione peroxidase activity was upregulated at 1\u00a0h post arousal and remained elevated until 8\u00a0h post arousal in heart tissue. Glutathione peroxidase was also upregulated at 24\u00a0h post arousal in foot tissue. Glutathione reductase activity was upregulated at 4\u00a0h post arousal in heart and foot tissues whereas catalase activity showed no changes. Markers of lipid peroxidation and protein damage revealed no significant increases during estivation or arousal. Therefore, antioxidant enzymes may play a role in oxidative stress defense specifically during arousal from estivation in A. fulica.",

Its intimacy to the cell's antenna, namely the primary cilia, makes it also involved in some signaling transduction pathways. To test the idea that KIF3A functions during spermiogenesis of the octopod Octopus tankahkeei, we hereby identified a gene (designated as ot-kif3a) encoding a protein apparently homologous to a group of KIF3As, from the testis of this organism. The full-length ot-kif3a comprised a 344\u00a0bp 5' untranslated region, a 2241\u00a0bp open reading frame and a 147\u00a0bp 3' untranslated region. The putative protein consisted of 746 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 85\u00a0kDa and a predicted isoelectric point of 6.36. It shared an overall sequence identity of 69%, 69%, 69% and 67% to KIF3A from Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Danio rerio, respectively. Tissue distribution profile analysis unraveled its presence in all the tissues examined. In situ hybridization of mRNA in spermionenic cells demonstrated that ot-kif3a was expressed moderately at the beginning of spermiogenesis. The abundance of transcripts increased in intermediate spermatid and peaked in drastically remodeling and final spermatids. In mature sperm, the message was still visible in the head and tail. The temporal and spatial expression dynamics of ot-kif3a during spermiogenesis supports the possibility that the putative motor protein, OtKIF3A, participates in the major cytological events during this differentiation program and is vital for the acquisition of the final cellular phenotype.",

Here we present evidence that cod have a functional BAL and a non-functional pancreatic lipase related protein (PLRP). The Atlantic cod genome does not seem to contain colipase which is essential for pancreatic lipase activity. During the larval stages, the gene expression of BAL was low until the point when pyloric caeca started to differentiate and develop (~\u00a020\u00a0mm standard length (SL)). Then the expression increased until ~\u00a050\u00a0mm SL. The PLRP gene was expressed but showed very little regulation. The activity of neutral lipase did not increase in parallel to gene expression. The mismatch between activity and gene expression measurements may be partly explained by the unspecific analytical method, when analysing lipase activity in larva whole body. There is neutral lipase activity in numerous tissues in the fish larvae and the lipase activity in the gut, relatively to activity in the whole body, decreased with age. Furthermore, neutral lipase activity in rotifers was ten times higher than in whole cod larvae with full guts. Activity originating from the live prey may therefore explain the high whole body lipase activity from 3 to 20\u00a0dph. The results also indicate that \u201cadult type\u201d digestion of neutral lipid develops late in the larval period (from 20\u00a0mm SL), while other mechanisms of lipid uptake are active at the early larval stage.",

Following exposure of freshwater (FW) tilapia to 25\u2030 seawater (SW), we measured plasma osmolality, [Na+], [K+], [Cl\u2212], hematocrit, cortisol concentration, oxygen-consumption rate (\u1e40O2), and ventilation frequency over 5\u00a0days and compared them to FW control fish. Cortisol increased rapidly by 3\u00a0h and remained elevated for 3\u00a0days. Plasma osmolality, [Na+], and [Cl\u2212] were elevated at 6\u20138\u00a0h, peaked 24\u00a0h following SW exposure, and then decreased to near-FW levels by 3\u00a0days. \u1e40O2 increased at 24\u00a0h post-SW exposure relative to FW, while ventilation frequency increased by 3\u00a0h. Overall, we interpret changes in cortisol as resulting from a change in salinity, in contrast to changes in plasma solute concentrations that could be due to adjustments resulting from the fish's cortisol response as it faces osmoregulatory distress. Increases in oxygen-consumption rate at 24\u00a0h and ventilation frequency at 3\u00a0h are likely as a result of the cellular stress response occurring during salinity stress. No significant changes in blood hematocrit were observed, which suggests that tilapia are capable of rapidly counteracting dehydration during acute hyperosmotic stress.",

Chickens (19-day-old) were exposed to either constant heat stress (34\u00a0\u00b0C) or kept at control temperature (24\u00a0\u00b0C) for 14\u00a0days. Mitochondrial ROS production for control group showed little changes during the experimental periods, whereas that for the heat-stressed group was increased after 3, 5 and 9\u00a0days of heat exposure and returned to original levels at day 14. Mitochondrial membrane potential in state 4 for heat-stressed birds was higher than those of control birds after 3 and 5\u00a0days, but was not at day 14. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in state 3 was increased after 3 and 5\u00a0days, and also returned to original levels by day 14. These results suggest that chronic heat stress induces increased ROS production in skeletal muscle mitochondria, probably via elevation of the membrane potential \uf020in state 4, resulting from enhanced oxygen consumption in the initial stage of heat exposure. These physiological changes were no longer observed at day 14, possibly because the animals had acclimatized to environmental heat stress.",

Genes encoding GK, G6Pase, GS and GP were partially cloned and characterized from silver sea bream liver and real-time PCR assays were developed for the quantification of the mRNA expression profiles of these genes in order to evaluate the potential of these carbohydrate metabolic pathways. GK mRNA level was elevated by GH and hIGF-I, implying that GH-induced stimulation of GK expression may be mediated via IGF-I. GH was found to elevate GS and G6Pase expression, but reduce G6PDH mRNA expression. However, hIGF-I did not affect mRNA levels of GS, G6Pase and G6PDH, suggesting that GH-induced modulation of GS, G6Pase and G6PDH expression levels is direct, and occurs independently of the action of IGF-I. T3 and T4 directly upregulated transcript abundance of GK, G6Pase, GS and GP. Cortisol significantly increased transcript amounts of G6Pase and GS but markedly decreased transcript abundance of GK and G6PDH. These changes in transcript abundance indicate that (1) the potential of glycolysis is stimulated by GH and thyroid hormones, but attenuated by cortisol, (2) gluconeogenic and glycogenic potential are augmented by GH, thyroid hormones and cortisol, (3) glycogenolytic potential is upregulated by thyroid hormones but not affected by GH or cortisol, and (4) the potential of the pentose phosphate pathway is attenuated by GH and cortisol but unaffected by thyroid hormones.",

In the present paper the acute effects of different salinities and temperatures on routine metabolism, spontaneous activity and excretion of ammonia and urea were studied in two freshwater fish: gambusia, Gambusia affinis and zebrafish, Danio rerio, acclimated to 27\u00a0\u00b0C. The effects on gill morphology were also evaluated. Five salinities (0\u2030, 10\u2030, 20\u2030, 30\u2030 and 35\u2030) were tested in gambusia, while four salinities were used in zebrafish (0\u2030, 10\u2030, 20\u2030 and 25\u2030). Each salinity acute stress was tested alone or in combination with an acute temperature reduction to 20\u00a0\u00b0C. In gambusia, both salinity and temperature acute stress strongly stimulated urea excretion. Routine oxygen consumption was barely affected by acute salinity or temperature stress, and was reduced by the combined effects of temperature and high salinity. Gills maintained their structural integrity in all stressing conditions; hyperplasia and hypertrophy of mitochondria-rich cells were observed. In zebrafish, temperature and salinity acute changes, both alone and in combination, scarcely affected any parameter tested. The major effect observed was a reduction of nitrogen excretion at 20\u00a0\u00b0C\u201325\u2030; under these extreme conditions a significant structural disruption of gills was observed. These results confirm the high tolerance to acute salinity and temperature stress in gambusia, and demonstrate the involvement of urea excretion modulation in the stress response in this species.",

The current study aimed to determine whether this MyHC variant is specific to a particular muscle fibre type, as a change in net charge to the loop 1 region of Variant A3 could be functionally significant. The localisation of different fibre types within the abdominal musculature of several gammarid species revealed that the deep flexor and extensor muscles are fast-twitch muscle fibres. The dorsal superficial muscles were identified as slow fibres and the muscles extrinsic to the pleopods were identified as intermediate fibres. Amplification of loop 1 region mRNA from isolated superficial extensor and deep flexor muscles, and subsequent liquid chromatography and sequence analysis revealed that Variant A3 was the primary MyHC variant in slow muscles, and the conserved A1 sequence was the primary variant in fast muscles. The specific role of Variant A3 in the slow muscles remains to be investigated.",

To explore its functions during the same process in the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNA of a mammalian KIFC1 homologue (termed es-KIFC1) from the total RNA of the testis. The 2340\u00a0bp es-KIFC1 cDNA contained a 102\u00a0bp 5\u2032 untranslated region, a 117\u00a0bp 3\u2032 untranslated region and a 2121\u00a0bp open reading frame.

Protein alignment demonstrated that es-KIFC1 had 36.9%, 37.3%, 36.6%, 37.6%, and 37.5% identity with its homologues in chicken, human, mouse, zebrafish and African clawed frog, respectively. The phylogenetic tree revealed that es-KIFC1 is more related to vertebrate KIFC1 than invertebrate (NCD). Tissue expression analysis showed the presence of es-KIFC1 in the testis, hepatopancreas, gill, muscle and heart. In situ hybridization showed that the es-KIFC1 mRNA was localized in the proacrosomal vesicle and the periphery of the nuclear membrane in early and middle spermatids. In late spermatids and spermatozoa, es-KIFC1 was expressed in the acrosomal tubule and the band between the acrosome and the nucleus. Therefore, es-KIFC1 probably performs critical functions in the spermiogenesis of E.sinensis.",

However, arousal was not affected in broiler chicks treated with orexin-A, but they spent less time feeding.

     "abstract": "Significant repeatability of a trait of interest is an essential assumption for undertaking studies of phenotypic variability. It is especially important in studies on highly variable traits, such as metabolic rates. Recent publications suggest that resting/basal metabolic rate of homeotherms is repeatable across wide range of species. In contrast, studies on the consistency of standard metabolic rate (SMR) in ectotherms, particularly fish, are scarce. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of several important technical aspects of body mass-corrected SMR measurements and its repeatability in a small (average weight \u223c\u00a03\u00a0g) fish, the spined loach (Cobitis taenia). First we demonstrated that release of oxygen from the walls of metabolic chambers exposed to hypoxic conditions did not confound SMR measurements. Next, using principle of propagation of measurement uncertainties we demonstrated that in aquatic systems, measurement error is significantly higher in open than closed respirometry setups. The measurement error for SMR of a small fish determined in a closed aquatic system is comparable to that obtainable using top-notch open-flow systems used for air-breathing terrestrial animals. Using a closed respirometer we demonstrated that body mass-corrected SMR in spined loaches was repeatable under both normoxia and hypoxia over a 5-month period (Pearson correlation r\u00a0=\u00a00.68 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.73, respectively) as well as across both conditions (intraclass correlation coefficient \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00.30). In these analyses we accounted for possible effect of oxygen consumption of the oxygen electrode on repeatability of SMR. Significant SMR consistency was accompanied by significant repeatability of body mass (intraclass correlation coefficient \u03c4\u00a0=\u00a00.86). To our knowledge, this is the first study showing long-term repeatability of body mass and SMR in a small fish, and is consistent with the existence of heritable variation of these two traits.",

Blood glucose levels were higher in fed bats (6.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mmol/L) than fasted bats (4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0mmol/L), whereas insulin levels were similar in both conditions.

These bats showed a marked \u03b2-cell distribution along the pancreas, and the pancreatic \u03b2 cells are not exclusively located at the central part of the islet. The insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation was more pronounced in the pectoral muscle, compared to liver.

Temperature compensation mechanisms have been reported, which enable organisms to minimize some of the temperature related effects. To investigate this process, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were acclimated to a control (26\u00a0\u00b0C), an increased (34\u00a0\u00b0C) or a decreased (18\u00a0\u00b0C) temperature for 4, 14 and 28\u00a0days. In general, warm acclimation depleted energy stores and decreased the condition factor, while cold acclimation increased both. The energy parameters as well as the transcriptional responses (investigated using printed 15k microarrays and real time PCR) indicated that warm acclimation was particularly stressful. However, after 28\u00a0days of warm acclimation, energy stores had recovered from the initial depletion. This could have been facilitated by the observed downregulation of transcripts involved in catabolic processes. Transcriptional regulation seemed to be an important means of coordinating the temperature compensation process. We could distinguish an early response which was independent of the direction of the temperature change and a direction specific long-term response. The early response was characterized by the upregulation of defence mechanisms, tissue regeneration and hemopoiesis. In the long-term response there was a strong emphasis on compensating for the altered metabolic rate as well as cell structure and replacement.",

Video analysis revealed that desmonemes discharged at forces of 3.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0N; stenoteles required forces of 1.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a02\u00a0N. Desmonemes not directly stimulated discharged if another desmoneme was adequately stimulated; the effect was carried through to at least two adjacent battery cells. Tentacles responded to desmoneme stimulation, by bending at the stimulation site. These findings imply afferent excitatory pathways between nematocytes onto other nematocytes and myonemes. Locomotory nematocysts (atrichous isorhizas) discharged only in hypostome-attached tentacles contacting a substrate; desmonemes and stenoteles did not discharge during substrate attachment, implying differential neuronal inhibition. At low concentrations, bath-applied mucin, a prey-associated glycosylated protein, lowered desmoneme and stenotele firing thresholds, abolishing the force dose-dependency in stenoteles, and allowing them to discharge at previously below threshold forces. At higher concentrations, mucin inhibited discharge, suggesting an involvement in prey-induced feeding inhibition.",

     "abstract": "This paper traces the research history of fish ventilation from its origins in the early 1700s to the present with emphasis on the work of George M. Hughes, who is considered by many to be the founder of the modern era of fish respiratory science. A particularly important year in the timeline for fish respiratory studies was 1960, when Hughes presented the currently accepted biomechanical model driving fish ventilation. He showed that both bony and cartilaginous fishes breathe through the use of a dual-pumping mechanism: a buccal or orobranchial pressure pump to force water over the gills and an opercular or parabranchial suction pump to pull water through the branchial chambers. Hughes divided this mechanism into four stages and demonstrated that during each the pressure of the buccal cavity usually exceeded that of the opercular chamber, thus indicating the continuous, or nearly continuous, nature of the ventilatory stream. Studies by Hughes and later researchers focused on variation in the four stages and related these to interspecific differences in fish habitat and activity level. Differences noted in the respiration of pelagic and benthic species largely led to the description and quantification of ram ventilation. Hughes further made significant contributions to the correlation of gill structure and function and was one of the first to examine gill morphometrics in relation to the ventilatory stream and the diffusivity of oxygen from the water into the blood. Such pioneering measurements paved the way toward the modern analyses of gill hydromechanics and the modeling of respiratory gas exchange in fishes.",

Using RT-PCR to survey tissue distribution of nkcc1a, 1b, and 2, we report that gills of brackish medaka prominently express Odnkcc1a. The full-length cDNA of Odnkcc1a was cloned from gill tissue. In situ hybridization indicates that Odnkcc1a was localized to mitochondrion-rich (MR) cells. Higher mRNA levels of Odnkcc1a were found in gills from seawater (SW) and brackish water (BW) medaka when compared to freshwater (FW) fish. Furthermore, higher amounts of NKCC1a-like protein were detected by the monoclonal antibody in gills of SW and BW medaka compared to FW medaka. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that NKCC1a-like protein colocalizes with Na+, K+\u2013ATPase on the basolateral membrane of MR cells in BW and SW fish. In addition, transfer of brackish medaka from SW to FW revealed that expression of NKCC1a-like protein in gills was retained until 7\u00a0days, which is a likely mechanism for maintaining hyposmoregulatory endurance. The study illustrates salinity-dependent expression of NKCC1a in branchial MR cells from brackish medaka and suggests a critical role for NKCC1a in hyposmoregulatory endurance of this fish.",

     "abstract": "Maternal investment by oviparous amniotes, in the form of yolk and albumen, and the mechanisms by which embryos use available energy and nutrients have a profound effect on embryo and, consequently, hatchling phenotype. Nutrient provisioning and uptake vary within and among oviparous taxa, avian and non-avian reptiles, due to differences and similarities in environment, behavior, and phylogeny. Eggs of crocodilians, the closest extant relatives to modern birds, are ideal models for examining modes of embryonic development, especially with regard to nutrient uptake, in non-avian reptiles and comparing them with those of birds. In this study, we investigated egg composition, embryo growth, and nutrient use in the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). We explored egg composition by separating and weighing components of fresh eggs. We measured embryo growth and nutrient usage by dissecting embryos and by obtaining samples of liquid from the amnion, digestive tract, and yolk sac throughout the last half of incubation. Variation in albumen mass contributed most to egg mass variation in chicken eggs, whereas alligator eggs were composed almost equally of yolk and albumen, although larger eggs contained proportionally more albumen and less yolk than smaller eggs. Both chicken and alligator albumen were mostly water (87% and 96%, respectively) although chicken albumen contained over three times more solid mass per gram than alligator albumen. In both species, yolk contained a high proportion of solids. Larger eggs produced larger hatchlings in both chickens and alligators, but albumen solids contributed to embryo mass only in chicken embryos. However, intact albumen proteins appeared in the stomach in embryos of both species. While the final disposition of albumen in alligators is unclear, variation in maternal investment of yolk at oviposition was responsible for nearly all of the variation in alligator hatchling phenotype, while both yolk and albumen contributed to chicken hatchling mass.",

We aimed to determine whether ACh evokes the release of an EDCF in the chicken ductus arteriosus (DA) and to identify its nature. Isolated rings DA from 19-d chicken embryos (total incubation: 21-d) were studied in a wire myograph. Low concentrations of ACh (30\u00a0nM\u20131\u00a0\u00b5M) elicited a relaxation, which was followed by a contraction at higher concentrations (3\u00a0\u00b5M\u20130.1\u00a0mM). Both relaxation and contraction were abolished by removal of endothelium and were sensitive to the antimuscarinic agents atropine and 4-DAMP (M3-receptor antagonist). ACh-induced contraction was impaired in the presence of the non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX) indomethacin, the selective COX-1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate, and the thromboxane (TX)/prostaglandin (PG) H2 (TP) receptor blocker SQ-29458, whereas the response was not affected by the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide, the TX synthase inhibitor furegrelate, the H2O2 scavenger PEG-catalase, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, or the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ. Enzyme immunoassay determined that, under basal conditions, the chicken DA produced PGE2, PGF2\u03b1 and TXB2 (stable metabolite of TXA2). Prostanoid production was inhibited by indomethacin but was not significantly affected by ACh. We conclude that in the chicken DA, stimulation of muscarinic receptors by ACh induces an endothelium-dependent relaxation followed by an endothelium-dependent contraction. The contraction involves COX-1 activation and TP receptor stimulation.",

     "abstract": "The food habit hypothesis (FHH) predicts that mass-independent BMR is associated with dietary traits. In spite of decades of research, the FHH remains controversial, in part because ambiguities surrounding diet categorization can potentially confound interpretations from interspecific analyses of the relative importance of diet quality. In this study, we investigated possible relationships between BMR and the percentage of nitrogen, and the percentage of various prey items in the gut content of 19 passerine species under an explicit phylogenetic context. There were no significant effects of the percentage of dietary nitrogen, invertebrates, or plants on mass-independent BMR using either conventional or phylogenetically corrected regressions. Consequently, our results do not support the FHH in passerine birds. The lack of a significant correlation between diet and BMR could be explained by generally similar levels of activity and similar body composition among species. In this sense, it is possible that the impact of food habits could depend mainly on body mass, which is also associated to the high cost of the endothermy at small sizes.",

The taimen VgC was purified from the sera of vitellogenic females by a combination of gel filtration, anion exchange, and immunoadsorbent column chromatography. Gel filtration of the purified VgC revealed that it had an apparent native mass of \u223c\u00a0380\u00a0kDa, while the mass of the VgC polypeptide that appeared following SDS-PAGE was estimated to be \u223c\u00a0140\u00a0kDa. An antiserum was raised against the purified VgC and utilized for the development of a subtype-specific immunoassay for VgC. Levels of VgC in the serum of female taimen increased from 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to \u223c\u00a01\u00a0mg/mL, with an increase of GSI. Levels of complete-type Vg and estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) in the serum of E2-administered juvenile taimen increased and reached peak levels similar to those found in vitellogenic females. Although VgC could be induced in the serum of E2-administered taimen, it stayed at levels (35.5\u201373\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) lower than those obtained in females. This is the first report on the presence of serum VgC and yolk LvC in a salmonid species; these findings indicate that for Sakhalin taimen, like other highly-evolved teleost species, this minor subtype of Vg is significant in the formation of egg yolk.",

The recta of anopheline larvae are distinct from other subfamilies of mosquitoes in several ways, yet have not yet been characterized extensively. Here we characterize the two major cell types of the anopheline rectum, DAR and non-DAR cells, using histological, physiological, and pharmacological analyses. Proton flux was measured at the basal membrane of 2%- and 50%-artificial sea water-reared An. albimanus larvae using self-referencing ion-selective microelectrodes, and the two cell types were found to differ in basal membrane proton flux. Additionally, differences in the response of that flux to pharmacological inhibitors in larvae reared in 2% versus 50% ASW indicate changes in protein function between the two rearing conditions. Finally, histological analyses suggest that the non-DAR cells are structurally suited for mediating ion transport. These data support a model of rectal ion regulation in which the non-DAR cells have a resorptive function in freshwater-reared larvae and a secretive function in saline water-reared larvae.

Metabolic rate, body temperature, evaporative water loss and thermal conductance were measured for eight planigales (average mass 9\u00a0g) exposed to four different ambient temperatures ranging from 10\u00a0\u00b0C to 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Water economy and respiratory variables were measured for the first time in this species. All of these standard physiological variables conformed to allometrically-predicted values for a marsupial. All variables were significantly affected by ambient temperature, except tidal volume and dry thermal conductance. Metabolic rate increased substantially at low ambient temperatures, as required to maintain a relatively constant body temperature of about 32\u201334\u00a0\u00b0C. This increased oxygen demand was accommodated by increased ventilation rather than increased oxygen extraction. Planigales had a comparatively high point of relative water economy of 19.1\u00a0\u00b0C, consistent with their small body size and arid habitat. Torpor reduced energy expenditure by 79% and evaporative water loss by 62%. Our study suggests that torpor use, along with behavioural adaptations, suffice for P. gilesi to live underground in arid habitats without further physiological adaptations.",

RT-PCR analysis revealed that vasa was detectable only in the gonads. Further, real-time PCR results showed that expression of vasa was seen throughout the development from embryonic stage to adult. However, the expression was more in ovary than in testis during gonadal development. In adult testis, the vasa transcripts were significantly high during spermatogenesis and it declined during spermiation. On the other hand, during ovarian recrudescence, vasa transcripts were high in immature oocytes (stages I and II oocytes) when compared to mature oocytes (stages III and IV oocytes). Human chorionic gonadotropin treatment in recrudescing ovary (in vivo) as well as in testicular slices (in vitro) resulted in up regulation of vasa mRNA in a time-dependant manner.

The objective of the present study was to investigate by Western blotting and immunohistofluorescence the expression and localization of these proteins in warm-acclimated, hydrated treefrogs. We hypothesized that patterns of protein expression would reflect unique osmoregulatory roles for the three aquaporins. Western blots revealed a spectrum of protein bands from 28\u00a0kDa to 65+\u00a0kDa; treatment with N-glycosidase suggested that this reflected variable glycosidation of the aquaporins. HC-1 was expressed in all organs, including dermis of skin, sinusoids and septa of liver, Bowman's capsule of kidney, intestinal lacteal vessels, and perimysium and vasculature of muscle. HC-3 expression was also widespread, but with different localization, including epidermis and dermis of skin, renal collecting ducts, and colonic villous epithelium. HC-2 expression was limited to osmoregulatory organs (renal collecting ducts and epidermis). In many ways, the expression of these proteins paralleled their mammalian homologs. For example, HC-2 and HC-3 expression in collecting ducts appeared similar to the mammalian pattern (the former more apical, the latter more basal). However, some aspects of localization (e.g. HC-1 in Bowman's capsule) were unique, and the ubiquity of HC-3 expression may relate to its facilitation of glycerol transport in this animal that possesses glycerol-dependent freeze tolerance.",

Their gastrointestinal capacity (in dry matter: 1.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63% of body mass) is similar to that calculated for horses. A comparison of the difference in fluid and particle MRT in large hindgut fermenters (horses, rhinoceroses, elephants, and the tapirs of this study) shows that longer absolute particle MRT are linked to shorter relative fluid MRT, possibly indicating a more thorough \u2018washing\u2019 of particulate ingesta with digestive fluids at longer particle MRT. The only outlier to this general pattern, with an exceptionally high difference between fluid and particle MRT, indicating a particularly efficient ingesta washing, is the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum).

     "abstract": "Among avian species with large differences in egg size, changes in eggshell conductance and incubation time permit the water loss necessary for embryonic development. To what extent this happens for different-size eggs within a species is much less known. Chicken eggs with fresh egg weight (Wegg) either large (L,\u223c66\u00a0g) or small (S,\u223c51\u00a0g) were incubated at 38\u00a0\u00b0C and 60% humidity; their yolk and albumen scaled almost in proportion to Wegg. Eggshell gas conductance scaled to 0.77 of Wegg, as it occurs inter-specifically, while external pipping and hatching occurred at similar times in S and L. Hence, L lost less water during incubation than S, and embryos of L were over-hydrated and those of S were dehydrated. The absolute values of embryo's weight, growth rate, oxygen consumption and the weight of the chorioallantoic membrane were similar between S and L during the first half of incubation, and greater in L in the second half. Incubation in hypoxia reduced growth rate in both sets and maintained the difference in growth trajectories between S and L. The energetic cost of growth and tissue maintenance did not differ significantly. It is concluded that,10\u00a0+\u00a09 among chicken eggs of different sizes, 1) the growth rate of the embryo relates to the size of its egg, probably genetically and because of differences in water content, 2) eggshell conductance contributes, but incubation time does not, to the requirements for water loss. Therefore, the egg water balance during incubation may be the physiological constraint that limits the maximal variability in egg size compatible with embryonic survival.",

     "abstract": "Rhinoceroses represent the largest extant herbivores with extensive dietary specialization for plant groups like browse (black rhino Diceros bicornis) or grass (white rhino Ceratotherium simum). However, it is not clear to what extent such diet selection patterns are reflected in adaptations of digestive physiology of the respective feeding types. In this study, feeding trials with four black and five white rhinos were conducted in four zoos. The animals had ad libitum access to the same batch of grass hay (second cut; neutral detergent fiber (NDF) 63% dry matter (DM), crude protein 10.2% DM). Total intake, fecal N content, in vitro digestibility of NDF residues of feces, fecal particle size and mean retention time (MRT) of particles (Cr-mordanted fiber; 1\u20132\u00a0mm) and fluid (Co-EDTA) were quantified. The average daily DM intake was 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0g/kg BW0.75 for white and 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0g/kg BW0.75 for black rhinos. In the in vitro fermentation test fecal NDF residues of black rhinos resulted in higher gas productions at fermentation times of 12 to 24\u00a0h, indicating that white rhinos have a superior capacity to digest NDF. Average MRT for fluids and particles was 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0h and 43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0h in white and 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0h and 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0h in black rhinos. The selectivity factor (SF\u00a0=\u00a0MRTparticle\u00a0/\u00a0MRTfluid) was higher for white (1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) than for black rhinos (1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). In a comparison of 12 ruminant and 3 rhino species, SF was correlated to percentage of grass in diet (R\u00a0=\u00a00.75). Mean fecal particle size was higher in white (9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.94\u00a0mm) than in black rhinos (6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79\u00a0mm) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). The results demonstrate differences between white and black rhinos in terms of retention times and fiber digestibility. The more selective retention of particles by the white rhino corresponds with the higher digestion of fiber measured indirectly. Furthermore there is indication for a general pattern of high SF in grazing ruminants and rhinos. The difference in fecal particle size between both rhino species might be due to the considerable difference in body weight.",

Here, we have examined if increased temperature reduces the hypoxia tolerance of coral reef fish (measured as critical [O2]), and if temperature acclimation in adults can change the resting rate of O2 consumption and critical [O2]. Two common species from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) were tested, Doederlein's cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus doederleini) and lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis). In both species, a 3\u00a0\u00b0C rise in water temperature caused increased oxygen consumption and reduced hypoxia tolerance, changes that were not reduced by acclimation to the higher temperature for 7 to 22\u00a0days. Critical [O2] increased by 71% in the cardinalfish and by 23% in the damselfish at 32\u00a0\u00b0C compared to 29\u00a0\u00b0C. The higher oxygen needs are likely to reduce the aerobic scope, which could negatively affect the capacity for feeding, growth and reproduction. The reduced hypoxia tolerance may force the fishes out of their nocturnal shelters in the coral matrix, exposing them to predation. The consequences for population and species survival could be severe unless developmental phenotypic plasticity within generations or genetic adaptation between generations could produce individuals that are more tolerant to a warmer future.",

Central administration of bombesin inhibits feeding behavior in chicks (Gallus gallus) while the effects of GRP and NMB have not been reported. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of GRP, NMB and neuromedin C (NMC, the C-terminus decapeptide of GRP) affected feeding and drinking behavior in chicks. Injection of GRP, NMC and NMB (0.2\u20135\u00a0nmol) decreased feeding behavior in chicks while drinking behavior was not affected. ICV injection of 5\u00a0nmol GRP and NMC decreased voluntary locomotion while NMB did not. It is therefore possible that GRP- and NMC-associated hypoactivity is related to the peptides' anorexigenic effects. GRP, NMC and NMB did not affect plasma corticosterone concentration, suggesting that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis might not be related to the anorexigenic action of these peptides. All these findings support the hypothesis that GRP, NMC and NMB function as anorexigenic factors in the brain of chicks.",

The mRNA of the three GTH subunits and their receptors increased with progression from male to female.

GnRHa treatment increased mRNA expression levels of these genes, as well as plasma E2 levels, indicating that GnRH plays an important regulatory role in the brain-pituitary-gonad axis of immature cinnamon clownfish.",

To better understand the photoreception systems involved in the light-induced hatching of T. granarius eggs, we examined the spectral sensitivity of hatching and the expression of genes involved in photoreception (opsins) and phototransduction (arrestin 2). Hatching of eggs is induced by light of broad wavelengths, from ultraviolet (UV) (395\u00a0nm) to red (660\u00a0nm), suggesting that visual pigments are involved in photoreception. Next, we focused on opsins which are protein moieties of visual pigments and arrestin 2 which is involved in a phototransduction cascade. Transcripts of several opsin genes and the arrestin 2 gene were detected in T. granarius eggs. Thus, we present a possibility that T. granarius eggs use visual pigments for light perception in light-induced hatching.",

     "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated angiogenesis may play a role in establishing dense retinal vasculatures of Antarctic hemoglobinless icefishes (suborder: Notothenioidei). We hypothesized that loss of hemoglobin (Hb) leads to elevation in [NO] due to decreased degradation of the compound when the NO-scavenger Hb is absent, thereby inducing vascular growth. We found that total mass of NO metabolites, nitrite plus nitrate (NOx), in plasma is greater in icefishes than in red-blooded notothenioids [e.g. C. aceratus (Hb\u2212), 22.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0\u03bcM; N. coriiceps (Hb+), 14.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0\u03bcM], suggesting a higher NO load in hemoglobinless animals. High NO levels do not appear to be a result of greater NO synthesis; we consistently measured lower activities of the enzyme catalyzing NO production, nitric oxide synthase, in tissues of icefishes than in Hb-expressing notothenioids [e.g. 96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 and 216\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039 pmol(min g wet wt)\u2212\u00a01 in brain tissue of C. aceratus (Hb\u2212) and G. gibberifrons (Hb+), respectively]. Levels of mRNA for hypoxia-induced (HIF-1\u03b1 and PHD2) and angiogenic genes (VEGF) were similar in red- and white-blooded species, indicating that vascular maintenance in adult animals does not require differences in angiogenic tone.

We therefore speculated that birds would develop high pulmonary artery pressures when the cardiac output was substantially increased during heavy exercise, for example during flight. However because of the technical difficulties of measuring pulmonary artery pressures in flight, the metabolic rate and cardiac output in anesthetized chickens were increased by infusing 2,4 Dinitrophenol (DNP) and the mean pressure was measured by means of a catheter in the pulmonary artery. Although the pulmonary artery pressure rose steadily as cardiac output increased, it remained below the high levels predicted from the previous studies for similar changes in pulmonary blood flow. Furthermore the increase in pressure was less than in mammals where recruitment and distension of pulmonary capillaries are known to occur. The reasons for this unexpected result are not clear.",

To this end, ten males were individually kept in 50-L tanks, each equipped with two self-feeders and one infrared photo-cell connected to a computer. The selection factors investigated were the level of phytase supplementation (0\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 vs 1500\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01; 1500\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 vs 4000\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) or sodium phytate (1% phytate vs 1% phytate\u00a0+\u00a01500\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 phytase).

Tilapia preferred the diet with 1500\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 phytase rather than the control or 4000\u00a0IU\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 diets. When exogenous sodium phytate was added to the diet, tilapia preferred the phytase diet. In conclusion tilapia self-feed at night (although locomotor activity was mostly diurnal) and chose plant-diets containing phytase, which should be taken into account when designing feeding strategies and practical diets for tilapia aquaculture.",

     "abstract": "Subterranean animals have commonly evolved hypoactivity, hypometabolism and/or the sequential use of energetic reserves to tolerate long fasting periods imposed by the low food levels found in subterranean environments. However, some tropical caves are characterized by a potential high level of nutriments. By using the tropical fish Astyanax fasciatus that presents both populations subterranean (Astyanax fasciatus mexicanus) and epigean (Astyanax fasciatus fasciatus) populations, we described behavioral, metabolic and biochemical responses during a long-term fasting period followed by a refeeding period. The results demonstrated that fed hypogean fishes exhibited different energy stores together with a hypometabolism. But, despite drastic decreases in locomotory activity and oxygen consumption during fasting, hypogean fishes consumed significantly more glycogen, triglycerides and proteins during the starvation period than epigean fishes. This lower fasting capacity showed by hypogean fishes is confirmed by the higher activation of the compensatory metabolic pathways (ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis). After the refeeding period, cave fishes did not recover from the \u201cfood deprivation\u201d stress, and resume fed levels in glycogen, triglyceride reserves and proteins, in contrast to epigean ones. This study thus demonstrates that starvation adaptations are not necessary for cave life, but are rather correlated to the \u201cenergetic state\u201d of each ecosystem, and that troglomorphism is not linked to starvation capacities and thus not to the impoverished food availability.",

     "abstract": "Known vertebrate response to low oxygen concentration include change in carbohydrate metabolism, increase in nitric oxide, stimulation of red blood cell and hemoglobin production and induction of gene expression for glycolytic enzymes and hormones. Also, extreme hypoxia plays main role in pathological studies of cardiac dysfunction. The morphological and physiological developmental studies of the cardiovascular system under low oxygen are important as it is directly related to oxygen supply and consumption. Furthermore, cardiac function demands high energy during system development and thus it is most likely to be affected by hypoxia. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) can act as a model organism for oxygen demand management study as in natural environment, due to ecological disturbances, it is exposed to changes in oxygen concentrations routinely and thus would have natural ability to cope with it for survival. We have studied, in zebrafish, i) cardiovascular flexibility under extreme hypoxia (PO2\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0Torr, 3\u00a0kPa) at 3\u201310\u00a0dpf (days post-fertilization), ii) cardiac re-animation in normoxia (PO2\u00a0=\u00a0152\u00a0Torr, 20\u00a0kPa) after 90\u00a0min of anoxia (PO2\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0Torr, 0\u00a0kPa)-induced suspended animation at 4\u00a0dpf and iii) oxygen consumption in 8\u00a0dpf von Hippel\u2013Lindau (vhl\u2212/\u2212) mutant that exhibits an artificial hypoxic response under normoxic conditions. In hypoxic fish, cardiac output, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume were elevated while intersegmental blood vessels vascularization index at 6\u00a0dpf and at 10\u00a0dpf was 22% and 11% higher respectively as compared to the normoxic fish. The heart rate in hypoxic fish was lower until 6\u00a0dpf and then showed an elevated trend. There was no significant difference in body length between the hypoxic and normoxic individuals. The observed changes may have enhanced the performance of the cardiovascular system for oxygen uptake. We also report for the first time that the post-anoxia re-animated heart rate returns to normal after 48\u00a0h. Measurement of oxygen consumption in 8\u00a0dpf hyperventilating vhl\u2212/\u2212 mutant was, unexpectedly, significantly lower than the non-mutant fish of the same age which point towards artificial hypoxic signal from brain in these mutants.",

Given their geographical distribution pattern, and differences in preferred temperature of cod with different haemoglobin types, the study was extended to include haemoglobin polymorphism. We hypothesised that the differences in temperature preference between HbI-1 and HbI-2 type cod might also be reflected in a difference in stress response to hypoxia exposure. Two hsp70-isoforms (labelled a and b) were detected and they differed in expression in the gills but not in the liver of Atlantic cod. Acclimation temperature significantly affected the expression of hsp70 in the liver, and in an isoform-specific manner in the gills. Hypoxia exposure increased the expression of hsp70 in the liver, but not the gills, of cod and this response was not influenced by the acclimation temperature. The expression of hsp70 in both tissues did not differ between fish with different haemoglobin types. Acclimation temperature significantly impacted plasma cortisol but not lactate levels. Also, acute oxygen limitation or HbI-type significantly elevated plasma cortisol and lactate levels but these responses were not modulated by acclimation temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that both temperature acclimation and acute hypoxic exposure influence the organismal and cellular stress responses in Atlantic cod. We hypothesise that HbI-2 fish are more tolerant to short-term hypoxic episodes than HbI-1 fish, and this adaptation may be independent of tissue hsp70 expression.",

The elevated heart rates enabled the embryos not only to survive, but to maintain \u201cnormal\u201d metabolic rates, and to hatch at the usual time with unmodified phenotypic traits (e.g., hatchling size, relative heart mass, locomotor speed, post-hatchling survival and growth rates). Turtles and birds with rigid (highly calcified) eggshells show more dramatic ill-effects from hypoxic incubation, suggesting that the thin (and thus, highly gas-permeable) parchment-shelled eggs of most squamates allow more effective embryonic adjustment of oxygen exchange rates in response to externally-imposed hypoxia.",

In this study, we report a novel putative C-type lectin from the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The cDNA of this lectin (hereby designated MeML for M. edulis mucocyte lectin) is 459\u00a0bp long encoding a 152-residue protein. MeML presents a signal peptide and a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) which contains a QPS (Gln, Pro, and Ser) motif and two putative conserved sites, WND and ENC, for calcium binding. MeML was expressed in mucocytes lining the epithelium of pallial organs (gills, labial palps and mantle) and intestine, and its expression was significantly up-regulated following starvation.

In mammals, ectopic expression of adipogenic transcription factors C/EBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1 can induce transdifferentiation of a variety of different cell types into adipocyte-like cells. However, in birds, whether C/EBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1 can induce transdifferentiation is unknown. The current study was designed to investigate whether chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) can be induced to transdifferentiate into adipocyte-like cells by the ectopic expression of chicken C/EBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1 via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. The results showed that any one of these three adipogenic transcription factors was sufficient to trigger the adipogenic program in CEFs, as demonstrated by accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets and expression of the adipocyte marker gene (adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, A-FABP). This suggests that C/EBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1 play a crucial role in chicken adipogenesis.",

We evaluated water movement and, in parallel, amino acid uptake induced by some members of the SLC6/NSS family belonging to different kingdoms, namely the rat GABA transporter GAT1, the insect amino acid transporters KAAT1 and CAATCH1 and the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT, whose structure was recently solved. We also tested whether mutated proteins in which the solute translocation mechanism is altered or even abolished were able to induce water movement across cell membrane. The proteins of interest were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and osmotic water permeabilities were estimated from the rate of cell volume change induced by an osmotic gradient in the absence of cotransported solutes. Under osmotic stress all the studied wild type amino acid cotransporters increased the water permeability of the membrane. The GABA transport inhibitor SKF 89976A inhibited both GABA transport and water movement induced by the expression of GAT1. Interestingly, the capacity of mutant proteins to induce water movement was not predictable on the basis of their substrate transport ability. In particular the GAT1 mutant Q291N, void of any transport activity, induced a water permeability similar to that induced by the wt protein. The KAAT1 mutant T339C, which showed a higher transport activity, induced a water permeability not significantly different from the wild type transporter. Interestingly, the bacterial leucine cotransporter LeuT, whose binding site for leucine and Na+ is void of water, induced water movement through the plasma membrane.",

Gelatinolyic activity was observed in cytoplasm and nucleus of both heart and skeletal myoblasts. The chelating agent EDTA blocked much of the gelatinolytic activity and the organomercurial activator of MMPs increased the activity in cells of both muscle origins. However, the inhibition of gelatinolytic activity by a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor was less profound in heart myoblasts than that in skeletal myoblasts. Gelatinolytic activity was also expressed in the endomysium and perimysium of tissue sections of heart and soleus muscles. Similar with findings in the cell studies, the gelatinase activity was increased by the MMP activator, mostly blocked by EDTA and partially inhibited by the MMP inhibitor. In the presence of the MMP inhibitor, the remaining gelatinolytic activity in the tissue sections was again higher in myocardium than that in soleus muscle. This observation was further supported by the gelatinolytic activity examined in tissue homogenates. Our findings suggest that other proteinases, in addition to MMPs, are more responsive for the tissue gelatinolytic activity in heart muscle as compared with that in skeletal muscle.",

Protein synthesis at 27 and 33\u00a0\u00b0C peaked 4\u00a0h after feeding in all tissues and returned to pre-feeding rates by 12\u00a0h. At 21\u00a0\u00b0C protein synthesis remained constant over 24\u00a0h in all tissues. While the concentration of RNA remained stable over the 24\u00a0h cycle and across temperatures, the ribosomal activity increased after feeding. This meant kRNA, not the absolute amount of RNA, was the driving force underlying the post-prandial increase in protein synthesis. However, relative differences in protein synthesis between tissues were attributed to differences in RNA concentration. There was a significant positive relationship between white muscle and whole body protein synthesis. This was the first study to show an interaction between temperature and the time after feeding on protein synthesis for an ectotherm, and that a post-prandial peak in protein synthesis only occurred under optimum temperature conditions.",

We showed that the microbicidal capacity of Stonechat (Saxicola torquata) blood, an integrative measure of constitutive immune function, is highly repeatable when tested against Escherichia coli and not significantly repeatable when tested against Candida albicans. The low repeatability against C. albicans results from relatively low variation among individuals, providing only low resolution to identify if this interindividual variation is consistent. In addition, we explored the effect of sex and age on microbicidal capacity, and found that over a range of ages from 1 to 7\u00a0years the blood of older birds had a better capacity to kill microbes. We concluded that, over a time period of weeks, microbicidal capacity of avian blood is an individual-bound trait, that shows consistent interindividual variation partly related to age, and unaffected by sex. This knowledge is important when interpreting the possible evolutionary mechanism underlying immunological differences, for example among individuals, environments and seasons.",

These same mussels were also assessed for their response to differences in seawater temperature by quantifying the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP70) and the activities of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD). These data were then interpreted in the context of sea surface and air temperatures as well as chlorophyll a concentration and the genetic structure of mussel populations. Populations of M. edulis throughout the GOM were found to be genetically homogenous and consumed a mixed diet of phytoplankton and detritus. Mussels exposed to higher seawater temperatures also showed a significant increase in the expression of HSP70 and activities of SOD. The site-specific interplay between the amount of energy gained from the available food resources and the costs associated with protection against the effects of elevated seawater temperatures shows that these mussels exhibit phenotypic plasticity at different sites which could play an important role in the population dynamics of this key member of the rocky intertidal.",

The aim of the study presented here was to determine how changes in dietary plant protein sources and amino acid profiles affect the muscle growth processes of fish. Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchys mykiss) were fed two diets containing fish meal and a mixture of plant protein sources either low (control diet) or rich in soybean meal (diet S). Both diets were supplemented with crystalline indispensable amino acids (IAA) to match the rainbow trout muscle IAA profile. Diet S was also supplemented with glutamic acid, an AA present in high quantities in trout muscle. Rainbow trout fed diets C and S were not significantly different in terms of overall somatic growth or daily nitrogen gain, although their parameters of dietary protein utilisation differed. Distribution of skeletal white muscle fibre diameter and expression of certain selected muscle genes were also affected by dietary changes. In the white muscle, diet S led to a significant decrease (\u00d70.9) in the mean and median diameters of muscle fibres, to a significant decrease (\u00d70.6) in the expression of MyoD and to a significant increase (\u00d71.7) in the expression of fast-MHC, with no significant changes in myogenin expression. There was no change in the expression of the genes analysed in lateral red muscle (MyoD, MyoD2, myogenin and slow-MHC). These results demonstrated that changes occurred in skeletal white muscle cellularity and expression of MyoD and fast-MHC, although overall growth and protein accretion were not modified, when a diet rich in soybean meal and glutamic acid was ingested.

The evolution of this system with its unique lung morphology and physiology has contributed to birds being one of the most successful vertebrate lineages. Despite holding the attention of the scientific community for a long time, much remains to be discovered about the complexities of this system. Recent advances have highlighted the important role that accessory breathing structures, the uncinate processes, play in understanding not only how this system functions but how it evolved. Almost all species of extant bird have uncinate processes extending from the midpoint of the vertebral ribs. These processes are integral to the mechanics of ventilation in birds, being active in both inspiration and expiration but also playing some role during locomotion. The morphological variation in the uncinate processes suggests that the constraints placed on the body by adaptations to different forms of locomotion are key to understanding differences in how birds breathe. These processes also occur in the theropod dinosaurs, providing further evidence that they are the ancestors of modern birds but also highlighting the intrinsic flexibility in the ventilatory systems of these animals.",

Here we investigated the energetic and kinematic effects of trunk and limb loading in walking barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis). A directly proportional relationship between increasing back-load mass and metabolic rate was established, indicating that the barnacle goose can carry back loads (up to 20% of body mass) more economically than the majority of mammals. The increased cost of supporting and propelling the body during locomotion is likely to account for a major proportion of the extra metabolic cost. Sternal loads up to 15% of body mass were approximately twice as expensive to carry as back loads. Given the key role in dorso-ventral movement of the sternum during respiration we suggest that moving this extra mass may account for the elevated metabolic rate. Loading the distal limb with 5% extra mass incurred the greatest proportional rise in metabolism, and also caused increases in stride length, swing duration and stride frequency during locomotion. The increased work required to move the loaded limb may explain the high cost of walking.",

No evidence for a gait change was found. The gait of a barnacle goose appears to conform to the classical pendulum mechanics based model of walking, with the kinetic energy of forward motion (horizontal kinetic energy, Ekh) out-of-phase with the sum of the gravitational potential (Ep), and vertical kinetic (Ekv) energies of the centre of mass at all speeds. Why barnacle geese are unable to aerial run when other \u2018waddling\u2019 species do show an aerial phase (e.g., mallard ducks) is unclear. Presumably, however, it is likely to relate to the amount of lateral kinetic energy generated, which is a feature of \u2018waddling\u2019. We predict that lateral kinetic energy generated by barnacle geese and other waddling species that cannot aerial run, is higher than in those that can. Due to competing selection pressures for swimming and flight, barnacle geese are mechanically and energetically inefficient walkers relative to more specialist cursorial birds. Their upper walking speed, however, appears to be limited by morphology (via kinematics) and not metabolic capacity (energetics).",

Together, these mean that the concentration of oxygen in the arterial blood at a given altitude is greater in bar-headed geese than in lowland birds and mammals. The low partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood (hypocapnia) that accompanies hyperventilation does not cause reduction of cerebral blood flow in birds as it does in mammals, thus there is greater oxygen delivery to the brain in hypoxic birds, including bar-headed geese, than in mammals. Captive bar headed geese could not maintain elevated aerobic metabolism during exercise at a simulated altitude of 8500\u00a0m and their cardiac stroke volume was much lower than that during exercise at sea level. This suggests that if some individuals of this species of geese do really manage to fly over Mt Everest, they may only do so if they receive assistance from vertical air movements, for example from lee waves downwind from the mountains.",

P. megacephalum shows horizontal intrapulmonary septation in the medial chambers, dividing them into dorsal and ventral lobes. This structure is found only in Platysternon and in the Emydidae, and is interpreted as a possible synapomorphy for these two taxa. In addition to further suggested synapomorphies for Platysternon and the Testudinoidea, we found \u2013 in contrast to previous reports \u2013 a small post-pulmonary septum (PPS) and incomplete coelomic compartmentalization in the Chelydridae. Thus, all major taxa of Testudines possess a PPS. Since this structure is also present in mammals, archosaurs and some lepidosaurs, the plesiomorphy of a coelomic compartmentalization by the PPS in amniotes in general should be considered. These preliminary results indicate that further comparative study of the respiratory apparatus might help resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the Testudines, as well as to shed light on its evolution among the Amniota.",

     "abstract": "Mutation of the drop-dead gene in Drosophila causes early death of the adult animal. After hatching from pupae, drop-dead mutants increasingly lose body control and typically die within ten days. Drop-dead carries an X-chromosomal recessive mutation that causes brain degeneration, due to a loss in glia function. Recent results attribute this functional deficiency to a component required to form the tracheolar respiratory apparatus and thus to a reduction of tracheal oxygen supply. If the reduction of respiratory capacity is the primary reason for brain degeneration, locomotor capacity of drop-dead should be significantly impaired. We thus determined running performance and locomotor motivation of drop-dead1 mutants at ages between one and five days. The mutant achieves similar mean and maximum forward speeds during running of approximately 1.5 and 10\u00a0mm\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, respectively, as wild type flies. Thus metabolic capacity required for running seems not to be compromised. Drop-dead1 flies, however, are significantly more active (34%) and also have a higher motivation (33%) to initiate running. Heading instability during forward running was increased by 17% compared to wild type and tended to increase with age. These findings are consistent with the previously reported loss in body control in the mutant and thus demonstrate the significance of the drop-dead gene for running behaviour in Drosophila.",

One of the first studies on allometric scaling of muscle enzymes was published in an early issue of this journal (George and Talesara, 1961 Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 3: 267\u2013273). These researchers studied a number of locally available birds and a bat, measuring the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in relation to body mass and muscle structure. Though the phenomenon of allometric scaling of metabolism was well recognized even 50\u00a0years earlier, this study was one of the first to explore the enzymatic underpinnings of the metabolic patterns in different animals. In this review, we begin by considering the George and Talesara study in the context of this early era in metabolic biochemistry and comparative physiology. We review subsequent studies in the last 50\u00a0years that continued the comparative analysis of enzyme patterns in relation to body size in diverse experimental models. This body of work identified a recurrent (though not ubiquitous) reciprocal relationship between oxidative and glycolytic enzymes. In the last 10\u00a0years, studies have focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms that determine the muscle metabolic enzyme phenotype.",

We recently developed a new assay system using teleost scales, which consists of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix protein. In this system, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were used as markers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Using this assay system, we examined the effects of mechanical loading on ALP and TRAP activity in goldfish scales. ALP activity in the scales was significantly elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) by ultrasound stimuli (1\u00a0MHz, 50% duty factor, 0.5\u00a0Hz pulse repetition frequency, 60\u00a0mW/cm2 [ISATA] and 6\u00a0min) after both 18\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h of incubation while TRAP activity remained unchanged. In addition, mRNA expression of both insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and estrogen receptors (ER) increased significantly, as did ALP activity. After the goldfish had been swimming for 3\u00a0days (speed: 2 body lengths/second, duration: 3\u00a0h/day), the scales' ALP activity increased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but TRAP activity did not change. These in vitro and in vivo results strongly suggest that osteoblasts in the goldfish scale respond sensitively to mechanical stress and may be important in promoting bone formation.",

We cloned and characterized the honeycomb grouper Epinephelus merra FSHR (EmFSHR) to elucidate its role in the protogynous sex change in groupers. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis suggested that EmFSHR was expressed exclusively in the gonads. In situ hybridization showed the distribution of EmFSHR in the granulosa cells of previtellogenic oocytes and Leydig cells in the testis. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of gonadal EmFSHR transcripts during the process of sex change indicated that the lowest levels were found in the female phase before sex change. EmFSHR transcripts increased during the early transitional phase, when oocytes began to degenerate in parallel with the initiation of gonial germ cell differentiation into spermatogonia. A dramatic increase in EmFSHR transcription occurred during the late transitional phase, when the gonad contained numerous proliferating male germ cells and many degenerated oocytes. EmFSHR expression remained high until the transformation from ovary to testis was complete. The data reveal that female to male sex change is associated with the upregulation of EmFSHR transcripts, and that this upregulation may be responsible for the development of testicular tissue and the progression of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, how the upregulation of EmFSHR is controlled in the initiation of sex change remains to be elucidated.",

Consequently, the aim of the present study was to examine CA expression and activity in osmoregulatory tissues of the Gulf Toadfish, Opsanus beta, following transfer to 60\u00a0ppt. A gene coding, for CAc of 1827\u00a0bp with an open reading frame of 260 amino acids was cloned and showed high expression in all intestinal segments and gills. CAc showed higher expression in posterior intestine and rectum than in anterior and mid intestine and in gills of fish exposed to 60\u00a0ppt for up to 4\u00a0days. The enzymatic activity, in contrast, was higher in all examined tissues two weeks following transfer to 60\u00a0ppt. Comparing early expression and later activity levels of acclimated fish reveals a very different response to hypersalinity among tissues. Results highlight a key role of CAc in osmoregulation especially in distal regions of the intestine; moreover, CAc play a role in the gill in hypersaline environments possibly supporting elevated branchial acid extrusion seen under such conditions.",

We posed the hypothesis that eicosanoids also mediate antioxidant enzymatic defense reactions to pro-oxidant challenge. To test this idea, we reared first-instar larvae of Galleria mellonella (L.) with the lypoxygenase inhibitor, esculetin (0.001%), the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, dexamethasone (0.001%) and the dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, phenidone (0.1%) to seventh-instars. Newly ecdysed seventh-instars were then fed on artificial diet containing 0.05% xanthotoxin (XA) for 2\u00a0days. Treating seventh-instar larvae of G. mellonella with XA induced lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation as evident from the increased content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls respectively, and antioxidative enzymatic response in a dose-dependent manner. High dietary XA concentrations (0.005 and 0.1%) were associated with increasing MDA and carbonyl content (by 3-fold) and antioxidant enzyme activities, superoxide dismutase (SOD) (by 3-fold) and catalase (CAT) (by 4-fold), and glutathione-dependent enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST) (by 15-fold) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (by 7-fold). Relative to control, eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors (EBIs) esculetin, dexamethasone and phenidone also resulted in impaired MDA content and antioxidant enzyme activities. However, carbonyl content did not differ between control- and EBIs-feeding larvae. Finally, MDA and carbonyl content, and antioxidant enzymes SOD, GST and GPx activities exhibited an incremental increase while CAT activity was decreased in the experimental larvae that had been reared on media amended with esculetin, dexamethasone and phenidone and then challenged with our standard XA challenge dose. Two of the markers indicated that significantly higher levels of oxidative stress were produced in the hemolymph tissue of larvae fed diets supplemented with EBIs and then challenged with XA. This oxidative stress was associated with elicited antioxidative responses by increasing SOD, GST and GPx and decreasing CAT activities in hemolymph. We infer from these findings that eicosanoids mediate insect antioxidant enzymatic responses to dietary pro-oxidants.",

In males, levels of pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (a marker of eumelanin), 11KT and the GSI increased sharply from September and plateaued in March and April when the fish are sexually mature. These results are consistent with the lightness of their body color.

In females, little change was observed in those variables except for the GSI. 4-Amino-3-hydroxyphenylalanine (a marker of pheomelanin) was also analyzed, but it was below the detection limit at all times. Oral treatment of juvenile red seabream with synthetic androgen methyl-testosterone for 2\u00a0months induced eumelanin accumulation about 3 times higher than the control.

In this study, we used adult zebrafish to elucidate the expression and role of zebrafish GHRL (zGHRL) in genes primarily involved in the brain's CGM. Results showed that zebrafish brain expressed zghrl and its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue-receptor (GHS-R: zghs-r1a and zghs-r2a), according to RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Protein localization coupled with mRNA spatial expression further verified zGHRL's presence in the brain. For the in vivo study, significant increases in zghs-r1a and zghs-r2a synthesis were observed after injection of synthetic peptide goldfish GHRL-12 (gGHRL) using brain templates analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Ligand-receptor synthesis of INS (zinsa; zins-r1 and zins-r2) significantly decreased, while glucagon (GCG) (zgcgb1 and zgcgb2; zgcg-r1 and zgcg-r2) exhibited a significant transient increase. In CGM, subsequent processes indicate urgent glucose-sensing response that will balance glycogen degradation and energy storage. Taken together, these findings suggest that GHRL regulates INS synthesis by mediating its action on GHS-R in the CNS and partly involved in CGM.",

Using isolated ganglia and semi-intact or intact animal preparations, the present studies examined the light-sensing and physiological roles of Ip-1 and Ip-2 cells, which respond jointly to light by inducing a slow hyperpolarizing receptor potential. First, the synaptic inputs received by Ip-1 and Ip-2 and the axonal branches arising from their cell bodies were investigated. We found that these cells are not only first-order photosensory neurons, but also second-order neurons (interneurons), relaying inhibitory synaptic inputs such as water pressure and/or tactile senses. The amphibian Onchidium opens a pneumostome at low tide in order to aero-breathe. This pneumostome opening; i.e., aero-breathing behavior, was produced by spike discharges of Ip-1 and Ip-2 cells. Furthermore, the present results suggested that the hyperpolarizing photoresponse of Ip-1 and Ip-2 cells operates in the potentiation of inhibitory sensory synaptic transmission. Thus, we conclude that the simple photoreceptors of Onchidium play a role in the long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission and the subsequent behavioral response and so may be involved in a new photosensory modality, non-image-forming vision.",

Cathepsin B activity as measured using the fluorogenic cathepsin B substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was elevated within the first 6\u00a0h of incubation in serum-free media and coincided with the onset of apoptosis. This increase in cathepsin B activity was sensitive to the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074-ME. Furthermore, adding CA-074-ME to the follicle incubation blocked caspase-3-like activation, suggesting that cathepsin B activity is a positive regulator of the apoptotic cascade during serum-starvation. Interestingly, the increase in cathepsin-B-like activity was not preceded by an increase in cathepsin B mRNA transcription, suggesting that regulation of this enzyme is at a level other than of the gene.

Adrenergic nerve blockade with bretylium decreased dorsal aortic pressure (Pda) and systemic vascular resistance (Rsys), while cardiac output (Q) did not change. The blockade of \u03b1-adrenoceptors with phentolamine reduced Pda and Rsys further, revealing that vasomotor tone was influenced by circulating catecholamines in bretylium treated fish. The physiological evidence for an adrenergic nervous control of the vasculature was corroborated by the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive fibres associated with blood vessels in spleen, gonads and gastrointestinal tract. TH-immunoreactive fibres were not observed in the atrium and ventricle, but a dense population of TH-immunoreactive fibres was apparent in the bulbus arteriosus. The present study suggests that an adrenergic nervous mechanism is responsible for maintaining vasomotor tone in P. borchgrevinki.

We purposed to gain insight into the generality of patterns of CWL in birds that have been generated mostly from studies on species from deserts, and we addressed the hypothesis that CWL is a passive diffusion process. Despite taxonomic and ecological differences among 12 species of temperate birds, mass-specific RWL and surface-specific CWL were statistically indistinguishable across species. When the birds were dead, CWL was reduced by 16.3% suggesting that CWL is, in part, under physiological control. We found that ceramides, cerebrosides, dioscylceramides, cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, fatty acid methyl esters, free fatty acid, sterol esters, and triacylglycerol constituted the intercellular lipids of the avian SC. CWL was positively associated with amount of ceramide 3, but this lipid class represented less than 2% of the total SC lipids. Combining direct measurements (n\u00a0=\u00a024) of RWL with indirect estimates (n\u00a0=\u00a025) yielded the equation log RWL (g H2O/d)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.86\u00a0+\u00a00.73 (log body mass, g).",

The species were the notothenioids Paranotothenia magellanica, Patagonotothen sima and Harpagifer bispinis and the zoarcid Austrolycus depressiceps. Individuals were captured in the vicinity of Ushuaia Bay. Experimental temperatures were 10, 4 and 2\u00a0\u00b0C, which correspond to summer, winter and extreme winter respectively. Individual respirometry chambers and calorimetric techniques were used. Different food items were provided: crustaceans (isopods and amphipods) and Argentinean hake muscle. Interspecific analysis was done on species fed with isopods. A rapid increase in oxygen consumption was registered after meals, indicating a typical SDA response. The Duration of the SDA was longer at low temperatures. The extra energy spent during the process itself, and when expressed as a percentage of consumed food energy, decreased with decreasing temperature. The SDA Coefficient was higher for H. bispinis that were fed with isopods. We suggest that decreases in temperature diminish the metabolic cost and extend SDA. Energy-saving mechanisms could be an evolutionary advantage to minimize the energetic cost of living at low sub-Antarctic temperatures. A general model of exponential decay is suggested for the duration of SDA and Temperature, based on the present study and compiled from literature data.",

An Australian desert skink, Ctenotus pantherinus, is unusual in being active day and night when all other Ctenotus species are diurnal, making it an excellent model to explore factors that promote night-time activity. We tested whether C. pantherinus 1) selects cooler temperatures than diurnal skinks, 2) shows no difference in mean selected temperature between day and night, 3) has the same metabolic rate during the day and night, 4) selects termites over other prey types, 5) can detect prey using only auditory or olfactory senses, and 6) experiences lower predation risk at night than during the day. C.pantherinus shows many features of diurnal skink species, with a high mean selected temperature (36.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0\u00b0C) that is the same night and day, and a 32% lower metabolic rate at night than during the day. C.pantherinus selects termite prey over other insects and can detect prey using only auditory and olfactory senses; models of C. pantherinus experienced less predation at night than during the day. Preference for termites and reduced predation risk at night favour opportunistic nocturnal activity in this predominantly diurnal lizard and may contribute to its wide geographic distribution in arid Australia.",

     "abstract": "The analysis of plasma biochemistry and haematology to monitor the condition of birds in the wild has been found a useful tool in ecological research. Despite biparental investment in most wild birds studied, some studies of condition indices found sex differences, and attributed these to the costs of egg formation or brooding in females or a higher contribution of males to chick rearing. We studied the natural variation of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters (namely leucocyte, lymphocyte and heterophil counts, H/L ratio and plasma concentrations of proteins, triglycerides and carotenoids) in relation to the different measures of parental investment in males and females in the Upland goose (Chloephaga picta leucoptera), a socially monogamous species. We found no sex differences in haematological and most plasma biochemistry parameters, but a relation to different aspects of parental investment in breeding male and female Upland geese. H/L ratios were related to body condition and capture date in males while leucocyte counts, plasma protein and plasma carotenoid concentrations varied with clutch measures and hatching date in females. Higher H/L ratios of males in a low body condition and later in the year may reflect stress associated with the investment into the establishment and defence of the breeding territory. Females with higher clutch volumes had lower total leucocyte and lymphocyte numbers and higher levels of plasma protein. Earlier hatching dates were associated with lower numbers of all leucocyte types and higher values of plasma carotenoid concentrations. This indicates that differences in health state are reflected in reproductive performance in female Upland geese. We also found sexual differences in the repeatability of haematological and plasma biochemistry parameters between years and therefore suggest that their potential as a measure of individual quality differs between male and female Upland geese. Finally, numbers of leucocyte counts and plasma triglyceride concentrations of pair partners were significantly related. No study so far investigated these parameters in pair partners and we discuss possible reasons for our finding.",

Proteasome inhibition, which has been associated with various diseases, can cause alterations in various intracellular processes including the expression of heat shock protein (hsp) genes. In this study, we show that celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene and anti-inflammatory agent, inhibited proteasome activity and enhanced HSP accumulation in Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells. Treatment of cells with celastrol induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein and inhibited chymotrypsin-like activity. This was accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent accumulation of HSP30 and HSP70. Celastrol-induced HSP accumulation was mediated by HSF1\u2013DNA binding activity since this response was inhibited by the HSF1 activation inhibitor, KNK437. Simultaneous exposure of cells with celastrol plus either mild heat shock or the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, produced an enhanced accumulation of HSP30 that was greater than the sum of the individual stressors alone. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that celastrol-induced HSP30 accumulation occurred in the cytoplasm in a granular pattern supplemented with larger circular HSP30 staining structures. HSP30 was also noted in the nucleus with less staining in the nucleolus. In some cells, celastrol induced the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton and conversion to a rounder morphology. In conclusion, this study has shown that celastrol inhibited proteasome activity and induced HSF1-mediated expression of hsp genes in amphibian cells.",

This study shows that effects of environmental quality (diet) on oxidative status and body mass of breeding pigeons can emerge more strongly while chick feeding, but now while incubating.

The primary goal of this review is to characterize the various physiological strategies that allow different animals to survive starvation.

The ubiquity of food limitation among animals, inconsistent terminology associated with starvation and fasting, and rationale for scientific investigations into starvation are discussed. Similarities and differences with regard to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism during starvation are also examined in a comparative context. Examples from the literature are used to underscore areas in which reporting and statistical practices, particularly those involved with starvation-induced changes in body composition and starvation-induced hypometabolism can be improved. The review concludes by highlighting several recent advances and promising research directions in starvation physiology. Because the hundreds of studies reviewed here vary so widely in their experimental designs and treatments, formal comparisons of starvation responses among studies and taxa are generally precluded; nevertheless, it is my aim to provide a starting point from which we may develop novel approaches, tools, and hypotheses to facilitate meaningful investigations into the physiology of starvation in animals.",

     "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that are involved in protein folding and translocation. During heat shock, both constitutive and stress-inducible HSPs bind to and inhibit irreversible aggregation of denatured protein and facilitate their refolding once normal cellular conditions are re-established. Recent interest in HSPs has been propelled by their association with various human diseases. Amphibian model systems, as shown in this review, have had a significant impact on our understanding of hsp gene expression and function. Some amphibian hsp genes are expressed constitutively during oogenesis and embryogenesis, while others are developmentally regulated and enriched in selected tissues in a stress-inducible fashion. For example, while hsp70 genes are heat-inducible after the midblastula stage, hsp30 genes are not inducible until late neurula/early tailbud. This particular phenomenon is likely controlled by chromatin structure. Also, hsp genes are expressed during regeneration, primarily in response to wounding-associated trauma. The availability of amphibian cultured cells has enabled the analysis of hsp gene expression induced by different stresses (e.g. cadmium, arsenite, proteasome inhibitors etc.), HSP intracellular localization, and their involvement in stress resistance. Furthermore, hyperthermia treatment of adult amphibians reveals that certain tissues were more sensitive than others in terms of hsp gene expression. Finally, this review details the evidence available for the role of amphibian small HSPs as molecular chaperones.",

     "abstract": "Mechanisms of thermogenic responses that play a role to maintain homeothermy during an early stage of neonatal chicks on acute cold exposure are scarcely studied as hatchlings are believed to be poikilothermic. However, chicks can attain the homeothermy during their subsequent growth after hatching. To identify thermogenic responses during neonatal stages of chicks (Gallus gallus) on acute cold exposure (12\u00a0\u00b0C, 3\u00a0h), changes in plasma corticosterone levels, thermogenesis, gene transcripts (avUCP and avPGC1\u03b1) in skeletal muscles (pectoralis superficialis and gastrocnemius) and mitochondrial substrate oxidation enzyme activities in dissected tissues of 1- and 4-d-old chicks were studied. Results revealed that 1-day-old neonatal chicks were particularly vulnerable to cold exposure and were hypothermic. However, 4-d-old cold-exposed chicks maintained thermostability with significantly higher plasma corticosterone levels, oxygen consumption, heat production, and increased mitochondrial substrate oxidation enzyme activities (CS and 3HADH) in different dissected tissues. Analysis of gene transcripts for avian peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 co-activator-1\u03b1 (avPGC1\u03b1) and avian uncoupling protein (avUCP) in skeletal muscles revealed no significant change between cold-sensitive (1-d-old) and cold-tolerant (4-d-old) neonatal chicks, and failed to explain the enhanced thermogenesis and tolerance to acute cold. Additionally, avPGC1\u03b1 gene transcripts were not correlated with the increased enzyme activities of CS or 3HADH in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, these data suggest the possible role of HPA-axis in cold-tolerant neonatal chicks to modulate substrate mobilization and oxidation. The thermogenic mechanisms based in part upon the increased capacity for mitochondrial substrate oxidation in different tissues are associated with enhanced heat production to attain homeothermy and acquire tolerance to acute cold exposure during an early stage of neonatal chicks.",

The ability, however, to extract oxygen from the water provides an additional means to maintain aerobic metabolism and prolong submergence. Therefore, we hypothesised that as temperature increased, a bimodally respiring animal will compensate for the effects on aerobic metabolic rate by increasing aquatic oxygen uptake. The fully aquatic, bimodally respiring Arafura filesnake (Acrochordus arafurae) was used to determine how temperature affects the partitioning of oxygen exchange between aerial and aquatic sources and the impacts on dive duration. We found that rate of oxygen consumption increased with temperature (Q10 (20\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C)\u00a0=\u00a02.52) but aquatic oxygen uptake remained temperature independent and all extra oxygen demands were met by increasing aerial gas exchange, thus reducing dive duration. Maximum dive duration reduced from 77\u00a0min to 28\u00a0min between 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 32\u00a0\u00b0C. Under severe hypoxia, oxygen uptake from the water was negligible and dive duration was further reduced to 21\u00a0min at 32\u00a0\u00b0C.

Fish were fed a diet of cutlets of freshly killed loach. Fish in the trained group were forced to swim at 60% Ucrit for 50\u00a0min followed by an exhaustive 10-min chase once daily for 21\u00a0days. Exercise training did not produce significant differences in resting VO2 (VO2rest) and postprandial peak VO2 (VO2peak) compared to the non-trained groups. However, exercise training elicited a significant decrease in both the duration and energy expenditure of digestion when fed with similar food (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Feeding had no significant effect on Ucrit of non-trained fish, while it caused a significantly lower Ucrit (compared to fasting fish) in trained fish (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The kidney was also responsible for the excretion of some excess dietary Ca2+, and, to a much lesser extent, Na+ and Cl\u2212, while the urinary excretion of K+ was unaffected. The most dramatic effect of feeding was the elevation of renal Mg2+ excretion, with the kidney transitioning from net Mg2+ reabsorption to net Mg2+ secretion during digestion. The renal handling of dietary ions accounted for 3\u201327% of the total ions absorbed from the diet, indicating that a majority of the ions are excreted extra-renally or incorporated into growth. However this does highlight the underestimation of renal ion handling when using unfed fish models. The metabolic alkalosis created by digestion (the alkaline tide) resulted in an increase in urine pH as well as a transition from net acidic equivalent excretion in the urine to net basic equivalent excretion. This was due to a decrease in the titratable acidity minus bicarbonate component of urine as well as a decrease in ammonia secretion. Additionally, the experimental separation of the urinary component of acid\u2013base excretion from that of the gills highlighted the substantially larger contribution of the latter. During the alkaline tide, renal excretion accounted for \u223c\u00a05% of the total basic equivalent excretion to the external water.",

Eight quail were maintained within their thermoneutral zone (TNZ) at 32.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C, and eight below their lower critical temperature (Tlc) at 12.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0\u00b0C. All quail entered hypothermia upon food deprivation, even quail kept within their TNZ. Body temperature (Tb) decreased more (38.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53\u00a0\u00b0C vs. 39.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57\u00a0\u00b0C), body mass (mb) loss was greater (21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.20\u00a0g vs.12.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.62\u00a0g), and the energy saved by using hypothermia was greater (25.18\u201345.01% vs. 7.98\u201328.06%) in low the Ta treatment than in TNZ treatment. Interestingly, the depth of hypothermia was positively correlated with mb loss in the low Ta treatment, but not in TNZ treatment. Our data support H3, that both thermoregulatory costs and body energy reserves are proximate cues for entry into hypothermia in quail. This outcome is not surprising below the Tlc. However, the quail kept at their TNZ also responded to food deprivation by entering hypothermia with no apparent dependence on mb loss. Therefore inputs, other than thermoregulatory costs and body condition, must serve as cues to enter hypothermia. Consequently, we address the role that tissue sparing may play in the physiological \u2018decision\u2019 to employ hypothermia.",

The dose and length of exposure, reproductive state and sex affected the auto-regulation of ER\u03b21 by E2. ER\u03b22 was not affected in any experiments suggesting it may not be auto-regulated by E2. Aromatase B and VTG gene expression were affected by E2, but also by other experimental conditions. EE2 induced liver ER\u03b1 and VTG mRNA levels indicating that high environmental EE2 levels induce E2-mediated gene expression in a model teleost. These studies reveal a more complicated action of estrogenic compounds that has important implications on estrogenic endocrine disruptors in teleosts.",

Growth in three groups of Atlantic cod juveniles (10\u201370\u00a0g) was measured at two salinities (15\u2030 or 32\u2030) in combination with two temperatures (10\u00a0\u00b0C or 14\u00a0\u00b0C). Groups of cod from a single egg batch differed by having been fed with rotifers (R) or natural zooplankton (Z) during the first 36\u00a0days post hatch. A third group was fed zooplankton from 1 to 22\u00a0dph, after which diet changed to rotifers from 22 to 36\u00a0dph (ZRZ). All fish were weaned at 36\u00a0dph. Juveniles from the Z and ZRZ groups performed equally well under all experimental conditions, but fish that had received rotifers as a larval diet showed overall significantly lower growth rates. Growth was significantly enhanced by reduced salinity. Metabolic enzyme activity and relative myosin mRNA expression levels were not affected by larval diet. Muscle AAT and MDH were affected by salinity while these enzymes in liver tissue were affected by the interaction between salinity and temperature. Metabolic enzymes were stronger correlated with fish size than growth rates. Our results indicate that larval diet has a pronounced effect on juvenile growth rates under varying environmental conditions as optimal larval diet (zooplankton) increased juvenile growth rates significantly. Metabolic enzyme activity and relative myosin mRNA expression were not affected by larval history, which suggests that the persisting juvenile growth difference is not a result of differing metabolic capacity.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in morphology and gene expression in the pig small intestine in response to heat stress. Forty eight Chinese experimental mini pigs (Sus scrofa) were subjected to 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0h each day for 10 successive days. Pigs were euthanized at 1, 3, 6, and 10\u00a0days after heat treatment and sections of the small intestine epithelial tissue were excised for morphological examination and microarray analyses. After heat treatment, the pig rectal temperature, the body surface temperature and serum cortisol levels were all significantly increased. The duodenum and jejunum displayed significant damage, most severe after 3\u00a0days of treatment. Microarray analysis found 93 genes to be up-regulated and 110 genes to be down-regulated in response to heat stress. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis (including gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis) revealed the genes altered in response to heat stress related to unfolded protein, regulation of translation initiation, regulation of cell proliferation, cell migration and antioxidant regulation. Heat stress caused significant damage to the pig small intestine and altered gene expression in the pig jejunum. The results of the bioinformatic analysis from the present study will be beneficial to further investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in heat stress-induced damage in the pig small intestine.",

Results show patterns associated to interspecific differences in both geographical distribution and time of seasonal reproduction. Sensitivity of locomotor performance to dehydration was lower at low temperatures for R. icterica, the species that are reproductively active during winter and lower at intermediate temperatures for R. schneideri, the species that reproduces mostly during spring, suggesting a pattern of thermal adaptation of locomotor performance for these species. Otherwise, R. ornata, a species with broader reproductive season, shows high sensitivity of locomotor performance to dehydration at all temperatures tested, suggesting a stronger relation of breeding activity with patterns of rainfall than temperature variation.

We applied chronic psychological stress by exposing European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to a previously validated chronic stress protocol (CSP) consisting of 4 different randomly applied stressors per day. Experimental design consisted of a 21\u00a0day CSP (CSP1), a 60\u00a0day recovery (R1), a second 14\u00a0day CSP (CSP2), and a second 30\u00a0day recovery (R2). Body weight decreased by approximately 5% during CSP1, but overshot to 5\u201310% above initial body weight during R1. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we periodically measured 12 biochemical analytes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), bile acids, total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, uric acid, calcium (Ca++), phosphorus (PHOS), potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+). AST and CK increased at the beginning of CSP1, suggesting muscle breakdown. Additionally, decreases in albumin and total protein paired with stable uric acid, but no associated change in glucose, suggested protein breakdown as a secondary energy source. Changes in blood parameters that occurred during CSP1 did not reverse during R1. During CSP2 and R2, weight loss and gain occurred in different proportions. CSP2 produced an approximate 15% decrease in body weight, but R2 resulted in only re-gaining 5% of this weight, although this was equivalent to the pre-CSP1 weight. In summary, protein metabolism appeared to mediate weight loss during chronic stress, but over-gaining weight was not a good indicator of recovery.",

     "abstract": "Yolk reserves supply the majority of embryonic nutrition in squamate reptiles, including calcium. Embryos of oviparous squamates exploit the eggshell for supplemental calcium, while embryos of viviparous species may receive additional calcium via the placenta. Developmental uptake of calcium in oviparous snakes increases during the interval of greatest embryonic growth (stage 35 to parturition). However, the pattern of embryonic calcium acquisition is unknown for viviparous snakes. Furthermore, while the uterus of oviparous species transports calcium early in embryonic development during mineralization of the eggshell, the timing of uterine calcium secretion in viviparous snakes is unknown. We studied a viviparous snake, Virginia striatula, to determine the ontogenetic pattern of yolk and embryonic calcium content. The pattern of embryonic calcium uptake of V. striatula is similar to that of oviparous snakes but the sources of calcium differ. In contrast to oviparous species, embryos of V. striatula acquire half of total neonatal calcium via placental provision, of which 71% is mobilized between stage 35 and parturition. Furthermore, we report for the first time in a viviparous squamate an increase in yolk calcium content during early stages of embryonic development, indicating that uterine secretion of calcium occurs in V. striatula coincident with shelling in oviparous squamates. Thus, uterine calcium secretion in this viviparous species may either occur continuously or in two phases, coincident with the timing of shelling in oviparous species and again during the last stages of development. Whereas, the pattern of embryonic calcium acquisition in V. striatula is plesiomorphic for squamates, the pattern of uterine calcium secretion includes both retention of a plesiomorphic trait and the evolution of a novel trait.",

     "abstract": "The unusual energy metabolism of elasmobranchs is characterized by limited or absent fatty acid oxidation in cardiac and skeletal muscle and a great reliance on ketone bodies and amino acids as oxidative fuels in these tissues. Other extrahepatic tissues in elasmobranchs rely on ketone bodies and amino acids for aerobic energy production but, unlike muscle, also appear to possess a significant capacity to oxidize fatty acids. This organization of energy metabolism is reflected by relatively low plasma levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and by plasma levels of the ketone body \u00df-hydroxybutyrate that are as high as those seen in fasted mammals. The preference for ketone body oxidation rather than fatty acid oxidation in muscle of elasmobranchs under routine conditions is opposite to the situation in teleosts and mammals. Carbohydrates appear to be utilized as a fuel source in elasmobranchs, similar to other vertebrates. Amino acid- and lipid-fueled ketogenesis in the liver, the lipid storage site in elasmobranchs, sustains the demand for ketone bodies as oxidative fuels. The liver also appears to export NEFA and serves a buoyancy role. The regulation of energy metabolism in elasmobranchs and the effects of environmental factors remain poorly understood. The metabolic organization of elasmobranchs was likely present in the common ancestor of the Chondrichthyes ca. 400\u00a0million years ago and, speculatively, it may reflect the ancestral metabolism of jawed vertebrates. We assess hypotheses for the evolution of the unusual energy metabolism of elasmobranchs and propose that the need to synthesize urea has influenced the utilization of ketone bodies and amino acids as oxidative fuels.",

Here we present a synthesis of data from several previous studies on responses in plasma metabolites after natural feeding and during prolonged fasting (up to 56\u00a0days), together with new data on changes in plasma concentrations of amino acids and non-esterified fatty acids. Post-prandial and long-term fasting responses were compared to control sharks fasted for 7\u00a0days, a typical inter-meal interval. A feeding frenzy was created in which dogfish were allowed to feed naturally on dead teleosts at two consumed ration levels, 2.6% and 5.5% of body weight. Most responses were more pronounced at the higher ration level. These included increases in urea and TMAO concentrations at 20\u00a0h, followed by stability through to 56\u00a0days of fasting. Ammonia levels were low and exhibited little short-term response to feeding, but declined to very low values during the extended fast. Glucose and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate both fell after feeding, the latter to a greater and more prolonged extent (up to 60\u00a0h), whereas acetoacetate did not change. During prolonged fasting, glucose concentrations were well regulated, but \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate increased to 2\u20133-fold control levels. Total plasma amino acid concentrations increased in a biphasic fashion, with peaks at 6\u201320\u00a0h, and 48\u201360\u00a0h after the meal, followed by homeostasis during the extended fast. Essential and non-essential amino acids generally followed this same pattern, though some exhibited different trends after feeding: taurine, \u03b2-alanine, and glycine (decreases or stability), alanine and glutamine (modest prolonged increases), and threonine, serine, asparagine, and valine (much larger short-term increases). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations declined markedly through 48\u00a0h after the 2.6% meal. These data are interpreted in light of companion studies showing elevations in aerobic metabolic rate, urea production, rectal gland function, metabolic base excretion, and activation of ornithine\u2013urea cycle and aerobic enzymes after the meal, and muscle N-depletion but maintenance of osmolality and urea production during long-term fasting.",

Values of \u220615N and \u220613C in lipid extracted liver and prey were 1.50\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54 and 0.22\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.18, respectively. Non-lipid extracted diet discrimination factors in liver were highly influenced by lipid content and studies that examine stable isotopes in shark liver, and likely any high lipid tissue, should strive to remove lipid effects through standardising C:N ratios, prior to isotope analysis. Mean vertebral cartilage \u220615N and \u220613C values were 1.45\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 and 3.75\u2030\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44, respectively. Organ \u220615N and \u220613C values were more variable among individual sharks but heart tissue was consistently enriched by ~\u00a01\u20132.5\u2030. Minimal variability in muscle and liver \u03b415N and \u03b413C sampled at different intervals along the length of individual sharks and between liver lobes suggests that stable isotope values are consistent within tissues of individual animals. To our knowledge, these are the first reported diet\u2013tissue discrimination factors for large sharks under semi-controlled conditions, and are lower than those reported for teleost fish.",

     "abstract": "Through convergent evolution tunas and lamnid sharks share thunniform swimming and a medial position of the red, aerobic swimming musculature. During continuous cruise swimming these muscles move uniformly out of phase with local body curvature and the surrounding white muscle tissue. This design results in thrust production primarily from the caudal fin rather than causing whole-body undulations. The common thresher shark (Family Alopiidae) is the only other fish known to share the same medial red muscle anatomy as the thunniform swimmers. However, the overall body shape and extremely heterocercal caudal fin of the common thresher is not shared with the thunniform swimmers, which have both fusiform bodies and high aspect-ratio, lunate caudal fins. Our study used sonomicrometry to measure the dynamics of red and white muscle movement in common thresher sharks swimming in the ocean to test whether the medial position of red muscle is associated with uncoupling of muscle shortening and local body bending as characteristic of thunniform swimmers. Common threshers (\u223c\u00a060\u2013100\u00a0kg) instrumented with sonomicrometric and electromyographic (EMG) leads swam alongside of the vessel with a tail-beat frequency of \u223c\u00a00.5\u00a0Hz. EMG signals confirmed that only the red muscle was active during sustained swimming. Despite the more medial position of the red muscle relative to the white muscle, its strain was approximately 1.5-times greater than that of the overlying white muscle, and there was a notable phase shift between strain trajectories in the red muscle and adjacent white muscle. These results suggest an uncoupling (shearing) of the red muscle from the adjacent white muscle. Although the magnitude of the phase shift between red and white muscle strain was relatively constant within individuals, it varied among sharks, ranging from near zero (red and white in phase) to almost 180\u00b0 out of phase. This extent in variability has not been documented previously for thunniform swimmers with a medial red muscle position and may be a characteristic of the thresher's unique body and caudal fin morphology. Nonetheless, the uncoupling of red and white muscle strain remains a consistent character associated with fishes having a medially positioned red muscle.",

Unlike the open, rounded incurrent nostril of non-hammerhead shark species, the incurrent nostril of S. tudes is a thin keyhole-like aperture. We discovered a groove running anterior and parallel to the incurrent nostril. This groove, dubbed the minor nasal groove to distinguish it from the larger, previously described, (major) nasal groove, is common to all eight hammerhead species. Using life-sized plastic models generated at 200\u00a0\u03bcm resolution from an X-ray scan, we also investigated flow in the nasal region. Even modest oncoming flow speeds stimulate extensive, but not complete, circulation within the model olfactory chamber, with flow passing through the two main olfactory channels. Flow crossed from one channel to another via a gap in the olfactory array, sometimes guided by the interlamellar channels. Major and minor nasal grooves, as well as directing flow into the olfactory chamber, can, in conjunction with the nasal bridge separating incurrent and excurrent nostrils, limit flow passing into the olfactory chamber, possibly to protect the delicate nasal structures. This is the first simulation of internal flow within the olfactory chamber of a shark.",

     "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration\u2013dehydration reactions of CO2. It is present in high abundance in the cytoplasm of vertebrate red blood cells, where it contributes to CO2 excretion. A membrane-bound CA isoform (CA IV) is also present in the lungs of mammals and reptiles, but plays little role in CO2 excretion. The gills of teleost fish appear to lack plasma-accessible CA activity. In elasmobranchs, however, evidence gathered using a variety of physiological, biochemical and molecular approaches suggests that CA IV is present in the gills, and that at least in dogfish, this CA IV makes a significant contribution to CO2 excretion by catalyzing the dehydration of plasma HCO3\u2212. The contribution of CA IV to CO2 excretion is favoured by unusually high relative plasma buffering that aids in the provision of protons for HCO3\u2212 dehydration. Moreover, reduced emphasis on HCO3\u2212 flux through the red blood cell may reflect the occurrence of a slower turnover cytosolic CA in dogfish. This model of CO2 excretion, in which HCO3\u2212 dehydration in the red blood cell catalyzed by cytosolic CA and HCO3\u2212 dehydration in the plasma catalyzed by membrane-bound CA IV are of comparable importance, has been described for the dogfish. Further work is required to determine whether it applies to elasmobranch fish as a group.",

     "abstract": "Interactions between coral reef topography, tide cycles, and photoperiod provided selection pressure for adaptive physiological changes in sheltered hypoxic niches to be exploited by specialized tropical reef fish. The epaulette shark Hemiscyllium ocellatum withstands cyclic hypoxia in its natural environment, many hours of experimental hypoxia, and anoxia for up to 5\u00a0h. It shows neuronal hypometabolism in response to 5% oxygen saturation. Northern-hemisphere hypoxia- and anoxia-tolerant vertebrates that over-winter under ice alter their inhibitory to excitatory neurotransmitter balance to forestall brain ATP depletion in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. GABA immunochemistry, HPLC analysis and receptor binding studies in H. ocellatum cerebellum revealed a heterogeneous regional accumulation of neuronal GABA despite no change in its overall concentration, and a significant increase in GABAA receptor density without altered binding affinity. Increased GABAA receptor density would protect the cerebellum during reoxygenation when transmitter release resumes. While all hypoxia- and anoxia-tolerant teleosts examined to date respond to low oxygen levels by elevating brain GABA, the phylogenetically older epaulette shark did not, suggesting that it uses an alternative neuroprotective mechanism for energy conservation. This may reflect an inherent phylogenetic difference, or represent a novel ecophysiological adaptation to cyclic variations in the availability of oxygen.",

Plasma and stomach fluid osmolality and solute values were comparable between species, and stomach pH was low in all species (2.2 to 3.4) suggesting these elasmobranchs may maintain a consistently low stomach pH. Intestinal osmolality, pH and ion values were comparable between species, however, some differences in ion values were observed. In particular Ca2+ (19.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.65\u00a0mM) and Mg2+ (43.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.11\u00a0mM) were high in L. erinacea and Mg2+ was high (130.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a039.8\u00a0mM) in C. palgiosum which may be an indication of drinking. Furthermore, intestinal fluid HCO3\u2212 values were low (8.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.42 and 8.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.48\u00a0mM) in both skates but very high in C. plagiosum (73.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.3\u00a0mM) suggesting ingested seawater may be processed by species-specific mechanisms. Urea values from the intestine to the colon dropped precipitously in all species, with the greatest decrease seen in C. plagiosum (426.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1 to 0\u00a0mM). This led to the examination of the molecular expression of both a urea transporter and a Rhesus like ammonia transporter in the intestine, rectal gland and kidney in L. erinacea. Both these transporters were expressed in all tissues; however, expression levels of the Rhesus like ammonia transporter were orders of magnitude higher than the urea transporter in the same tissue. Intestinal flux rates of solutes in L. erinacea were, for the most part, in an inward direction with the notable exception of urea. Colon flux rates of solutes in L. erinacea were all in an outward direction, although absolute rates were considerably lower than the intestine, suggestive of a much tighter epithelia. Results are discussed in the context of the potential role of the GI tract in salt and water, and nitrogen, homeostasis in elasmobranchs.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that elasmobranch fish respond differently to metal exposure than marine teleosts. Accumulation rates can be high, which despite the fact that normal background levels for metals in the marine environment are low, is worrying due to the long life span and late fecundity of most shark. The goals of the present study were to examine differences in accumulation rates and toxicity of a range of metals at equimolar concentrations (10\u00a0\u00b5M) in the Mediterranean or spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula. For this purpose, we exposed the dogfish to Ni (587\u00a0\u00b5g/L), Cd (1124\u00a0\u00b5g/L), Pb (2072\u00a0\u00b5g/L), Cu (635\u00a0\u00b5g/L), and Ag (1079\u00a0\u00b5g/L and two additional exposures at 10\u00a0\u00b5g/L and 1\u00a0\u00b5g/L) for one week and measured total metal accumulation, metallothionein induction, and parameters related to osmoregulation. Our study confirms the high toxicity and accumulation rates of Ag for elasmobranch fish, even at levels 100 to 1000 times lower than exposure levels of other metals. Also Pb accumulated readily in all organs, but did not cause any osmoregulatory disturbance at the exposure levels used. Ni and Cd seem to accumulate primarily in the kidney while Cu mainly accumulated in liver. In contrast to Ni and Cd, the three other metals Ag, Cu and Pb accumulated in the rectal gland, an important organ for osmoregulation and possible target organ for metal toxicity. Only Cu succeeded in initiating a protective response by inducing MT synthesis in liver and gills.",

We investigated the effects of prolonged starvation and varying food quality on the structure and function of the GI tract in a detritivorous catfish, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus, native to the Amazonian basin, which experiences seasonal variation in food availability. After 150\u00a0days of starvation or consumption of a wood-diet too low in quality to meet their energetic needs, the fish reduced the surface area of their intestines by 70 and 78%, respectively, and reduced the microvilli surface area by 52 and 27%, respectively, in comparison to wild-caught fish consuming their natural diet and those raised in the laboratory on a high-quality algal diet. Intake and dietary quality did not affect the patterns of digestive enzyme activity along the guts of the fish, and the fish on the low-quality diet had similar mass-specific digestive enzyme activities to wild-caught fish, but lower summed activity when considering the mass of the gut. Overall, P. disjunctivus can endure prolonged starvation and low food quality by down-regulating the size of its GI tract.",

In fresh water (FW), confinement and handling for 0.5, 1, 2 and 6\u00a0h produced elevations in plasma cortisol and glucose; a reduction in plasma osmolality was observed at 6\u00a0h.

In seawater (SW), confinement and handling increased plasma osmolality and glucose between 0.5 and 6\u00a0h; no effect on plasma cortisol was seen due to variable control levels. Concurrently, both PRLs were reduced in stressed fish with only transient changes in the GH/IGF-I axis. Next, the branchial expression of Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC) and Na+/Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NCC) was characterized following confinement and handling for 6\u00a0h. In SW, NKCC mRNA levels increased in stressed fish concurrently with elevated plasma osmolality and diminished gill Na+, K+-ATPase activity; NCC was unchanged in stressed fish irrespective of salinity. Taken together, PRL and NKCC participate in restoring osmotic balance during acute stress while the GH/IGF-I axis displays only modest responses.",

Whether or not this is the case in hypoxia is not known and represents the aim of the study. The heart of chicken embryos at 72\u00a0h (stage HH18) was filmed through a window of the eggshell by a camera attached to a microscope. Stroke volume was estimated from the changes in heart silhouette between systole and diastole. V\u0307O2was measured by a closed system methodology. In normoxia, a decrease in temperature (T) from 39 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C had parallel depressant effects on V\u0307O2and HR. At 39\u00a0\u00b0C, a progressive decrease in O2 lowered V\u0307O2; HR was maintained until the O2 threshold of \u223c\u00a015%. In severe hypoxia (4% O2) V\u0307O2and HR were, respectively, \u223c\u00a012% and \u223c\u00a062% of normoxia. At 32\u00a0\u00b0C the hypoxic threshold for HR was significantly lower. During constant hypoxia (7% O2) V\u0307O2did not respond to T, while the HR response was preserved. Stroke volume changed little with changes in T or O2, except at 6 and 4% O2, when it decreased by \u223c\u00a020 and 30%. In embryos growth-retarded because of incubation in chronic hypoxia, V\u0307O2and HR responses to T and hypoxia were similar to those of normal embryos. We conclude that in the early embryo during hypoxia cardiovascular O2 convection is not responsible for the drop in V\u0307O2. The generalised hypometabolic response, in combination with the extremely small cardiac V\u0307O2, probably explains the minor effects of hypoxia on cardiac activity.",

NKA-IR cells in the lamellar and interlamellar regions significantly increased in DW and 10\u00a0g/L treatments. Only HA-IR cells in the lamellar region were significantly increased in DW.

Following a preparatory period of 75\u00a0days water was adjusted to 10\u00a0\u00b0C and kept for 40\u00a0days. Enzymatic activities and store deposition revealed that the HiE\u2212SW group had acquired an energy surplus whilst the LoE+SW group exhibited an energy deficit. Liver enzyme activities evidenced diet dependence: LoE groups showed greater glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and HiE groups showed greater lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities. Moreover, the HiE\u2212SW group's lower citrate synthase/cytochrome-c-oxidase ratio reflected the energy surplus available. Perivisceral fat mobilisation caused by cold stress affected liver integrity, resulting in a pre-steatotic condition for the HE\u2212SW group. The differences in liver enzyme activities produced by pre-cold conditions disappeared at low temperatures and enzymatic activities did not compensate. Therefore any improvement that would enable gilthead sea bream to face up to winter must be achieved prior to the appearance of low temperatures.",

Software, membrane topology was predicted using HMMTOP algorithm, while qRT-PCR was used to determine tissue-specific gene expression levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Oatp superfamily in zebrafish consists of five families that include 14 SLCO genes. Eight out of 14 transporters do have orthologs or co-orthologs in other vertebrates, while 6 members are found only in fish lineage. Topology analysis showed that all zebrafish Oatps consist of 12 transmembrane domains (TMD) with the large fifth extracellular loop (LP5). Tissue distribution analysis revealed that the expression patterns of Oatp2a1, Oatp2b1 and Oatp3a1 follow tissue distribution patterns of their mammalian (co)orthologs. Expression pattern of a newly identified Oatp1d1 is similar to mouse Oatp1a4, while other new zebrafish Oatps (Oatp1e1, 1f2) do not resemble any of the mammalian Oatps.

The mean total body water was 83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0g, equal to 68.5% of body weight. Mean water flux was 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mL\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01. Season, ambient temperature or sex did not affect any of the measured and estimated physiological variables, but body mass and total body water differed significantly between sexes and among seasons. Our study is the first to provide evidence for a constant FMR in a small mammal in three different seasons and despite different thermal conditions. This suggests that seasonal changes in climate are compensated for by behavioural and physiological adjustments such as huddling and torpor known to be employed extensively by sugar gliders in the wild.",

In the present study, we used a combination of linear and artificial neural network (ANN) modelling to detect and explore interactions among low-dose mixtures of these heavy metals and their impacts on fundamental physiological processes in tissues of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Animals were exposed to Cd (0.001\u20130.400\u00a0\u03bcM), Zn (0.001\u20133.059\u00a0\u03bcM) or Cu (0.002\u20130.787\u00a0\u03bcM), either alone or in combination for 1 to 27\u00a0days. We measured indicators of acid\u2013base balance (hemolymph pH and total CO2), gas exchange (Po2), immunocompetence (total hemocyte counts, numbers of invasive bacteria), antioxidant status (glutathione, GSH), oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation; LPx), and metal accumulation in the gill and the hepatopancreas. Linear analysis showed that oxidative membrane damage from tissue accumulation of environmental metals was correlated with impaired acid\u2013base balance in oysters. ANN analysis revealed interactions of metals with hemolymph acid\u2013base chemistry in predicting oxidative damage that were not evident from linear analyses. These results highlight the usefulness of machine learning approaches, such as ANNs, for improving our ability to recognize and understand the effects of sub-acute exposure to contaminant mixtures.",

By using degenerate primers, partial sequence (812\u00a0bp) of Angpt1 was cloned from Anguilla japonica, and deduced amino acids showed 80% similarity to those of zebrafish. Physiological functions of cloned eel Angpt1 were studied by in vitro and in vivo manipulations with gas glands (rete mirabile) taken as the tested target tissues. RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining techniques were performed to examine the expression patterns of Angpt1 as well as VEGF-Flk. Experimental data showed that, in vitro, bFGF, PPAR beta agonist, and estradiol affected Angpt1 expression; while cobalt ions, a VEGF expression-inducer, did not affect Angpt1 expression. In vivo, expression levels of Angpt1 increased with body growth. Furthermore, Angpt1 expressions increased significantly in the late stage of gas glands in the stimulated eel. Successive expression patterns on VEGF-Flk, and Angpt1 on different development stages of gas glands were observed.

The current study examined mRNA expression of two tight junction proteins (claudin-15 and -25b) predominantly expressed in the intestine of Atlantic salmon. We examined the response in pyloric caecae, middle and posterior intestine to seawater challenge, during smoltification and after injection with osmoregulatory hormones. Seawater (SW) transfer elevated levels of claudin-15 and -25b while no change was induced throughout the smolt stage. In freshwater, cortisol and growth hormone inhibited claudin-15 expression in the two anterior segments. Claudin-25b was elevated in all intestinal segments by growth hormone, while cortisol had an inhibitory effect. In seawater, prolactin and cortisol inhibited claudin expression. The data suggest that claudin expression is involved in the reorganisation of intestinal epithelium and possibly change paracellular permeability during SW acclimation. The lack of preparatory change during smoltification suggests that this process is not completed during smolt development. The effects of the tested hormones cannot explain the sum of changes induced by salinity, which, like the smoltification data, suggests the importance of additional factors and possibly contact with the imbibed SW per se.",

The activity of the Malpighian tubules (MTs) is facilitated by the increase of the circulation of the haemolymph produced by the increase of the aorta contractions as well as, of the peristaltic waves of the anterior midgut. MTs of Triatoma infestans secrete an allatotropin-like peptide, which has a myostimulatory effect on the hindgut, inducing the mixing and voiding of the content during post-prandial diuresis. We are reporting now the activity of allatotropin (AT) as a cardioacceleratory and a myostimulatory peptide at the level of the anterior midgut. The peptide induced the increase of the rate of contractions of the anterior midgut and the aorta in a wide range of concentrations. The cardioacceleratory effect of AT was dependent on the feeding state of the insects and on the presence of serotonin. The response showed the existence of a differential behavior between sexes, inducing a higher increase on the frequency of contractions, as well as, the width of the aorta in males than in females. Finally, our results suggest that AT interacts with serotonin to facilitate the circulation of haemolymph during post-prandial diuresis.",

There are environmental variations that affect the availability as well as the quality of such resources; energy extraction also depends on the design of the digestive tract. It is expected that features associated with food utilization will be subjected to selective pressures and show some adjustment to the variability of the environment. Since energetic constraints challenge animals to display digestive compensatory mechanisms, the objective of this study is to determine the physiological and behavioral responses to spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in food quality. We investigated digestive strategies (digestive efficiency and coprophagy) in cavies inhabiting two different populations, and hence naturally experiencing different levels of diet quality. Cavies under experimentally different quality diets showed changes in dry matter digestibility and intake, digesta retention time and coprophagy. Our results partially support the expectations from theory and also reveal interpopulation differences in the ability to cope with changes in food quality, and may explain the capability of Microcavia australis to colonize extreme habitats.",

Lower body temperatures in winter may offset the increased energetic cost of remaining active in the cold, if cellular metabolism is not constrained by a negative thermodynamic effect. We aimed to determine whether variable body temperatures can be advantageous for small endotherms by testing the hypothesis that body temperature fluctuates seasonally in a wild rat (Rattus fuscipes); conferring an energy saving and reducing food requirements during resource restricted winter. Additionally we tested whether changes in body temperature affected tissue specific metabolic capacity. Winter acclimatized rats had significantly lower body temperatures and thicker fur than summer acclimatized rats. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption and the activity of enzymes that control oxidative (citrate synthase, cytochrome c-oxidase) and anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) metabolism were elevated in winter and were not negatively affected by the lower body temperature. Energy transfer modeling showed that lower body temperatures in winter combined with increased fur thickness to confer a 25\u00a0kJ\u00a0day\u2212\u00a01 energy saving, with up to 50% owing to reduced body temperature alone. We show that phenotypic plasticity at multiple levels of organization is an important component of the response of a small endotherm to winter.

The present study investigated the role of melatonin in seasonal accumulation of adipose tissue in Scotophilus heathi, with particular reference to its role in glucose homeostasis and development of insulin resistance. The circulating melatonin levels correlated positively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with the changes in body mass due to fat accumulation and circulating insulin level, but correlated negatively with the blood glucose level in S. heathi. The bats showed high circulating blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance during the period of fat deposition suggesting insulin resistance condition which improves after winter when most of the fat has been utilized as a metabolic fuel. The high circulating melatonin levels during the period of maximum body fat at the beginning of winter prepare the bats for winter dormancy by modulating the glucose homeostasis through affecting blood glucose levels, muscle and liver glycogen stores, insulin receptor and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) expression. This is also confirmed by in vivo study in which melatonin injection improves the glucose tolerance, increases muscle insulin receptor and GLUT 4 expression, and enhances glucose clearance from the blood. The results of present study further showed that the effect of melatonin injection on the blood glucose levels is determined by the metabolic state of the bats and may protect from decrease in blood glucose level during extreme starvation, however, melatonin when injected during fed state increases glucose clearance from the blood. In summary, the present study suggested that melatonin interferes with the glucose homeostasis through modulating intracellular glucose transport and may protect bats from hypoglycemia during winter dormancy.",

     "abstract": "Emerging evidence has shown that acute heat exposure affects metabolic characteristics and causes oxidative damage to skeletal muscle in birds. Little is known, however, about such phenomena under chronic heat stress conditions. To address this, we designed the present study to determine the influence of cyclic (32 to 24 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C: 32 \u00b0C for 8 h/d, 32\u201324\u201332HS ), and constant (32 and 34\u00a0\u00b0C, 32HS and 34HS, respectively) heat exposure on the metabolic and peroxide status in skeletal muscle of 4-wk-old male broiler chickens. Heat stress, particularly in the 32HS and 34HS groups, depressed feed intake and growth, while cyclic high temperature gave rise to a less severe stress response in performance terms. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in skeletal muscle were enhanced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by constant heat treatment; the degree of enhancement was not as large as the changes observed in our previous \u2018acute\u2019 heat stress model. The 3HADH (3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase related to fatty acid oxidation) and CS (citrate synthase) enzyme activities were lowered (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by both the cyclic and constant 34HS treatments, and constant 34HS group, respectively. These results suggest that chronic heat exposure decreases metabolic oxidation capacity in skeletal muscle of broiler chickens. On exposure to chronic heat stress, GPx activity remained relatively constant, though a temperature-dependent elevation in Cu/Zn-SOD activity was observed, implying that anti-oxidation ability was disturbed by the chronic stress condition. From these results it can be concluded that chronic heat stress did not induce oxidative damage to a major extent. This may probably be due to a decrease in metabolic oxidation capacity or due to a self-propagating scavenging system, though the system was not fully activated.",

We investigated the impact of cold-exposure (4\u00a0\u00b0C) and recovery (26\u00a0\u00b0C) on the cell cycle activity of the Plodia interpunctella Lepidoptera cell line IAL-PID2 and on the expression of B-type cyclin (PcycB), ecdysone receptor (B1-isoform; PiEcR-B1), and Hsc70 (PiHsc70) mRNA. Cold-exposure significantly reduced expression of these mRNAs, while their levels increased to above control values during subsequent recovery at the normal growth temperature. When cold-exposed cells were returned to 26\u00a0\u00b0C, cell cycle activity restarted, but apoptosis was strongly increased. The presence of 20E appeared to increase this apoptotic phenomenon. This result is consistent with the described protective role of 20E against a variety of stressors and with the capacity of 20E to induce cell death in different situations. Here, we illustrate for the first time a connection between 20E treatment and Hsc70 expression during cold-exposure and subsequent recovery in insect cells. Combined with the 20E-induced apoptotic response, our results suggest that regulation of Hsc70 expression by 20E could act in synergy with the control of apoptotic cell death in order to optimize the survival of specific cell populations after a period of cold-exposure.",

Comparative immunologists contributed to eliminate the idea of a static immune system in invertebrates, making necessary to re-consider the evolutive meaning of immunological memory of vertebrates. If the anticipatory immune system represents a maximally efficient immune system, why can it be observed only in vertebrates, especially in consideration that molecular hypervariability exists also in invertebrates? Using well-established theories concerning the evolution of the vertebrate immunity as theoretical basis we analyze from an Eco-immunology-based perspective why a memory-based immune system may have represented an evolutive advantage for jawed vertebrates. We hypothesize that for cold-blooded vertebrates memory represents a complimentary component that flanks the robust and fundamental innate immunity. Conversely, immunological memory has become indispensable and fully exploited in warm-blooded vertebrates, due to their stable inner environment and high metabolic rate, respectively.",

Within a mixed MR cell population, one cell type displayed Na+-independent pHi recovery while the other cell type lacked a Na+-independent pHi recovery. Cells displaying Na+ independent recovery exhibited a significantly higher buffering capacity compared to cells lacking Na+-independent pHi recovery. Cells displaying Na+ independent recovery were identified as PNA+ (peanut lectin agluttinin binding) MR cells while those unable to recover were identified as PNA\u2212 (non-peanut lectin agluttinin binding) MR cells. Therefore, recovery from acidification in the absence of Na+ provides a direct functional marker for PNA+ and PNA\u2212 MR cells. Re-addition of Na+ to acidified cells resulted in a transient pHi recovery in both cell types. This event was abolished by amiloride (500\u00a0\u00b5M) but it was insensitive to phenamil (50\u00a0\u00b5M).

     "abstract": "The highly derived mechanism birds use to ventilate their lungs relies on dorsoventral excursions of their heavily muscled sternum and abdominal viscera. Our expectation of the level of mechanical work involved in this mechanism led us to hypothesize that the metabolic cost of breathing is higher in birds than in other tetrapods. To test this theory, we used unidirectional artificial ventilation (UDV) to stop normal ventilatory movements in guinea fowl (Numida meleagris L.) at rest and during treadmill locomotion at three speeds. Oxygen consumption was measured during normal breathing and UDV, and the difference was used to approximate the cost of ventilation. Contrary to our prediction, metabolism increased when ventilatory movements ceased during UDV at rest. Although we do not understand why this occurred we suspect that UDV induced a homeostatic mechanism to counteract the loss of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, across all running speeds, metabolism decreased significantly with UDV, indicating a minimum cost of ventilation during running of 1.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62% of total running metabolism or 0.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0mL O2 (L ventilated)\u2212\u00a01.

The puffer fish GI tract was divided into three regions (anterior, middle and posterior) and four isoforms of claudin-3 (Tncldn3a, Tncldn3b, Tncldn3c and Tncldn3d) were found to be expressed in each section.

In situ hybridization indicated that all Tncldn3 isoforms localized to the mucosal epithelium in the intestine. The mRNA abundance of Tncldn3 isoforms varied spatially along the GI tract. Furthermore, region as well as isoform specific alterations in mRNA abundance could be observed along the GI tract in response to salinity change. Qualitative TEM observations suggested that the depth of TJ complexes increased from anterior to posterior along the GI tract and that TJ complexes in the GI tract of FW fish were deeper than those in SW. NKA activity increased from anterior to posterior in fish acclimated to FW, whereas activity in fish acclimated to SW was uniformly high along the length of the intestine. Taken together data; (1) suggest a progressive decrease in epithelial permeability from anterior to posterior along the longitudinal axis of the puffer fish GI tract, (2) indicate that claudin-3 protein isoforms may play a role in regulating paracellular movement of solutes across this epithelium, and (3) provide further evidence that claudin-3 proteins are involved in the homeostatic control of salt and water balance in fishes.",

Examination of tissues revealed significant changes in morphology and ultrastructure of both gills and the integument following acutely lethal exposure to low pH water. Changes to the gills of acid-exposed L. fallax larvae included lifting of the branchial epithelium and opening of tight junctions between pavement cells (with a consequent reduction in tight junction length). Damage to epithelial cell\u2013cell tight junctions was also apparent at the integument along with widespread oncosis and localised epithelial necrosis.

Changes in morphology and ultrastructure at low pH were accompanied by significant Na+ loss (up to 50% of the total body Na+ content) attributable in large part to increased paracellular ionic efflux across the gills as well as increased transcellular and paracellular efflux of ions across the integument.",

     "abstract": "Fish, unlike mammals, can regenerate axons in the optic nerve following optic nerve injury. We hypothesized that using microarray analysis to compare gene expression in fish which had experienced optic nerve lesion to fish which had undergone a similar operation but without optic nerve injury would reveal genes specifically involved in responding to optic nerve injury (including repair), reducing detection of genes involved in the general stress and inflammatory responses. We discovered 120 genes were significantly (minimally two-fold with a P-value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) differentially expressed (up or down) at one or more time point. Among these was ATF3, a member of the cAMP-response element binding protein family. Work by others has indicated that elevated cAMP could be important in axon regeneration. We investigated ATF3 expression further by qRT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry and found ATF3 expression is significantly upregulated in the ganglion cell layer of the retina, the nerve fiber layer and the optic nerve of the injured eye. The upregulation in retina is detectable by qRT-PCR by 24\u00a0h after injury, at which time ATF-3 mRNA levels are 8-fold higher than in retinas from sham-operated fish. We conclude ATF3 may be an important mediator of optic nerve regeneration-promoting gene expression in fish, a role which merits further investigation.",

Myostatin (MSTN) is implicated in double-muscling when mutated in mammals, indicating that MSTN is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle formation. In order to elucidate the role of an MSTN equivalent in fish muscle formation, we created a transgenic medaka strain that expresses dominant-negative MSTN exclusively in skeletal muscle, d-rR-Tg(OlMA1\u2013C315Y\u2013MSTN\u2013hrGFPII\u2013FLAG). The transgenic fish exhibited increased production of skeletal muscle fibers at the adult stage (hyperplasia), although gross muscle mass was not altered. During embryogenesis, ectopic accumulation and misalignment of muscle fibers, possibly due to muscle-fiber hypertrophy, were observed in the transgenic medaka. Our findings suggest that MSTN function is required for regulating the appropriate growth of skeletal muscle in medaka. Unlike in mammals, MSTN loss-of-function failed to induce double-muscling in medaka, despite the highly conserved nature of MSTN function among taxa.",

Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",

We investigated the passage kinetics of fluid and particle markers (2, 10 and 20\u00a0mm) in fistulated cattle (Bos primigenius f. taurus), muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and moose (Alces alces) on different diets. The distribution of dry matter in the rumen and the viscosity of rumen fluids suggested that the rumen contents were more stratified in muskoxen than moose. Correspondingly, as in previous studies, the species differed in the ratio of mean retention times of small particles to fluids in the reticulorumen, which was highest in cattle (2.03) and muskoxen (1.97\u20131.98), intermediate in reindeer (1.70) and lowest in moose (0.98\u20131.29). However, the ratio of large to small particle retention did not differ between the species, indicating similarity in the efficiency of the particle sorting mechanism. Passage kinetics of the two largest particle classes did not differ, indicating that particle retention is not a continuous function of particle size but rather threshold-dependent. Overall, the results suggest that fluid flow through the forestomach differs between ruminant species. A lower relative fluid passage, such as in moose, might limit species to a browse-based dietary niche, whereas a higher relative fluid passage broadens the dietary niche options and facilitates the inclusion of, or specialization on, grass. The function of fluid flow in the ruminant forestomach should be further investigated.",

In addition, we also studied plasma steroid hormone levels and spawning performances in female fish injected with a single dose of D-Ala6, Pro9-Net-mGnRH (LHRHa: 50\u00a0\u00b5g/kg), human chronic gonadotropin (HCG: 1,500\u00a0IU/kg) and carp pituitary extract (CPE: 10\u00a0mg/kg). In all experiments, samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h after exposure. T4 exposure via dietary route produced differential and enhanced effects, compared with when the compound was injected to the broodstock. A significant association between exposure to dietary T4, elevated plasma steroid hormone levels, maturation-, spawning-, fertilization- and hatching rate, egg diameter, embryogenesis and larval growth were observed. Interestingly, we observed that broodstock groups fed with T4 doses spawned 20\u00a0days earlier than the control group. Thus, we propose that these differences may be attributed to higher systemic availability of T4 due to dietary exposure that is easily transferable to eggs and embryos, as opposed to injection that require absorption to increase bioavailability. Furthermore, our results show that LHRHa, CPE and HCG produced significant increase in spawning rate, but significantly reduced fertilization- and hatching rates. Waigieu seaperch is a new candidate for marine aquaculture in Vietnam and relatively little is known about the reproductive biology and endocrinology of this species. Therefore, the present study forms an integral basis for understanding the reproductive endocrinology of a tropical marine finfish with increasing aquaculture prospects and may also contribute in the development of sustainable aquaculture of this species in a developing country such as Vietnam.",

Such cholinergic suppression of electric activity was observed in the atrial myocardium of frog and in both fish species, but not in reptilians.

In several preparations of frog atrium, cholinergic suppression of excitation coincided with episodes of atrial fibrillation.

It is likely to be caused by IKACh activation and may be important for initiation of atrial arrhythmias.",

Thus, we measured dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) and cardiac function in 8 and 15\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated flounder exposed to graded hypoxia, and in 8\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish exposed to an acute temperature increase to their critical thermal maximum (CTM). The extent of bradycardia in 8\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish (decrease in heart rate of 41%) was consistent with that observed for other teleosts, as was this species' CTM (25.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C) and its cardiac response to increasing temperature. However, this study provides further examples of how cardiovascular function is controlled differently in the flounder as compared with other fishes. First, the onset of bradycardia in 8\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish occurred earlier than expected for this inactive and hypoxia-tolerant species (60% water air saturation). Second, resting cardiac output was similar in flounder acclimated to 8 and 15\u00a0\u00b0C (\u223c\u00a015\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01), and hypoxic bradycardia was surprisingly absent at 15\u00a0\u00b0C.

The VO2max increased with increasing temperature, but the relative residual metabolic scope (VO2max\u2212\u00a0VO2peak) during swimming decreased with increasing in temperature.

The general model of freeze tolerance is of extracellular ice formation (EIF) whereby ice formation in the haemocoel leads to osmotic dehydration of the cells, whose contents remain unfrozen. However, survivable intracellular ice formation (IIF) has been reported in fat body and certain other cells of some insects. Although the cellular location of ice has been determined only in vitro, several lines of evidence suggest that IIF occurs in vivo. Both cell-to-cell propagation of intracellular ice and inoculation from the haemocoel may be important, although the route of ice into the cell is unclear. It is unclear why some cells survive IIF and others do not, but it is suggested that the shape, size, and low water content of fat body cells may predispose them towards surviving ice formation. We speculate that IIF may reduce water loss in some freeze tolerant species, but there are too few data to build a strong conceptual model of the advantages of IIF. We suggest that new developments in microscopy and other forms of imaging may allow investigation of the cellular location of ice in freeze tolerant insects in vivo.",

     "abstract": "North Western European populations of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) appear to have been saved from extinction by settling, i.e. stopping migration. Settled storks exposed to winter conditions must cope with periods of potentially high energy demands that would otherwise be avoided by the migration process. Doubly labeled water (DLW) was therefore used to examine the seasonal variation (summer vs winter) in daily energy expenditure (DEE) and the body composition of adult and immature storks of both sexes. Male White Storks showed a higher DEE over the winter period than in summer compared with females; in particular, immature males exhibited greater energy expenditure in winter than adult males. Thus, the DEE did not significantly differ between summer and winter (except for immature males), reflecting an absence of thermoregulation cost in winter. For both age classes, total body mass increased in winter, which was mainly due to an increase in fat mass. Adult storks were 5% heavier than immature storks. The sexes differed in body mass, with males weighing significantly more than females by 11%. Mean LBM (lean body mass) was 8.5% higher in adults than in immatures, and was 11.5% higher in males compared with females. Between their first and second summers, immatures accumulated a lean body mass to finally reach the same values as adults, indicating a phase of muscle development. The mean fat mass of the storks did not differ between age classes or between sexes. Based on physiological parameters, this study shows that settled White Storks are able to cope with mild winter periods when they are artificially provided with food. In a view to preserve favourable habitats for this species, it is therefore necessary to decide on a plan of action for breeding areas.",

Forty-two females were divided into the fed and fasted groups, in which the latter was deprived of food for 3\u00a0days. After 66\u00a0h fasting, half of the gerbils in each group were injected with phosphate buffered saline or phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) solution. T cell-mediated immunity assessed by PHA response was suppressed in the fasted gerbils compared with the fed gerbils. The fasted gerbils had lower body fat mass, wet and dry thymus mass, dry spleen mass, white blood cells, serum leptin and blood glucose concentrations, but higher corticosterone concentrations than those of the controls. Moreover, PHA response was positively correlated with body fat mass and serum leptin levels in the immunochallenged groups. Taken together, acute fasting leads to immunosuppression, which might be caused by low body fat mass and low serum leptin concentrations in female Mongolian gerbils.",

Deduced amino acid sequences of these proteins revealed about 30% identity with those of sea urchin major yolk protein (MYP) and therefore they were designated AjMYP1 and AjMYP2. The full-length cDNAs for AjMYP1 and AjMYP2 consisted of 4600 and 4420\u00a0bp, with predicted protein lengths of 1365 and 1345 amino acid residues, respectively. RT-PCR detected transcripts for both types of AjMYPs in all the tissues and organs examined. The transcript levels of both AjMYPs in the ovary were apparently elevated at late stages of ovarian development whereas the MYP content of the ovary examined by SDS-PAGE remained stable throughout ovarian development.",

Measured by Multi-Angle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS), Sclerolinum shows a 3190\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0kDa hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin (HBL-Hb) and a 461\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046\u00a0kDa ring-Hb, just as vestimentifera, whereas Oligobrachia has a 409\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0kDa ring-Hb only. Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) showed Sclerolinum HBL-Hb composed of seven monomeric globins (15\u201316\u00a0kDa), three disulfide-bonded globin heterodimers and three linkers. The heterodimers always contain globin-b (15814.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0Da). Sclerolinum ring-Hb is composed of globins and dimers with identical masses as its HBL-Hb, but lacks linkers. Oligobrachia ring-Hb has three globin monomers (14\u201315\u00a0kDa) only, with no disulfide-bonded dimers. Comparison of Sclerolinum hemoglobins between Storegga and Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano, using the normalized height of deconvoluted ESI-MS peaks, shows differences in globin monomers abundances that could reflect genetic differences or differential gene expression between distinct seep populations.

ESA elevated hemolymph levels of MF in male lobsters. Enzyme activity suggested that increased MF production on day one was due largely to elevated HMGR activity while changes in FAOMeT activity closely paralleled changes in MF levels on day 14. Transcript levels for HMGR and FAOMeT changed little on day one, but both increased substantially on day 14. We treated ESA males with a partially purified mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MOIH) and observed a significant decline in MF levels, FAOMeT activity, and FAOMeT\u2013mRNA levels after 5\u00a0h. However, no effect was observed on HMGR activity or its mRNA indicating that they must be regulated by a separate sinus gland peptide.

Levels of E2 in both sexes ranged from 0.5 to 2\u00a0ng/mL from September to March, peaked in late April (2\u20134\u00a0ng/mL), and decreased in May, with levels higher in males than in females. Levels of P were low from September through April, but then increased substantially during May (2\u20134\u00a0ng/mL), with levels again highest in males. Levels of 15\u03b1-T in males were around 0.75\u00a0ng/mL through the winter before exceeding 1\u00a0ng/mL in April and decreasing thereafter, whereas females showed a gradual increase from 0.25\u00a0ng/mL in November to 0.5\u00a0ng/mL in April before decreasing. Thyroxine concentrations differed between fish in each year, with most having levels ranging from 0.75 to 2.5\u00a0ng/mL in the fall and winter, and only fish in 2003 showing distinct peaks (3\u20134\u00a0ng/mL) in early April or May. Plasma T3 was undetectable from November through mid-March before surging dramatically in April (ca. 150\u00a0ng/mL) and decreasing thereafter. Levels of protein, TGs, and glucose decreased or were stable during the fall and winter with TGs and glucose surging in late April to early May for some fish.

Adipose fat of healthy wild crocodiles differs minimally from diseased ones, respectively with 37.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6% vs. 43.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 43.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9% in dead crocodiles, while polyunsaturated fatty acids decrease from 27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9% to as low as 21.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6% respectively.

     "abstract": "This study investigates the potential effects of moulting, and the concomitant period of fasting undertaken by ringed seals, on hormone, vitamin and contaminant status in adult animals in a population from Svalbard, Norway, which has relatively low contaminant levels. Concentrations of circulating total and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine, circulating and hepatic vitamin A, hepatic persistent organic pollutants and their circulating hydroxyl metabolites were higher in moulting seals compared to pre-moulting seals. The opposite trend was observed for body condition, circulating calcitriol levels and hepatic mRNA expression of thyroid hormone receptor \u03b2. No differences were observed for circulating or hepatic vitamin E levels or hepatic mRNA expressions for deioidinase 1 or 2, or retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 between the two seal groups. The observed differences are likely the result of increased metabolic rates required during moulting to maintain thermal balance and replace the pelage, in combination with mobilization of lipid soluble compounds from blubber stores during the fasting period that is associated with moulting. The present study shows that contaminant levels and their relationships with physiological or endogenous variables can be highly confounded by moulting/fasting status. Thus, moulting status and body condition should be taken into consideration when using variables related to thyroid, calcium or vitamin A homeostasis as biomarkers for contaminant effects.",

Cave-dwelling organisms thus have to cope with fasting periods that can extend from a month to a year. However, adaptive fasting resistance previously found in subterranean fauna has only been highlighted by direct comparisons with phylogenetically distant epigean organisms, which could severely impact conclusions. Here we report physiological and metabolic responses to 42\u00a0days of fasting followed by 10\u00a0days of refeeding in two populations (one subterranean and one epigean) of Calotriton asper. In the fed state (control), the hypogean population exhibited a hypometabolism together with higher glycogen (+\u00a025% in liver and muscles) and triglyceride stores (+\u00a050% in muscles). During the fasting period, cave individuals exhibited a 20% decrease in VO2 whereas epigean individuals experienced no significant change. In addition, the energetic reserves always remained higher in the hypogean population. According to phylogenic and biogeographic data, cave colonization by this species dates back to less than 10,000\u00a0years, suggesting a rapid selection of adaptive traits related to fasting. This study strongly suggests that cave colonization induces a decrease in metabolism together with a higher capacity to accumulate energy reserves and therefore to withstand unpredictable fasting periods.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to examine the involvement of cortisol on melatonin synthesis in the pineal organ of the Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. The circulating levels of melatonin in this species exhibited daily variations with a decrease during the photophase (0600, 1200, and 1800\u00a0h) and an increase during the scotophase (0000\u00a0h), while cortisol levels peaked during the early photophase (0600\u00a0h). The pineal organ was cultured in vitro in the dark in the presence of cortisol mimicking either stressed (100\u00a0ng/mL) or resting (10\u00a0ng/mL) concentration in tilapia. High cortisol concentration significantly reduced the levels of melatonin secreted into the medium. In the fish reared under stressful conditions, the nocturnal circulating levels of cortisol increased significantly, while melatonin did not change significantly. We detected glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcripts in the pineal organ and a quantitative real-time PCR revealed that this receptor mRNA abundance fluctuated diurnally, increasing at 0600, 1800, and 0000\u00a0h and decreasing at 1200\u00a0h. The GR mRNA abundance in the pineal organ was not altered either in vitro when the organ was cultured in the presence of 100\u00a0ng/mL cortisol or in vivo when the fish were reared under stressful conditions. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that cortisol lowers melatonin synthesis in the pineal organ, while the role of GR signaling in this process remains to be established.",

     "abstract": "This study examines the role of a myoplasmic protein, parvalbumin, in enhancing muscle relaxation by fishes. Parvalbumin is thought to bind free Ca2+ during muscle contraction, thereby reducing intracellular [Ca2+] in muscle and speeding muscle relaxation by reducing Ca2+ availability to the troponin complex. We hypothesized that parvalbumin expression is ubiquitously expressed in fish muscle and that its expression levels and role in muscle relaxation would depend on the activity level and the thermal environment of a given fish species. Muscle contractile properties and patterns of parvalbumin expression were examined in pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and two species of toadfish (gulf toadfish, Opsanus beta, and oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau). Unlike another sparid (sheepshead), the active swimming pinfish does not express parvalbumin in its slow-twitch red muscle. However, both sheepshead and pinfish have relatively high levels of parvalbumin in their myotomal white muscle. Gulf toadfish from the Gulf of Mexico expressed higher levels of parvalbumin and had faster muscle relaxation rates than oyster toadfish from more northern latitudes. The faster muscle of gulf toadfish also expressed relatively more of one parvalbumin isoform, suggesting differences in the binding properties of the two isoforms observed in toadfish swimming muscle. Parvalbumin expression and its role in muscle relaxation appear to vary widely in fishes. There are many control points involved in the calcium transient of contracting muscle, leading to a variety of species-specific solutions to the modulation of muscle relaxation.",

     "abstract": "Predation is considered one of the main costs to reproduction but is rarely examined from a physiological perspective. In particular, little is known about the influence of brood predation pressure on the physiology of parents engaged in care. Brood defense, even when there is no direct threat to the parent, can be costly as it requires constant vigilance and chasing predators to protect the developing brood and maintain parental investment (i.e., fitness). Our goal was to examine the influence of natural variation in nest predation pressure on the physiology of the teleost smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, an animal that provides sole-paternal care for developing offspring. More specifically, we used indicators of anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) and aerobic capacity (cytochrome c oxidase [CCO] and citrate synthase [CS]) in axial white muscle and pectoral red muscle to test for differences in antipredator performance of nest guarding males across six lakes with natural variation in nest predation pressure. Pectoral red muscle enzyme activities and protein concentrations were highly conserved among populations, while axial white muscle showed differences in LDH activities, CCO activities and protein concentrations. However, there was no evidence for higher metabolic capacities in fish from lakes with increased brood predation pressure. Clearly, factors other than predation pressure have a greater influence on white muscle metabolic capacities. Additional research is needed to clarify the extent to which biotic and abiotic factors influence the enzyme activity and organismal performance in wild animals, particularly at the level of the individual and population.",
