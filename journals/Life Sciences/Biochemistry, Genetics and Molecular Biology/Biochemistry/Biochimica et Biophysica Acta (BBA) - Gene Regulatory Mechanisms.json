     "abstract": "Although hepatic stellate cells (HSC) represent the major source of fibrogenesis in the liver under various pathological conditions, other cell types including hepatic parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) also contribute to HSC activation and hence liver fibrosis. The underlying mechanism, however, is poorly defined. Here we report that hepatocytes exposed to high concentrations of glucose (HG) emit a pro-fibrogenic cue as evidenced by the observation that primary HSCs cultured in conditioned media (CM) collected from hepatocytes exposed to HG up-regulated the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins compared to CM collected from hepatocytes exposed to low glucose. We further identified the pro-fibrogenic cue from hepatocytes to be connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) because either depletion of endogenous CTGF in hepatocytes with siRNA or the addition of a CTGF-specific neutralizing antibody to the CM blunted the pro-fibrogenic effect elicit by HG treatment. Of interest, we discovered that genetic ablation or pharmaceutical inhibition of the transcriptional modulator MKL1 in hepatocytes also abrogated the HG-induced pro-fibrogenic effects. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with AP-1 and SMAD3 to trans-activate CTGF in hepatocytes in response to HG treatment. In conclusion, our data suggest that MKL1 contribute to HSC activation in a non-autonomous fashion by promoting CTGF transcription in hepatocytes.",

     "abstract": "Senescence is a stress-responsive cellular program that leads to cell cycle arrest. In cancer cells, senescence has profound implications for tumor aggressiveness and clinical outcome, but the molecular events that provoke cancer cells to undergo senescence remain unclear. Herein, we provide evidence that the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A supports the growth of Glioblastoma tumor cells and its inhibition triggers senescence response. LSD1 is a histone modifier that participates in key aspects of gene transcription as well as in the regulation of methylation dynamics of non-histone proteins. We found that down-regulation of LSD1 inhibits Glioblastoma cell growth, impairs mTOR pathway and cell migration and induces senescence. At mechanistic level, we found that LSD1 regulates HIF-1\u03b1 protein stability. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated silencing of LSD1 expression effectively reduces HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels, which suffices for the induction of senescence. Our findings elucidate a mechanism whereby LSD1 controls senescence in Glioblastoma tumor cells through the regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, and we propose the novel defined LSD1/HIF-1\u03b1 axis as a new target for the therapy of Glioblastoma tumors.",

Recent studies have correlated down-regulation of Claudins with augmented breast cancer malignancy and poor prognosis.

Here we report that expression levels of Brahma (BRM) were down-regulated in triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-231) compared to the less malignant MCF-7 cells and in high-grade human breast cancer specimens compared to low-grade ones. TGF-\u03b2 treatment in MCF-7 cells repressed BRM transcription likely through targeting C/EBP\u03b2. BRM over-expression suppressed whereas BRM knockdown promoted TGF-\u03b2 induced migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells. BRM down-regulation was accompanied by the loss of a panel of Claudins in breast cancer cells. BRM directly bound to the promoter region of Claudin genes via interacting with Sp1 and activated transcription by modulating histone modifications.

In recent years, genomic and transcriptomic resources have become increasingly available for many helminths, but only a limited number of reports in this area are on the regulatory effects of host microRNAs on parasitic nematodes. In this work, we screened increased expression of host microRNAs after nematode infection from miRNA-seq data and predicted target genes by combined bioinformatics analysis and transcriptional profiling. We elucidated regulatory effects of one host miRNA on nematode infection using miRNA inhibitor and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based TuD miRNA inhibitor. Using AAV-based TuD miRNA inhibitor, we showed that stable blockade of mmu-miR-101b-3p could alleviate the pathological damages of Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a parasitic nematode. Data from a luciferase report assay showed that mmu-miR-101b-3p targeted the extracellular superoxide dismutase 3 (Acsod3). Increased Acsod3 expression in larvae and alleviated oxidative damages were seen in the groups receiving mmu-miR-101b-3p inhibitor treatment in vitro and AAV-based TuD miRNA inhibitor injection in vivo. Results of this study demonstrate that murine miR-101b-3p inhibits the expression of antioxidant enzyme in A. cantonensis to strengthen host oxidative responses to nematodes.

In this study, we showed up-regulation of miR-15/16 during HGF- and FGF4-induced hepatocyte differentiation from amniotic epithelial cells (AECs). To elucidate the role of miR-15/16 and their targets in hepatocyte differentiation, we investigated the roles of miR-15/16 in both the MAPK and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathways, which were predicted to be involved in miR-15/16 signaling. Our results demonstrated that the transcription of miR-15/16 was enhanced by c-Fos, c-Jun, and CREB, important elements of the MAPK pathway, and miR-15/16 in turn directly targeted adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, a major member of the \u03b2-catenin degradation complex. MiR-15/16 destroyed these degradation complexes to activate \u03b2-catenin, and the activated \u03b2-catenin combined with LEF/TCF7L1 to form a transcriptional complex that enhanced transcription of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4\u03b1). HNF4\u03b1 also bound the promoter region of miR-15/16 and promoted its transcription, thereby forming a regulatory circuit to promote the differentiation of AECs into hepatocytes. Endogenous miRNAs are, therefore, involved in hepatocyte differentiation from AECs and should be considered during the development of an effective hepatocyte transplant therapy for liver damage.",

Targeting PcG complex to a specific locus is mediated by DNA sequences known as Polycomb response elements. Interestingly, these PREs are also recognized by TrxG proteins to antagonise PcG mediated gene repression. In this study, we have characterised DNA binding property of rice trithorax group factor ULTRAPETALA1 (OsULT1) which has a SAND domain and B\u2013box motif. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicates cold induced enrichment of OsULT1 occupancy and a decrease in H3K27me3 mark in the promoter region of OsDREB1b gene, during transcription activation. OsULT1 binds to the cis motif \u201cGAGAG\u201d, and the sequence specificity is contributed mainly by the SAND domain. GAGAG is one of the cis motifs present in PREs that are recognized by Drosophila GAGA factor and Pipsqueak. Thus, binding of OsULT1 to GAGAG motif, along with a decrease in H3K27me3 suggests that OsULT1 antagonises the repressive effect of PcG complex for transcriptional activation of OsDREB1b. Moreover, OsULT1 interacts with rice SET domain-containing methyltransferase TRX1, suggesting OsULT1 is an integral part of plant Trithorax group complex. Furthermore, the increase in ULT1 levels during environmental cues suggests its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of stress responsive genes. Collectively, these results suggest that the antagonistic functions of PcG and TrxG proteins and the mechanism of recruitment of these complexes to target loci are evolutionarily conserved for gene expression regulation across kingdoms.",

     "abstract": "In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation of nuclear DNA at CpG sequences (5mCpG) regulates epigenetic inheritance through alterations in chromatin structure. However, mitochondria lack nucleosomal chromatin, therefore the molecular mechanisms by which 5mCpG influences mitochondria must be different and are as yet unknown. Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) is both the primary DNA-compacting protein in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nucleoid and a transcription-initiation factor. TFAM must encounter hundreds of CpGs in mtDNA, so the occurrence of 5mCpG has the potential to impact TFAM-DNA recognition. We used biophysical approaches to determine whether 5mCpG alters any TFAM-dependent activities. 5mCpG in the heavy strand promoter (HSP1) increased the binding affinity of TFAM and induced TFAM multimerization with increased cooperativity compared to nonmethylated DNA. However, 5mCpG had no apparent effect on TFAM-dependent DNA compaction. Additionally, 5mCpG had a clear and context-dependent effect on transcription initiating from the three mitochondrial promoters. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that 5mCpG in the mitochondrial promoter region does impact TFAM-dependent activities in vitro.",

Testing the influence of TO 901317, a known activator of liver X receptor alpha (LXR\u03b1, NR1H3) which is a central regulator of the lipid homeostasis, Grefhorst et al. reported in 2012 that administration of TO 901317 did not affect PDZK1 expression and reduced the amount of SR-BI protein in mouse liver. Considering that TO 901317 also activates the xenosensor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2), it was aim of this study to further investigate the influence of LXR\u03b1 and PXR activation on transcription of PDZK1.First, we tested the transactivation of PDZK1 by LXR\u03b1 or PXR in cell-based reporter gene assays comparing the effect of prototypical ligands to that of TO 901317. Ligand mediated activation of LXR\u03b1 increased, while that of PXR lowered luciferase activity. Further, we located the most likely binding site for LXR\u03b1 and PXR on the PDZK1 promoter between \u221285\u202fbp and \u221254\u202fbp. The transcriptional regulation by LXR\u03b1 was further supported showing enhanced mRNA expression of PDZK1 in HepG2 cells treated with the selective LXR\u03b1-agonist GW3965, while treatment with TO 901317 reduced the protein amount of PDZK1.Taken together, we provide evidence that both LXR\u03b1 and PXR are transcriptional regulators of PDZK1 supporting the previous notion that the scaffold protein is part of cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Cells respond to external stimuli with transient gene expression changes in order to adapt to environmental alterations. However, the dose response profile of gene induction upon a given stress depends on many intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here we show that the accurate quantification of dose dependent gene expression by live cell luciferase reporters reveals fundamental insights into stress signaling. We make the following discoveries applying this non-invasive reporter technology. (1) Signal transduction sensitivities can be compared and we apply this here to salt, oxidative and xenobiotic stress responsive transcription factors. (2) Stress signaling depends on where and how the damage is generated within the cell. Specifically we show that two ROS-generating agents, menadione and hydrogen peroxide, differ in their dependence on mitochondrial respiration. (3) Stress signaling is conditioned by the cells history. We demonstrate here that positive memory or an acquired resistance towards oxidative stress is induced dependent on the nature of the previous stress experience. (4) The metabolic state of the cell impinges on the sensitivity of stress signaling. This is shown here for the shift towards higher stress doses of the response profile for yeast cells moved from complex to synthetic medium. (5) The age of the cell conditions its transcriptional response capacity, which is demonstrated by the changes of the dose response to oxidative stress during both replicative and chronological aging. We conclude that capturing dose dependent gene expression in real time will be of invaluable help to understand stress signaling and its dynamic modulation.",

Heterozygous dicer1sa9205 developed normally, being phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type siblings. Homozygous dicer1sa9205 mutants display smaller eyes, abnormal craniofacial development and aberrant pigmentation. Reduced numbers of both iridophores and melanocytes were observed in the head and ventral trunk of dicer1sa9205 homozygotes; the effect on melanocytes was stronger and detectable earlier in development. The expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor a (mitfa), the master gene for melanocytes differentiation, was enhanced in dicer1-depleted fish. Similarly, the expression of SRY-box containing gene 10 (sox10), required for mitfa activation, was higher in mutants than in wild types. In silico and in vivo analyses of either sox10 or mitfa 3\u2019UTRs revealed conserved potential miRNA binding sites likely involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of both genes.

The X-ray structure of CREB1 binding the half site GTCA identifies an alanine in the DNA binding region interacting with the methyl group of T, structurally analogous to the methyl group of methylated C. This alanine is replaced with a valine in CEBPB. To explore the contribution of this amino acid to binding with methylated cytosine of the GCAA half-site, we made the reciprocal mutants CEBPB(V285A) and CREB1(A297V) and used protein binding microarrays (PBM) to examine binding to four types of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA): 1) DNA with cytosine in both strands (DNA(C|C)), 2) DNA with 5-methylcytosine (M) in one strand and cytosine in the second strand (DNA(M|C)), 3) DNA with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (H) in one strand and cytosine in the second strand (DNA(H|C)), and 4) DNA with both cytosines in all CG dinucleotides containing 5-methylcytosine (DNA(5mCG)). When binding to DNA(C|C), CEBPB (V285A) preferentially binds the CRE consensus motif (TGACGTCA), similar to CREB1. The reciprocal mutant, CREB1(A297V) binds DNA with some similarity to CEBPB, with strongest binding to the methylated PAR site 8-mer TTACGTAA.

Here, we identify multi-promoter structure (P1, P2, and P3) of the human FOXP1 gene. Clustering of the \u03b22-leukocyte integrin Mac-1 downregulated transcription from these promoters. We extend our prior observation that IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is physically associated with Mac-1 and provide evidence that IRAK1 is a potent suppressor of human FOXP1 promoter. IRAK1 reduced phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) via inhibiting phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKII\u03b4), thereby promoting recruitment of HDAC4 to P1 chromatin. A novel human FOXP1 intronic transcript 1 (FOXP1-IT1) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), whose gene is embedded within that of FOXP1, has been cloned and found to bind directly to HDAC4 and regulate FOXP1 in cis manner. Overexpression of FOXP1-IT1 counteracted Mac-1 clustering-dependent downregulation of FOXP1, reduced IRAK1 downregulation of HDAC4 phosphorylation, and attenuated differentiation of THP-1 monocytic cells. In contrast, Mac-1 clustering inhibited FOXP1-IT1 expression with reduced binding to HDAC4 as well as phosphorylation of CaMKII\u03b4 to activate the IRAK1 signaling pathway. Importantly, both IRAK1 and HDAC4 inhibitors significantly reduced integrin clustering-triggered downregulation of FOXP1 expression in purified human blood monocytes.

Loss of CBX7 expression has been reported in several human malignant neoplasias, where it often correlates with an advanced cancer state and poor survival, proposing CBX7 as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in cancer progression. Indeed, CBX7 is able to positively or negatively regulate the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and cancer progression, such as E-cadherin, cyclin E, osteopontin, EGR1.To understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the involvement of CBX7 in cancer progression, we designed a functional proteomic experiment based on CHIP-MS to identify novel CBX7 protein partners. Among the identified CBX7-interacting proteins we focused our attention on the Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) whose critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration and invasion has been already reported. We confirmed the interaction between CBX7 and PRMT1 and demonstrated that this interaction is crucial for PRMT1 enzymatic activity both in vitro and in vivo and for the regulation of E-cadherin expression, an important hallmark of EMT.These results suggest a general mechanism by which CBX7 interacting with histone modification enzymes like HDAC2 and PRMT1 enhances E-cadherin expression. Therefore, disruption of this equilibrium may induce impairment of E-cadherin expression and increased cell migration eventually leading to EMT and, then, cancer progression.",

AF1 is mapped to the highly variable and intrinsically unstructured N terminal domain and AF2 lies in the conserved ligand binding domain. The unstructured nature of AF1 offers structural plasticity and hence functional versatility in gene regulation. However, little is known about the key functional residues of AF1 that mediates its interaction with coregulators. This study focuses on the progesterone receptor (PR) and reports the identification of K464, K481 and R492 (KKR) as the key functional residues of PR AF1. The KKR are monomethylated and function cooperatively. The combined mutations of KKR to QQQ render PR isoform B (PRB) hyperactive, whereas KKR to FFF mutations abolishes as much as 80% of PR activity. Furthermore, the hyperactive QQQ mutation rescues the loss of PR activity due to E911A mutation in AF2. The study also finds that the magnitudes of the mutational effect differ in different cell types as a result of differential effects on the functional interaction with coregulators. Furthermore, KKR provides the interface for AF1 to physically interact with p300 and SRC-1, and with AF2 at E911. Intriguingly, the inactive FFF mutant interacts strikingly stronger with both SRC-1 and AF2 than wt PRB. We propose a tripartite model to describe the dynamic interactions between AF1, AF2 and SRC-1 with KKR of AF1 and E911 of AF2 as the interface. An overly stable interaction would hamper the dynamics of disassembly of the receptor complex.",

In this review we focus on the proteins that catalyze formation of m6A (also called writers) on RNA. Interestingly, distinct proteins deposit m6A on different classes of RNA, indicating that specific RNA features dictate recognition mechanisms.

In this review, we focus on the occurrence of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in the transcriptome. We summarise the main findings of the molecular role in post-transcriptional regulation that governs m5C deposition in RNAs. Functionally, m5C deposition can regulate several cellular and physiological processes including development, differentiation and survival to stress stimuli. Despite many aspects concerning m5C deposition in RNA, such as position or sequence context and the fact that many readers and erasers still remain elusive, the overall recent findings indicate that RNA cytosine methylation is a powerful mechanism to post-transcriptionally regulate physiological processes. In addition, mutations in RNA cytosine-5 methyltransferases are associated to pathological processes ranging from neurological syndromes to cancer.",

We review related studies on mouse Adar1 mutant phenotypes, their rescues by preventing signaling from the antiviral RIG-I-like Sensors (RLRs), as well as Adar1 mechanisms in innate immune suppression and other roles of Adar1, including editing-independent effects.

The objective of this study was to uncover how diet mediates the transcriptional regulation of Cpt1a. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to either a high-fat (HF) or low-fat control diet during gestation and lactation. At weaning, male offspring received either a HF or control diet, creating 4 groups: lifelong control diet (C/C; n\u202f=\u202f12), perinatal HF diet (HF/C; n\u202f=\u202f9), post-weaning HF diet (C/HF; n\u202f=\u202f10), and lifelong HF diet (HF/HF; n\u202f=\u202f10). Only HF/HF animals had higher hepatic Cpt1a mRNA expression than C/C. Epigenetic analysis revealed reduced DNA methylation (DNAMe) and increased histone 3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4Me2) upstream and within the promoter of Cpt1a in the HF/HF group. This was accompanied by increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP\u03b2) binding directly downstream of the Cpt1a transcription start site within the first intron. Findings were confirmed in rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cells treated with non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA).

Here we examined the epigenetic mechanism whereby the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) represses eNOS transcription. In response to IFN-\u03b3 treatment, there was a simultaneous down-regulation of eNOS expression and up-regulation of class II trans-activator (CIITA). Over-expression of CIITA directly repressed eNOS promoter while CIITA knockdown attenuated IFN-\u03b3 induced eNOS repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that IFN-\u03b3 stimulation promoted CIITA occupancy on the proximal eNOS (\u2212430/\u2212168). Coincidently, CIITA recruitment to the eNOS promoter was paralleled by the disappearance of trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4Me3) and the enrichment of trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9Me3) with no significant changes in the levels of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27Me3) or trimethylated H4K20 (H4K20Me3). In accordance, CIITA depletion was associated with the normalization of H3K4Me3 and H3K9Me3 on the eNOS promoter. Mechanistically, CIITA interacted with and enlisted the histone H3K9 trimethyltransferase SUV39H1 to the eNOS promoter to repress transcription. IFN-\u03b3 treatment augmented SUV39H1 expression and promoted SUV39H1 recruitment to the eNOS promoter in endothelial cells. Silencing of SUV39H1 abrogated eNOS repression by IFN-\u03b3 by erasing H3K9Me3 from the eNOS promoter. In conclusion, our data reveal a novel role for CIITA in endothelial cells and present SUV39H1 as a druggable target in the intervention of endothelial dysfunction.",

Cultured colon cancer cell lines were used in this study including DLD-1, HT-29, LS174T and SW620. Their promoter regions were strongly marked by repressive mark H3K27me3, catalyzed by EZH2 that was markedly upregulated in early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis.

     "abstract": "Elongation has emerged as a highly regulated step in the multistage process of transcription. Control of gene expression mediated through transcription elongation remains an unexplored area of study in Toxoplasma gondii where the demands of complex lifecycle necessitate a regulated transcription program. Here, we elucidate the central role of Spt5 homolog in T. gondii mRNA transcription. We demonstrate that TgSpt5 functions in conjunction with a small zinc finger protein TgSpt4. TgSpt5 interacts with TgRpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II and associates with actively transcribed genes. Enrichment of TgSpt5 towards the 3\u2032 end of genes coinciding with P-Ser2 form of RNAPII, a marker of active elongation further underscores its pivotal role in transcription. TgSpt5 undergoes phosphorylation mediated through Toxoplasma Cdk9 homolog, TgCrk9, which appears crucial for its function. Inhibition of TgCrk9, which also regulates RNAPII by differential phosphorylation of its C terminal domain, results in loss of TgSpt5 enrichment at 3\u2032 sites of the genes and an overall repressive effect on parasite progression. TgSpt5 along with TgSpt4 could successfully complement the loss of function mutations in yeast counterparts emphasizing its functional significance. Together, the results highlight the possible role of TgSpt5 in transcript elongation regulated through phosphorylation by TgCrk9.",

     "abstract": "Differentiation of human macrophages predisposes these cells to numerous tasks, i.e. killing invading pathogens, and this entails the need for enhanced intracellular defences against stress, including conditions that may increase DNA damage. Our study shows that expression of DNA repair enzymes, such as PARP1, BRCA1 and XRCC1, are activated during macrophage development by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, which serves as a histone acetylation sensor. It recognises and displaces epigenetically marked nucleosomes, thereby enabling transcription. Acetylation is controlled both in monocytes and macrophages by the co-operation of EP300 and HDAC1 activities. Differentiation modulates the activities of individual components of EP300-HDAC1-SWI/SNF functional unit and entails recruitment of PBAF to gene promoters. In monocytes, histone-deacetylated promoters of repressed PARP1, BRCA1 and XRCC1 respond only to HDAC inhibition, with an opening of the chromatin structure by BRM, whereas in macrophages both EP300 and HDAC1 contribute to the fine-tuning of nucleosomal acetylation, with HDAC1 remaining active and the balance of EP300 and HDAC1 activities controlling nucleosome eviction by BRG1-containing SWI/SNF. Since EP300-HDAC1-SWI/SNF operates at the level of gene promoters characterized simultaneously by the presence of E2F binding site(s) and CpG island(s), this allows cells to adjust PARP1, BRCA1 and XRCC1 transcription to the differentiation mode and to restart cell cycle progression. Thus, mutual interdependence between acetylase and deacetylase activities defines the acetylation-dependent code for regulation of histone density and gene transcription by SWI/SNF, notably on gene promoters of DNA repair enzymes.",

However, no reports have revealed the function of CELF1 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Hinted by RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq) data, the influence of the CELF protein on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression was tested by modulating CELF1 levels. Cardiac hypertrophy is related to oxidative stress-induced damage. Hence, the cardiovascular system may be protected against further injury by upregulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as HO-1. During the past two decades, research has demonstrated the central role of HO-1 in the protection against diseases. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of HO-1 expression is profoundly important for developing new strategies to prevent cardiac hypertrophy.To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying HO-1 regulation by the CELF protein, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), biotin pull-down analysis, luciferase reporter and mRNA stability assays. We found that the expression of HO-1 was downregulated by CELF1 through the conserved GU-rich elements (GREs) in HO-1 3\u2032UTR transcripts. Correspondingly, CELF1 expression was regulated by controlling the release of carbon monoxide (CO) in H9C2 cells. The CELF1-HO-1-CO regulation axis constituted a novel positive feedback circuit. In addition, we detected the potential involvement of CELF1 and HO-1 in samples from HCM patients. We found that CELF1 and CELF2, but not HO-1, were highly expressed in HCM heart samples. Thus, a manipulation targeting CELF1 could be developed as a potential therapeutic option for cardiac hypertrophy.",

     "abstract": "Endothelium-derived colony stimulating factor (CSF1) plays a key role in a range of human pathologies. Angiotensin II (Ang II) has been documented to stimulate CSF1 transcription although the underlying epigenetic mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that induction of CSF1 transcription by Ang II in vascular endothelial cells paralleled alterations of signature histone modifications surrounding the CSF1 promoter. Specifically, ChIP assays indicated that there was a simultaneous up-regulation of both acetylated H3 and trimethylated H3K4, indicative of transcriptional activation, and down-regulation of dimethyl H3K9, implicated in transcriptional repression, surrounding the proximal CSF1 promoter. Further analysis revealed that silencing of brahma related gene 1 (BRG1), a chromatin remodeling protein, abrogated CSF1 induction by Ang II. In the meantime, BRG1 silencing erased H3 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation and restored H3K9 dimethylation. Mechanistically, BRG1 interacted with and recruited SET1A, a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, and JMJD1A, a histone H3K9 demethylase, to the CSF1 promoter to alter chromatin structure thereby promoting CSF1 trans-activation in response to Ang II stimulation. Knockdown of either SET1A or JMJD1A blocked CSF1 induction by Ang II. Finally, we demonstrate that the crosstalk between BRG1 and histone modifying enzymes was mediated by the transcription factor AP-1. In conclusion, our data unveil a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby a BRG1-centered complex mediates transcriptional activation of CSF1 by Ang II in vascular endothelial cells.",

RNA methylation is another layer of posttranscriptional regulation. The methylation of N1 atom of adenine (m1A) results in a conformational change of RNA which regulates translational efficiency. Our study indicates that the m1A is also involved in the CSF-1 mRNA decay. The alteration of ALKBH3 expression, an m1A demethylase, regulates the CSF-1 mRNA stability. Demethylation of m1A by ALKBH3 increases the half-life of CSF-1 mRNA without affecting the translation efficiency. The m1A in CSF-1 mRNA is mapped in the 5\u2032UTR near the translation initiation site. YTHDF2, a known m6A reader which interacts with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex, is not the reader of m1A-containing CSF-1 mRNA. Overexpression of ALKBH3 increases CSF-1 expression and the degree of cancer cell invasiveness without affecting cell proliferation or migration.

The mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) plays a vital role in innate antiviral immunity. The MAVS mRNA has a long 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR, >9\u202fkb) and an understanding of this region may help to explain the post-transcriptional regulation in a key protein. In this study, we aimed to characterize the role of the MAVS 3\u2032UTR during MAVS expression by truncating the 3\u2032UTR into different fragments so as to identify the regulatory elements. We found that the different fragments (H1\u2013H5) of the MAVS 3\u2032UTR play different roles in regulating the subcellular localization and function of MAVS. Three AU-rich elements (AREs) in the MAVS 3\u2032UTR H1 fragment (region 1-3445 in the 3\u2032UTR) repressed MAVS expression by interacting with HuR to destabilize its mRNA. The MAVS 3\u2032UTR H5 fragment (region 5955-7687 in the 3\u2032UTR) affected the cellular localization of MAVS in mitochondria and influenced the subsequent antiviral function. Four miR-27a binding sites were recognized in the MAVS 3\u2032UTR, and treatment of miR-27a inhibited MAVS expression and promoted the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

In our present study, we aimed to identify functional lncRNAs in one of the three lineages of kidney progenitor cells, i.e., metanephric mesenchymal (MM) cells. We conducted comprehensive analyses of the chromatin signature and transcriptome by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. We found seventeen lncRNAs that were expressed specifically in MM cells with an active chromatin signature, while remaining silenced in a bivalent chromatin state in non-MM cells. Out of these MM specific lncRNAs, we identified a lncRNA, Gm29418, in a distal enhancer region of Six2, a key regulatory gene of MM cells. We further identified three transcript variants of Gm29418 by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), and confirmed that the transcription-start-sites (TSSs) of these variants were consistent with the result of Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE). In support of the enhancer-like function of Gm29418 on Six2 expression, we found that knock-down of Gm29418 by two independent anti-sense locked nucleic acid (LNA) phosphorothioate gapmers suppressed Six2 mRNA expression levels in MM cells. We also found that over-expression of Gm29418 led to an increase in Six2 mRNA expression levels in a mouse MM cell line.

Expression of the Wilms tumor gene, WT1, marks a group of high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we identify WT1 as a downstream target of HIF-2\u03b1 in Kelly neuroblastoma cells. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, HIF-2\u03b1 bound to a HRE in intron 3 of the WT1 gene, but not to another predicted HIF binding site (HBS) in the first intron.

Deletion of the HBS in the intronic HRE by genome editing abolished WT1 expression in hypoxic neuroblastoma cells. Physical interaction between the HRE and the WT1 promoter in normoxic and hypoxic Kelly cells was shown by chromosome conformation capture assays.

In the course of evolution, CKLFSF2 has evolved as two isoforms, namely CKLFSF2A and CKLFSF2B, in mice. CKLFSF2A, also known as CMTM2A and ARR19, is expressed in the testis and is important for testicular steroidogenesis. CKLFSF2B is also known to be highly expressed in the testis. In the prepubertal stage, CKLFSF2B is expressed only in Leydig cells, but it is highly expressed in haploid germ cells and Leydig cells in adult testis. CKLFSF2B is naturally processed inside the cell at its C-terminus to yield smaller proteins compared to its theoretical size of \u224825\u202fkDa. The Cklfsf2b gene is regulated by GATA-1 and CREB protein, binding to their respective binding elements present in the 2-kb upstream promoter sequence. In addition, the overexpression of CKLFSF2B inhibited the activity of the Nur77 promoter, which consequently represses the promoter activity of Nur77-target steroidogenic genes such as P450c17, 3\u03b2-HSD, and StAR in MA-10 Leydig cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CKLFSF2B in primary Leydig cells isolated from adult mice shows a repression of steroidogenic gene expression and consequently testosterone production. Moreover, intratesticular injection of CKLFSF2B-expressing adenovirus in adult mice clearly had a repressive effect compared to the control injected with only GFP-expressing adenovirus. Altogether, these findings suggest that CKLFSF2B might be involved in the development and function of Leydig cells and regulate testicular testosterone production by fine-tuning the expression of steroidogenic genes.",

This view has recently been challenged by the demonstration that CXXC domain of TET3 has relaxed sequence specificity and binds with the highest affinity to symmetric DNA duplex containing 5caCpG. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the MLL1-CXXC and TET3-CXXC sequence specificity and tolerance to cytosine modifications (5-methyl, 5-hydroxymethyl, 5-formyl, 5-carboxyl) in CpG and non-CpG context. For the first time, we take into consideration possible interference from cytosine bases elsewhere in the sequence. We show that despite similar overall structure, MLL1-CXXC has greater sequence and modification specificity than TET3-CXXC. MLL1-CXXC is specific only for CpG and does not tolerate any cytosine modifications. In contrast, TET3-CXXC does not require the CpG context of cytosine bases. Methyl-, formyl- and carboxyl-modifications are tolerated by TET3-CXXC, but only preceding G. Based on our and other data we propose a parsimonious model of MLL1-CXXC and TET3-CXXC DNA binding. This model explains why the binding of modified DNA duplexes by TET3-CXXC requires in some cases a register shift and is therefore context-dependent.",

     "abstract": "DNA-Double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by radiation therapy represent the most efficient lesions to kill tumor cells, however, the inherent DSB repair efficiency of tumor cells can cause cellular radioresistance and impact on therapeutic outcome. Genes of DSB repair represent a target for cancer therapy since their down-regulation can impair the repair process making the cells more sensitive to radiation. In this study, we analyzed the combination of ionizing radiation (IR) along with microRNA-mediated targeting of genes involved in DSB repair to sensitize human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. MicroRNAs are natural occurring modulators of gene expression and therefore represent an attractive strategy to affect the expression of DSB repair genes. As possible IR-sensitizing targets genes we selected genes of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway (i.e. RAD51, BRCA2, PRKDC, XRCC5, LIG1). We examined these genes to determine whether they may be real targets of selected miRNAs by functional and biological validation. The in vivo effectiveness of miRNA treatments has been examined in cells over-expressing miRNAs and treated with IR. Taken together, our results show that hsa-miR-96-5p and hsa-miR-874-3p can directly regulate the expression of target genes. When these miRNAs are combined with IR can decrease the survival of NSCLC cells to a higher extent than that exerted by radiation alone, and similarly to radiation combined with specific chemical inhibitors of HR and NHEJ repair pathway.",

However, little is known about TSPO's transcriptional regulation in microglia. The aim of this study was to identify genetic elements and transcription factors required for basal and inducible TSPO expression in microglia. Murine Tspo promoter was cloned into the pGL4.10 luciferase vector and functionally characterized in BV-2 cells. Deletion mutagenesis indicated that \u2212845 bases upstream were sufficient to reconstitute near maximal promoter activity in BV-2. Deletion of \u2212593 to \u2212520 sequences, which harbour an Ap1, Ets.2 and Nkx3.1 site which also serves as a non-canonical binding site for Sp1-family transcription factors, led to a dramatic decrease in both basal and LPS induced promoter activity. Further deletion of \u2212168 to \u221239 sequences, which contains four GC boxes, also led to a significant decrease in promoter activity. Targeted mutations of Ap1, Ets.2, Nkx3.1/Sp1/3/4 and the GC boxes led to significant decreases in promoter activity. ChIP-qPCR revealed that Pu.1, Ap1, Stat3, Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 bind to the endogenous Tspo promoter. Notably, binding of these factors, with the exception of Stat3, was significantly enhanced upon LPS treatment. RNAi silencing of Pu.1, cJun, cFos, Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Stat3 strongly lowered Tspo promoter activity while Ap1 silencing inhibited LPS induced increase in Tspo protein levels. These findings demonstrate that consensus binding sequences for Ap1, Ets.2, distal as well as proximal Sp1/3/4 sites regulate basal and LPS induced Tspo promoter activity in microglia.",

Reduced Myt1l expression has been implicated in glioblastoma (GBM), and the related St18 was originally identified as a potential tumor suppressor for breast cancer. We previously analyzed changes in gene expression in a human GBM cell line with re-expression of either Myt1 or Myt1l. This revealed largely overlapping gene expression changes, suggesting similar function in these cells. Here we show that re-expression of Myt1 or Myt1l reduces proliferation in two different GBM cell lines, activates gene expression programs associated with neuronal differentiation, and limits expression of proliferative and epithelial to mesenchymal transition gene-sets. Consistent with this, expression of both MYT1 and MYT1L is lower in more aggressive glioma sub-types. Examination of the gene expression changes in cells expressing Myt1 or Myt1l suggests that both repress expression of the YAP1 transcriptional coactivator, which functions primarily in the Hippo signaling pathway. Expression of YAP1 and its target genes is reduced in Myt-expressing cells, and there is an inverse correlation between YAP1 and MYT1/MYT1L expression in human brain cancer datasets. Proliferation of GBM cell lines is reduced by lowering YAP1 expression and increased with YAP1 over-expression, which overcomes the anti-proliferative effect of Myt1/Myt1l expression. Finally we show that reducing YAP1 expression in a GBM cell line slows the growth of orthotopic tumor xenografts. Together, our data suggest that Myt1 and Myt1l directly repress expression of YAP1, a protein which promotes proliferation and GBM growth.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs and RNA-binding proteins exert regulation on >60% of coding genes, yet interplay between them is little studied. Canonical microRNA binding occurs by base-pairing of microRNA 3\u2032-ends to complementary \u201cseed regions\u201d in mRNA 3\u2032UTRs, resulting in translational repression. Similarly, regulatory RNA-binding proteins bind to mRNAs, modifying stability or translation. We investigated post-transcriptional regulation acting on the xenobiotic pump ABCB1/P-glycoprotein, which is implicated in cancer therapy resistance. We characterised the ABCB1 UTRs in primary breast cancer cells and identified UTR sequences that responded to miR-19b despite lacking a canonical binding site. Sequences did, however, contain consensus sites for the RNA-binding protein HuR. We demonstrated that a tripartite complex of HuR, miR-19b and UTR directs repression of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein expression, with HuR essential for non-canonical miR-19b binding thereby controlling chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells. This exemplifies a new cooperative model between RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs to expand the repertoire of mRNAs that can be regulated. This study suggests a novel therapeutic target to impair P-glycoprotein mediated drug efflux, and also indicates that current microRNA binding predictions that rely on seed regions alone may be too conservative.",

In breast tissue, the core circadian gene Period (PER)2 plays a critical role in mammary gland development and possesses tumor suppressor function. Interleukin (IL)-6 and C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2 are among the most abundant cytokines in the inflammatory microenvironment. We found that acute stimulation by IL-6/CCL2 reduced PER2 expression in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells. Longer term exposure to IL-6/CCL2 suppressed PER2 to an even lower level. IL-6 activated STAT3/NF\u03baB p50 signaling to recruit HDAC1 to the PER2 promoter. CCL2 activated the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote ELK-1 cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation, recruit HDAC1 to the proximal PER2 promoter and facilitate DNMT3-EZH2-PER2 promoter association. Ectopic expression of PER2 inhibited IL-6 or CCL2 induced mammosphere forming ability and reduced sphere size indicating that PER2 repression in breast epithelial cells can be crucial to activate tumorigenesis in an inflammatory microenvironment. The diminished expression of PER2 can be observed over a time scale of hours to weeks following IL-6/CCL2 stimulation suggesting that PER2 suppression occurs in the early stage of the interaction between an inflammatory microenvironment and normal breast epithelial cells. These data show new mechanisms by which mammary cells interact with a cancerous microenvironment and provide additional evidence that PER2 expression contributes to breast tumorigenesis.",

In this report, we revealed that the HOXC10 promoter contains multiple G-tracts in its negative strand and has high potential of forming G-quadruplex structures. In circular dichroism studies, synthesized oligonucleotides based on the G-rich region of 241\u2013297 base pairs upstream of the HOXC10 transcription start site showed molar ellipticity at specific wavelengths characteristic of G-quadruplex structures. Analyses of these oligonucleotides by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel-shift assay, immunostaining and replication stop assay revealed formation of multiple types of G-quadruplex structures in presence of potassium and lithium ions. In reporter assays, mutations or deletion of the G-tracts could differentially impact the expression of Gaussia luciferase downstream of the HOXC10 promoter. Additionally, CHD7, a chromatin remodeling protein with DNA helicase activity, could associate with the HOXC10 promoter and likely unwind the G-quadruplex structures to enhance its gene expression.",

In this work, we elucidate a new role for Slt2 as a part of the transcriptional activation machinery that regulates CWI gene expression in response to cell wall stress. We show that Slt2 is recruited to promoters and coding regions of CWI Rlm1-dependent genes in response to stress. This phenomenon is dependent both on the activation of the MAPK and its kinase activity. Slt2 binding is also dependent on Rlm1 and SWI/SNF and SAGA complexes. During the initial steps of transcription, the catalytic activity of Slt2 on Rlm1 is critical for the binding of the activator to promoters in response to stress. In addition, Slt2 itself acts as a transactivator, as it is able to induce the transcription of CWI responsive genes when it is bound to promoters through the Rlm1 binding domain independently of its catalytic activity. Slt2 interacts with RNA Pol II in a Rlm1-dependent manner to provide further support to a role of this MAPK as an integral component of the transcriptional complexes under cell wall stress. Selective recruitment and progression of the complex Slt2-RNA Pol II from the promoters to the coding regions of Rlm1-dependent genes does not rely on Paf1, suggesting a different mechanism from that which is exerted by Slt2 on the Swi4/Swi6 (SBF)-regulated genes.",

Differentially methylated promoters were described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but we do not know how these epimutations can trigger a proinflammatory cytokine milieu. B cell-focused DNA methylome studies identified a group of genes that had undergone disease-associated changes in a murine model of RA. An arthritis-specific epimutation (hypomethylation) was detected in the promoter region of the Zbtb38 gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. Gene expression studies revealed that hypomethylation of the Zbtb38 promoter was accompanied by disease-specific repressor expression, and two anti-inflammatory factors interleukin 1 receptor 2 gene (IL1r2) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1rn) were among the downregulated genes. We hypothesized that Zbtb38 repressor could induce downregulated expression of these anti-inflammatory genes and that this could significantly contribute to arthritis pathogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that Zbtb38 forms a molecular bridge between an arthritis-associated epimutation (DNA hypomethylation in Zbtb38 promoter) and transcriptional silencing of the IL1r2 gene in B cells. In this way, disease-associated DNA hypomethylation can support autoimmune arthritis by interfering with an anti-inflammatory pathway.",

Surprisingly, the mammalian DNMTs also possess active DNA demethylation activity in vitro in a Ca2+- and redox conditions-dependent manner, although little is known about its molecular mechanisms and occurrence in a cellular context. In this study, we have used LC-MS/MS to track down the fate of the methyl group removed from 5mC on DNA by mouse DNMT3B in vitro and found that it becomes covalently linked to the DNA methylation catalytic cysteine of the enzyme. We also show that Ca2+ homeostasis-dependent but TET1/TET2/TET3/TDG-independent demethylation of methylated episomal DNA by mouse DNMT3A or DNMT3B can occur in transfected human HEK 293 and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Structural studies combined with imaging of transport and biochemical studies have contributed to the enormous recent progress, particularly in understanding how dynein/dynactin/BicD (DDB) dependent transport on microtubules works.

While essential for the host defense mechanism, excessive ROS generation and/or deficient clearance is blamed for the pathogenesis of human diseases. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory role of hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1), a transcription factor, in high glucose-induced ROS accumulation in renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2). Treatment with high glucose (HG) not only markedly up-regulated HIC1 expression but prompted its translocation into the nucleus. HG stimulation promoted HIC1 binding to the promoter of SIRT1, a known HIC1 target with anti-oxidative ability. The recruitment of HIC1 to the SIRT1 promoter was paralleled by the enrichment of trimethylated histone H3K27 and 5\u2011methyl cytosine, two well-characterized markers for trans-repression. HIC1 silencing with small interfering RNA abrogated SIRT1 repression by HG and at the same time weakened ROS accumulation in HK-2 cells. Knockdown or pharmaceutical inhibition of SIRT1 preempted the effect of HIC1 depletion by restoring ROS accumulation and down-regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. Mechanistically, HIC1 interacted with and recruited EZH2, an H3K27 trimethyltransferase, and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to repress SIRT1 transcription in response to HG stimulation. Depletion or inhibition of EZH2 or DNMT1 rescued SIRT1 expression and blocked ROS accumulation in HG-treated HK-2 cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that epigenetic repression of SIRT1 by HIC1 may contribute to HG-induced elevation of ROS levels in renal tubular epithelial cells.",

CIRCE composition and locations were found to be phylogenetically conserved in bacterial taxa. Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 has two CIRCE elements (CIRCE1groESL1 and CIRCE2groESL1) in the promoter region of groESL1 and one CIRCE element (CIRCEgroEL2) before groEL2. We also found that negative HrcA and positive \u03c332 regulators coordinated the transcription of duplicate groELs, and that the double deletion in DK1622 eliminated transcriptional differences and reduced the heat-shock responses of groELs. In vitro binding assays showed that HrcA protein binding was biased towards CIRCE1groESL1, followed by CIRCEgroEL2, but that HrcA proteins failed to bind with CIRCE2groESL1. Mutation experiments revealed that single-nucleotide mutations in the inverted repeat regions changed the HrcA-binding abilities of CIRCEs. We constructed an in vivo transcription-regulation system in Escherichia coli to pair each of the regulators with a groEL promoter. The results indicated that the transcriptional regulation performed by HrcA and \u03c332 was biased towards the groEL2 and groEL1 promoters, respectively.

Activation of specific pathways ameliorates these challenges and thereby warrants integrity. Here, we demonstrate the pliability of the CckA-CtrA two-component signaling system in the freshwater bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Our forward genetic screen to analyze suppressor mutations that can negate the chromosome segregation block induced by the topoisomerase IV inhibitor, NstA, yielded various point mutations in the cell cycle histidine kinase, CckA. Notably, we identified a point mutation in the PAS-B domain of CckA, which resulted in increased levels of phosphorylated CtrA (CtrA~P), the master cell cycle regulator. Surprisingly, this increase in CtrA~P levels did not translate into a genome-wide increase in the DNA occupancy of CtrA, but specifically enriched its affinity for the chromosomal origin of replication, Cori, and for a very small sub-set of CtrA regulated promoters. We show that through this enhanced binding of CtrA to the Cori, cells are able to overcome the toxic defects rendered by stable NstA through a possible slow down in the chromosome replication cycle. Taken together, our work opens up an unexplored and intriguing aspect of the CckA-CtrA signal transduction pathway. The distinctive DNA binding nature of CtrA and its regulation by CckA might also be crucial for pathogenesis because of the highly conserved nature of the CckA-CtrA pathway in alphaproteobacteria.",

Classically, p50 functions in heterodimeric form with the RelA (p65) NF-\u03baB subunit to activate inflammatory genes. However, p50 also forms homodimers which actively repress NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory gene expression and exert an important brake on the inflammatory process. This repressive activity of p50:p50 is thought to be in part mediated by an interaction with the epigenetic repressor protein Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). However, neither the interaction of p50 with HDAC1 nor the requirement of HDAC1 for the repressive activities of p50 has been well defined. Here we employed in silico prediction with in vitro assays to map sites of interaction of HDAC1 on the p50 protein. Directed mutagenesis of one such region resulted in almost complete loss of HDAC1 binding to p50. Transfected mutant p50 protein lacking the putative HDAC1 docking motif resulted in enhanced cytokine and chemokine expression when compared with cells expressing a transfected wild type p50. In addition, expression of this mutant p50 was associated with enhanced chemoattraction of neutrophils and acetylation of known inflammatory genes demonstrating the likely importance of the p50:HDAC1 interaction for controlling inflammation. These new insights provide an advance on current knowledge of the mechanisms by which NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription are regulated and highlight the potential for manipulation of p50:HDAC1 interactions to bring about experimental modulation of chronic inflammation and pathologies associated with dysregulated neutrophil accumulation and activation.",

This study explores interactions of PC4 with histone proteins, which presumably triggers chromatin modifications during LHR transcriptional activation. TSA treatment of MCF7 cells expressing PC4-Flag protein induces acetylation of histone 3 (H3) and immunoprecipitation (IP) studies revealed its interaction with PC4-Flag protein. MS/MS analysis of the protein complex obtained after IP from TSA treated samples detected H3.3 acetylated at K9, K14, K18, K23 and K27 as a PC4 interacting protein. The association of PC4 with H3.3 was corroborated by IP and re-ChIP using H3.3 antibody. Similarly, IP and re-ChIP showed association of PC4 with H3 acetylated protein. Knockdown of PC4 in MCF7 cells reduced H3.3 enrichment, H3 acetylation at the Lys sites and LHR promoter activity in TSA treated cells despite an increase in H3 and H3.3 protein induced by TSA, linking PC4 to H3 acetylation and LHR transcription. Depletion of H3.3 A/B in MCF7 cells impair chromatin accessibility and enrichment of Pol II and TFIIB at the LHR promoter and its activation, resulting in marked reduction of LHR gene expression. Together, these findings point to the critical role of PC4 and its association with acetylated H3.3 in TSA-induced LHR gene transcription.",

Here we synthesize information from different organisms to reveal the core function(s) of FACT and propose a model that reconciles the cell-free and cell-based observations. We describe FACT structure and nucleosomal interactions, and their roles in FACT-dependent transcription, replication and repair. The variable requirements for FACT among different tumor and non-tumor cells suggest that various FACT-dependent processes have significantly different levels of relative importance in different eukaryotic cells. We propose that the stability of chromatin, which might vary among different cell types, dictates these diverse requirements for FACT to support cell viability. Since tumor cells are among the most sensitive to FACT inhibition, this vulnerability could be exploited for cancer treatment.",

Recent studies revealed that HBO1 is involved in gene transcriptional activation. However, the molecular behavior of HBO1 in inflammation is yet to be studied. Here we report that endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevates HBO1 protein level via up-regulating UPS25 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 25) and alters inflammatory gene transcription in THP-1 monocytes and in human primary macrophages. LPS protects HBO1 from ubiquitin proteasomal degradation without significantly altering its transcription. By immunoprecipitation, we identified that HBO1 associates with a deubiquitinating enzyme USP25 in THP-1 cells. LPS increases protein level of USP25 resulting in accumulation of HBO1 by suppression of HBO1 ubiquitination. Stabilized-HBO1 modulates inflammatory gene transcription in THP-1 cells. These findings indicate that USP25 promotes stability of HBO1 in bacterial infection thereby enhances HBO1-mediated inflammatory gene transcription.",

MRGBP increased the expression of certain AR target genes, including KLK3 and TMPRSS2, and it associated with AR binding regions of these genes during androgen treatment. Furthermore, MRGBP interacted with MRG15 and TIP60 in prostate cancer cells. Androgen-stimulated AR enhanced histone H3K4me1 or H3K4me3 levels at AR binding regions. MRGBP was recruited to active gene regions through its binding with H3K4me1/3 by MRG15. Then, MRGBP promoted recruitment of TIP60 and acetylation of histone variant H2A.Z at the location of AR binding. Accordingly, AR occupancy of the AR binding regions was increased by MRGBP.

Inhibition of glucose-stimulated \u03b2-cell proliferation is one of the in vivo results of the lipotoxicity of saturated fatty acids (SFAs). However, the mechanism by which lipotoxicity inhibits \u03b2-cell proliferation is still unclear. In this study, we found palmitate, a saturated fatty acid, inhibited the \u03b2-cell proliferation induced by high glucose through the induction of Wnt5a expression in vitro and in vivo. We also found that Wnt5a was both sufficient and necessary for inhibition of \u03b2-cell proliferation. Additionally, Egr-1, but not NF-\u03baB, FOXO1, Smad2, Smad3, SP1 or SP3 mediated the expression of Wnt5a. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the WNT5A promoter revealed that activation of WNT5A gene transcription depends primarily on a putative Egr-binding sequence between nucleotides \u221252 to \u221244, upstream of the transcription start site. Furthermore, Egr-1 bound directly to this sequence in response to palmitate treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, after mice islets were treated with Egr inhibitors, the expression of Wnt5a decreased significantly and the glucose-induced \u03b2-cell proliferation inhibited by palmitate was resumed. These findings establish Wnt5a as an Egr-1 target gene in \u03b2-cells, uncovering a novel Egr-1/Wnt5a pathway by which saturated free fatty acids block glucose-induced \u03b2-cell proliferation.

Importantly, RNAi knockdown of METTL4 and NMAD not only induce cell cycle arrest at G1 phase but also result in defects of chromosome alignments at metaphase. We further demonstrate that 6mA methylation is widely distributed across the genome of B. mori by 6mA-Seq and primarily enriched in the regulatory regions as well as gene bodies. Integrated analysis of 6mA-Seq and RNA-Seq reveals that 6mA methylation in B. mori is preferentially related with lowly expressed genes and negatively correlated with active gene transcription, which provides a novel regulatory mechanism of DNA 6mA methylation on target genes. Altogether, these data identify 6mA methylation in B. mori and demonstrate a crucial role of 6mA signaling in controlling cell cycle progression.",

     "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by the excess of body fat leading to impaired health. Abdominal fat is particularly harmful and is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and cancer. In contrast, subcutaneous fat is generally considered less detrimental. The mechanisms that establish the cellular characteristics of these distinct fat types in humans are not fully understood. Here, we explored whether differences of their gene regulatory mechanisms can be investigated in vitro. For this purpose, we in vitro differentiated human visceral and subcutaneous pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes and obtained their gene expression profiles and genome-wide H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27ac patterns. Subsequently, we compared those data with public gene expression data from visceral and subcutaneous fat tissues. We found that the in vitro differentiated adipocytes show significant differences in their transcriptional landscapes, which correlate with biological pathways that are characteristic for visceral and subcutaneous fat tissues, respectively. Unexpectedly, visceral adipocyte enhancers are rich on motifs for transcription factors involved in the Hippo-YAP pathway, cell growth and inflammation, which are not typically associated with adipocyte function. In contrast, enhancers of subcutaneous adipocytes show enrichment of motifs for common adipogenic transcription factors, such as C/EBP, NFI and PPAR\u03b3, implicating substantially disparate gene regulatory networks in visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes. Consistent with the role in obesity, predominantly the histone modification pattern of visceral adipocytes is linked to obesity-associated diseases. Thus, this work suggests that the properties of visceral and subcutaneous fat tissues can be studied in vitro and provides preliminary insights into their gene regulatory processes.",

Lastly, we also observed that the downregulation of ZNF496 is associated with poor recurrence-free survival among patients with breast cancer.

ErbB2 is transcriptionally regulated by YAP in both the mouse liver and in HepG2 human hepatoma cells. Knockdown of YAP or pharmacological inhibition with verteporfin reduced ERBB2 levels in HepG2 cells. Analysis of ChIP-seq data revealed enrichment of the transcription factor TEAD4 at the ERBB2 promoter.

In the filamentous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120, global stress management role for LexA and a consensus LexA-binding box (AnLexA-box) has been established using a LexA-overexpressing recombinant strain, AnlexA+. High levels of LexA rendered Anabaena cells sensitive to different DNA damage and oxidative stress-inducing agents, through the transcriptional down-regulation of the genes involved in DNA repair and alleviation of oxidative stress. LexA overexpression enhanced the ability of Anabaena to tolerate C-depletion, induced by inhibiting photosynthesis, by up-regulating genes involved in C-fixation and down-regulating those involved in C-breakdown, while maintaining the overall photosynthetic efficiency. A consensus LexA-binding box, AnLexA-box [AGT-N4\u201311-ACT] was identified upstream of both up- and down-regulated genes using a subset of Anabaena genes identified on the basis of proteomic analysis of AnlexA+ strain along with a few DNA repair genes. A short genome search revealed the presence of AnLexA box in at least 40 more genes, with functional roles in fatty acid biosynthesis, toxin-antitoxin systems in addition to DNA repair, oxidative stress, metal tolerance and C-metabolism. Thus, Anabaena LexA modulates the tolerance to multitude of stresses through transcriptional up/down-regulation of their functional genes directly by binding to the AnLexA Box present in their promoter region.",

Our results reveal a complex transcriptional circuit downstream of Cbt and evidence that it is functionally related with the Insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway. In this context, Cbt may act as a positive regulator of the pathway, leading to the repression of Foxo activity.

A panel of well-documented pro-apoptotic genes, including p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (PERP), are up-regulated and collectively mediate ROS induced apoptosis. The epigenetic mechanism whereby ROS stimulates PERP transcription, however, lacks in-depth characterization. Here we report that the transcriptional modulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is activated by H2O2 treatment in skeletal muscle cells (C2C12). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing or small-molecule compound (CCG-1423) mediated inhibition of MKL1 attenuated H2O2 induced apoptosis of C2C12 cells. Over-expression of MKL1 potentiated trans-activation of PERP whereas MKL1 ablation/inhibition abrogated the induction of PERP by H2O2 in C2C12 cells. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited to the PERP promoter by the transcription factor E2F1. Once bound to the PERP promoter, MKL1 engaged the histone demethylase KDM3A to modulate the chromatin structure surrounding the PERP promoter thereby leading to PERP trans-activation. Depletion of either E2F1 or KDM3A blocked the induction of PERP by H2O2.

The exon located between the two introns can be skipped during splicing and has been detected in circular form. This exon (E2) has also been found to influence the splicing of the flanking introns, an unusual situation in budding yeast where splicing mainly relies on intron recognition. Using SHAPE (selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension), NMR spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis and UV thermal denaturation experiments combined with computational predictions, we show that E2 of SUS1 comprises a conserved double-helical stem topped by a three-way junction. One of the hairpins emerging from the junction exhibited significant thermal stability and was capped by a purine-rich loop structurally related to the substrate loop of the VS ribozyme. Cellular assays revealed that three mutants containing altered E2 structures had impaired SUS1 expression, and that a compensatory mutation restoring the conserved stem recovered expression to wild-type levels. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR measurements paralleled these results, and revealed that mutations in E2 altered splicing and transcript degradation processes. Thus, exon structure plays an important role in SUS1 RNA metabolism.",

This study focuses on histone marks of active chromatin at promoter and enhancer regions and investigates, whether these genomic loci are sensitive to vitamin D. The epigenome of THP-1 human monocytes contains nearly 23,000 sites with H3K4me3 histone modifications, 550 of which sites are significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) modulated by stimulation with the VDR ligand 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). H3K27ac histone modifications mark active chromatin and 2473 of 45,500 sites are vitamin D sensitive. The two types of ligand-dependent histone marks allow to distinguish promoter and enhancer regulation by vitamin D, respectively. Transcription start site overlap is the prime attribute of ligand-dependent H3K4me3 marks, while VDR co-location is the top ranking parameter describing 1,25(OH)2D3-sensitive H3K27ac marks at enhancers. A categorization of 1,25(OH)2D3-sensitive histone marks by machine learning algorithms - using the attributes overall peak strength and ligand inducibility - highlights 260 and 287 regions with H3K4me3 and H3K27ac modifications, respectively. These loci are found at the promoter regions of 59 vitamin D target genes and their associated enhancers.

     "abstract": "Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, encoded by NR5A1) and estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2, encoded by ESR2), which are highly expressed in endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs), contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but the regulation mechanism remains largely unknown. Transcription factor 21 (TCF21) belongs to the helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family characterized by regulating gene expression via binding to E-box element. Here, we attempted to determine the molecular mechanism of TCF21 on SF-1 and ER\u03b2 expression in endometriosis. We found that TCF21 expression in ESCs was higher than that in endometrial stromal cells (EMs), and positively correlated with SF-1 and ER\u03b2 expression in ESCs. Since the importance of E-box element for NR5A1 promoter activity has been previously reported, we performed site-mutation and luciferase assay, revealing that the E-box sequence in the ESR2 promoter is also a critical element modulating ER\u03b2 expression. Upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2) is another bHLH factor implicated in transcriptional regulation. Further analyses elucidated that it is not TCF21, but USF2 exhibited higher binding affinities in ESCs to NR5A1 and ESR2 promoters than in EMs. Additionally, TCF21 knockdown significantly decreased the binding activities of USF2 to NR5A1 and ESR2 promoters via disruption of the TCF21-USF2 complex. Meanwhile, manipulating TCF21 expression significantly affected MMP9 and cyclinD1 expression, as wells as proliferation and invasion of ESCs. Moreover, TCF21 depletion in endometriotic xenografts reduced SF-1 and ER\u03b2 expression, abrogating ectopic lesion growth in mice. Cumulatively, a critical role of TCF21 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis is demonstrated, suggesting a potential druggable target for future therapy.",

     "abstract": "CTCF is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed architectural protein regulating a plethora of cellular functions via different molecular mechanisms. CTCF can undergo a number of post-translational modifications which change its properties and functions. One such modifications linked to cancer is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). The highly PARylated CTCF form has an apparent molecular mass of 180\u202fkDa (referred to as CTCF180), which can be distinguished from hypo- and non-PARylated CTCF with the apparent molecular mass of 130\u202fkDa (referred to as CTCF130). The existing data accumulated so far have been mainly related to CTCF130. However, the properties of CTCF180 are not well understood despite its abundance in a number of primary tissues. In this study we performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses in human breast cells 226LDM, which display predominantly CTCF130 when proliferating, but CTCF180 upon cell cycle arrest. We observed that in the arrested cells the majority of sites lost CTCF, whereas fewer sites gained CTCF or remain bound (i.e. common sites). The classical CTCF binding motif was found in the lost and common, but not in the gained sites. The changes in CTCF occupancies in the lost and common sites were associated with increased chromatin densities and altered expression from the neighboring genes. Based on these results we propose a model integrating the CTCF130/180 transition with CTCF-DNA binding and gene expression changes. This study also issues an important cautionary note concerning the design and interpretation of any experiments using cells and tissues where CTCF180 may be present.",

In addition to protein factors affecting RNA polymerase (RNAP) activity, second messengers play an important role in transcription regulation, such as well-known effectors of the stringent response: guanosine 5\u2032triphosphate-3\u2032diphosphate and guanosine 3\u2032, 5\u2032-bis(diphosphate) [(p)ppGpp]. Although much is known about importance of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 moieties of (p)ppGpp, the role of the guanine base remains somewhat cryptic. Here, we use (p)ppGpp's adenine analogs [(p)ppApp] to investigate how the nucleobase contributes to determine its binding site and transcriptional regulation. We determined X-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli RNAP-(p)ppApp complex, which shows the analogs bind near the active site and switch regions of RNAP. We have also explored the regulatory effects of (p)ppApp on transcription initiating from the well-studied E. coli rrnB P1 promoter to assess and compare properties of (p)ppApp with (p)ppGpp. We demonstrate that contrary to (p)ppGpp, (p)ppApp activates transcription at this promoter and DksA hinders this effect. Moreover, pppApp exerts a stronger effect than ppApp. We also show that when ppGpp and pppApp are present together, the outcome depends on which one of them was pre-incubated with RNAP first. This behavior suggests a surprising Yin-Yang like reciprocal plasticity of RNAP responses at a single promoter, occasioned simply by pre-exposure to one or the other nucleotide. Our observations underscore the importance of the (p)ppNpp's purine nucleobase for interactions with RNAP, which may lead to a better fundamental understanding of (p)ppGpp regulation of RNAP activity.",

Nucleoplasmin is a key factor in regulating nucleosome assembly as a chaperone during fertilization process. However, knowledge on nucleoplasmin in chromatin formation remains elusive. Herein, magnetic tweezers (MT) and a chromatin assembly system were used to study the nucleoplasmin-mediated DNA decondensation/condensation at the single-molecular level in vitro. We found that protamine induces DNA condensation in a stepwise manner. Once DNA was condensed, nucleoplasmin, polyglutamic acid, and RNA could remove protamine from the DNA at different rates. The affinity binding of the different polyanions with protamine suggests chaperone-mediated chromatin decondensation activity occurs through protein\u2013protein interactions. After decondensation, both RNA and polyglutamic acid prevented the transfer of histones onto the naked DNA. In contrast, nucleoplasmin is able to assist the histone transfer process, even though it carries the same negative charge as RNA and polyglutamic acid. These observations imply that the chaperone effects of nucleoplasmin during the decondensation/condensation process may be driven by specific spatial configuration of its acidic pentamer structure, rather than by electrostatic interaction. Our findings offer a novel molecular understanding of nucleoplasmin in sperm chromatin decondensation and subsequent developmental chromatin reprogramming at individual molecular level.",

Here we report that transcriptional activation of TM in both immortalized vascular endothelial cells (EAhy926) and primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) by all-trans retinoic acid (RA) paralleled accumulation of trimethylated histone H3K4, a prominent marker for active chromatin, surrounding the THBD promoter. RA treatment up-regulated the expression of SETD1A (SET1), a dedicated H3K4 methyltransferase, and augmented SETD1A occupancies on the THBD promoter. Further analysis revealed that the sequence-specific transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) interacted with and recruited SETD1A to the THBD promoter. Interestingly, SETD1A was recruited to the KLF4 promoter by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and mediated the up-regulation of KLF4 expression by RA stimulation. In summary, our data illustrate a previously unrecognized pathway in which SETD1A contributes to RA-induced TM expression in vascular endothelial cells by modulating the activity and expression of KLF4.",

In this study, we globally analyzed AGO2-bound mRNAs and found that the miR-17-92 miRNAs coherently repress multiple targets involved in the destabilization of mRNA. While the miRNAs repress the expression of their targets, they increase stability and lengthen the poly-A tails of non-target mRNAs.

In this work, 25 MaTCPs named MaTCP1 to MaTCP25 were characterized from our previously reported transcriptomes related to banana ripening. Expression analysis revealed that these MaTCPs displayed differential expression patterns during the progression of banana ripening. Particularly, MaTCP5, MaTCP19 and MaTCP20 were ethylene-inducible and nuclear-localized, with MaTCP5 and MaTCP20 acting as transcriptional activators while MaTCP19 being a transcriptional inhibitor. Moreover, MaTCP5 and MaTCP20 promoted the transcription of MaXTH10/11 that may play a role in fruit softening during banana ripening, whereas MaTCP19 repressed their transcription, by directly binding to their promoters. Importantly, protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that MaTCP20 physically interacts with MaTCP5 and MaTCP19 to form heterodimers in vitro and in vivo, and these protein complexes affects their transcriptional activities in regulating the target genes. Taken together, our results provide an overview of the interactions between MaTCPs in controlling the ripening-associated genes and lay a foundation for further investigation of MaTCP gene family in regulating banana fruit ripening.",

However, how SALL2 is regulated and why is deregulated in cancer remain poorly understood. We previously showed that the p53 tumor suppressor represses SALL2 under acute genotoxic stress. Here, we investigated the effect of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (HDACi) Trichostatin A (TSA), and involvement of Sp1 on expression and function of SALL2 in Jurkat T cells. We show that SALL2 mRNA and protein levels were enhanced under TSA treatment. Both, TSA and ectopic expression of Sp1 transactivated the SALL2 P2 promoter. This transactivation effect was blocked by the Sp1-binding inhibitor mithramycin A. Sp1 bound in vitro and in vivo to the proximal region of the P2 promoter. TSA induced Sp1 binding to the P2 promoter, which correlated with dynamic changes on H4 acetylation and concomitant recruitment of p300 or HDAC1 in a mutually exclusive manner. Our results suggest that TSA-induced Sp1-Lys703 acetylation contributes to the transcriptional activation of the P2 promoter. Finally, using a CRISPR/Cas9 SALL2-KO Jurkat-T cell model and gain of function experiments, we demonstrated that SALL2 upregulation is required for TSA-mediated cell death. Thus, our study identified Sp1 as a novel transcriptional regulator of SALL2, and proposes a novel epigenetic mechanism for SALL2 regulation in Jurkat-T cells.

BmSuc1 is a novel animal \u03b2-fructofuranosidase (\u03b2-FFase, EC 3.2.1.26)-encoding gene that was firstly cloned and identified in silkworm, Bombyx mori. BmSUC1 was presumed to play an important role in the silkworm-mulberry enzymatic adaptation system by effectively hydrolyzing sucrose absorbed from mulberry leaves. However, this has not been proved with direct evidence thus far. In this study, we investigated sucrose hydrolysis activity in the larval midgut of B. mori by inhibition tests and found that sucrase activity mainly stemmed from \u03b2-FFase, not \u03b1-glucosidase. Next, we performed shRNA-mediated transgenic RNAi to analyze the growth characteristics of silkworm larvae and variations in glycometabolism in vivo in transgenic silkworms. The results showed that in the RNAi-BmSuc1 transgenic line, larval development was delayed, and their body size was markedly reduced. Finally, the activity of several disaccharidases alone in the midgut and the sugar distribution, total sugar and glycogen in the midgut, hemolymph and fat body were then determined and compared. Our results demonstrated that silencing BmSuc1 significantly reduced glucose and apparently activated maltase and trehalase in the midgut. Together with a clear decrease in both glycogen and trehalose in the fat body, we conclude that BmSUC1 acts as an essential sucrase by directly modulating the degree of sucrose hydrolysis in the silkworm larval midgut, and insufficient sugar storage in the fat body may be responsible for larval malnutrition and abnormal petite phenotypes.",

Thus, an important question is whether this association of Ago1 with miRNAs and Ago2 with siRNAs occurs generally in insects, or was a specific innovation in higher flies.We addressed this question by using RNAi approaches and studying Ago1 and Ago2 functions in the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, a much less modified insect that emerged some 320 million years ago.The results showed that B. germanica does preferentially use Ago1 in the miRNA pathway, but can also use Ago2 in some cases. Conversely, Ago2 operates in the RNAi, in siRNA sorting, whereas Ago1 seems to have no relevant role in this process.These basic associations are equivalent to those observed in D. melanogaster, implying that they have been evolutionary conserved from at least cockroach to flies, and possibly stem from the last common ancestor of extant insects.",

In Apicomplexan parasites, the role and relevance of the kinases in the multistep process of transcription seeks more attention given the absence of full repertoire of canonical Cdks and cognate cyclin partners. In this study, we functionally characterize T. gondii Cdk-related kinase 9 (TgCrk9) showing maximal homology to eukaryotic Cdk9. An uncanonical cyclin, TgCyclin L, colocalizes with TgCrk9 in the parasite nucleus and co-immunoprecipitate, could activate the kinase in-vitro. We identify two threonines in conserved T-loop domain of TgCrk9 that are important for its activity. The activated TgCrk9 phosphorylates C-terminal domain (CTD) of TgRpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II highlighting its role in transcription. Selective chemical inhibition of TgCrk9 affected serine 2 phosphorylation in the heptapeptide repeats of TgRpb1-CTD towards 3\u2032 end of genes consistent with a possible role in transcription elongation. Interestingly, TgCrk9 kinase activity is regulated by the upstream TgCrk7 based CAK complex. TgCrk9 was found to functionally complement the role of its yeast counterpart Bur1 establishing its role as an important transcriptional kinase. In this study, we provide robust evidence that TgCrk9 is an important part of transcription machinery regulating gene expression in T. gondii.",

The molecular mechanisms facilitating this metabolic flexibility have yet to be elucidated in hypometabolic squid. Herein, we report the first investigation of the role of microRNAs, a rapid and reversible post-transcriptional master regulator of virtually all biological functions, in cephalopods. We examined expression levels of 39 highly-conserved invertebrate microRNAs in D. gigas brain, mantle muscle, and branchial heart, comparing hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Hypoxia-inducible microRNAs are potentially involved in facilitating neuroprotection, anti-apoptosis, and regenerative mechanisms in brain; inhibiting apoptosis and cell proliferation while conserving energy in heart; and limiting damage by reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in muscle. Rather than orchestrate global metabolic rate depression, the majority of hypoxia-inducible microRNAs identified are involved in promoting cytoprotective mechanisms, suggesting a regulatory role for microRNA in hypoxic marine invertebrates that sets the stage for mechanistic analyses.",

The non-methylated H3 peptide is recognized only by the PHD finger of ATRXADD while mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3 is recognized by both the PHD and GATA-like zinc finger of the domain. Furthermore, water molecules play an important role in orienting the lysine 9 anchor towards the GATA-like zinc finger, which results in stabilizing the lysine 9 binding pocket on ATRXADD. We compared our computational results against experimentally determined NMR and X-ray structures by demonstrating the RMSD, order parameter S2 and hydration number of the complex.

In contrast, the Trithorax group (TrxG) protein absent, small, or homeotic discs 1 (ASH1) is bound downstream of the PRE, to a region adjacent to the Lim3 transcription start site in embryos and adult flies, in which Lim3 is in an active state. Furthermore, mutations in Pc and ash1 genes affect Lim3 expression depending on the structural integrity of the Lim3 PRE, thus confirming functional interactions between these proteins and Lim3 regulatory region. In addition, we demonstrate that the evolutionary conserved Lim3 core promoter provides basic Lim3 expression, whereas structural changes in the Lim3 PRE of distal promoter provide stage-, and tissue-specific Lim3 expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that PcG/TrxG proteins, which are directly involved in Lim3 transcription regulation, participate in lifespan control.",

Repressed COX-2 expression and deficient PGE2 have been shown to contribute to the activation of lung fibroblasts and excessive deposition of collagen in pulmonary fibrosis. We have previously demonstrated that COX-2 expression in lung fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is epigenetically silenced and can be restored by epigenetic inhibitors. This study aimed to investigate whether COX-2 downregulation induced by the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in normal lung fibroblasts could be prevented by epigenetic inhibitors. We found that COX-2 protein expression and PGE2 production were markedly reduced by TGF-\u03b21 and this was prevented by the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) and to a lesser extent by the DNA demethylating agent Decitabine (DAC), but not by the G9a histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitor BIX01294 or the EZH2 HMT inhibitor 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the effect of SAHA was unlikely mediated by histone modifications. Instead 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) luciferase reporter assay indicated the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms. This was supported by the downregulation by SAHA of the 3\u2032-UTR mRNA binding protein TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen-1), a negative regulator of COX-2 translation. Furthermore, TIA-1 knockdown by siRNA mimicked the effect of SAHA on COX-2 expression. These findings suggest SAHA can prevent TGF-\u03b21-induced COX-2 repression in lung fibroblasts post-transcriptionally through a novel TIA-1-dependent mechanism and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying its potential antifibrotic activity.SAHA suberanilohydroxamic acid TGF-\u03b21 transforming growth factor-\u03b21 COX-2 cyclooxygenase-2 TIA-1 T-cell intracellular antigen-1 PGE2 prostaglandin E2 IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis DAC Decitabine HMT histone methyltransferase EZH2 enhancer of zeste homolog 2 DZNep 3-deazaneplanocin A 3\u2032-UTR 3\u2032-untranslated region \u03b1-SMA \u03b1-smooth muscle actin ECM extracellular matrix COL1 collagen 1 DNMT DNA methyltransferase HAT histone acetyltransferase HDAC histone deacetylase H3K9me3 histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation ARE AUUUA-rich element HuR human antigen R ELAV1 ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1 TTP Tristetraprolin CUGBP2 CUG triplet repeat, RNA binding protein 2 F-NL fibroblast from non-fibrotic lung FCS fetal calf serum",

Previously, we showed that Neurogenin3 promoted the removal of H3K27me3 marks at target gene promoters in vitro, suggesting a functional connection between this factor and regulators of this chromatin mark. In the present study, we aimed to specifically evaluate whether targeting the activity of these histone modifiers can be used to modulate pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Our data show that chemical inhibition of the H3K27me3 demethylases Jmjd3/Utx blunts Neurogenin3-dependent gene activation in vitro. Conversely, inhibition of the H3K27me3 methyltransferase Ezh2 enhances both the transactivation ability of Neurogenin3 in cultured cells and the formation of insulin-producing cells during directed differentiation from pluripotent cells.

In this study, we identified the interaction between the C-terminus of ANP32e and N-terminus of H2A.Z in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Knockdown of ANP32e resulted in proteasomal degradation and nuclear depletion of H2A.Z or of a chimeric green florescence protein fused to its N-terminus. This effect was reversed by inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and, conversely, reproduced by overexpression of its catalytic subunit. Accordingly, knockdown of ANP32e inhibited phosphorylation of H2A.Z, whereas a mutation of serine-9 proved its requirement for both the protein's stability and nuclear localization, as did knockdown of the nuclear mitogen and stress-induced kinase 1. Moreover, ANP32e's knockdown also revealed its differential requirement for cell signaling and gene expression, whereas, genome-wide binding analysis confirmed its co-localization with H2A.Z at transcription start sites, as well as, gene bodies of inducible and tissue-specific genes. The data also suggest that H2A.Z restricts transcription, which is moderated by ANP32e at the promoter and gene bodies of expressed genes. Thus, ANP32e, through inhibition of PP2A, is required for nucleosomal inclusion of H2A.Z and the regulation of gene expression.",

Many viruses encode miRNAs that directly downregulate the expression of factors of the innate immune system, which includes proteins involved in promoting apoptosis and recruitment. In this study, we examined the expression profiles of three previously identified viral miRNAs (v-miRs) from the human herpesvirus (HHV) family, HSV-1 (miR-H1), KSHV (miR-K12-3-3p), and HCMV (miR-US4) in healthy and diseased periodontal tissues and observed increased levels of v-miRs in diseased tissues. To understand the significance of this increase, we overexpressed v-miRs in human oral keratinocytes (HOK), a common target for various HHV, and analyzed the impact of miR-H1 and miR-K12-3-3p on the host transcriptome. More than 1300 genes were altered in HOK overexpressing miR-H1 and miR-K12-3-3p. Global pathway analysis of deregulated genes identified several key cellular pathways that may favor viral persistence. Using bioinformatic analysis, we predicted hundreds of potential v-miR binding sites on genes downregulated by miR-H1 and miR-K12-3-3p and validated three novel target v-miR sites suggesting widespread direct and indirect modulation of numerous host genes/pathways by a single v-miR. Finally, in vitro HSV-1 infection assays showed that miR-H1 can regulate viral entry and infection in human oral keratinocytes (HOK). Overall, our results demonstrate clinical and functional relevance of pathogenic viral molecules viz., v-miRs that regulate both host and viral functions and may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory oral diseases.",

Transcriptome analyses found that many non-protein-coding regions are transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs and enhancer-associated RNAs. Production of these transcripts is associated with activation of nearby protein-coding genes, and at least in some cases, the transcripts themselves mediate this activation. Non-coding transcripts are also reported from large enhancers or clusters of enhancers. However, not much is known about the function of large transcribed enhancer regions during organismal development. Here we investigated a transcribed 10.6\u202fkb intergenic region located upstream of the C. elegans bed-3 gene. We found that parts of this region exhibit tissue-specific promoter and enhancer activities. Deletion of the region disrupts egg laying, a phenotype also observed in bed-3 mutants, but with the severity correlating with the size of the deletion. This phenotype is not caused by overall reduction in bed-3 expression. Rather, deletions reduce bed-3 expression specifically in the mesoderm lineage. We found that bed-3 has a previously unknown function in the generation of sex myoblast (SM) cells from the M lineage, and deletions cause loss of SM cells leading to loss of vulval muscles required for egg laying. Furthermore, injection of dsRNA targeting non-coding transcripts from this region disrupted egg laying in the wild type but not in RNAi-defective mutants. Therefore, the region upstream of bed-3 is required for robust expression of bed-3 in a specific tissue, and non-coding transcripts may mediate this interaction.",

Interestingly, MAF1 modulates Pol II activity both as a repressor and activator, depending on specific target genes, to impact on cellular growth and metabolism. While MAF1 represses genes such as TATA-binding protein (TBP) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), it activates the expression of PTEN, a major tumor suppressor and an inhibitor of the mTOR signaling. Increasing evidence indicates that MAF1 plays an important role in different aspects of normal physiology, lifespan and oncogenesis. Here we will review the current knowledge on MAF1 in growth, metabolism, aging and cancer.

     "abstract": "The field of tRNA biology, encompassing the functional and structural complexity of tRNAs, has fascinated scientists over the years and is continuously growing. Besides their fundamental role in protein translation, new evidence indicates that tRNA-derived molecules also regulate gene expression and protein synthesis in all domains of life. This review highlights some of the recent findings linking tRNA transcription and modification with plant cell growth and response to pathogens. In fact, mutations in proteins directly involved in tRNA synthesis and modification most often lead to pleiotropic effects on plant growth and immunity. As plants need to optimize and balance their energy and nutrient resources towards growth and defense, regulatory pathways that play a central role in integrating tRNA transcription and protein translation with cell growth control and organ development, such as the auxin-TOR signaling pathway, also influence the plant immune response against pathogens. As a consequence, distinct pathogens employ an array of effector molecules including tRNA fragments to target such regulatory pathways to exploit the plant's translational capacity, gain access to nutrients and evade defenses. An example includes the RNA polymerase III repressor MAF1, a conserved component of the TOR signaling pathway that controls ribosome biogenesis and tRNA synthesis required for plant growth and which is targeted by a pathogen effector molecule to promote disease.

For all three RNAPs, the nascent transcripts generated undergo extensive post-transcriptional processing. Transcription of mRNAs by RNAP II and their processing are coupled with the aid of the C-terminal domain of the RNAP II. RNAP I transcription and the processing of its transcripts are co-localized to the nucleolus and to some extent, rRNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally.

     "abstract": "The conserved nuclear RNA-binding factor known as La protein arose in an ancient eukaryote, phylogenetically associated with another eukaryotic hallmark, synthesis of tRNA by RNA polymerase III (RNAP III). Because 3\u2032-oligo(U) is the sequence-specific signal for transcription termination by RNAP III as well as the high affinity binding site for La, the latter is linked to the intranuclear posttranscriptional processing of eukaryotic precursor-tRNAs. The pre-tRNA processing pathway must accommodate a variety of substrates that are destined for both common steps as well as tRNA-specific events. The order of intranuclear pre-tRNA processing steps is mediated in part by three activities derived from interaction with La protein: 3\u2032-end protection from untimely decay by 3\u2032 exonucleases, nuclear retention and chaperone activity that helps prevent pre-tRNA misfolding and mischanneling into offline pathways. A focus of this perspective will be on differences between yeast and mammals in the subcellular partitioning of pre-tRNA intermediates and differential interactions with La. We review how this is most relevant to pre-tRNA splicing which occurs in the cytoplasm of yeasts but in nuclei of higher eukaryotes. Also divergent is La architecture, comprised of three RNA-binding domains in organisms in all examined branches of the eukaryal tree except yeast, which have lost the C-terminal RNA recognition motif-2\u03b1 (RRM2\u03b1) domain. We also review emerging data that suggest mammalian La interacts with nuclear pre-tRNA splicing intermediates and may impact this branch of the tRNA maturation pathway.

     "abstract": "Although tRNAs participate in the essential function of protein translation in the cytoplasm, tRNA transcription and numerous processing steps occur in the nucleus. This subcellular separation between tRNA biogenesis and function requires that tRNAs be efficiently delivered to the cytoplasm in a step termed \u201cprimary tRNA nuclear export\u201d. Surprisingly, tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic traffic is not unidirectional, but, rather, movement is bidirectional. Cytoplasmic tRNAs are imported back to the nucleus by the \u201ctRNA retrograde nuclear import\u201d step which is conserved from budding yeast to vertebrate cells and has been hijacked by viruses, such as HIV, for nuclear import of the viral reverse transcription complex in human cells. Under appropriate environmental conditions cytoplasmic tRNAs that have been imported into the nucleus return to the cytoplasm via the 3rd nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling step termed \u201ctRNA nuclear re-export\u201d, that again is conserved from budding yeast to vertebrate cells. We describe the 3 steps of tRNA nuclear-cytoplasmic movements and their regulation. There are multiple tRNA nuclear export and import pathways. The different tRNA nuclear exporters appear to possess substrate specificity leading to the tantalizing possibility that the cellular proteome may be regulated at the level of tRNA nuclear export. Moreover, in some organisms, such as budding yeast, the pre-tRNA splicing heterotetrameric endonuclease (SEN), which removes introns from pre-tRNAs, resides on the cytoplasmic surface of the mitochondria. Therefore, we also describe the localization of the SEN complex to mitochondria and splicing of pre-tRNA on mitochondria, which occurs prior to the participation of tRNAs in protein translation.

Furthermore, the expression of several microbial virulence factors is induced by changes in environmental conditions; a process where tRNA 2-thiolation is unequivocal for pathogenicity.

The vital importance of tRNAs becomes evident in numerous diseases that are linked to defective tRNA molecules. It is therefore not surprising that the structural intactness of tRNAs is continuously scrutinized and defective tRNAs are eliminated. In this process, erroneous tRNAs are tagged with single-stranded RNA sequences that are recognized by degrading exonucleases. Recent discoveries have revealed that the CCA-adding enzyme \u2013 actually responsible for the de novo synthesis of the 3\u2032-CCA end \u2013 plays an indispensable role in tRNA quality control by incorporating a second CCA triplet that is recognized as a degradation tag.

     "abstract": "Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3-inducing interleukin (IL)-18 is a crucial inflammatory cytokine systemically provided by monocytes. It is counteracted by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a decoy receptor that displays IFN\u03b3-inducibility thus curbing inflammation by negative feedback. Since IL18BP inducibility is pronounced in human epithelial cells but diminished in monocytes, differential IL18BP regulation was investigated herein in both types of cells. Interestingly, DNA-demethylating 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine enhanced IFN\u03b3-induced IL-18BP only in monocytic but not in epithelial cells. Subsequent promoter analysis brought into focus a specific CpG (coined CpG2) neighboring a \u03b3-activated site responsible for IL18BP induction. CpG2 was consistently methylated in monocytic but unmethylated in epithelial cells. Notably, demethylation by 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine treatment of monocytic cells impeded methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) interaction with CpG2, increased adjacent histone H3K9-acetylation, and enhanced RNA-polymerase-II recruitment to the nearby IL18BP transcriptional start. Both latter observations are indicative of a gene locus displaying augmented transcriptional activity. Data suggest that epigenetic silencing by single CpG methylation determines differential IL18BP inducibility in monocytic versus epithelial cells. This regulatory principle should serve and control pivotal IL-18-related cell type-specific (patho)-physiological functions. Whereas epithelial IL-18BP evidently counteracts pathological inflammation at biological barriers, retarded IL18BP inducibility in monocytes may be key to combat blood-borne infections in IL-18-dependent manner.",

These functions include the enhancement of binding of a number of transcription factors, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, to their specific DNA-binding sites. HMGB1 is composed of two highly conserved HMG boxes, linked to an intrinsically disordered acidic C-terminal tail. Previous reports have suggested that the ability of HMGB1 to bend DNA may explain the in vitro HMGB1-mediated increase in sequence-specific DNA binding by p53. The aim of this study was to reinvestigate the importance of HMGB1-induced DNA bending in relationship to the ability of the protein to promote the specific binding of p53 to short DNA duplexes in vitro, and to transactivate two major p53-regulated human genes: Mdm2 and p21/WAF1. Using a number of HMGB1 mutants, we report that the HMGB1-mediated increase in sequence-specific p53 binding to DNA duplexes in vitro depends very little on HMGB1-mediated DNA bending. The presence of the acidic C-terminal tail of HMGB1 and/or the oxidation of the protein can reduce the HMGB1-mediated p53 binding. Interestingly, the induction of transactivation of p53-responsive gene promoters by HMGB1 requires both the ability of the protein to bend DNA and the acidic C-terminal tail, and is promoter-specific. We propose that the efficient transactivation of p53-responsive gene promoters by HMGB1 depends on complex events, rather than solely on the promotion of p53 binding to its DNA cognate sites.",

In this work, we demonstrated SIK1-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation of CRTC1 in the context of the regulation of gluconeogenesis. CRTC1 protein was destabilized by SIK1 but not SIK2 or SIK3. This effect was likely mediated by phosphorylation at S155, S167, S188 and S346 residues of CRTC1 followed by K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Expression of gluconeogenic genes such as that coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was stimulated by CRTC1, but suppressed by SIK1. Depletion of CRTC1 protein also blocked forskolin-induced gluconeogenic gene expression, knockdown or pharmaceutical inhibition of SIK1 had the opposite effect. Finally, SIK1-induced ubiquitination of CRTC1 was mediated by RFWD2 ubiquitin ligase at a site not equivalent to K628 in CRTC2. Taken together, our work reveals a regulatory circuit in which SIK1 suppresses gluconeogenic gene transcription by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of CRTC1.

Although complementarity of small interfering RNAs and microRNAs with target mRNAs has been studied thoroughly, partial complementarity of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with their target mRNAs has not been investigated clearly. To address that research gap, our lab investigated whether the sequence complementarity of two lncRNAs, lincRNA-p21 and OIP5-AS1, influenced the quantity of target RNA expression. We predicted a positive correlation between lncRNA complementarity and target mRNA quantity. We confirmed this prediction using RNA affinity pull down, microarray, and RNA-sequencing analysis. In addition, we utilized the information from this analysis to compare the quantity of target mRNAs when two lncRNAs, lincRNA-p21 and OIP5-AS1, are depleted by siRNAs. We observed that human and mouse lincRNA-p21 regulated target mRNA abundance in complementarity-dependent and independent manners. In contrast, affinity pull down of OIP5-AS1 revealed that changes in OIP5-AS1 expression influenced the amount of some OIP5-AS1 target mRNAs and miRNAs, as we predicted from our sequence complementarity assay. Altogether, the current study demonstrates that partial complementarity of lncRNAs and mRNAs (even miRNAs) assist in determining target RNA expression and quantity.",

One of the most powerful independent prognostic indicators for this disease is the amplification of the MYCN oncogene, which occurs at high levels in approximately 25% of neuroblastomas. Interestingly, amplification and not just expression of MYCN has a strong prognostic value, although this fact appears quite surprising as MYCN is a transcription factor that requires dimerising with its partner MAX, to exert its function. This observation greatly suggests that the role of MYCN in neuroblastoma should be examined in the context of MAX expression.In this report, we show that, in contrast to what is found in normal cells, MAX expression is significantly different among primary NBs, and that its level appears to correlate with the clinical outcome of the disease. Importantly, controlled modulation of MAX expression in neuroblastoma cells with different extents of MYCN amplification, demonstrates that MAX can instruct gene transcription programs that either reinforce or weaken the oncogenic process enacted by MYCN.In general, our work illustrates that it is the MAX to MYCN ratio that can account for tumour progression and clinical outcome in neuroblastoma and proposes that such a ratio should be considered as an important criterion to the design and development of anti-MYCN therapies.",

Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, not CYP19A1, is a direct functional target of miR-1275. In vitro overexpression and knockdown experiments showed that LRH-1 significantly repressed apoptosis and induced E2 secretion and CYP19A1 expression in pGCs.

It has been shown that sense-directed ncRNAs arising from the promoter region of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mediate its repression. Here, we show that an antisense-directed ncRNA (paRCDH1-AS) transcribed from the CDH1 promoter is necessary for its expression. paRCDH1-AS acts as a hooking scaffold by recruiting the epigenetic regulators, UHRF1, DNMT3A, SUV39H1 and SUZ12, involved in CDH1 repression. The binding of epigenetic regulators to paCRDH1-AS, indeed, prevents their localization to the chromatin on CDH1 promoter. Moreover, paRCDH1-AS silencing induces CDH1 repression and a switch of the epigenetic profile on the promoter towards a more closed chromatin. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches we defined that the promoter of the paRCDH1-AS is shared with the E-cadherin gene, showing a bidirectional promoter activity. We found that UHRF1 controls both CDH1 and paRCDH1-AS by directly binding this bidirectional promoter region.

In the current article, we study the involvement of TRIB3 in responses to nutrient deficiencies, including fasting for up to 48\u202fh in mice. We show that hepatic expression of Trib3 is increased after 48\u202fh of fasting and mice with a targeted deletion of the Trib3 gene present elevated hepatic triglyceride content and liver weight at 48\u202fh, along with an upregulation of lipid utilization genes in the liver. Further, hepatic and serum levels of the metabolic stress hormone FGF21 are considerably increased in 48-h-fasted Trib3 knockout mice compared to wild type. Trib3 deficiency also leads to elevated FGF21 levels in the mouse liver during essential amino acid deficiency and in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts during glucose starvation. Reporter assays reveal that TRIB3 regulates FGF21 by inhibiting ATF4-mediated, C/EBP\u2013ATF site-dependent activation of Fgf21 transcription. Based on chromatin immunoprecipitation from mouse liver, the binding of TRIB3 and ATF4, a transcription factor known to physically interact with TRIB3, is significantly increased at the Fgf21 promoter following 48\u202fh of fasting. Thus, under nutrient-limiting conditions that stimulate ATF4 activity, TRIB3 is implicated in the regulation of metabolic adaptation by restraining the transcription of Fgf21.",

     "abstract": "In the nucleus of differentiated osteoblasts, the alpha chain of nascent polypeptide associated complex (\u03b1NAC) interacts with cJUN transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes, including Osteocalcin (Bglap2). PTH induces the phosphorylation of \u03b1NAC on serine 99 through a G\u03b1s-PKA dependent pathway. This leads to activation of \u03b1NAC and expression of Bglap2. To identify additional target genes regulated by PTH-activated \u03b1NAC, we performed ChIP-Seq against \u03b1NAC in PTH-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. This identified Low density lipoprotein receptor-Related Protein 6 (Lrp6) as a potential \u03b1NAC target. LRP6 acts as a co-receptor for the PTH receptor to allow optimal activation of PTH signaling. PTH increased Lrp6 mRNA levels in primary osteoblasts. Conventional quantitative ChIP confirmed the ChIP-Seq results. To assess whether \u03b1NAC plays a critical role in PTH-stimulated Lrp6 expression, we knocked-down Naca expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Reduction of \u03b1NAC levels decreased basal expression of Lrp6 by 30% and blocked the stimulation of Lrp6 expression by PTH. We cloned the proximal mouse Lrp6 promoter (\u22122523/+120\u202fbp) upstream of the luciferase reporter. Deletion and point mutations analysis in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfections identified a functional \u03b1NAC binding site centered around \u2212343\u202fbp. ChIP and ChIP-reChIP against JUND and \u03b1NAC showed that they cohabit on the proximal Lrp6 promoter. Luciferase assays confirmed that PTH-activated \u03b1NAC potentiated JUND-mediated Lrp6 transcription and Jund knockdown abolished this response. This study identified a novel \u03b1NAC target gene induced downstream of PTH signaling and represents the first characterization of the regulation of Lrp6 transcription in osteoblasts.",

     "abstract": "Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a highly regulated protein that is implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions including inflammation and transformation. Transcription from the ATF3 gene is induced by several stress-induced signaling pathways, including amino acid limitation (amino acid response, AAR) and ER stress (unfolded protein response, UPR). Induction of ATF3 transcription by these pathways is mediated by ATF4 and cJUN recruitment to enhancer elements within the ATF3 gene. Although a canonical promoter (promoter A) has been studied by numerous laboratories, a second promoter activity (promoter A1), 43\u202fkb upstream of the first, has been reported to respond to stress-induced signaling and to be critical for ATF3 expression in certain transformed cells. The results of the present study show that in normal human hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells both basal as well as AAR- and UPR-induced transcription occurs almost exclusively from promoter A. This selectivity between the two promoters correlated with increased binding of ATF4, recruitment of RNA polymerase II, and the expected histone modifications in the promoter A region of the gene. Time course studies of ATF3 transcription activity revealed that the temporal kinetics for ATF3 induction differ between the AAR and UPR, with the former being more transient than the latter. Collectively, the results document that ATF3 expression in normal and transformed human liver originates from the canonical promoter A that responds to multiple stress signals.",

TIM23 is the channel-forming subunit of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23) complex, which mediates preprotein translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane. In this paper, we aimed to characterize the promoter region of the highly similar human TIM23 orthologs: TIMM23 and TIMM23B. Bioinformatic analysis revealed putative sites for the GA-binding protein (GABP) and the recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J (RBPJ) transcription factors in both promoters. Luciferase reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed three functional sites for GABP and one functional site for RBPJ in both promoters. Moreover, silencing of GABPA, the gene encoding the DNA-binding subunit of the GABP transcription factor, resulted in reduced expression of TIMM23 and TIMM23B. Our results show an essential role of GABP in activating TIMM23 expression. More broadly, they suggest that physiological signals involved in activating mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function also enhance the transcription but not the protein level of TIMM23, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and homeostasis.",

The mechanistic importance of promoter activity in regulation of IGF2 has not been fully clarified. Here we show that histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) modified by menin-MLL complex of IGF2 promoter contributes to promoter activity of IGF2. The strong binding of menin and abundant H3K4me3 at the DNA demethylated P3/4 promoters were observed in Hep3B cells with the robust expression of IGF2. In IGF2-low-expressing HepG2 cells, menin didn't bind to DNA hypermethylated P3/4 regions; however, menin overexpression inhibited DNA methylation and promoted H3K4me3 at the P3/4 as well as IGF2 expression in HepG2. In addition, the H3K4me3 at P3/4 locus was activated in primary HCC specimens with high IGF2 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of the menin/MLL interaction via MI-2/3 reduced IGF2 expression, inhibited the IGF1R-AKT pathway, and significantly repressed HCC with robust expression of IGF2. Taken together, we conclude that H3K4me3 of P3/4 locus mediated by the menin-MLL complex is a novel epigenetic mechanism for releasing IGF2.",

     "abstract": "The selective inhibition of transcription of a chosen gene by an artificial agent has numerous applications. Usually, these agents are designed to bind a specific nucleotide sequence in the promoter or within the transcribed region of the chosen gene. However, since optimal binding sites might not exist within the gene, it is of interest to explore the possibility of transcription inhibition when the agent is designed to bind at other locations. One of these possibilities arises when an additional transcription initiation site (e.g. secondary promoter) is present upstream from the primary promoter of the target gene. In this case, transcription inhibition might be achieved by inducing the formation of an RNA-DNA hybrid (R-loop) upon transcription from the secondary promoter. The R-loop could extend into the region of the primary promoter, to interfere with promoter recognition by RNA polymerase and thereby inhibit transcription. As a sequence-specific R-loop-inducing agent, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) could be designed to facilitate R-loop formation by sequestering the non-template DNA strand. To investigate this mode for transcription inhibition, we have employed a model system in which a PNA binding site is localized between the T3 and T7 phage RNA polymerase promoters, which respectively assume the roles of primary and secondary promoters. In accord with our model, we have demonstrated that with PNA-bound DNA substrates, transcription from the T7 promoter reduces transcription from the T3 promoter by 30-fold, while in the absence of PNA binding there is no significant effect of T7 transcription upon T3 transcription.",

We conducted a transcriptome-wide screen for AREs and found that they are most abundant in introns, with up to 25% of introns containing AREs corresponding to 58% of human genes. Clustering studies of ARE size, complexity, and distribution revealed that, in introns, longer AREs with two or more overlapping repeats are more abundant than in the 3\u2032UTR, and only introns can contain very long AREs with 6\u201314 overlapping AUUUA pentamers. We found that intronic sites of the ARE binding proteins HuR/ELAVL1, ZFP36/TTP, AUF1, and BRF1/ZFP36L1 overlap with the intronic AREs with HuR being most abundant. Accordingly, RNA-IP experiments demonstrated a specific association of HuR with reporter and endogenous pre-mRNAs that contain intronic AREs. Moreover, HuR knockdown led to a significant general reduction in the mRNA levels of genes that contain intronic AREs and to a specific reduction in the expression of ARE-intronic reporters. The data represent bioinformatics analysis for key RNA-binding proteins interactions with intronic AREs and provide experimental evidence for HuR binding to AREs. The widespread distribution of intronic AREs and their particular association with HuR and HuR binding sites indicates that more than half of human genes can be regulated post-transcriptionally by AREs.",

Thorough evaluation of the behaviour of multiple transcriptional complexes during the early activation process has shown that the pathways by which activation proceeds for different genes may vary considerably, even in response to the same induction signal. RNA polymerase II recruitment is an important step that is involved in one of the pathways. RNA polymerase II recruitment is accompanied by the recruitment of a significant number of transcriptional coactivators as well as slight changes in the chromatin structure. The second pathway involves the stimulation of transcriptional elongation as its key step.

The rpb5-P151T mutation specifically impairs transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II but does not influence the functions of RNA polymerases I or III. The comparison of RNA polymerase II ChIP and run-on signals indicates a higher tendency to backtrack by this mutant, in agreement with its lower elongation rate and its genetic interactions with dst1\u0394 mutant. This phenotype is particularly striking shortly after transcription initiation and is linked to differences in the phosphorylation state of the RNA polymerase II and reduced recruitment of Spt5 to transcribe chromatin, thus influencing its anti-backtracking activity.

Herein, our data revealed that 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), an antimetabolite used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, stabilizes the LDLR mRNA through a previously unrecognized signaling pathway resulting in a strong increase of its protein level in human hepatocytes in culture. 5-AzaC caused a sustained activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) kinase domain and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) independently of endoplasmic reticulum stress. This resulted in activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) that, in turn, stabilized LDLR mRNA. Systematic mutation of the AREs (ARE1-3) in the LDLR 3\u2032UTR and expression of each mutant coupled to a luciferase reporter in Huh7 cells demonstrated that ARE1 is required for rapid LDLR mRNA decay and 5-AzaC-induced mRNA stabilization via the IRE1\u03b1-EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling cascade.

     "abstract": "Differentiation of human monocytes is associated with proliferation arrest resulting from activation of the inter alia retinoblastoma protein family of gene repressors, which target gene promoters in an E2F-dependent manner. To investigate RBL2 contribution to defining monocyte phenotype and function, we used primer libraries. We identified genes encoding two surface receptors (CXCR1 and IL17RE) and two TLR signaling mediators (CD86 and NFKB2) that are repressed by the RBL2-E2F4-HDAC1-BRM complex. Surprisingly, PARP1 co-regulated 24 out of the 28 identified genes controlled by RBL2. Upon RBL2 silencing, PARP1 was recruited to one subset of RBL2-dependent genes, represented by MAP2K6 and MAPK3. RBL2 silencing also restored PARP1 transcription. Gene promoters enriched in PARP1 were characterized by increased histone acetylation and the replacement of HDAC1 with EP300. While PARP1 was dispensable for HDAC1 dissociation, EP300 was found only at gene promoters enriched in PARP1. EP300 activated transcription of PARP1/RBL2 co-regulated genes, but not genes solely controlled by RBL2. DNA was a prerequisite to the formation of an immunoprecipitated PARP1-EP300 complex, suggesting that PARP1 enabled EP300 binding, which in turn activated gene transcription. Notably, PARP1 overexpression failed to overcome the inhibitory effect of RBL2 on MAP2K6 and MAPK3 transcription. The same interdependence was observed in proliferating cancer cells; the low abundance of RBL2 resulted in PARP1-mediated EP300 recruitment to promoters of the MAP2K6 and MAPK3 genes. We conclude that RBL2 may indirectly regulate transcription of some genes by controlling PARP1-mediated EP300 recruitment.",

However, the amount of T-UCRs that are conservatively expressed in the developing nervous systems of mice, monkeys and humans is still unknown. In this study, we screened the RNA sequence signals of 481 identified UCRs in an E14.5 mouse brain from the ENCODE database and found 76 UCRs that may be transcribed into T-UCRs. To verify the expression of these potential T-UCRs, we used an RT-PCR experiment and identified that 60 T-UCRs can be expressed in the E14.5 mouse brain. Furthermore, we detected the expression conservation of 76 potential T-UCRs in two comparisons: postnatal day 0 brains of a mouse and a rhesus monkey and neural stem cells of mouse and human by RT-PCR experimentation. It was found that up to 65% of these T-UCRs were expressed in mouse, rhesus monkey and human nervous systems. Next, by testing the spatiotemporal expression pattern of these T-UCRs expressed in mouse, rhesus monkey and human nervous systems, we found that approximately 30% of the T-UCRs showed a relatively high and dynamical expression during mouse brain development. Finally, through biological process and molecular function gene ontology analysis of the host genes of intronic or exonic-antisense T-UCRs, it was discovered that most of the genes were involved in RNA splicing or RNA binding. These results suggest that T-UCRs are likely to participate in nervous system development through RNA processing.",

In this work we aimed to determine individual roles of p53 family members in the regulation of CXCR5 gene expression under genotoxic stress. DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate caused a reduction in CXCR5 expression not only in parental MCF-7 cells but also in MCF-7-p53off cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of the p53 gene. Since p53 knockout was associated with elevated expression of its p63 and p73 homologues, we knocked out p63 using CRISPR/Cas9 system and knocked down p73 using specific siRNA. The CXCR5 promoter activity, CXCR5 expression and CXCL13-directed migration in MCF-7 cells with inactivation of all three p53 family genes were completely insensitive to genotoxic stress, while pairwise p53\u00a0+\u00a0p63 or p53\u00a0+\u00a0p73 inactivation resulted in partial effects. Using deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that effects of NFkB on the CXCR5 promoter inversely correlated with p63 and p73 levels. Thus, all three p53 family members mediate the effects of genotoxic stress on the CXCR5 promoter using the same mechanism associated with attenuation of NFkB activity. Understanding of this mechanism could facilitate prognosis of tumor responses to chemotherapy.",

A critical step in animal miRNA biogenesis is the cleavage of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to produce precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the enzyme Drosha. How Drosha recognizes its substrates remains incompletely understood. In this study we constructed a series of human Drosha mutants and examined their enzymatic activities and interaction with RNAs. We found that the N-terminal region is required for the nuclear localization and cellular function of Drosha. And in contrast to previous reports, we showed that the double-stranded RNA binding domain (RBD) of Drosha exhibited a weak but noticeable affinity for RNA. Compared to the RBDs of other RNA-binding proteins, the RBD of Drosha has a short insert, whose mutations reduced RNA binding and pri-miRNA cleavage. Overexpression of Drosha RBD mutants in a reporter assay corroborated their deficiencies in Drosha activity in cell cultures. In addition, we found that point mutations in the RNaseIIIb domain of Drosha implicated in Wilms tumors differentially affected cleavage of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 strands of pri-miRNAs in vitro.

Marked elevation in FMR1 mRNA levels have been observed with premutation alleles resulting in RNA toxicity, the leading molecular mechanism proposed for the FMR1 associated disorders observed in premutation carriers.The FMR1 gene undergoes alternative splicing and we have recently reported that the relative abundance of all FMR1 mRNA isoforms is significantly increased in premutation carriers.In this study, we characterized the transcriptional FMR1 isoforms distribution pattern in different tissues and identified a total of 49 isoforms, some of which observed only in premutation carriers and which might play a role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS.Further, we investigated the distribution pattern and expression levels of the FMR1 isoforms in asymptomatic premutation carriers and in those with FXTAS and found no significant differences between the two groups.Our findings suggest that the characterization of the expression levels of the different FMR1 isoforms is fundamental for understanding the regulation of the FMR1 gene as imbalance in their expression could lead to an altered functional diversity with neurotoxic consequences.

It spans 2.2\u00a0Mb and accounts for approximately 0,1% of the entire human genome. Mutations in this gene cause Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy, X-linked Dilated Cardiomyopathy, and other milder muscle phenotypes. Beside the remarkable number of reports describing dystrophin gene expression and the pathogenic consequences of the gene mutations in dystrophinopathies, the full scenario of the DMD transcription dynamics remains however, poorly understood. Considering that the full transcription of the DMD gene requires about 16\u00a0h, we have investigated the activity of RNA Polymerase II along the entire DMD locus within the context of specific chromatin modifications using a variety of chromatin-based techniques.Our results unveil a surprisingly powerful processivity of the RNA polymerase II along the entire 2.2\u00a0Mb of the DMD locus with just one site of pausing around intron 52. We also discovered epigenetic marks highlighting the existence of four novel cis\u2011DNA elements, two of which, located within intron 34 and exon 45, appear to govern the architecture of the DMD chromatin with implications on the expression levels of the muscle dystrophin mRNA.Overall, our findings provide a global view on how the entire DMD locus is dynamically transcribed by the RNA pol II and shed light on the mechanisms involved in dystrophin gene expression control, which can positively impact on the optimization of the novel ongoing therapeutic strategies for dystrophinopathies.",

Despite the deeply conserved catalytic activity, only a small number of targets have been reported to extensively base pair with cognate miRNAs to be cleaved by AGO2. Here, we analyzed AGO2-bound RNAs by CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP) of genetically modified cells that express epitope-tagged AGO2 from the native genomic locus. We found that HMGA2 mRNA is cleaved by AGO2 loaded with let-7 and miR-21. In contrast to the generally accepted notion, the base-pairing from the seed region to the cleavage site, rather than perfect or near perfect complementarity, was required for cleavage of the target mRNA in cells. Non-templated addition of nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end of the cleaved RNA was observed, further supporting the AGO2-mediated cleavage. Based on the observation that the limited complementarity is the minimum requirement for cleavage, we found that AGO2-mediated cleavage of targets is more common than previously thought.

We first examined KSRP expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort containing 196 NSCLC patients and observed a strong positive correlation between KSRP expression and survival of NSCLC patients. Multivariate analysis further identified KSRP as an independent prognostic factor. Manipulating KSRP expression significantly affected in vitro cell mobility and in vivo metastatic ability of NSCLC cells. Microarray analysis identified an ARE-containing gene, EGR3, as a downstream effector of KSRP in NSCLC. Interestingly, we found that KSRP decreased EGR3 mRNA stability in an ARE-independent manner. By screening KSRP-regulated miRNAs in NSCLC cells, we further found that miR-23a directly binds to EGR3 3\u2032UTR, reducing EGR3 expression and thereby inhibiting NSCLC cell mobility.

Mutations in the skeletal muscle \u03b1-actin gene (ACTA1) cause muscle diseases that are mostly lethal in the early postnatal period. We previously demonstrated that the disease phenotype of ACTA1 mouse models could be rescued by transgenic over-expression of cardiac \u03b1-actin (ACTC1). ACTC1 is the predominant striated \u03b1-actin isoform in the heart but is also expressed in developing skeletal muscle. To develop a translatable therapy, we investigated the genetic regulation of Actc1 expression. Using strains from The Collaborative Cross (CC) genetic resource, we found that Actc1 varies in expression by up to 24-fold in skeletal muscle. We defined significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with early adult Actc1 expression in soleus and heart. eQTL in both heart and soleus mapped to the Actc1 locus and replicate an eQTL mapped for Actc1 in BXD heart and quadriceps. We built on this previous work by analysing genes within the eQTL peak regions to prioritise likely candidates for modifying Actc1 expression. Additionally we interrogated the CC founder haplotype contributions to enable prioritisation of genetic variants for functional analyses. Methylation around the Actc1 transcriptional start site in early adult skeletal muscle negatively correlated with Actc1 expression in a strain-dependent manner, while other marks of regulatory potential (histone modification and chromatin accessibility) were unaltered.

In the present study we investigated the role of HIF-1\u03b1 in trans\u2011activating the seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1) gene and the underlying mechanism. We report that in response to nutritional stress, SIAH1 expression was up-regulated in the liver in mice and in cultured hepatocytes.

HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown or inhibition paralleled epigenetic alterations surrounding the SIAH1 promoter characterized by the loss of acetylated histone H3 and trimethylated H3K4 as well as the acquisition of dimethylated H3K9. Further analyses revealed that HIF-1\u03b1 interacted with and recruited the histone demethylase KDM3A to the SIAH1 promoter to activate transcription. HIF-1\u03b1 also mediated the crosstalk between KDM3A and p300. Depletion of KDM3A coincided with the loss of SIAH1 induction and the accumulation of dimethylated H3K9 surrounding the SIAH1 promoter.

P. falciparum proteome has significantly higher aspartic acid content and a higher proportion of proteins with poly aspartic acid repeats than other apicomplexan pathogenic protozoans. Proteins with such repeats are functionally important, with significant roles in host-pathogen interactions.

The changes in transcription can be an indirect effect on some of the genes, ensuing from the effect of stress on the regulators of transcription including epigenetic regulators. Within this paradigm, we investigated the correlation between stress response and epigenetic modification underlying gene expression modulation during desiccation stress in Canton-S. We report altered resistance of flies in desiccation stress for heterozygote mutants of PcG and TrxG members. Pc/+ mutant shows lower survival, while ash1/+ mutants show higher survival under desiccation stress as compared to Canton-S. We detect expression alteration in stress related genes as well the genes of the Polycomb and trithorax complex in Canton-S subjected to desiccation stress. Concomitant with this, there is an altered enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 at the upstream regions of the stress responsive genes. The enrichment of activating mark, H3K4me3, is higher in non-stress condition. H3K27me3, the repressive mark, is more pronounced under stress condition, which in turn, can be correlated with the binding of Pc. Our results show that desiccation stress induces dynamic switching in expression and enrichment of PcG and TrxG in the upstream region of genes, which correlates with histone modifications. We provide evidence that epigenetic modulation could be one of the mechanisms to adapt to the desiccation stress in Drosophila.

Here, we report the generation and the characterization of an ezh2-deficient zebrafish line. In contrast to its essential role in mouse early development, loss of ezh2 function does not affect zebrafish gastrulation. Ezh2 zebrafish mutants present a normal body plan but die at around 12 dpf with defects in the intestine wall, due to enhanced cell death. Thus, ezh2-deficient zebrafish can initiate differentiation toward the different developmental lineages but fail to maintain the intestinal homeostasis. Expression studies revealed that ezh2 mRNAs are maternally deposited. Then, ezh2 is ubiquitously expressed in the anterior part of the embryos at 24 hpf, but its expression becomes restricted to specific regions at later developmental stages. Pharmacological inhibition of Ezh2 showed that maternal Ezh2 products contribute to early development but are dispensable to body plan formation.

     "abstract": "Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) possess the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation, which are the basis of spermatogenesis. In maintenance of SSC homeostasis, intrinsic/extrinsic factors and various signaling pathways tightly control the fate of SSCs. Methyltransferase SETDB1 (Set domain, bifurcated 1) catalyzes histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation and represses gene expression. SETDB1 is required for maintaining the survival of spermatogonial stem cells in mice. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Setdb1 regulates PTEN/AKT/FOXO1 pathway to inhibit SSC apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assay revealed that SETDB1 interacted and coordinated with AKT to regulate FOXO1 activity and expression of the downstream target genes Bim and Puma. Among the SETDB1-bound genes, the H3K9me3 levels on the promoter regions of Bim and Pten decreased in Setdb1-KD group; in contrast, H3K9me3 status on promoters of Bax and Puma remained unchanged. Therefore, SETDB1 was responsible for regulating the transcription activity of genes in the apoptotic pathway at least in part through modulating H3K9me3. This study replenishes the research on the epigenetic regulation of SSC survival, and provides a new insight for the future study of epigenetic regulation of spermatogenesis.",

In our previous work, Eaf1/2 was found to modulate convergence and extension (C&E) movements and pattern the embryonic anterior-posterior axis during zebrafish embryogenesis. Here, we found that loss-of-function of eaf1/2 caused expanded mesoderm and endoderm in zebrafish embryos and led to the recovery of endoderm specification in TGF-\u03b2 factor-mzoeptz257 mutants, while gain-of-function of eaf1/2 induced reduced mesoderm and endoderm. Analyses of gene expression profiles in Eaf deleted or over-expressed mammalian cells indicated that the roles of Eaf1 and Eaf2 in inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 signals were conserved from fish to mammals. By taking advantages of TGF-\u03b2 reporters, eaf1/2-fused engrailed proteins, and P53M214K mutant, we revealed that Eaf1 and Eaf2 might suppress TGF-\u03b2 transduction by synergistically inhibiting none-P53 and P53-required TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Furthermore, Eaf1/2 might co-localize and interact with TGF-\u03b2 transcriptional factors in the transcriptional complex as repressors to target and suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity. Our study unveiled a previously unrecognized link of Eaf1/2 genes with TGF-\u03b2 and P53 in vertebrates and demonstrated a conservation of TGF-\u03b2 suppression activity for Eaf1/2 family genes from fish to mammals, which might shed some light on the molecular mechanistic basis of Eaf1 and Eaf2 in tumor suppression.",

LSD1 regulates the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial cells, i.e., the ability to transition into mesenchymal cells, to lose homotypic adhesion and to acquire migratory capacity. From its initial discovery as a component of the Snail complex, multiple studies highlighted the causative role of LSD1 in cell invasiveness and EMT, describing its direct involvement in different molecular processes through the interaction with specific partners.

In this study, we performed RIP-seq experiments in HeLa cells using a monoclonal antibody against CELF1. Mapping of the RIP-seq reads showed a biased distribution at the 3\u2032UTR and intronic regions. A total of 15,285 and 1384 CELF1-specific sense and antisense peaks were identified using the ABLIRC software tool. Our bioinformatics analyses revealed that 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice site motifs and GU-rich motifs were highly enriched in the CELF1-bound peaks. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that alternative splicing was globally regulated by CELF1 in HeLa cells. For example, the inclusion of exon 16 of LMO7 gene, a marker gene of breast cancer, is positively regulated by CELF1. Taken together, we have shown that RIP-seq data can be used to decipher RBP binding sites and reveal an unexpected landscape of the genome-wide CELF1-RNA interactions in HeLa cells. In addition, we found that CELF1 globally regulates the alternative splicing by binding the exon-intron boundary in HeLa cells, which will deepen our understanding of the regulatory roles of CELF1 in the pre-mRNA splicing process.",

Both NFATc3 knock-out mice and ILK conditional-knockdown mice (cKD-ILK) display symptoms of NDI (polyuria and reduced AQP2 expression). NFATc3 is upregulated in the renal medulla tubular cells of cKD-ILK mice but with reduced nuclear localization. Inner medullary collecting duct mIMCD3 cells were subjected to ILK depletion and transfected with reporter plasmids. Pharmacological activators or inhibitors determined the effect of ILK activity on NFATc/AP-1-dependent increases in transcription of AQP2.

However, the role of these non-coding RNA and their regulation in response to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is not known.In this paper, BRG1 and SMARCAL1, members of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling family, are shown to co-regulate the transcription of DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER in response to double-strand DNA breaks induced by doxorubicin. Both BRG1 and SMARCAL1 are needed for the upregulation of the three miRNA biogenesis genes as absence of BRG1 results in downregulation of DGCR8 and DICER while absence of SMARCAL1 results in downregulation of DROSHA. These two proteins act in coordination to upregulate expression of DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER when cells are treated with doxorubicin. This transcriptional regulation of the miRNA biogenesis proteins is needed for the formation of 53BP1 foci as downregulation of either BRG1 or SMARCAL1 reduced the number of 53BP1 foci in DNA damaged cells. The foci formation was restored when the downregulated cells were treated with ncRNA purified from doxorubicin treated HeLa cells.From the results obtained, we conclude that the regulation of miRNA biogenesis proteins by SMARCAL1 and BRG1 is needed for the formation of non-coding RNA and thus, 53BP1 foci in response to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage.",

In contrast, a group of 510 persistent VDR sites occurred at all conditions and some 2100 VDR loci were only transiently occupied. Machine learning and statistical analysis as well as a comparison with the re-analyzed B cell VDR cistrome indicated a subgroup of 339 highly conserved persistent VDR sites that were suited best for describing vitamin D-triggered gene regulatory scenarios. The 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent transcriptome of THP-1 cells comprised 587 genes, 311 of which were primary targets with main functions in the immune system. More than 97% of the latter genes were located within 1,25(OH)2D3-modulated topologically associated domains (TADs). The number of persistent and transient VDR sites was found to be the main discriminator for sorting these TADs into five classes carrying vitamin D target genes involved in distinct biological processes.

Due to alternative splicing of the ZNF509 primary transcript, ZNF509S1 lacks the 6 zinc-fingers and C-terminus of ZNF509L, resulting in only one zinc-finger. ZNF509L and -S1 inhibit cell proliferation by activating p21/CDKN1A and RB transcription, respectively. When cells are exposed to severe DNA damage, p53 activates PUMA ( p 53- u pregulated m odulator of a poptosis) transcription. Interestingly, apoptosis due to transcriptional activation of PUMA by p53 is attenuated by ZNF509S1. Thus we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the transcriptional attenuation and anti-apoptotic effects of ZNF509S1. We show that ZNF509S1 modulation of p53 activity is important in PUMA gene transcription by modulating post-translational modification of p53 by p300. ZNF509S1 directly interacts with p53 and inhibits p300-mediated acetylation of p53 lysine K382, with deacetylation of p53 K382 leading to decreased DNA binding at the p53 response element 1 of the PUMA promoter. ZNF509S1 may play a role not only in cell cycle arrest, by activating RB expression, but also in rescuing cells from apoptotic death by repressing PUMA expression in cells exposed to severe DNA damage.",

Although it has been shown that TSGA10 messenger RNA (mRNA) is mainly expressed in testis and some tumors, the transcription pattern and regulatory mechanisms of this gene remain largely unknown. Here, we report that human TSGA10 comprises at least 22 exons and generates four different transcript variants. It was identified that using two distinct promoters and splicing of exons 4 and 7 produced these transcript variants, which have the same coding sequence, but the sequence of 5'untanslated region (5'UTR) is different between them. This is significant because conserved regulatory RNA elements like upstream open reading frame (uORF) and putative internal ribosome entry site (IRES) were found in this region which have different combinations in each transcript variant and it may influence translational efficiency of them in normal or unusual environmental conditions like hypoxia. To indicate the transcription pattern of TSGA10 in breast cancer, expression of identified transcript variants was analyzed in 62 breast cancer samples. We found that TSGA10 tends to express variants with shorter 5'UTR and fewer uORF elements in breast cancer tissues. Our study demonstrates for the first time the expression of different TSGA10 transcript variants in testis and breast cancer tissues and provides a first clue to a role of TSGA10 5'UTR in regulation of translation in unusual environmental conditions like hypoxia.",

In prostate cancer, HIF1\u03b1 interplays with androgen receptor (AR) to contribute to the progression of this disease to its lethal form\u2014castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hypoxia upregulates several epigenetic factors including histone demethylase KDM3A which is a critical co-factor of HIF1\u03b1. However, how histone demethylases regulate hypoxia signaling is not fully understood. Here, we report that histone demethylase PHF8 plays an essential role in hypoxia signaling. Knockdown or knockout of PHF8 by RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 system reduced the activation of HIF1\u03b1 and the induction of HIF1\u03b1 target genes including KDM3A. Mechanistically, PHF8 regulates hypoxia inducible genes mainly through sustaining the level of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an active mark in transcriptional regulation. The positive role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling extended to hypoxia-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED), wherein PHF8 cooperates with KDM3A to regulate the expression of NED genes. Moreover, we discovered that the role of PHF8 in hypoxia signaling is associated with the presence of full-length AR in CRPC cells. Collectively, our study identified PHF8 as a novel epigenetic factor in hypoxia signaling, and the underlying regulatory mechanisms likely apply to general cancer development involving HIF1\u03b1.

The PPR elements bind the nucleotides in the target RNA, while the function of the E domain has remained unknown. At most sites RNA editing also requires multiple organellar RNA editing factor (MORF) proteins. To understand how these two types of proteins are involved in RNA editing complexes, we systematically analyzed their protein-protein interactions. In vivo pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays show that MORF proteins connect with selected PPR proteins. In a loss of function mutant of MORF1, a single amino acid alteration in the conserved MORF domain abrogates interactions with many PLS-class PPR proteins, implying the requirement of direct interaction to PPR proteins for the RNA editing function of MORF1. Subfragment analyses show that predominantly the N-terminal/central regions of the MORF domain in MORF1 and MORF3 bind the PPR proteins. Within the PPR proteins, the E domains in addition to PPR elements contact MORF proteins. In chimeric PPR proteins, different E domains alter the specificity of the interaction with MORF proteins. The selective interactions between E domain containing PPR and MORF proteins suggest that the E domains and MORF proteins play a key role for specific protein complexes to assemble at different RNA editing sites.",

In this study, we characterized the molecular and functional features of Kr-POK in the context of tumor growth and glutamine metabolism. We found that cells expressing Kr-POK shRNA exhibited more severe cell death than control cells in glucose-deprived medium, and that knockdown of Kr-POK decreased glutamine uptake. Glutamine is critical for tumor cell proliferation. Glutaminase (GLS1), which is activated by p-STAT1, catalyzes the initial reaction in the pathway of glutaminolysis. Kr-POK interacts with PIAS1 to disrupt the interaction between PIAS1 and p-STAT1, and free p-STAT1 can activate GLS1 transcription through an interaction with p300. Kr-POK can be also sumoylated by PIAS1, facilitating Kr-POK degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway.

Previously we have reported that the transcriptional regulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) plays a role programming cellular inflammatory response by modulating NF-\u03baB activity. Here we report that MKL1 was acetylated in vivo and pro-inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1 and LPS) augmented MKL1 acetylation accompanying increased MKL1 binding to NF-\u03baB target promoters. Further analysis revealed that the lysine acetyltransferase PCAF mediated MKL1 acetylation: TNF-\u03b1 and LPS promoted the interaction between MKL1 and PCAF whereas depletion of PCAF abrogated the induction of MKL1 acetylation by TNF-\u03b1 and LPS. Acetylation of MKL1 was necessary for MKL1 to activate the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes because mutation of four conserved lysine residues in MKL1 attenuated its capacity as a trans-activator of NF-\u03baB target genes. Mechanistically, MKL1 acetylation served to promote MKL1 nuclear enrichment, to enhance the MKL1-NF-\u03baB interaction, and to stabilize the binding of MKL1 on target promoters.

     "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL and chylomicrons in the circulation. Mutations in LPL or its activator apolipoprotein C-II cause hypertriglyceridemia in humans and animal models. The levels of LPL in the liver are low but they can be strongly induced by a high cholesterol diet or by synthetic ligands of Liver X Receptors (LXRs). However, the mechanism by which LXRs activate the human LPL gene is unknown. In the present study we show that LXR agonists increased the mRNA and protein levels as well as the promoter activity of human LPL in HepG2 cells. A promoter deletion analysis defined the proximal \u2212\u00a0109/\u2212\u00a028 region, which contains a functional FOXA2 element, as essential for transactivation by ligand-activated LXR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 heterodimers. Silencing of endogenous FOXA2 in HepG2 cells by siRNAs or by treatment with insulin compromised the induction of the LPL gene by LXR agonists whereas mutations in the FOXA2 site abolished the synergistic transactivation of the LPL promoter by LXR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 and FOXA2. Physical and functional interactions between LXR\u03b1 and FOXA2 were established in vitro and ex vivo. In summary, the present study revealed a novel mechanism of human LPL gene induction by oxysterols in the liver with is based on physical and functional interactions between transcription factors LXR\u03b1 and FOXA2. This mechanism, which may not be restricted to the LPL gene, is critically important for a better understanding of the regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism in the liver under healthy or pathological states.",

Unlike conventional transgene silencing models, 35S promoter hypermethylation in gentian is species-specific and occurs irrespective of the T-DNA copy number and genomic location. Modified 35S promoters were introduced into gentian, and single-copy transgenic lines were selected for methylation analysis. Modified 35S promoter lacking a core (\u2212\u00a090) region [35S(\u0394core)] in gentian conferred hypermethylation and high levels of de novo methylation of the CpHpH/CpCpG sites in the 35S enhancer regions (\u2212\u00a0298 to \u2212\u00a0241 and \u2212\u00a0148 to \u2212\u00a085). Therefore, promoter transcription may not be an absolute requirement for the methylation machinery. In vitro, de novo methylation persisted for more than eight years. In another modified 35S promoter, two \u201cG AAG A\u201d motifs (\u2212\u00a0268 to \u2212\u00a0264 and \u2212\u00a0135 to \u2212\u00a0131) were replaced by \u201cG TTC A\u201d in the two highly de novo methylated regions. It did not support hypermethylation and showed transgene expression. A 64-bp fragment of the 35S enhancer region (\u2212\u00a0148 to \u2212\u00a085) was introduced into gentian and the resultant transgenic lines analyzed. The 64-bp region exhibited hypermethylation at the CpG/CpWpG sites, but the CpHpH/CpCpG methylation frequency was lower than those of the unmodified 35S- and 35S(\u0394core) promoters. Nevertheless, a distinct CpHpH/CpCpG methylation peak was found in the 64-bp region of all single-copy transgenic lines. These results suggest that the 64-bp region may contain an element required for 35S methylation but insufficient for high de novo methylation compared with those in the unmodified 35S and 35S(\u0394core) promoters.",

The current study reveals that EPA modulates the exquisite interplay of interaction of CREB1 with the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) and E2A family members, thereby delivering mechanistic insights into specific neural differentiation program. In this scenario, our work provides evidence for the capability of CREB1 to sequester ID:E2A family members in brain tissues and neural differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) through formation of a [CREB1]2:ID2:E47 tetrameric complex.In essence, the molecular function of CREB1 is to dynamically regulate the location-specific assembly or disassembly of basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH):HLH protein complexes to mediate the activation of neural/glial target genes. Together, these findings support the one-to-many binding mechanism of CREB1 and indicate that EPA treatment potentiates the integration of CREB dependent signaling with HLH/bHLH transcriptional network, adding specificity to the CREB1-mediated gene regulation during neural/glial differentiation. Our current research on the EPA-CREB axis could reveal new molecular targets for treating neurogenerative disease.",

However, the transcriptional regulation of these genes, especially whether there exist any enhancers and their roles during the IFN induction process remain elusive. Here, through public data mining, episomal luciferase reporter assay and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35\u00a0kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter upregulating the IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 bound to the enhancer with the treatment of IFN and was indispensable for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, using chromosome conformation capture technique, we revealed that the IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and constitutively looped to the distal enhancer through long-range interactions in both HEK293 and A549 cells, providing structural basis for coordinated regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the enhancer. Finally, we showed that in vivo truncation of the enhancer impaired IFN-induced resistance to influenza A virus (IAV) infection.

     "abstract": "LIM-domain proteins, containing multiple cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motifs, have been shown to play diverse roles in several cellular processes. A common theme is that they mediate important protein-protein interactions that are key to their function. Androgen receptor-associated protein 55 (ARA55) belongs to this family of bridging proteins containing four C-terminal LIM domains. It has a dual role with functions both at focal adhesions and in the nucleus, apparently shuttling between the two compartments. In the present work, we have expanded our understanding of its nuclear functions by showing that it interacts with three nuclear regulators not previously linked to ARA55. We first identified ARA55 as a novel interaction partner of the nuclear kinase HIPK1 and found that ARA55, like HIPK1, also interacts with the transcription factor c-Myb. In search of a function for these associations, we observed that the coactivator p300 not only binds to c-Myb, but to ARA55 as well. When combined, c-Myb, p300, HIPK1 and ARA55 caused strong synergistic activation of a chromatinized reporter gene. In parallel, all partners, including p300, were efficiently recruited to chromatin at the c-Myb-bound promoter. Consistent with this cooperation, we found that c-Myb and ARA55 share a common set of target genes in an osteosarcoma cellular context. We propose that ARA55 and HIPK1 assist c-Myb in recruiting the coactivator and acetyltransferase p300 to chromatin.",

The last step to govern production of nascent peptides is during the process of mRNA translation. mRNA translation is controlled by many translation initiation factors that are susceptible to post-translational modifications. Here we report that one of the translation initiation factors, eIF4E, is phosphorylated by Mammalian Ste20-like kinase (MST1). Upon phosphorylation, eIF4E weakly interacts with the 5\u2032 CAP to inhibit mRNA translation. Simultaneously, active polyribosome is more associated with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Moreover, the linc00689-derived micropeptide, STORM ( S tress- and T NF-\u03b1-activated OR F M icropeptide), is triggered by TNF-\u03b1-induced and MST1-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation, which exhibits molecular mimicry of SRP19 and, thus, competes for 7SL RNA. Our findings have uncovered a novel function of MST1 in mRNA and lncRNA translation by direct phosphorylation of eIF4E. This novel signaling pathway will provide new platforms for regulation of mRNA translation via post-translational protein modification.",

Transcription of stress responsive genes is altered in gim2\u0394, gim3\u0394 and gim6\u0394 mutants: TRX2 gene is induced in these mutants but with a profile diverging from type cells, whereas CTT1 and HSP26 fail to be induced. Remaining gim\u0394 mutants display stress transcript abundance comparable to wild type cells. No alteration in the nuclear localization of the transcriptional activators for TRX2 (Yap1) and CTT1/HSP26 (Msn2) was observed in gim2\u0394. In accordance with TRX2 induction, RNA polymerase II occupancy at TRX2 discriminates the wild type from gim2\u0394 and gim6\u0394. In contrast, RNA polymerase II occupancy at CTT1 is similar in wild type and gim2\u0394, but higher in gim6\u0394. The absence of active RNA polymerase II at CTT1 in gim2\u0394, but not in wild type and gim1\u0394, explains the respective CTT1 transcript outputs. Altogether our results put forward the need of Gim2, Gim3 and Gim6 in oxidative and osmotic stress activated transcription; others Gim proteins are dispensable.

In addition, we applied a model complex obtained in the same way with eRF1\u2022eRF3\u2022GMPPNP.

Our cross-linking data allowed determining locations of the 3\u2032-terminus of the P site tRNA relatively the eRF1 M domain and of the mRNA stop signal toward the N domain and the ribosomal decoding site at the nucleotide-peptide resolution level. Our results indicate that locations of these components do not change after peptide release up to post-termination pre-recycling state, and the positioning of the mRNA stop signal remains similar to that when eRF1 recognizes it. Besides, we found that in all the complexes studied eRF1 shielded the N-terminal part of ribosomal protein eS30 from the interaction with the nucleotide adjacent to stop codon observed with pre-termination ribosome free of eRFs.

Although random spatio-temporal fluctuations reshuffle continuously the chromatin landscape, each heterochromatic territory maintains its dynamic profile, exhibiting robustness and resembling a quasi-steady state. Transitions towards less dynamic states are detected sporadically as ESCs downregulate Nanog and exit the self-renewal phase. These transitions increase in frequency after lineage-commitment, but evolve differently depending on cellular context and transcriptional status.

Except for muscle specific regulators, few miRNAs were proved to coordinate this complex process. Here, we reported that miR-16 inhibited myoblast proliferation and promoted myoblast apoptosis by directly targeting Bcl2 and FOXO1. The expression level of miR-16 was significantly decreased in the hypertrophic pectoral muscle compared to the normal pectoral muscle in chicken. In vitro, elevating miR-16 significantly inhibited myoblast proliferation and promoted myoblast apoptosis, resulting in about 11.2% cells arrested in G1 phase and 12.3% apoptotic cells in the early stage. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed Bcl2 and FOXO1 as direct targets of miR-16. Consist to the effect of miR-16 on myogenesis, specific inhibition of Bcl2 or FOXO1 significantly suppressed myoblast proliferation and induced myoblast apoptosis, indicating that both Bcl2 and FOXO1 contributed to miR-16 regulatory function in myogenesis. Interestingly, FOXO1, as the core target, mediated multiple growth-related pathways induced by miR-16 such as PI3K-AKT-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that 234 annotated genes bound by FOXO1 in the early-differentiated myoblasts, which were significantly enriched in myogenic proliferation, death and hypotrophy.

In differentiated cells and brain tissues there is a general use of distal polyadenylation signals, originating mRNAs with longer 3\u2032 UTRs, in contrast with proliferating cells and other tissues such as testis, where most mRNAs contain shorter 3\u2032 UTRs. Although cell type and state are relevant in many biological processes, how these mechanisms occur in specific brain cell types is still poorly understood. Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases with essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including cell differentiation and axonal growth. Here we used different brain cell types and tissues, including oligodendrocytes, microglia, astrocytes, cortical and hippocampal neurons, and optical nerve, to show that classical Rho GTPases express mRNAs with alternative 3\u2032 UTRs differently, by gene- and cell- specific mechanisms. In particular, we show that Rac1 originate mRNA isoforms with longer 3\u2032 UTRs specifically during neurite growth of cortical, but not hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the longest Rac1 3\u2032 UTR is necessary for driving the mRNA to the neurites, and also for neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons. Our results indicate that the expression of Rac1 longer 3\u2032 UTR is a gene and cell-type specific mechanism in the brain, with a new physiological function in cortical neuron differentiation.",

Here, we demonstrate that CK2-dependent phosphorylation positively regulates Msn2/4, the general stress response transcriptional activators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in response to various types of environmental stress conditions. CK2 overexpression elicits hyperactivation of Msn2/4, whereas deletion of one of the CK2 catalytic subunits, especially CKA2, leads to reduced transcriptional activity of Msn2/4 in response to glucose starvation, H2O2, and lactic acid. The CKA2 deletion mutant also shows increased stress sensitivity. CK2 phosphorylates Ser194 and Ser638 in Msn2 and replacement of Ser638 with alanine leads to reduced Msn2 activity upon stress and reduced tolerance to H2O2 and lactic acid. CKA2 deletion mutant shows shorter nuclear retention time of Msn2 upon lactic acid stress, suggesting that CK2 might regulate nuclear localization of Msn2. However, Msn2S194A, S638A mutant shows normal nuclear import and export patterns upon stress, suggesting that CK2 might positively regulate the general stress response not only by direct phosphorylation of Msn2/4, but also by regulating cellular translocation machinery.",

Understanding the dynamics of MBD1 binding to nucleosomal DNA is crucial, but the molecular interactions between MBD1 and chromatin remain elusive. In this study, we found the binding of MBD1 to nucleosomes demonstrates sequence preferences depending on the position of the methyl groups on the nucleosome. Specifically, binding was favored at meCpG sites in the dyad proximal region and facing towards the histone octamers. At locations where the meCpG sites face away from the histone octamer, the binding affinity was significantly lower. Interestingly, the binding of \u0394MBD1 at methylated CpG sites facing away from histone octamers induces conformational changes of nucleosomes, resulting in a more \u201copen\u201d conformation. The biological implication of DNA methylation is thus likely to be synergistically regulated via DNA sequences contents and their nucleosome-positioning patterns based on our in vitro findings.",

However, the mechanism of EVI1-mediated leukemogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Previously, by characterizing the EVI1 promoter, we have shown that RUNX1 and ELK1 directly regulate EVI1 transcription. Intriguingly, bioinformatic analysis of the EVI1 promoter region identified the presence of several EVI1 potential binding sites. Thus, we hypothesized that EVI1 could bind to these sites regulating its own transcription. In this study, we show that there is a functional interaction between EVI1 and its promoter, and that the different EVI1 isoforms (EVI1-145\u00a0kDa, EVI1-\u0394324 and MDS1-EVI1) regulate the transcription of EVI1 transcripts through distinct promoter regions. Moreover, we determine that the EVI1-145\u00a0kDa isoform activates EVI1 transcription, whereas EVI1-\u0394324 and MDS1-EVI1 act as repressors. Finally, we demonstrate that these EVI1 isoforms are involved in cell transformation; functional experiments show that EVI1-145\u00a0kDa prolongs the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; conversely, MDS1-EVI1 repressed hematopoietic stem and progenitor colony replating capacity. We demonstrate for the first time that EVI1 acts as a regulator of its own expression, highlighting the complex regulation of EVI1, and open new directions to better understand the mechanisms of EVI1 overexpressing leukemias.",

Here we provide evidence that protein arginine methylation of the yeast SR-/hnRNP-like protein Npl3 plays a role in facilitating efficient splicing of the SUS1 intron that harbors a non-consensus 5\u2032 splice site and branch site. In yeast cells lacking the major protein arginine methyltransferase HMT1, we observed a change in the co-transcriptional recruitment of the U1 snRNP subunit Snp1 and Npl3 to pre-mRNAs harboring both consensus (ECM33 and ASC1) and non-consensus (SUS1) 5\u2032 splice site and branch site. Using an Npl3 mutant that phenocopies wild-type Npl3 when expressed in \u0394hmt1 cells, we showed that the arginine methylation of Npl3 is responsible for this. Examination of pre-mRNA splicing efficiency in these mutants reveals the requirement of Npl3 methylation for the efficient splicing of SUS1 intron 1, but not of ECM33 or ASC1. Changing the 5\u2032 splice site and branch site in SUS1 intron 1 to the consensus form restored splicing efficiency in an Hmt1-independent manner. Results from biochemical studies show that methylation of Npl3 promotes its optimal association with the U1 snRNP through its association with the U1 snRNP subunit Mud1. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Hmt1, via arginine methylation of Npl3, facilitates U1 snRNP engagement with the pre-mRNA to promote usage of non-consensus splice sites by the splicing machinery.",

Hyperadenylation of RNA is known to be associated with nuclear retention, but the cause-consequence relationship between hyperadenylation and regulation of RNA nuclear export is still unclear. We compared polyadenylation status between normal and expanded DMPK transcripts in muscle cells and tissues derived from unaffected individuals and patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. DM1 etiology is characterized by an almost complete block of nuclear export of DMPK transcripts carrying a long (CUG)n repeat, including aberrant sequestration of RNA-binding proteins. We show here by use of cell fractionation, RNA size separation and analysis of poly(A) tail length that a considerable fraction of transcripts from the normal DMPK allele is also retained in the nucleus (~30%). They carry poly(A) tails with an unusually broad length distribution, ranging between a few dozen to >500 adenosine residues. Remarkably, expanded DMPK (CUG)n transcripts from the mutant allele, almost exclusively nuclear, carry equally long poly(A) tails. Our findings thus suggest that nuclear retention may be a common feature of regulation of DMPK RNA expression. The typical forced nuclear residence of expanded DMPK transcripts affects this regulation in tissues of DM1 patients, but not through hyperadenylation.",

MHC genes are crucial in immune response and show peculiar expression patterns. Among other conserved elements on MHC promoters, an NF-Y binding CCAAT box was found to contribute to MHC transcriptional regulation. NF-Y along with other DNA binding factors assembles in a stereospecific manner to form a multiprotein scaffold, the MHC enhanceosome, which is necessary but not sufficient to drive transcription. Transcriptional activation is achieved by the recruitment of yet another factor, the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA).

Subsequently, the CBC was found to sense reactive oxygen species through oxidative modifications of cysteine residues in order to mediate redox regulation. Moreover, via interaction with the iron-sensing bZIP transcription factor HapX, the CBC was shown to mediate adaptation to both iron starvation and iron excess. Due to the control of various pathways in primary and secondary metabolism the CBC is of crucial importance for fungal virulence in both animal and plant hosts as well as antifungal resistance. Consequently, CBC-mediated control affects biological processes that are of high interest in biotechnology, agriculture and infection medicine.

     "abstract": "The recently determined crystal structures of the sequence-specific transcription factor NF-Y have illuminated the structural mechanism underlying transcription at the CCAAT box. NF-Y is a trimeric protein complex composed by the NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. NF-YB and NF-YC contain a histone-like domain and assemble on a head-to-tail fashion to form a dimer, which provides the structural scaffold for the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone binding (mimicking the nucleosome H2A/H2B\u2013DNA assembly) and for the interaction with NF-YA. The NF-YA subunit hosts two structurally extended \u03b1-helices; one is involved in NF-YB/NF-YC binding and the other inserts deeply into the DNA minor groove, providing exquisite sequence-specificity for recognition and binding of the CCAAT box. The analysis of these structural data is expected to serve as a powerful guide for future experiments aimed at understanding the role of post-translational modification at NF-Y regulation sites and to unravel the three-dimensional architecture of higher order complexes formed between NF-Y and other transcription factors that act synergistically for transcription activation. Moreover, these structures represent an excellent starting point to challenge the formation of a stable hybrid nucleosome between NF-Y and core histone proteins, and to rationalize the fine molecular details associated with the wide combinatorial association of plant NF-Y subunits.

Drosophila NF-Y (dNF-Y) consists of three subunits dNF-YA, dNF-YB and dNF-YC. In some tissues, dNF-YC-related protein Mes4 may replace dNF-YC in dNF-Y complex. Studies with eye imaginal disc-specific dNF-Y-knockdown flies revealed that dNF-Y positively regulates the sevenless gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, a component of the ERK pathway and negatively regulates the Sensless gene encoding a transcription factor to ensure proper development of R7 photoreceptor cells together with proper R7 axon targeting. dNF-Y also controls the Drosophila Bcl-2 (debcl) to regulate apoptosis. In thorax development, dNF-Y is necessary for both proper Drosophila JNK (basket) expression and JNK signaling activity that is responsible for thorax development. Drosophila p53 gene was also identified as one of the dNF-Y target genes in this system. C. elegans contains two forms of NF-YA subunit, CeNF-YA1 and CeNF-YA2. C. elegans NF-Y (CeNF-Y) therefore consists of CeNF-YB, CeNF-YC and either CeNF-YA1 or CeNF-YA2. CeNF-Y negatively regulates expression of the Hox gene egl-5 (ortholog of Drosophila Abdominal-B) that is involved in tail patterning. CeNF-Y also negatively regulates expression of the tbx-2 gene that is essential for development of the pharyngeal muscles, specification of neural cell fate and adaptation in olfactory neurons. Negative regulation of the expression of egl-5 and tbx-2 by CeNF-Y provides new insight into the physiological meaning of negative regulation of gene expression by NF-Y during development.

Intriguingly, recent evidence suggests that NF-Ys are frequently associated with other groups of TFs, expanding the potential NF-Y combinatorial complexity. Further, information regarding the regulation of individual NF-Y subunits at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level is beginning to emerge. In this review, we will identify developing trends within the NF-Y field and discuss recent progress towards a better understanding of NF-Y function, molecular action, and regulation in the context of Arabidopsis.

     "abstract": "NF-Ys are heterotrimeric transcription factors composed by the NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC subunits. In plants, NF-Y subunits are encoded by multigene families whose members show structural and functional diversifications. An increasing number of NF-Y genes has been shown to play key roles during different stages of root nodule and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, as well as during the interaction of plants with pathogenic microorganisms. Individual members of the NF-YA and NF-YB families have also been implicated in the development of primary and lateral roots. In addition, different members of the NF-YA and NF-YB gene families from mono- and di-cotyledonous plants have been involved in plant responses to water and nutrient scarcity. This review presents the most relevant and striking results concerning these NF-Y subunits. A phylogenetic analysis of the functionally characterized NF-Y genes revealed that, across plant species, NF-Y proteins functioning in the same biological process tend to belong to common phylogenetic groups. Finally, we discuss the forthcoming challenges of plant NF-Y research, including the detailed dissection of expression patterns, the elucidation of functional specificities as well as the characterization of the potential NF-Y-mediated epigenetic mechanisms by which they control the expression of their target genes.

We will discuss how the diurnal rhythms of its transcription and protein accumulation are generated, and how the protein engages into multiple complexes to control production of a systemic flowering signal.

To accomplish some of their functions within the cell, RNA molecules undergo hundreds of chemical modifications from which N6-methyladenosine (m6A), inosine (I), pseudouridine (\u03c8) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) have been described in eukaryotic mRNA. Interestingly, the m6A modification was shown to be reversible, adding novel layers of regulation of gene expression through what is now recognized as epitranscriptomics. The development of molecular mapping strategies coupled to next generation sequencing allowed the identification of thousand of modified transcripts in different tissues and under different physiological conditions such as viral infections. As intracellular parasites, viruses are confronted to cellular RNA modifying enzymes and, as a consequence, viral RNA can be chemically modified at some stages of the replication cycle. This review focuses on the chemical modifications of viral RNA and the impact that these modifications have on viral gene expression and the output of infection. A special emphasis is given to m6A, which was recently shown to play important yet controversial roles in different steps of the HIV-1, HCV and ZIKV replication cycles.",

In this study, we report that in THP-1 human monocytes the PU.1 cistrome comprises 122,319 genomic sites. Interestingly, at 6498 (5.3%) of these loci PU.1 binding was significantly modulated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). In most cases 1,25(OH)2D3 increased PU.1 association, which correlated strongly with VDR co-location and overlap ratios for canonical DR3-type VDR binding sites. Genome-wide 6488 sites associating both with PU.1 and VDR as well as 5649 non-VDR overlapping, 1,25(OH)2D3-sensitive PU.1 loci represent the PU.1-VDR crosstalk and can be described by four gene regulatory scenarios, each. Chromatin accessibility was the major discriminator between these models. The location of the PU.1 binding loci in open chromatin coincided with a significantly smaller mean distance to the closest 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene. PU.1 knockdown indicated that the pioneer factor is relevant for the transcriptional activation of 1,25(OH)2D3 target genes but its impact differed in magnitude and orientation. In conclusion, PU.1 is an important modulator of VDR signaling in monocytes, including but also exceeding its role as a pioneer factor, but we found no evidence for a direct interaction of both proteins.",

Here we analyzed chromatin organization in eight CTCF sites around the \u03b2-globin locus by 3C assay and explored the roles of erythroid specific transcription activator GATA-1 and KLF1 in it. It was found five CTCF sites convergent to the locus interact with each other in erythroid K562 cells but not in non-erythroid 293 cells. The interaction was decreased by depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. It accompanied reductions of CTCF and Rad21 occupancies and loss of active chromatin structure at the CTCF sites. Furthermore Rad21 occupancy was reduced in the \u03b2-globin locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive sites (HSs) by the depletion of GATA-1 or KLF1. The role of GATA-1 in interaction between CTCF sites was revealed by its ectopic expression in 293 cells and by deletion of a GATA-1 site in the LCR HS2.

     "publication date": "04-2017",
     "abstract": "Although Men1 is a well-known tumour suppressor gene, little is known about the functions of Menin, the protein it encodes for. Since few years, numerous publications support a major role of Menin in the control of epigenetics gene regulation. While Menin interaction with MLL complex favours transcriptional activation of target genes through H3K4me3 marks, Menin also represses gene expression via mechanisms involving the Polycomb repressing complex (PRC). Interestingly, Ezh2, the PRC-methyltransferase that catalyses H3K27me3 repressive marks and Menin have been shown to co-occupy a large number of promoters. However, lack of binding between Menin and Ezh2 suggests that another member of the PRC complex is mediating this indirect interaction. Having found that ActivinB - a TGF\u03b2 superfamily member encoded by the Inhbb gene - is upregulated in insulinoma tumours caused by Men1 invalidation, we hypothesize that Menin could directly participate in the epigenetic-repression of Inhbb gene expression. Using Animal model and cell lines, we report that loss of Menin is directly associated with ActivinB-induced expression both in vivo and in vitro. Our work further reveals that ActivinB expression is mediated through a direct modulation of H3K27me3 marks on the Inhbb locus in Menin-KO cell lines. More importantly, we show that Menin binds on the promoter of Inhbb gene where it favours the recruitment of Ezh2 via an indirect mechanism involving Akt-phosphorylation. Our data suggests therefore that Menin could take an important part to the Ezh2-epigenetic repressive landscape in many cells and tissues through its capacity to modulate Akt phosphorylation.",

     "abstract": "Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are critical for regeneration of multiple tissues. Epigenetic mechanisms are fundamental regulators of lineage specification and cell fate, and as such, we addressed the question of which epigenetic modifications characterize the transition of nascent MSCs to a tissue specific MSC-derived phenotype. By profiling the temporal changes of seven histone marks correlated to gene expression during proliferation, early commitment, matrix deposition, and mineralization stages, we identified distinct epigenetic mechanisms that regulate transcriptional programs necessary for tissue-specific phenotype development. Patterns of stage-specific enrichment of histone modifications revealed distinct modes of repression and activation of gene expression that would not be detected using single endpoint analysis. We discovered that at commitment, H3K27me3 is removed from genes that are upregulated and is not acquired on downregulated genes. Additionally, we found that the absence of H3K4me3 modification at promoters defined a subset of osteoblast-specific upregulated genes, indicating that acquisition of acetyl modifications drive activation of these genes. Significantly, loss or gain of H3K36me3 was the primary predictor of dynamic changes in temporal gene expression. Using unsupervised pattern discovery analysis the signature of osteogenic-related histone modifications identified novel functional cis regulatory modules associated with enhancer regions that control tissue-specific genes. Our work provides a cornerstone to understand the epigenetic regulation of transcriptional programs that are important for MSC lineage commitment and lineage, as well as insights to facilitate MSC-based therapeutic interventions.",

Previously, we identified a dual histone reader ZMYND8 (zinc finger MYND (Myeloid, Nervy and DEAF-1)-type containing 8), to be a novel target of ATRA. In the present study, we attempted to decipher the detail mechanism of its transcription regulation. ATRA can reprogram the epigenetic landscape in the upstream regulatory region of ZMYND8 thereby promoting its expression. Interestingly, there is a unique H3K27Me3 to H3K27Ac switch upon ATRA-treatment. We show here that ATRA causes dynamic changes in recruitment of transcription factor YY1 in concert with HDAC1 at ZMYND8 promoter. Further, we show that ATRA treatment triggers an anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells through regulation of ZMYND8 expression. Subsequently, in 4T1-induced syngenic tumor mouse model, ATRA injection caused significant upregulation of ZMYND8. Overall our findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying ATRA-mediated changes in ZMYND8 expression which, in turn, activates the anti-proliferative program in a cancer cell. Thus, histone reader mediated modulation of epigenetic language could play a significant role in retinoid based therapeutic strategy which is well exploited to combat tumor growth.",

This study contributes to the state of art knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying yeast stress response to arsenate as it provides the genetic and biochemical evidences that Yap8, through cysteine residues 132, 137, and 274, is the sensor of presence of arsenate in the cytosol. Moreover, it is here reported for the first time the essential role of the Mediator complex in the transcriptional activation of ACR2 by Yap8. Based on our data, we propose an order-of-function map to recapitulate the sequence of events taking place in cells injured with arsenate. Modification of the sulfhydryl state of these cysteines converts Yap8 in its activated form, triggering the recruitment of the Mediator complex to the ACR2/ACR3 promoter, through the interaction with the tail subunit Med2. The Mediator complex then transfers the regulatory signals conveyed by Yap8 to the core transcriptional machinery, which culminates with TBP occupancy, ACR2 upregulation and cell adaptation to arsenate stress. Additional co-factors are required for the transcriptional activation of ACR2 by Yap8, particularly the nucleosome remodeling activity of SWI/SNF and SAGA complexes.",

Markov state analysis was applied to identify major states and estimate kinetic rates for transitions between those states.

SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase which activates HBV transcription by promoting the activity of cellular transcription factors and coactivators. How SIRT1 and viral transactivator X protein (HBx) might affect each other remains to be clarified. In this study we show synergy and mutual dependence between SIRT1 and HBx in the activation of HBV transcription. All human sirtuins SIRT1 through SIRT7 activated HBV gene expression. The steady-state levels of SIRT1 protein were elevated in HBV-infected liver tissues and HBV-replicating hepatoma cells. SIRT1 interacted with HBx and potentiated HBx transcriptional activity on precore promoter and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) likely through a deacetylase-independent mechanism, leading to more robust production of cccDNA, pregenomic RNA and surface antigen. SIRT1 and HBx proteins were more abundant when both were expressed. SIRT1 promoted the recruitment of HBx as well as cellular transcriptional factors and coactivators such as PGC-1\u03b1 and FXR\u03b1 to cccDNA. Depletion of SIRT1 suppressed HBx recruitment. On the other hand, SIRT1 recruitment to cccDNA was compromised when HBx was deficient. Whereas pharmaceutical agonists of SIRT1 such as resveratrol activated HBV transcription, small-molecule inhibitors of SIRT1 including sirtinol and Ex527 exhibited anti-HBV activity. Taken together, our findings revealed not only the interplay between SIRT1 and HBx in the activation of HBV transcription but also new strategies and compounds for developing antivirals against HBV.",

     "abstract": "Brain aging is characterized by progressive loss of plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) and its activator \u2013 calmodulin (CaM), but the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unresolved. CaM encoded by three genes Calm1, Calm2, Calm3, works to translate Ca2\u00a0+ signal into changes in frequently opposite cellular activities. This unique function allows CaM to affect gene expression via stimulation of calcineurin (CaN) and its downstream target \u2013 nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and to terminate Ca2\u00a0+ signal by stimulation of its extrusion. PMCA, which exists in four isoforms PMCA1\u20134, may in turn shape the pattern of Ca2\u00a0+ transients and control CaN activity by its direct binding. Therefore, the interplay between PMCA, CaM and CaN/NFAT is highly plausible. To verify that, we used differentiated PC12 cells with reduced expression of PMCA2 or PMCA3 to mimic the potential changes in aged brain. Manipulation in PMCAs level decreased CaM protein in PMCA2 or PMCA3-reduced lines that was accompanied by down-regulation of Calm1 and Calm2 in both lines, but Calm3 only in PMCA2-reduced cells. Further studies showed substantially higher NFATc2 nuclear accumulation and increased NFAT transcriptional activity. Blocking of CaN/NFAT signalling resulted in almost full CaM recovery, mainly due to up-regulation of Calm2 and Calm3 genes. Moreover, higher occupancy of Calm2 and Calm3 promoters by NFATc2 and increased expression of these genes in response to NFATc2 silencing were demonstrated in PMCA2 and PMCA3-reduced lines. Our results indicate that decrease in CaM level in response to PMCAs downregulation can be driven by CaN/NFAT pathway.",

In this review, we discuss the latest advances in our understanding of these diverse mechanisms at the cell-, tissue- and organismal-level. We also highlight the dynamics, complexity and non-linear nature of their regulatory roles in metabolic decision making, and deliberate some of the outstanding questions and challenges in this rapidly expanding field.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol (RESV) is a natural polyphenolic compound endowed with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, as well as pro-apoptotic activities that make it a potential anti-tumor compound. Here we show that RESV counteracts the TGF-\u03b2-induced Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) phenotype in mammary gland cells and affects the alternative exon usage of pre-mRNAs that encode crucial factors in adhesion and migration \u2014including CD44, ENAH, and FGFR2\u2014 in a panel of immortalized and transformed mammary gland cells. RESV causes a shift from the mesenchymal-specific forms of these factors to the respective epithelial forms and increases the expression of the RNA-binding proteins KHSRP and hnRNPA1. From a mechanistic point of view, we show that the combined silencing of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 prevents the RESV-dependent inclusion of the epithelial-type exons in the Cd44 pre-mRNA. Our findings support an unexpected regulatory mechanism where RESV limits EMT by controlling gene expression at post-transcriptional level.",

Among these modifiers are ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, where the SWI/SNF complex is the founding member. It has been observed that High Mobility Group (HMG) proteins can influence the activity of a number of these chromatin remodelers. In this context, we have previously demonstrated that the yeast HMG proteins Nhp6 and Hmo1 can stimulate SWI/SNF activity. Here, we studied the genome-wide binding patterns of Nhp6, Hmo1 and the SWI/SNF complex, finding that most of gene promoters presenting high occupancy of this complex also display high enrichment of these HMG proteins. Using deletion mutant strains we demonstrate that binding of SWI/SNF is significantly reduced at numerous genomic locations by deletion of NHP6 and/or deletion of HMO1. Moreover, alterations in the nucleosome landscape take place at gene promoters undergoing reduced SWI/SNF binding. Additional analyses show that these effects also correlate with alterations in transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that, besides the ability to stimulate SWI/SNF activity, these HMG proteins are able to assist the loading of this complex onto gene regulatory regions.",

     "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a major role in the hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG) from circulating TG-rich lipoproteins. The role of LPL in the liver has been controversial but recent studies in mice with liver LPL overexpression or deficiency have revealed important new roles of the enzyme in glucose and lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to identify regulatory elements and factors that control the transcription of the human LPL gene in hepatocytes. Deletion analysis of the human LPL promoter revealed that the proximal region which harbors a binding site for the forkhead box transcription factor FOXA2/HNF-3\u03b2 at position \u2212\u00a047/\u2212\u00a040 is important for its hepatic cell activity. Silencing of FOXA2 in HepG2 cells reduced the LPL mRNA and protein levels. Direct binding of FOXA2 to the novel binding site was established in vitro and ex vivo. Mutagenesis of the FOXA2 site reduced the basal activity and abolished the FOXA2-mediated transactivation of the LPL promoter. \u0399nsulin decreased LPL mRNA levels in HepG2 cells and this was associated with phosphorylation of AKT and nuclear export of FOXA2. In summary, the data of the present study combined with previous findings on the role of FOXA2 in HDL metabolism and gluconeogenesis, suggest that FOXA2 is a key regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis in the adult liver. Understanding the mechanisms by which FOXA2 exerts its functions in hepatocytes may open the way to novel therapeutic strategies for patients with metabolic diseases such as dyslipidemia, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.",

Both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs of CSF-1 mRNA are involved in post-transcriptional regulation. In CSF-1 mRNA, a small hairpin loop structure is predicted to form at the extreme 5\u2032 end (2\u201321\u00a0nt) of the 5\u2032UTR. Nucleolin binds the hairpin loop structure in the 5\u2032UTR of CSF-1 mRNA and enhances translation, while removal of this hairpin loop nucleolin binding element dramatically represses translation. Thus in CSF-1 mRNA, the hairpin loop nucleolin binding element is critical for translational regulation. In addition, nucleolin interacts with the 3\u2032UTR of CSF-1 mRNA and facilitates the miRISC formation which results in poly (A) tail shortening. The overexpression of nucleolin increases the association of CSF-1 mRNA containing short poly (A)n\u00a0\u2264\u00a026, with polyribosomes. Nucleolin both forms an mRNP complex with the eIF4G and CSF-1 mRNA, and is co-localized with the eIF4G in the cytoplasm further supporting nucleolin's role in translational regulation.

Although regulatory mechanisms of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L), a well-known splicing regulatory protein, have been studied in a substantial level, its role in 5\u2032SS selection is not thoroughly defined. By using a KLF6 pre-mRNA alternative splicing model, we demonstrate in this report that hnRNP L inhibits proximal 5\u2032SS but promotes two consecutive distal 5\u2032SS splicing, antagonizing SRSF1 roles in KLF6 pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, three consecutive CA-rich sequences in a CA cassette immediately upstream of the proximal 5\u2032SS are all required for hnRNP L functions. Importantly, the CA-cassette locations on the proximal exon do not affect hnRNP L roles. We further show that the proximal 5\u2032SS but not the two distal 5\u2032SSs are essential for hnRNP L activities. Notably, in a Bcl-x pre-mRNA model that contains two alternative 5\u2032SS but includes CA-rich elements at distal exon, we demonstrate that hnRNP L also suppresses nearby 5\u2032SS activation. Taken together, we conclude that hnRNP L suppresses 5\u2032SS selection through multiple exonic motifs.",

Loss of Fhit protein expression promotes accumulation of DNA damage, affects apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, though molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations have not been fully elucidated. Initiation of genome instability directly follows Fhit loss and the associated reduced Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1) protein expression. The effects on TK1 of Fhit knockdown and Fhit induction in the current study confirmed the role of Fhit in regulating TK1 expression. Changes in Fhit expression did not impact TK1 protein turnover or transcription from the TK1 promoter, nor steady-state levels of TK1 mRNA or turnover. Polysome profile analysis showed that up-regulated Fhit expression resulted in decreased TK1 RNA in non-translating messenger ribonucleoproteins and increased ribosome density on TK1 mRNA. Fhit does not bind RNA but its expression increased luciferase expression from a transgene bearing the TK1 5\u2032-UTR. Fhit has been reported to act as a scavenger decapping enzyme, and a similar result with a mutant (H96) that binds but does not cleave nucleoside 5\u2032,5\u2032-triphosphates suggests the impact on TK1 translation is due to its ability to modulate the intracellular level of cap-like molecules. Consistent with this, cells expressing Fhit mutants with reduced activity toward cap-like dinucleotides exhibit DNA damage resulting from TK1 deficiency, whereas cells expressing wild-type Fhit or the H96N mutant do not. The results have implications for the mechanism by which Fhit regulates TK1 mRNA, and more broadly, for its modulation of multiple functions as tumor suppressor/genome caretaker.",

RHS6-deficient cells had a marked reduction in chromatin remodeling and in intrachromosomal interactions at the Th2 locus.

     "abstract": "Despite their dynamic nature, certain chromatin marks must be maintained over the long term. This is particulary true for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation, that is involved in the maintenance of healthy differentiated cellular states by preventing inappropriate gene expression, and has been recently identified as the most efficient barrier to cellular reprogramming in nuclear transfer experiments. We propose that the capacity of the enzymes SUV39H1/2 to rebind to a minor fraction of their products, either directly or via HP1\u03b1/\u03b2, contributes to the solidity of this mark through (i) a positive feedback involved in its establishment by the mutual enforcement of H3K9me3 and SUV39H1/2 and then (ii) a negative feedback sufficient to strongly stabilize H3K9me3 heterochromatin in post-mitotic cells by generating local enzyme concentrations capable of counteracting transient bursts of demethylation. This model does not require direct molecular interactions with adjacent nucleosomes and is favoured by a series of additional mechanisms including (i) the protection of chromatin-bound SUV39H1/2 from the turnovers of soluble proteins, which can explain the uncoupling between the cellular contents in SUV39H1 mRNA and protein; (ii) the cooperative dependence on the local density of the H3K9me3 of HP1\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent heterochomatin condensation and, dispensably (iii) restricted enzyme exchanges with chromocenters confining the reactive bursts of SUV39H1/2 in heterochromatin.

The increase in the interaction of MLL and MLL4 on depletion of YY1 and the increase in the enrichment of YY1 and EZH2 upon MLL knockdown at the hPRE-PIK3C2B indicate the dual occupancy and suggest a concentration dependent enrichment of the activator or the repressor complex at hPRE-PIK3C2B.

We also show that all four hnRNP D isoforms can act as genuine splicing repressors when bound to exonic positions. The presence of an extended GRD, however, seemed to potentiate the hnRNP D silencer activity of isoforms p42 and p45.

Whereas these well-established functions are associated with ubiquitously occurring GRXs that encode variants of a CPYC or a CGFS motif in the active center, land plants also possess CCxC/S-type GRXs (named ROXYs in Arabidopsis thaliana) for which the biochemical functions are yet unknown. ROXYs and CC-type GRXs from rice and maize physically and genetically interact with bZIP transcription factors of the TGA family to control developmental and stress-associated processes. Here we demonstrate that ROXYs interact with transcriptional co-repressors of the TOPLESS (TPL) family which are related to Tup1 in fungi and Groucho/TLE in animals. In ROXYs, the functionally important conserved A(L/I)W(L/V) motif at the very C terminus mediates the interaction with TPL. A ternary TGA2/ROXY19/TPL complex is formed when all three proteins are co-expressed in yeast. Loss-of-function evidence for the role of TPL in ROXY19-mediated repression was hampered by the redundancy of the five members of the TPL gene family and developmental defects of higher order tpl mutants. As an alternative strategy, we ectopically expressed known TPL-interacting proteins in order to out-compete the amount of available TPL in transiently transformed protoplasts. Indeed, ROXY19-mediated transcriptional repression was strongly alleviated by this approach. Our data suggest a yet unrecognized function of GRXs acting as adapter proteins for the assembly of transcriptional repressor complexes on TGA-regulated target promoters.",

     "abstract": "Ixr1 is a transcriptional factor involved in the response to hypoxia, which is also related to DNA repair. It binds to DNA through its two in-tandem high mobility group box (HMG-box) domains. Each function depends on recognition of different DNA structures, B-form DNA at specific consensus sequences for transcriptional regulation, or distorted DNA, like cisplatin-DNA adducts, for DNA repair. However, the contribution of the HMG-box domains in the Ixr1 protein to the formation of different protein-DNA complexes is poorly understood. We have biophysically and biochemically characterized these interactions with specific DNA sequences from the promoters regulated by Ixr1, or with cisplatin-DNA adducts. Both HMG-boxes are necessary for transcriptional regulation, and they are not functionally interchangeable. The in-tandem arrangement of their HMG-boxes is necessary for functional folding and causes sequential cooperative binding to specific DNA sequences, with HMG-box A showing a higher contribution to DNA binding and bending than the HMG-box B. Binding of Ixr1 HMG boxes to specific DNA sequences is entropy driven, whereas binding to platinated DNA is enthalpy driven for HMG-box A and entropy driven for HMG-box B. This is the first proof that HMG-box binding to different DNA structures is associated with predictable thermodynamic differences. Based on our study, we present a model to explain the dual function of Ixr1 in the regulation of gene expression and recognition of distorted DNA structures caused by cisplatin treatment.",

MyoD is a key transcription factor during myogenesis. In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel myogenic regulator, SH2B1. Knocking down SH2B1 delays global chromatin condensation and decreases the formation of myotubes. SH2B1 interacts with histone H1 and is required for the removal of histone H1 from active transcription sites, allowing for the expressions of myogenic genes, IGF2 and MYOG. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest the requirement of SH2B1 for the induction of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation as well as the reduction of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at the promoters and/or enhancers of IGF2 and MYOG genes during myogenesis. Furthermore, SH2B1 is required for the transcriptional activity of MyoD and MyoD occupancy at the enhancer/promoter regions of IGF2 and MYOG during myogenesis. Together, this study demonstrates that SH2B1 fine-tunes global-local chromatin states, expressions of myogenic genes and ultimately promotes myogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Non-canonical DNA structures can obstruct transcription. This transcription blockage could have various biological consequences, including genomic instability and gratuitous transcription-coupled repair. Among potential structures causing transcription blockage are Holliday junctions (HJs), which can be generated as intermediates in homologous recombination or during processing of stalled replication forks. Of particular interest is the double Holliday junction (DHJ), which contains two HJs. Topological considerations impose the constraint that the total number of helical turns in the DNA duplexes between the junctions cannot be altered as long as the flanking DNA duplexes are intact. Thus, the DHJ structure should strongly resist transient unwinding during transcription; consequently, it is predicted to cause significantly stronger blockage than single HJ structures. The patterns of transcription blockage obtained for RNA polymerase II transcription in HeLa cell nuclear extracts were in accordance with this prediction. However, we did not detect transcription blockage with purified T7 phage RNA polymerase; we discuss a possible explanation for this difference. In general, our findings implicate naturally occurring Holliday junctions in transcription arrest.",

In addition, expansion of TF families has allowed functional divergence of duplicate copies, which has contributed to novel, and in some cases adaptive, traits in plants. Thus, TFs are central to the generation of the diverse plant species that we see today. Major plant agronomic traits, including those relevant to domestication, have also frequently arisen through changes in TF coding sequence or expression patterns. Here our goal is to provide an overview of plant TF evolution by first comparing the diversity of DNA-binding domains and the sizes of these domain families in plants and other eukaryotes. Because TFs are among the most highly expanded gene families in plants, the birth and death process of TFs as well as the mechanisms contributing to their retention are discussed. We also provide recent examples of how TFs have contributed to novel traits that are important in plant evolution and in agriculture.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant Gene Regulatory Mechanisms and Networks, edited by Dr. Erich Grotewold and Dr. Nathan Springer.",

This is achieved by transcription factors assembling into complexes in a combinatorial fashion, exponentially increasing the number of genes that they can target. Such an arrangement also increases the specificity and affinity for the cis-regulatory sequences required for accurate target gene expression. Superimposed on this transcription factor combinatorial arrangement is the increasing realization that histone modification marks expand the regulatory information, which is interpreted by histone readers and writers that are part of the regulatory apparatus.

This review highlights literature that provides, in part, experimental and computational techniques for characterizing TFNs. This review also outlines methodologies that have been used to mathematically model the dynamic characteristics of TFNs. We present several examples of TFNs in plants that are involved in developmental and stress response.

Given its pervasive effects on plant physiology, it is not surprising that circadian clock genes have played an important role in the domestication of crop plants and in the improvement of crop productivity. Therefore, identifying the principles governing the dynamics of the circadian gene regulatory network in plants could strongly contribute to further speed up crop improvement. Here we provide an historical as well as a current description of our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms in plants.

     "abstract": "The ability of plants to cope with abiotic environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, heat, cold or flooding relies on flexible mechanisms for re-programming gene expression. Over recent years it has become apparent that transcriptional regulation needs to be understood within its structural context. Chromatin, the assembly of DNA with histone proteins, generates a local higher-order structure that impacts on the accessibility and effectiveness of the transcriptional machinery, as well as providing a hub for multiple protein interactions. Several studies have shown that chromatin features such as histone variants and post-translational histone modifications are altered by environmental stress, and they could therefore be primary stress targets that initiate transcriptional stress responses. Alternatively, they could act downstream of stress-induced transcription factors as an integral part of transcriptional activity. A few experimental studies have addressed this \u2018chicken-and-egg\u2019 problem in plants and other systems, but to date the causal relationship between dynamic chromatin changes and transcriptional responses under stress is still unclear. In this review we have collated the existing information on concurrent epigenetic and transcriptional responses of plants to abiotic stress, and we have assessed the evidence using a simple theoretical framework of causality scenarios.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant Gene Regulatory Mechanisms and Networks, edited by Dr. Erich Grotewold and Dr. Nathan Springer.",

Enhancers are difficult to identify because of their unpredictable positions relative to their cognate promoters. Remarkably, only a handful of enhancers have been identified in plant species largely due to the lack of general approaches for enhancer identification. Extensive genomic and epigenomic research in mammalian species has revealed that the genomic locations of enhancers can be predicted based on the binding sites of transcriptional co-factors and several distinct features associated with open chromatin.

     "abstract": "RNA-directed chromatin modification that includes cytosine methylation silences transposable elements in both plants and mammals, contributing to genome defense and stability. In Arabidopsis thaliana, most RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is guided by small RNAs derived from double-stranded precursors synthesized at cytosine-methylated loci by nuclear multisubunit RNA Polymerase IV (Pol IV), in close partnership with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RDR2. These small RNAs help keep transposons transcriptionally inactive. However, if transposons escape silencing, and are transcribed by multisubunit RNA polymerase II (Pol II), their mRNAs can be recognized and degraded, generating small RNAs that can also guide initial DNA methylation, thereby enabling subsequent Pol IV-RDR2 recruitment. In both pathways, the small RNAs find their target sites by interacting with longer noncoding RNAs synthesized by multisubunit RNA Polymerase V (Pol V). Despite a decade of progress, numerous questions remain concerning the initiation, synthesis, processing, size and features of the RNAs that drive RdDM. Here, we review recent insights, questions and controversies concerning RNAs produced by Pols IV and V, and their functions in RdDM.

Differences in the sequence context of individual sites are established, maintained, and interpreted by differing molecular pathways. Varying patterns of methylation within genes and surrounding sequences are associated with a continuous range of expression differences, from silencing to constitutive expression. These often-subtle differences have been pieced together from years of effort, but have taken off with the advent of methods for assessing methylation across entire genomes. Recognizing these patterns and identifying underlying causes is essential for understanding the function of DNA methylation and its systems-wide contribution to a range of processes in plant genomes.

     "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a major portion of many plant genomes and bursts of TE movements cause novel genomic variation within species. In order to maintain proper gene function, plant genomes have evolved a variety of mechanisms to tolerate the presence of TEs within or near genes. Here, we review our understanding of the interactions between TEs and gene expression in plants by assessing three ways that transposons can influence gene expression. First, there is growing evidence that TE insertions within introns or untranslated regions of genes are often tolerated and have minimal impact on expression level or splicing. However, there are examples in which TE insertions within genes can result in aberrant or novel transcripts. Second, TEs can provide novel alternative promoters, which can lead to new expression patterns or original coding potential of an alternate transcript. Third, TE insertions near genes can influence regulation of gene expression through a variety of mechanisms. For example, TEs may provide novel cis-acting regulatory sites behaving as enhancers or insert within existing enhancers to influence transcript production. Alternatively, TEs may change chromatin modifications in regions near genes, which in turn can influence gene expression levels. Together, the interactions of genes and TEs provide abundant evidence for the role of TEs in changing basic functions within plant genomes beyond acting as latent genomic elements or as simple insertional mutagens.

Advances in DNA sequencing technology and genomics have allowed scientists to generate genome sequences and transcriptomics data for numerous model plant species. This information is publicly available and presents a valuable tool to introduce undergraduate students to the fundamental concepts of gene expression in the context of modern quantitative biology and bioinformatics. Modern biology classrooms must provide authentic research experiences to allow developing core competencies such as scientific inquiry, critical interpretation of experimental results, and quantitative analyses of large dataset using computational approaches. Recent educational research has shown that undergraduate students struggle when connecting gene expression concepts to classic genetics, phenotypic analyses, and overall flow of biological information in living organisms, suggesting that novel approaches are necessary to enhance learning of gene expression and regulation. This review describes different strategies and resources available to instructors willing to incorporate authentic research experiences, genomic tools, and bioinformatics analyses when teaching transcriptional regulation and gene expression in undergraduate courses.

However, a number of recent studies across a range of organisms indicate a broader role for NMD in gene regulation and transcriptome homeostasis. Here we propose a novel role for NMD as a buffering system with the capability of accumulating and subsequently releasing a wide spectrum of cryptic genetic variation in response to environmental stimuli, and hence facilitating adaptive evolution. We discuss this role for NMD in the context of evolution of plant pathogen defense, whereby NMD may promote rapid diversification of intracellular immune receptors by mitigating the potentially harmful impact of their newly formed variants on plant fitness.",

During B cell maturation, expression of the class II transactivator (CIITA) gene is down-regulated although the underlying epigenetic mechanism is not completely defined. Here we report that hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) was up-regulated in differentiating B lymphocytes paralleling CIITA repression. Over-expression of HIC1 directly repressed endogenous CIITA transcription in B cells. Reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay confirmed that HIC1 bound to the proximal CIITA type III promoter (\u2212\u00a0545/\u2212\u00a0113); mutation of a conserved HIC1 site within this region abrogated CIITA trans-repression. More important, depletion of HIC1 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) restored CIITA expression in differentiating B cells. Mechanistically, HIC1 preferentially interacted with and recruited DNMT1 and DNMT3b to the CIITA promoter to synergistically repress CIITA transcription. On the contrary, silencing of DNMT1/DNMT3b or inhibition of DNMT activity with 5-aza-dC attenuated CIITA trans-repression. Therefore, our data identify HIC1 as a novel factor involved in B cell differentiation acting as an epigenetic repressor of CIITA transcription.",

Activation of human macrophages with interleukin (IL)-4 showed that up-regulation of some IL-4 target genes was reduced when macrophages were incubated at 1% oxygen. Hypoxia impaired induction of chemokine (C\u2010C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), although IL-4-induced DNA binding of the transcription factor STAT6 remained intact. In contrast, induction of serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type (SPINT)2, another IL-4/STAT6 target gene, was not affected by hypoxia. The repressive histone mark histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), known to prevent chromatin remodelling and transcription, was removed from the SPINT2 but not the CCL18 gene locus under hypoxia or dimethyloxalylglycine-treatment. The H3K27me3 demethylase JMJD3 was required for CCL18 gene induction but dispensable for induction of SPINT2. Our data indicate that hypoxic inhibition of JMJD3 activity reduces demethylation of H3K27me3, nucleosome removal, and hence induction of the STAT6 target gene CCL18, while induction of other STAT6-inducible genes such as SPINT2 remained unaffected by JMJD3.

Previously, we identified DNMT1 as an interacting partner of the TR2/TR4 nuclear receptor heterodimer in erythroid cells, implicated in the developmental silencing of fetal \u03b2-type globin genes in the adult stage of human erythropoiesis. Here, we extended this work by using a biotinylation tagging approach to characterize DNMT1 protein complexes in mouse erythroleukemic cells. We identified novel DNMT1 interactions with several hematopoietic transcription factors with essential roles in erythroid differentiation, including GATA1, GFI-1b and FOG-1. We provide evidence for DNMT1 forming distinct protein subcomplexes with specific transcription factors and propose the existence of a \u201ccore\u201d DNMT1 complex with the transcription factors ZBP-89 and ZNF143, which is also present in non-hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, we identified the short (17a.a.)

However, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional repression by the BET bromodomain are poorly understood. Here, we found that BET bromodomain inhibition upregulated TAZ protein and its transcriptional output, independent of its well-established role as a mediator of Hippo and Wnt signaling. Additionally, JQ1, a synthetic BET inhibitor, suppressed Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity by upregulating TAZ.

     "abstract": "Transcriptional silencing is a major cause for the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, however, the underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood. The EPHB2 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that controls epithelial cell migration and allocation in intestinal crypts. Through its ability to restrict cell spreading, EPHB2 functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer whose expression is frequently lost as tumors progress to the carcinoma stage. Previously we reported that EPHB2 expression depends on a transcriptional enhancer whose activity is diminished in EPHB2 non-expressing cells. Here we investigated the mechanisms that lead to EPHB2 enhancer inactivation. We show that expression of EPHB2 and SNAIL1 - an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - is anti-correlated in colorectal cancer cell lines and tumors. In a cellular model of Snail1-induced EMT, we observe that features of active chromatin at the EPHB2 enhancer are diminished upon expression of murine Snail1. We identify the transcription factors FOXA1, MYB, CDX2 and TCF7L2 as EPHB2 enhancer factors and demonstrate that Snail1 indirectly inactivates the EPHB2 enhancer by downregulation of FOXA1 and MYB. In addition, Snail1 induces the expression of Lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) which competitively displaces TCF7L2 from the EPHB2 enhancer. In contrast to TCF7L2, however, LEF1 appears to repress the EPHB2 enhancer. Our findings underscore the importance of transcriptional enhancers for gene regulation under physiological and pathological conditions and show that SNAIL1 employs a combinatorial mechanism to inactivate the EPHB2 enhancer based on activator deprivation and competitive displacement of transcription factors.",

Moreover, overexpression of Nova1 proteins reduced the serine/arginine splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) level by enhancing the generation of intron 2-included (SRSF6+\u00a0intron 2) transcripts, which are a putative candidate of the AS-coupled nonsense-mediated decay mechanism.

Quadruplicate chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrated that at 2130 loci the association strenght of CTCF with genomic DNA was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) modulated by stimulation with the natural vitamin D receptor (VDR) ligand 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3).

A self-organizing map approach subdivided the vitamin D-sensitive CTCF sites into seven classes that can be distinguished by participation in DNA loop formation, binding to open chromatin, carrying binding motifs for CTCF or its relative BORIS, overlap with transcription start site (TSS) regions and binding of VDR. These variant molecular profiles suggest different mechanisms of the 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent action of CTCF. The co-location of VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent CTCF sites increases in the context of accessible chromatin and TSS regions but does not show any significant correlation with classical DNA binding mechanisms of CTCF.

We characterized genome-wide RUNX1 localization and performed RNA-seq and Hi-C in RUNX1-depleted and control MCF-7 breast cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that RUNX1 depletion led to up-regulation of genes associated with chromatin structure and down-regulation of genes related to extracellular matrix biology, as well as NEAT1 and MALAT1 lncRNAs. Our ChIP-Seq analysis supports a prominent role for RUNX1 in transcriptional activation. About 30% of all RUNX1 binding sites were intergenic, indicating diverse roles in promoter and enhancer regulation and suggesting additional functions for RUNX1. Hi-C analysis of RUNX1-depleted cells demonstrated that overall three-dimensional genome organization is largely intact, but indicated enhanced association of RUNX1 near Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) boundaries and alterations in long-range interactions. These results suggest an architectural role for RUNX1 in fine-tuning local interactions rather than in global organization.

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby Zfat regulates gene expression in T cells remain unexplored. In this study, we analyzed the genome-wide occupancy of Zfat by chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq), which showed that Zfat bound predominantly to a region around a transcription start site (TSS), and that an 8-bp nucleotide sequence GAA(T/A)(C/G)TGC was identified as a consensus sequence for Zfat-binding sites. Furthermore, about half of the Zfat-binding sites were characterized by histone H3 acetylations at lysine 9 and lysine 27 (H3K9ac/K27ac). Notably, Zfat gene deletion decreased the H3K9ac/K27ac levels at the Zfat-binding sites, suggesting that Zfat may be related to the regulation of H3K9ac/K27ac. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and transcriptional profiling in thymocytes identified Zfat-target genes with transcription to be regulated directly by Zfat. We then focused on the chromatin regulator Brpf1, a Zfat-target gene, revealing that Zfat bound directly to a 9-bp nucleotide sequence, CGAANGTGC, which is conserved among mammalian Brpf1 promoters.

Despite their differential expression, MMP genes have AP-1 (activator protein-1) binding elements within their promoters. Interestingly, c-JUN phosphorylation by cytokine signaling decreased its interaction with NCoR, but increased its interaction with p300, resulting in activation of MMP gene transcription. Here, we found that Zbtb7c (Kr-pok) is a critical component of a transcriptional repressor complex containing c-Jun and NCoR. c-Jun, bound at AP-1, interacts with Zbtb7c, which in turn recruits an NCoR/Hdac3 complex to repress several Mmp (-8, -10, -13, and -16) genes. The molecular interaction between c-Jun and Zbtb7c also prevents phosphorylation of c-Jun by p-Jnk, However, Zbtb7c phosphorylation by p-Jnk (induced by TNF\u03b1), and its (Zbtb7c) subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway, leads to c-Jun phosphorylation by p-Jnk. Promoter-bound p-c-Jun then recruits the coactivator p300 to upregulate Mmp gene. Overall, these findings show that Zbtb7c is a key molecule that recruits an NCoR/Hdac3 complex to inhibit phosphorylation of c-Jun, and thereby repress Mmp gene expression.",

We previously reported that DDIAS is transcriptionally activated by nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc1). However, the upstream regulation of DDIAS expression by growth factors has not been studied. Here, we demonstrate that DDIAS expression is induced by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) and myocyte enhancer factor 2B (MEF2B) in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and that it positively regulates \u03b2-catenin signaling in HeLa cells. The genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ERK5 suppressed DDIAS induction following EGF exposure and the overexpression of constitutively active MEK5 (CA-MEK5) enhanced DDIAS expression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, MEF2B, a downstream target of ERK5, exhibited sequence-specific binding to a MEF2 binding site in the DDIAS promoter following treatment with EGF. The overexpression of MEF2B increased the EGF-mediated induction of DDIAS expression, whereas the knockdown of MEF2B impaired this effect. Furthermore, DDIAS promoted invasion by increasing \u03b2-catenin expression at the post-translational level in response to EGF, suggesting that DDIAS plays a crucial role in the metastasis of cancer cells by regulating \u03b2-catenin expression. It is unlikely that MEF2B and NFATc1 cooperatively regulate DDIAS transcription in response to EGF.

Here we demonstrated that siRNA-based ATF4 depletion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly reduced the accumulation of fatty acids and triglycerides. Moreover, SREBP1c protein, which is an important transcription factor of lipogenesis, appreciably decreased while Srebp1c mRNA increased. Then we identified that ATF4 could maintain SREBP1c protein stability by directly activating the expression of USP7 which deubiquitinates SREBP1c and increases its protein content in cell. Besides, USP7 could restore the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides in the absence of ATF4. On the other hand, we found that ATF4 might inhibit the transcription of Srebp1c through TRB3, which is repressed by IBMX and DEX during early adipogenesis.

Using a combination of biochemistry and genetics approaches we provide an unprecedented level of detail on the multifactorial regulation of bacterial transcription.

Knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms that drive ALX/FPR2 gene expression is key for the development of innovative anti-inflammatory pharmacology. Here, we examined chromatin patterns of the ALX/FPR2 gene. We report that in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, the ALX/FPR2 gene undergoes epigenetic silencing characterized by low acetylation at lysine 27 and trimethylation at lysine 4, associated with high methylation at lysine 27 of histone 3. This pattern, which is consistent with transcriptionally inaccessible chromatin leading to low ALX/FPR2 mRNA and protein expression, is reversed in polymorphonuclear leukocytes that express high ALX/FPR2 levels. Activation of p300 histone acetyltransferase and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase restored chromatin accessibility and significantly increased ALX/FPR2 mRNA transcription and protein levels in MDA-MB231 cells, as well as in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. In both cells types, changes in the histone acetylation/methylation status enhanced ALX/FPR2 signaling in response to LXA4. Collectively, these results uncover unappreciated epigenetic regulation of ALX/FPR2 expression that can be exploited for innovative approaches to inflammatory disorders.",

Mutations of SP1, STAT6, IRF4, NF-kB, ELF1, TCF3, and SPI1/PU.1 sites resulted in significantly decreased promoter activity of varying magnitude, depending on the cell line tested.

Ectopic excision was associated with transcription of the endogenous Tag1 and changes in histone H3 methylation at the promoter region. Focusing on the endogenous Tag1 elements we found low level of excision in Ler protoplasts, which was slightly and strongly enhanced in ddm1 and cmt3 (chromomethylase3) protoplasts, respectively, concomitantly with reduction in Tag1 gene body (GB) CHG methylation and increased Tag1 transcription; strong activation of Tag1 was also observed in cmt3 leaves. Notably, in cmt3, but not in ddm1, Tag1 elements were excised out from their original sites and transposed elsewhere in the genome.

These CUTs originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is enriched at rDNA repeats.

DHT significantly increased IP mRNA and protein expression, IP-induced cAMP generation and promoter (PrmIP)-directed gene expression in all cell types examined. The androgen-responsive region was localised to a cis-acting androgen response element (ARE), which lies in close proximity to a functional sterol response element (SRE) within the core promoter. In normal serum conditions, DHT increased IP expression through classic androgen receptor (AR) binding to the functional ARE within the PrmIP. However, under conditions of low-cholesterol, DHT led to further increases in IP expression through an indirect mechanism involving AR-dependent upregulation of SCAP expression and enhanced SREBP1 processing & binding to the SRE within the PrmIP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed DHT-induced AR binding to the ARE in vivo in cells cultured in normal serum while, in conditions of low cholesterol, DHT led to increased AR and SREBP1 binding to the functional ARE and SRE cis-acting elements, respectively, within the core PrmIP resulting in further increases in IP expression. Collectively, these data establish that the human IP gene is under the transcriptional regulation of DHT, where this regulation is further influenced by serum-cholesterol levels. This may explain, in part, some of the protective actions of androgens within the vasculature.",

     "abstract": "The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a nuclear receptor that is traditionally thought to be specialized for sensing xenobiotic exposure. In concurrence with this feature PXR was originally identified to regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. During the last ten years it has become clear that PXR harbors broader functions. Evidence obtained both in experimental animals and humans indicate that ligand-activated PXR regulates hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism and affects whole body metabolic homeostasis. Currently, the consequences of PXR activation on overall metabolic health are not yet fully understood and varying results on the effect of PXR activation or knockout on metabolic disorders and weight gain have been published in mouse models. Rifampicin and St. John's wort, the prototypical human PXR agonists, impair glucose tolerance in healthy volunteers. Chronic exposure to PXR agonists could potentially represent a risk factor for diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

     "abstract": "Nuclear receptors are transcription factors which sense changing environmental or hormonal signals and effect transcriptional changes to regulate core life functions including growth, development, and reproduction. To support this function, following ligand-activation by xenobiotics, members of subfamily 1 nuclear receptors (NR1s) may heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate transcription of genes involved in energy and xenobiotic metabolism and inflammation. Several of these receptors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), the pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), the liver X receptor (LXR) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) are key regulators of the gut:liver:adipose axis and serve to coordinate metabolic responses across organ systems between the fed and fasting states. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease and may progress to cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with inappropriate nuclear receptor function and perturbations along the gut:liver:adipose axis including obesity, increased intestinal permeability with systemic inflammation, abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism, and insulin resistance. Environmental chemicals may compound the problem by directly interacting with nuclear receptors leading to metabolic confusion and the inability to differentiate fed from fasting conditions. This review focuses on the impact of nuclear receptors in the pathogenesis and treatment of NAFLD. Clinical trials including PIVENS and FLINT demonstrate that nuclear receptor targeted therapies may lead to the paradoxical dissociation of steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and obesity. Novel strategies currently under development (including tissue-specific ligands and dual receptor agonists) may be required to separate the beneficial effects of nuclear receptor activation from unwanted metabolic side effects. The impact of nuclear receptor crosstalk in NAFLD is likely to be profound, but requires further elucidation.

     "abstract": "The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a key sensor in xenobiotic detoxification and endobiotic metabolism. Increasing evidence suggests that CAR also plays a role in energy metabolism by suppressing the hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of two evodia alkaloids, rutaecarpine (Rut) and evodiamine (Evo), on gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis through their activation of the human CAR (hCAR). We found that both Rut and Evo exhibited anti-lipogenic and anti-gluconeogenic effects in the hyperlipidemic HepG2 cells. Both compounds can potently activate hCAR, and treatment of cells with hCAR antagonists reversed the anti-lipogenic and anti-gluconeogenic effects of Rut and Evo. The anti-gluconeogenic effect of Rut and Evo was due to the CAR-mediated inhibition of the recruitment of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) onto the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene promoters. In vivo, we showed that treatment of mice with Rut improved glucose tolerance in a CAR-dependent manner. Our results suggest that the evodia alkaloids Rut and Evo may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes.

     "abstract": "Cardiometabolic disease emerges as a worldwide epidemic and there is urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this chronic disease. The chemical environment to which we are exposed has significantly changed in the past few decades and recent research has implicated its contribution to the development of many chronic human diseases. However, the mechanisms of how exposure to chemicals contributes to the development of cardiometabolic disease are poorly understood. Numerous chemicals have been identified as ligands for the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor functioning as a xenobiotic sensor to coordinately regulate xenobiotic metabolism via transcriptional regulation of xenobiotic-detoxifying enzymes and transporters. In the past decade, the function of PXR in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism has been extensively studied by many laboratories and the role of PXR as a xenobiotic sensor has been well-established. The identification of PXR as a xenobiotic sensor has provided an important tool for the study of new mechanisms through which xenobiotic exposure impacts human chronic diseases. Recent studies have revealed novel and unexpected roles of PXR in modulating obesity, insulin sensitivity, lipid homeostasis, atherogenesis, and vascular functions. These studies suggest that PXR signaling may contribute significantly to the pathophysiological effects of many known xenobiotics on cardiometabolic disease in humans. The discovery of novel functions of PXR in cardiometabolic disease not only contributes to our understanding of \u201cgene\u2013environment interactions\u201d in predisposing individuals to chronic diseases but also provides strong evidence to inform future risk assessment for relevant chemicals.

     "abstract": "Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a major transcriptional regulator of xenobiotic metabolism and transport pathways in the liver and intestines, which are critical for protecting organisms against potentially harmful xenobiotic and endobiotic compounds. Inadvertent activation of drug metabolism pathways through PXR is known to contribute to drug resistance, adverse drug\u2013drug interactions, and drug toxicity in humans. In both humans and rodents, PXR has been implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Because of PXR's important functions, it has been a therapeutic target of interest for a long time. More recent mechanistic studies have shown that PXR is modulated by multiple PTMs. Herein we provide the first investigation of the role of acetylation in modulating PXR activity. Through LC\u2013MS/MS analysis, we identified lysine 109 (K109) in the hinge as PXR's major acetylation site. Using various biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that PXR's acetylation status and transcriptional activity are modulated by E1A binding protein (p300) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Based on analysis of acetylation site mutants, we found that acetylation at K109 represses PXR transcriptional activity. The mechanism involves loss of RXR\u03b1 dimerization and reduced binding to cognate DNA response elements. This mechanism may represent a promising therapeutic target using modulators of PXR acetylation levels.

     "abstract": "Post-translational modification (PTM) of nuclear receptor superfamily members regulates various aspects of their biology to include sub-cellular localization, the repertoire of protein-binding partners, as well as their stability and mode of degradation. The nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) is a master-regulator of the drug-inducible gene expression in liver and intestine. The PXR-mediated gene activation program is primarily recognized to increase drug metabolism, drug transport, and drug efflux pathways in these tissues. The activation of PXR also has important implications in significant human diseases including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Our recent investigations reveal that PXR is modified by multiple PTMs to include phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination. Using both primary cultures of hepatocytes and cell-based assays, we show here that PXR is modified through acetylation on lysine residues. Further, we show that increased acetylation of PXR stimulates its increased SUMO-modification to support active transcriptional suppression. Pharmacologic inhibition of lysine de-acetylation using trichostatin A (TSA) alters the sub-cellular localization of PXR in cultured hepatocytes, and also has a profound impact upon PXR transactivation capacity. Both the acetylation and SUMOylation status of the PXR protein is affected by its ability to associate with the lysine de-acetylating enzyme histone de-acetylase (HDAC)3 in a complex with silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT). Taken together, our data support a model in which a SUMO-acetyl \u2018switch\u2019 occurs such that acetylation of PXR likely stimulates SUMO-modification of PXR to promote the active repression of PXR-target gene expression.

It is an accepted view that some individuals or specific populations display considerable differences in their ability to metabolize different drugs, dietary constituents, herbals etc. In this context we speculated that polymorphisms in PXR gene might contribute to variability in cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolizing enzymes of phase I, drug metabolizing components of phase II and efflux components of the detoxification machinery. Therefore, in this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive functional analysis of seventeen naturally occurring non-synonymous variants of human PXR. When compared, we observed that some of the PXR SNP variants exhibit distinct functional and dynamic responses on parameters which included transcriptional function, sub-cellular localization, mitotic chromatin binding, DNA-binding properties and other molecular interactions. One of the unique SNP located within the DNA-binding domain of PXR was found to be functionally null and distinct on other parameters. Similarly, some of the non-synonymous SNPs in PXR imparted reduced transactivation function as compared to wild type PXR. Interestingly, PXR is reported to be a mitotic chromatin binding protein and such an association has been correlated to an emerging concept of \u2018transcription memory\u2019 and altered transcription output. In view of the observations made herein our data suggest that some of the natural PXR variants may have adverse physiological consequences owing to its influence on the expression levels and functional output of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The present study is expected to explain not only the observed inter-individual responses to different drugs but may also highlight the mechanistic details and importance of PXR in drug clearance, drug\u2013drug interactions and diverse metabolic disorders.

     "abstract": "The pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) are well-known xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors with overlapping functions. However, there lacks a quantitative characterization to distinguish between the PXR and CAR target genes and signaling pathways in the liver. The present study performed a transcriptomic comparison of the PXR- and CAR-targets using RNA-Seq in livers of adult wild-type mice that were treated with the prototypical PXR ligand PCN (200\u00a0mg/kg, i.p. once daily for 4\u00a0days in corn oil) or the prototypical CAR ligand TCPOBOP (3\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., once daily for 4\u00a0days in corn oil). At the given doses, TCPOBOP differentially regulated many more genes (2125) than PCN (212), and 147 of the same genes were differentially regulated by both chemicals. As expected, the top pathways differentially regulated by both PCN and TCPOBOP were involved in xenobiotic metabolism, and they also up-regulated genes involved in retinoid metabolism, but down-regulated genes involved in inflammation and iron homeostasis. Regarding unique pathways, PXR activation appeared to overlap with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, whereas CAR activation appeared to overlap with the farnesoid X receptor signaling, acute-phase response, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The mRNAs of differentially regulated drug-processing genes (DPGs) partitioned into three patterns, namely TCPOBOP-induced, PCN-induced, as well as TCPOBOP-suppressed gene clusters. The cumulative mRNAs of the differentially regulated DPGs, phase-I and -II enzymes, as well as efflux transporters were all up-regulated by both PCN and TCPOBOPOP, whereas the cumulative mRNAs of the uptake transporters were down-regulated only by TCPOBOP. The absolute mRNA abundance in control and receptor-activated conditions was examined in each DPG category to predict the contribution of specific DPG genes in the PXR/CAR-mediated pharmacokinetic responses. The preferable differential regulation by TCPOBOP in the entire hepatic transcriptome correlated with a marked change in the expression of many DNA and histone epigenetic modifiers. In conclusion, the present study has revealed known and novel, as well as common and unique targets of PXR and CAR in mouse liver following pharmacological activation using their prototypical ligands. Results from this study will further support the role of these receptors in regulating the homeostasis of xenobiotic and intermediary metabolism in the liver, and aid in distinguishing between PXR and CAR signaling at various physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

     "abstract": "The ligand-activated nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) are two master transcriptional regulators of many important drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter genes (DMET) in response to xenobiotics including many drugs. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1, NR1C1), the target of lipid lowering fibrate drugs, primarily regulates fatty acid catabolism and energy-homeostasis. Recent research has shown that there are substantial overlaps in the regulated genes of these receptors. For example, both CAR and PXR also modulate the transcription of key enzymes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and PPAR\u03b1 also functions as a direct transcriptional regulator of important DMET genes including cytochrome P450s CYP3A4 and CYP2C8. Despite their important and widespread influence on liver metabolism, comparative data are scarce, particularly at a global level and in humans. The major objective of this study was to directly compare the genome-wide transcriptional changes elucidated by the activation of these three nuclear receptors in primary human hepatocytes. Cultures from six individual donors were treated with the prototypical ligands for CAR (CITCO), PXR (rifampicin) and PPAR\u03b1 (WY14,643) or DMSO as vehicle control. Genomewide mRNA profiles determined with Affymetrix microarrays were analyzed for differentially expressed genes and metabolic functions. The results confirmed known prototype target genes and revealed strongly overlapping sets of coregulated but also distinctly regulated and novel responsive genes and pathways. The results further specify the role of PPAR\u03b1 as a regulator of drug metabolism and the role of the xenosensors PXR and CAR in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical modulators of gene expression and appear to impact many cellular pathways, including those involved in chemical detoxification and liver tumor development. In this study, we used deep sequencing approaches with an Illumina HiSeq platform to differentially profile microRNA expression patterns in livers from wild type C57BL/6J mice following CAR activation with the mouse CAR-specific ligand activator, 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5,-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP).

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of the differentially expressed microRNAs revealed altered effector pathways, including those involved in liver cell growth and proliferation.

As a result, the transcriptional regulation of the gene is complex and must depend on the cell type. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that in dying thymocytes the expression of Tgm2 is induced by external signals derived from engulfing macrophages, such as retinoids, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and adenosine, the latter triggering the adenylate cyclase signaling pathway. The existence of TGF-\u03b2 and retinoid responsive elements in the promoter region of Tgm2 has already been reported, but the intergenic regulatory elements participating in the regulation of Tgm2 have not yet been identified. Here we used publicly available results from DNase I hypersensitivity analysis followed by deep sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing against CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac to map a putative regulatory element set for Tgm2 in thymocytes. By measuring eRNA expressions of these putative enhancers in retinoid, rTGF-\u03b2 or dibutiryl cAMP-exposed thymocytes we determined which of them are functional. By applying ChIP-qPCR against SMAD4, retinoic acid receptor, retinoid X receptor, cAMP response element binding protein, P300 and H3K27ac under the same conditions, we identified two enhancers of Tgm2, which seem to act as integrators of the TGF-\u03b2, retinoid and adenylate cyclase signaling pathways in dying thymocytes. Our study describes a novel strategy to identify and characterize the signal-specific functional enhancer set of a gene by integrating genome-wide datasets and measuring the production of enhancer specific RNA molecules.",

     "abstract": "The regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is important for a variety of cellular functions. ELL/EAF-containing little elongation complex (LEC) was found to be required for transcription of Pol II-dependent small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes. It was shown that the tumor suppressor p53 interacts with ELL and inhibits transcription elongation activity of ELL. Here, we show that p53 inhibits interaction between ELL/EAF and ICE1 in LEC and thereby p53 represses transcription of Pol II-dependent snRNA genes through inhibiting LEC function. Furthermore, induction of p53 expression by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation decreases the occupancy of ICE1 at Pol II-dependent snRNA genes. Consistent with the results, knockdown of p53 increased both the expression of snRNA genes and the occupancy of Pol II and components of LEC at snRNA genes. Our results indicate that p53 interferes with the interaction between ELL/EAF and ICE1 and represses transcription of snRNA genes by Pol II.",

However, a concise mechanism for chemotherapy-induced MDR1 expression is unclear. Mechanistically, mutational selection, epigenetic alteration, activation of the Wnt pathway or impaired p53 function have been implicated. The present study describes that the surviving fraction of cisplatin resistant cells co- upregulate MDR1, BMI1 and acetyl transferase activity of TIP60. Using complementary gain and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that the expression of MDR1 is positively regulated by BMI1, a stem-cell factor classically known as a transcriptional repressor. Our study establishes a functional interaction between TIP60 and BMI-1 resulting in upregulation of MDR1 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further establish that the proximal MDR1 promoter responds to cisplatin in a BMI1 dependent manner. BMI1 interacts with a cluster of E-box elements on the MDR1 promoter and recruits TIP60 resulting in acetylation of histone H2A and H3. Collectively, our data establish a hitherto unknown liaison among MDR1, BMI1 and TIP60 and provide mechanistic insights into cisplatin-induced MDR1 expression resulting in acquired cross-resistance against paclitaxel, doxorubicin and likely other drugs. In conclusion, our results advocate utilizing anti-BMI1 strategies to alleviate acquired resistance to chemotherapy.",

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that transcription of a further gene essential for TH synthesis, the thyroglobulin (TG) gene, is under the control of SREBP. To test this hypothesis, we studied the influence of inhibition of SREBP maturation and SREBP knockdown on TG expression in FRTL-5 thyrocytes and explored transcriptional regulation of the TG promoter by reporter gene experiments in FRTL-5 and HepG2 cells, gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Inhibition of SREBP maturation by 25-hydroxycholesterol and siRNA-mediated knockdown of either SREBP-1c or SREBP-2 decreased mRNA and protein levels of TG in FRTL-5 thyrocytes. Reporter gene assays with wild-type and mutated TG promoter reporter truncation constructs revealed that the rat TG promoter is transcriptionally activated by nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2. DNA-binding assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both nSREBP-1c and nSREBP-2 bind to a SREBP binding motif with characteristics of an E-box SRE at position -63 in the rat TG promoter. In connection with recent findings that NIS and TPO are regulated by SREBP in thyrocytes the present findings support the view that SREBP are regulators of essential steps of TH synthesis in the thyroid gland such as iodide uptake, iodide oxidation and iodination of tyrosyl residues of TG. This moreover suggests that SREBP may be molecular targets for pharmacological modulation of TH synthesis.",

Interaction of Fhl1 with Ifh1 or Crf1 is achieved through a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Fhl1, which binds to forkhead-binding (FHB) domains of Ifh1 and Crf1. Here, we demonstrate that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of T681 and T348 residues, located in the FHB domains of Ifh1 and Crf1, respectively, provides binding sites for the FHA domain of Fhl1. Cells expressing Ifh1T681A mutant showed reduced association of Ifh1 at the RP gene promoters and decreased levels of RP gene transcripts, thereby reducing the growth rate. On the other hand, cells expressing Crf1T348A showed a defect in repressing RP gene transcription upon inhibition of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) by rapamycin treatment.

Hundreds of alternative splicing events regulated by endogenous RBM39 were identified. The majority of these events were cassette exons. Genes containing RBM39-regulated alternative exons were found to be linked to G2/M transition, cellular response to DNA damage, adherens junctions and endocytosis.

Generally, it is assumed that the mRNA fragments resulting from Ago2 cleavage are rapidly degraded, thus making the transcript translation-incompetent. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the post-cleavage mRNA decay are not completely understood and the fate of cleavage intermediates has been poorly studied. Using specific siRNAs and short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) we show that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 mRNA cleavage fragments of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) E6/7 mRNA, over-expressed in cervical malignancies, are unevenly degraded. Intriguingly, the 5\u2032 mRNA fragment was more abundant and displayed a greater stability than the corresponding 3\u2032 mRNA fragment in RNAi-treated cells. Further analysis revealed that the 5\u2032 mRNA fragment was polysome-associated, indicating its active translation, and this was further confirmed by using tagged E7 protein to show that C-terminally truncated proteins were produced in treated cells. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the degradation of siRNA-targeted transcripts and show that RNAi can alter protein expression in cells as a result of preferential stabilization and translation of the 5\u2032 cleavage fragment. These results challenge the current model of siRNA-mediated RNAi and provide a significant step forward towards understanding non-canonical pathways of siRNA gene silencing.",

The molecular mechanisms that mediate silencing of the Runx2 gene and its downstream target osteogenic-related genes in neuronal cells have not been explored. Here, we assess the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate silencing of osteoblast-specific genes in CNS neurons. In particular, we address the contribution of histone epigenetic marks and histone modifiers on the silencing of the Runx2/p57 bone-related isoform in rat hippocampal tissues at embryonic to adult stages. Our results indicate enrichment of repressive chromatin histone marks and of the Polycomb PRC2 complex at the Runx2/p57 promoter region. Knockdown of PRC2 H3K27-methyltransferases Ezh2 and Ezh1, or forced expression of the Trithorax/COMPASS subunit Wdr5 activates Runx2/p57 mRNA expression in both immature and mature hippocampal cells.

The resulting increase in MKP-1 leads to suppression of JNK-mediated inflammatory responses in brain astrocytes. We further demonstrate that 22(R)-HC\u2013induced phosphorylation of nuclear HuR is mediated by PKC\u03b1, which is activated in the cytosol by increases in intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ levels mediated by the phospholipase C/inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (PLC/IP3R) pathway and translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus.

Tox3 is also expressed in neural progenitor cells obtained from the ganglionic eminence of E15 mice that express Nestin, and it specifically binds the Nestin promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In line with this, over-expression of Tox3 increased Nestin promoter activity, which was cooperatively enhanced by treatment with the stem cell self-renewal promoting Notch ligand Jagged and repressed by pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling.

     "abstract": "Translation is an energy-intensive process and tightly regulated. Generally, translation is initiated in a cap-dependent manner. Under stress conditions, typically found within the tumor microenvironment in association with e.g. nutrient deprivation or hypoxia, cap-dependent translation decreases, and alternative modes of translation initiation become more important. Specifically, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) facilitate translation of specific mRNAs under otherwise translation-inhibitory conditions. This mechanism is controlled by IRES trans-acting factors (ITAF), i.e. by RNA-binding proteins, which interact with and determine the activity of selected IRESs. We aimed at characterizing the translational regulation of the IL-33 decoy receptor sST2, which was enhanced by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). We identified and verified an IRES within the 5\u2032UTR of sST2. Furthermore, we found that MEK/ERK signaling contributes to FGF2-induced, sST2-IRES activation and translation. Determination of the sST2-5\u2032UTR structure by in-line probing followed by deletion analyses identified 23 nucleotides within the sST2-5\u2032UTR to be required for optimal IRES activity. Finally, we show that the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) binds to the sST2-5\u2032UTR, acts as an ITAF, and thus controls the activity of the sST2-IRES and consequently sST2 translation. Specifically, FGF2 enhances nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNP A1, which requires intact MEK/ERK activity. In summary, we provide evidence that the sST2-5\u2032UTR contains an IRES element, which is activated by a MEK/ERK-dependent increase in cytoplasmic localization of hnRNP A1 in response to FGF2, enhancing the translation of sST2.",

The Polycomb group (PcG) chromatin remodeling complex deposits a methyl group on lysine 27 of histone 3 leading to repressed gene expression. Plants encode homologs of the Enhancer of zeste (E(z)), a component of the PcG complex from Drosophila, one of which is a SET domain protein designated CURLY LEAF (CLF). Although this SET domain protein exhibits a strong correlation with the presence of the H3K27me3 mark in plants, the methyl-transferase activity and specificity of its SET domain have not been directly tested in-vivo.Using the evolutionary early-diverged land plant model species Physcomitrella patens we show that abolishment of a single copy gene PpCLF, as well as an additional member of the PcG complex, FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (PpFIE), results in a specific loss of tri-methylation of H3K27. Using site-directed mutagenesis of key residues, we revealed that H3K27 tri-methylation is mediated by the SET domain of the CLF protein. Moreover, the abolishment of H3K27me3 led to enhanced expression of transcription factor genes. This in turn led to the development of fertilization-independent sporophyte-like structures, as observed in PpCLF and PpFIE null mutants. Overall, our results demonstrate the role of PpCLF as a SET protein in tri-methylation of H3K27 in-vivo and the importance of this modification in regulating the expression of transcription factor genes involved in developmental programs of P. patens.",

KLF17 plays a key role in breast cancer inhibition. However, the underlying mechanisms by which KLF17 control breast cancer progression remains unknown. Here, we show that KLF17 antagonizes ER\u03b1-dependent signaling to suppress breast cancer progression. KLF17 alters ER\u03b1-binding pattern throughout the genome and co-localizes with ER\u03b1 on chromatin. Mechanistically, KLF17 forms a complex with ER\u03b1 that interferes with ER\u03b1 binding on chromatin and thereby attenuates ER\u03b1-dependent pathway. KLF17 increases the methylation status of ERE target promoters by recruiting transcriptional corepressor N-CoR/HDAC1 complex and prevents RNA polymerase II binding to suppress ER\u03b1-dependent transcriptional activation. Importantly, KLF17 preoccupies a subset of ERE target gene promoters and inhibits interaction of ER\u03b1 with chromatin. Conversely, estrogen signaling suppresses KLF17 transcription via ER\u03b1/HDAC1-dependent mechanism. KLF17 expression negatively correlates with ER\u03b1 target genes in multiple breast cancer samples. Enhanced KLF17 expression sensitizes ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells to endocrine therapy.

Inhibition of translation is known to impair NMD; however, few studies have investigated the correlation between enhanced translation and increased NMD. Here, we demonstrate that insulin signaling events increase translation, leading to an increase in NMD of eIF4E-bound transcripts. We provide evidence that (i) insulin-mediated enhancement of translation augments NMD and rapamycin abrogates this enhancement; (ii) an increase in AKT phosphorylation due to inhibition of PTEN facilitates NMD; (iii) insulin stimulation increases the binding of up-frameshift factor 1 (UPF1), most likely to eIF4E-bound PTC-containing transcripts; and (iv) insulin stimulation induces the colocalization of UPF1 and eIF4E in processing bodies. These results illustrate how extracellular signaling promotes the removal of eIF4E-bound NMD targets.",

To what extent such changes can be reversed is largely unknown. We examined the effect of maternal dietary restriction on RNA synthesis in the offspring. Low protein diet fed either throughout gestation or for the preimplantation period alone reduced cellular RNA content across fetal somatic tissues during challenge and increased it beyond controls in fetal and adult tissues after challenge release. Changes in transcription of ribosomal RNA, the major component of cellular RNA, were responsible for this phenotype as evidenced by matching alterations in RNA polymerase I density and DNA methylation at ribosomal DNA loci. Cellular levels of the ribosomal transcription factor Rrn3 mirrored the rRNA expression pattern. In cell culture experiments, Rrn3 overexpression reduced rDNA methylation and increased rRNA expression; the converse occurred after inhibition of Rrn3 activity. These observations define novel mechanism where poor nutrition before implantation irreversibly alters basal rates of rRNA transcription thereafter in a process mediated by rDNA methylation and Rrn3 factor.",

We have previously observed that conservative valine-to-isoleucine amino acid substitutions in a conserved stretch of hydrophobic amino acids have a profound effect on Myb activity. Here, we have explored the function of the hydrophobic region as a mediator of protein\u2013protein interactions. We show that the hydrophobic region facilitates Myb self-interaction and binding of the histone acetyl transferase Tip60, a previously identified Myb interacting protein. We show that these interactions are affected by the valine-to-isoleucine amino acid substitutions and suppress Myb activity by interfering with the interaction of Myb and the KIX domain of p300. Taken together, our work identifies the hydrophobic region in the Myb transactivation domain as a binding site for homo- and heteromeric protein interactions and leads to a picture of the c-Myb transactivation domain as a composite protein binding region that facilitates interdependent protein\u2013protein interactions of Myb with regulatory proteins.",

     "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that secretin (SCT) is an important element in the osmoregulatory pathway. It is interesting to note that both SCT and its receptor (SCTR) gene are activated upon hyperosmolality in the kidney. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of the SCTR gene expression in response to changes in osmolality have yet to be clarified. Detailed DNA sequence analysis of the promoter regions of the SCTR gene reveals the presence of multiple osmotic response elements (ORE). The ORE is the binding site of a key osmosensitive transactivator, namely, the nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5). SCTR and NFAT5 are co-expressed in the kidney cortex and medulla collecting duct cells. We therefore hypothesize that NFAT5 is responsible for modulating SCTR expression in hypertonic environments. In this study, we found hypertonicity stimulates the promoter activities and endogenous gene expression of SCTR in mouse kidney cortex collecting duct cells (M1) and inner medulla collecting duct cells (mIMCD3). The overexpression and silencing of NFAT5 further confirmed it to be responsible for the up-regulation of the SCTR gene under hypertonic conditions. A significant increase in the interaction between NFAT5 and the SCTR promoter was also observed following chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In vivo, osmotic stress up-regulates the SCTR gene in the kidney cortex and medulla of wild-type mice, but does not do so in NFAT5+/\u2212 animals. Hence, this study provides comprehensive information on how NFAT5 regulates SCTR expression in different osmotic environments.",

     "abstract": "MiR-195 expression is frequently reduced in various cancers, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To explore whether abnormal transcription contributed to miR-195 downregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we characterized the \u22122165-bp site upstream of mature miR-195 as transcription start site and the \u22122.4 to \u22122.0-kb fragment as the promoter of miR-195 gene. Subsequent investigation showed that deletion of the predicted Sp1 binding site decreased the miR-195 promoter activity; Sp1 silencing significantly reduced the miR-195 promoter activity and the endogenous miR-195 level; Sp1 directly interacted with the miR-195 promoter in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest Sp1 as a transactivator for miR-195 transcription. Interestingly, miR-195 expression was also subjected to epigenetic regulation. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) could anchor to the miR-195 promoter via interacting with Sp1 and consequently repress the Sp1-mediated miR-195 transactivation by deacetylating histone in HCC cells. Consistently, substantial increase of HDAC3 protein was detected in human HCC tissues and HDAC3 upregulation was significantly correlated with miR-195 downregulation, suggesting that HDAC3 elevation may represent an important cause for miR-195 reduction in HCC. Our findings uncover the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation and expression deregulation of miR-195 in HCC cells and provide new insight into microRNA biogenesis in cancer cells.",

This \u201cguardian\u201d function is important in numerous cell types and tissue barriers but becomes disadvantageous by being responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype in certain tumor cells. ABCG2 regulation at the protein level has already been extensively studied, however, regulation at the mRNA level, especially the functional role of the various 5\u2032 untranslated exon variants (5\u2032 UTRs) has been elusive. In the present work, we describe a comprehensive characterization of four ABCG2 mRNA variants with different exon 1 sequences, investigate drug inducibility, stem cell specificity, mRNA stability, and translation efficiency. Although certain variants (E1B and E1C) are considered as \u201cconstitutive\u201d mRNA isoforms, we show that chemotoxic drugs significantly alter the expression pattern of distinct ABCG2 mRNA isoforms. When examining human embryonic stem cell lines, we provide evidence that variant E1A has an expression pattern coupled to undifferentiated stem cell stage, as its transcript level is regulated parallel to mRNAs of Oct4 and Nanog pluripotency marker genes. When characterizing the four exon 1 variants we found no significant differences in terms of mRNA stabilities and half-lives of the isoforms. In contrast, variant E1U showed markedly lower translation efficiency both at the total protein level or regarding the functional presence in the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results indicate that the different 5\u2032 UTR variants play an important role in cell type specific regulation and fine tuning of ABCG2 expression.",

Although significant progress has been made in answering these questions, additional studies are needed to resolve several important remaining issues.

The underlying epigenetic mechanism, however, is not completely understood. Here we report that following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, symmetrically dimethylated histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2Me2s) accumulated on the MHC II promoter along with CIITA. IFN-\u03b3 augmented expression, nuclear translocation, and promoter binding of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 in macrophages. Over-expression of PRMT5 potentiated IFN-\u03b3 induced activation of MHC II transcription in an enzyme activity-dependent manner. In contrast, PRMT5 silencing or inhibition of PRMT5 activity by methylthioadenosine (MTA) suppressed MHC II transactivation by IFN-\u03b3. CIITA interacted with and recruited PRMT5 to the MHC II promoter and mediated the synergy between PRMT5 and ASH2/WDR5 to activate MHC II transcription. PRMT5 expression was down-regulated in senescent and H2O2-treated macrophages rendering ineffectual induction of MHC II transcription by IFN-\u03b3.

They participate in a range of biological processes, also beyond their well-established role in the immune system and cytokine signalling. They act both as transcriptional corepressors and coactivators depending on the context. In the present work, we investigated mechanisms by which PIAS1 causes activation or repression of c-Myb dependent target genes. Analysis of global expression data shows that c-Myb and PIAS1 knockdowns affect a subset of common targets, but with a dual outcome consistent with a role of PIAS1 as either a corepressor or coactivator. Our mechanistic studies show that PIAS1 engages in a novel interaction with the acetyltransferase and coactivator p300. Interaction and ChIP analysis suggest a bridging function where PIAS1 enhances p300 recruitment to c-Myb-bound sites through interaction with both proteins. In addition, the E3 activity of PIAS1 enhances further its coactivation. Remarkably, the SUMO status of c-Myb had a decisive role, indicating a SUMO-dependent switch in the way PIAS1 affects c-Myb, either as a coactivator or corepressor. Removal of the two major SUMO-conjugation sites in c-Myb (2KR mutant), which enhances its activity significantly, turned PIAS1 into a corepressor. Also, p300 was less efficiently recruited to chromatin by c-Myb-2KR. We propose that PIAS1 acts as a \u201cprotein inhibitor of activated c-Myb\u201d in the absence of SUMOylation while, in its presence, PIAS behaves as a \u201cprotein activator of repressed c-Myb\u201d.",

Previous studies have shown that DDX3 promotes nuclear export and translation of the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA. Although the function of DDX3 during both processes requires its catalytic activity, it is unknown whether other domains surrounding the helicase core are involved. Here, we show the involvement of the N- and C-terminal domains of DDX3 in the regulation of HIV-1 unspliced mRNA translation. Our results suggest that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of DDX3 regulates its functions in translation by acting prior to the recruitment of the 43S pre-initiation complex onto the viral 5\u2032-UTR.

Assembly defects alter both transcriptional activity as well as the amount of enzyme associated with genes. Here, we show that the global transcriptional analysis of foot mutants reveals the activation of an environmental stress response (ESR), which occurs at a permissive temperature under optimal growth conditions. Our data indicate that the ESR that occurs in foot mutants depends mostly on a global post-transcriptional regulation mechanism which, in turn, depends on Rpb4\u2013mRNA imprinting. Under optimal growth conditions, we propose that Rpb4 serves as a key to globally modulate mRNA stability as well as to coordinate transcription and decay. Overall, our results imply that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in controlling the ESR at both the transcription and mRNA decay levels.",

     "abstract": "miRNAs play critical roles in heart disease. In addition to differential miRNA expression, miRNA-mediated control is also affected by variable miRNA processing or alternative 3\u2032-end cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) of their mRNA targets. To what extent these phenomena play a role in the heart remains unclear. We sought to explore miRNA processing and mRNA APA in cardiomyocytes, and whether these change during cardiac hypertrophy. Thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) was performed to induce hypertrophy in C57BL/6J mice. RNA extracted from cardiomyocytes of sham-treated, pre-hypertrophic (2\u00a0days post-TAC), and hypertrophic (7\u00a0days post-TAC) mice was subjected to small RNA- and poly(A)-test sequencing (PAT-Seq). Differential expression analysis matched expectations; nevertheless we identified ~\u00a0400 mRNAs and hundreds of noncoding RNA loci as altered with hypertrophy for the first time. Although multiple processing variants were observed for many miRNAs, there was little change in their relative proportions during hypertrophy. PAT-Seq mapped ~\u00a048,000 mRNA 3\u2032-ends, identifying novel 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) for over 7000 genes. Importantly, hypertrophy was associated with marked changes in APA with a net shift from distal to more proximal mRNA 3\u2032-ends, which is predicted to decrease overall miRNA repression strength. We independently validated several examples of 3\u2032UTR proportion change and showed that alternative 3\u2032UTRs associate with differences in mRNA translation. Our work suggests that APA contributes to altered gene expression with the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and provides a rich resource for a systems-level understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation in physiological and pathological states of the heart.",

The biological significance of the IGF-1 splice variants and how the E-peptides affect the actions of mature IGF-1 are largely unknown. In this study we investigated the origin and conservation of the IGF-1 E-peptides and we compared the pattern of expression of the IGF-1 isoforms in vivo, in nine mammalian species, and in vitro using human and mouse IGF-1 minigenes.Our analysis showed that only IGF-1Ea is conserved among all vertebrates, whereas IGF-1Eb and IGF-1Ec are an evolutionary novelty originated from the exonization of a mammalian interspersed repetitive-b (MIR-b) element. Both IGF-1Eb and IGF-1Ec mRNAs were constitutively expressed in all mammalian species analyzed but their expression ratio varies greatly among species. Using IGF-1 minigenes we demonstrated that divergence in cis-acting regulatory elements between human and mouse conferred species-specific features to the exon 5 region. Finally, the protein-coding sequences of exon 5 showed low rate of synonymous mutations and contain disorder-promoting amino acids, suggesting a regulatory role for these domains.In conclusion, exonization of a MIR-b element in the IGF-1 gene determined gain of exon 5 during mammalian evolution.

Expression of the c-Myc oncogene is frequently deregulated in tumors, facilitating aberrant cell proliferation. c-MYC protein levels display circadian rhythmicity, which is compatible with an in vitro repressive role of the clock-activating complex BMAL1/CLOCK on its promoter. In this report, we provide evidence for the in vivo binding of the core circadian factor BMAL1 on the human c-Myc promoter. In addition, analysis of protein synthesis and degradation rates, as well as post-translational acetylation, demonstrate that the clock tightly controls cellular MYC levels. The oncoprotein itself is a transcription factor that by responding to mitogenic signals regulates the expression of several hundred genes. c-MYC-driven transcription is generally exerted upon dimerization with MAX and binding to E-box elements, a sequence that is also recognized by the circadian heterodimer. Our reporter assays reveal that the MYC/MAX dimer cannot affect transcription of the circadian gene Per1. However, when overexpressed, c-MYC is able to repress Per1 transactivation by BMAL1/CLOCK via targeting selective E-box sequences. Importantly, upon serum stimulation, MYC was detected in BMAL1 protein complexes. Together, these data demonstrate a novel interaction between MYC and circadian transactivators resulting in reduced clock-driven transcription. Perturbation of Per1 expression by MYC constitutes a plausible alternative explanation for the deregulated expression of clock genes observed in many types of cancer.",

Core promoters are diverse and may contain a variety of sequence elements such as the TATA box, the Initiator (INR), and the downstream promoter element (DPE) recognized, respectively, by the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors of the TFIID complex. Core promoter elements contribute to the gene selectivity of enhancers, and INR/DPE-specific enhancers and activators have been identified. Here, we identify a TATA box-selective activating sequence upstream of the human \u03b2-actin (ACTB) gene that mediates serum response factor (SRF)-induced transcription from TATA-dependent but not INR-dependent promoters and requires the TATA-binding/bending activity of TBP, which is otherwise dispensable for transcription from a TATA-less promoter. The SRF-dependent ACTB sequence is stereospecific on TATA promoters but activates in an orientation-independent manner a composite TATA/INR-containing promoter. More generally, we show that SRF-regulated genes of the actin/cytoskeleton/contractile family tend to have a TATA box. These results suggest distinct TATA-dependent and INR-dependent mechanisms of TFIID-mediated transcription in mammalian cells that are compatible with only certain stereospecific combinations of activators, and that a TBP-TATA binding mechanism is important for SRF activation of the actin/cytoskeleton-related gene family.",

We recently identified that one of the general but key mechanisms for inflammatory gene transcription regulation is controlled by the formation of super enhancers mediated by NF-\u03baB, and bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins.Given that microRNA transcription shares a similar mechanism to mRNA, we assume that the inflammatory microRNAs transcription could be NF-\u03baB and BET bromodomain dependent. In the present study, we confirmed that inflammatory stimuli changed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) microRNA profile. Among these microRNAs, miR-146a and miR-155, two well-established inflammatory microRNAs, are both downregulated at transcriptional level by NF-\u03baB and BET bromodomain inhibition. To pursue this mechanism, we analyzed the ChIP-seq data and found that NF-\u03baB, BRD4 and RNA POL II were rapidly distributed at the upstream regions of miR-146a and miR-155, and more importantly mediated the formation of the super enhancers that drive miR-146a and miR-155 transcription. These microRNAs transcription driven by super enhancers in turn downregulate both in vitro and in vivo canonical inflammatory genes expression through targeting inflammatory mediators. This novel finding demonstrated how the host self-regulates inflammatory genes expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level to ensure the appropriate level of the host inflammatory response.",

In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as in human, a same histone lysine residue (e.g. H3K4 or H3K36) can be a potential target substrate for various different histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs). Using powerful genetic tool in Arabidopsis, we here investigate the interplay between two close HKMT homologues, SET DOMAIN GROUP 8 (SDG8) and SDG26, in regulating transcription and plant growth and development. We show that the sdg8 mutation is epistatic to the sdg26 one, leading to a sdg8 sdg26 double mutant exhibiting defects similar to sdg8 (reduced level of H3K36me3, increased level of H3K36me1, reduced plant body size, early flowering associated with reduced expression of FLC and MAFs and increased expression of FT and SOC1), but opposite to sdg26 (increased rosette size, late flowering associated with increased FLC and MAF5 expression and reduced FT and SOC1 expression). In parallel to the finding of the epistasis of SDG8, our study also unravels novel functions of SDG26 in H3K36me1 deposition and in the interplay with SDG8 in regulating the genome-wide gene expression. The implication of various HKMTs in establishing different forms of histone methylation and gene-context-specific chromatin modifications likely provides an advantageous mechanism for the regulation of transcription to cope with complex and plastic growth and developmental programs in plants and possibly also in other organisms.",

We investigated the transcriptional network governed by HNF1 in an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco2). We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by direct sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify HNF1 binding sites genome-wide. Direct targets of HNF1 were validated using conventional ChIP assays and confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of HNF1, followed by RT-qPCR. Gene ontology process enrichment analysis of the HNF1 targets identified multiple processes with a role in intestinal epithelial cell function, including properties of the cell membrane, cellular response to hormones, and regulation of biosynthetic processes. Approximately 50% of HNF1 binding sites were also occupied by other members of the intestinal transcriptional network, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 4A (HNF4A), caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and forkhead box A2 (FOXA2). Depletion of HNF1 in Caco2 cells increases FOXA2 abundance and decreases levels of CDX2, illustrating the coordinated activities of the network.

Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) protein, also termed as merlin, is a well-known tumor suppressor; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect has not yet been fully defined. To investigate the role of NF2 in the invasiveness of GBM, we used two GBM cell lines: NF2-expressing T98G cells and NF2-deficient A172 cells. Knockdown of NF2 increased the invasiveness of T98G cells, whereas NF2-overexpressing A172 cells showed decreased invasive activity. Moreover, re-expression of NF2 reversed the high invasiveness of NF2-silenced T98G cells, indicating that NF2 negatively regulates GBM invasiveness. We further found that the NF2-mediated regulation of invasiveness was dependent on YAP and TEAD2 expression levels. NF2 also controlled the expression of YAP targets, including cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61/CCN1), by regulating the nuclear localization of YAP. Silencing of CYR61/CCN1 blocked the increased invasiveness of T98G cells, suggesting that CYR61/CCN1 is required for NF2-mediated invasiveness. Through microRNA microarray analysis, we found that NF2 negatively regulates the expression of miR-296-3p. Overexpression of miR-296-3p suppressed the expression of STAT5A, induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 by downregulating SOCS2, and increased the invasiveness of T98G cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that NF2 negatively controls the invasiveness of GBM through YAP-dependent induction of CYR61/CCN1 and miR-296-3p.",

The upregulated RRM2 translocated to the nucleus for DNA repair. Further study showed that E2F3 transactivated RRM2 expression by directly binding to its promoter after MNNG exposure. The transactivation was enhanced by the upregulation of NFY, which bound to the RRM2 promoter adjacent to the E2F3 binding site and interacted with E2F3. In response to MNNG treatment, E2F3 accumulated mainly through its phosphorylation at S124 and was dependent on ATR\u2013CHK1 signaling. In comparison, p53R2 played a relatively weaker role in the MNNG-induced DNA damage response, and its transcription was regulated by the ATR\u2013CHK2\u2013E2F1/p53 pathway.We suggest that MNNG-stimulated ATR/CHK1 signaling stabilizes E2F3 by S124 phosphorylation, and then E2F3 together with NFY co-transactivate RRM2 expression for DNA repair.We propose a new mechanism for RRM2 regulation to maintain genome stability in response to environmental chemical carcinogens.",

NF-YA is present in two alternatively spliced isoforms, NF-YAs and NF-YAl, differing in 28 aminoacids in the N-terminal Q-rich activation domain. NF-YAs has been identified as a regulator of stemness and proliferation in mouse embryonic cells (mESCs) and human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs), whereas the role of NF-YAl is not clear. In the muscle system, NF-YA expression is observed in proliferating cells, but barely detectable in terminally differentiated cells in vitro and adult skeletal muscle in vivo. Here, we show that NF-YA inactivation in mouse myoblasts impairs both proliferation and differentiation. The overexpression of the two NF-YA isoforms differentially affects myoblasts fate: NF-YAs enhance cell proliferation, while NF-YAl boosts differentiation. The molecular mechanisms were investigated by expression profilings, detailing the opposite programs of the two isoforms. Bioinformatic analysis of the regulated promoters failed to detect a significant presence of CCAAT boxes in the regulated genes. NF-YAl activates directly Mef2D, Six genes, and p57kip2 (Cdkn1c), and indirectly the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). Specifically, Cdkn1c activation is induced by NF-Y binding to its CCAAT promoter and by reducing the expression of the lncRNA Kcnq1ot1, a negative regulator of Cdkn1c transcription. Overall, our results indicate that NF-YA alternative splicing is an influential muscle cell determinant, through direct regulation of selected cell cycle blocking genes, and, directly and indirectly, of muscle-specific transcription factors.",

Mouse insulinoma \u03b2TC6 cells stably expressing a small hairpin RNA targeting HuD (shHuD) (\u03b2TC6-shHuD) contained higher TG levels compared to control cells.

We identified Insig1 mRNA as a direct target of HuD by using ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation (RIP) and biotin pulldown analyses. By associating with the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u02b9UTR) of Insig1 mRNA, HuD promoted INSIG1 translation; accordingly, HuD downregulation reduced while ectopic HuD expression increased INSIG1 levels. We further observed that HuD downregulation facilitated the nuclear localization of SREBP1c, thereby increasing the transcriptional activity of SREBP1c and the expression of target genes involved in lipogenesis; likewise, we observed lower INSIG1 levels in the pancreatic islets of HuD-null mice.

Nonetheless, it is clear that linker histones are essential for both the assembly and maintenance of the condensed chromatin fiber. Interestingly, linker histones are post-translationally modified and how this affects both their binding to chromatin and functions is now beginning to emerge. In addition, linker histones are highly mobile in vivo, but not in vitro. No explanation of this finding is reported for the moment. The higher mobility of the linker histones should, however, have strong impact on their function. Linker histones plays an important role in gene expression regulation and other chromatin related process and their function is predominantly regulated by their posttranslational modifications. However, the detailed mechanism how the linker histones do function remains still not well understood despite numerous efforts. Here we will summarize and analyze the data on the linker histone binding to the nucleosome and the chromatin fiber and will discuss its functional consequences.

H1.1, H1.2, H1.3, H1.4 and H1.5 are present in most somatic cells, whereas other subtypes are mainly expressed in more specialized cells.H1 subtypes have been shown to have unique functions in chromatin structure and dynamics. This can occur at least in part via specific post-translational modifications of distinct H1 subtypes. However, while core histone modifications have been extensively studied, our knowledge of H1 modifications and their molecular functions has remained for a long time limited to phosphorylation. In this review we discuss the current state of knowledge of linker histone H1 modifications and where possible highlight functional differences in the modifications of distinct H1 subtypes.H1 histones are intensely post-translationally modified. These modifications are located in the N- and C-terminal tails as well as within the globular domain. Recently, advanced mass spectrometrical analysis revealed a large number of novel histone H1 subtype specific modification sites and types. H1 modifications include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and ADP ribosylation. They are involved in the regulation of all aspects of linker histone functions, however their mechanism of action is often only poorly understood. Therefore systematic functional characterization of H1 modifications will be necessary in order to better understand their role in gene regulation as well as in higher-order chromatin structure and dynamics.

The H1 family constitutes the most heterogeneous group of histone proteins, with eleven non-allelic H1 variants in mammals. H1 variants differ in their biochemical properties and exhibit significant sequence divergence from one another, yet most of them are highly conserved during evolution from mouse to human. H1 variants are differentially regulated during development and their cellular compositions undergo dramatic changes in embryogenesis, gametogenesis, tissue maturation and cellular differentiation.

Unlike core histones, the linker histone H1 family is evolutionarily diverse and many organisms have multiple H1 variants or subtypes, distinguishable between germ-line and somatic cells. In mammals, the H1 family includes seven somatic H1 variants with a prevalence that varies between cell types and over the course of differentiation, H1.1 to H1.5 being expressed in a replication-dependent manner, whereas H1.0 and H1X are replication-independent. Until recently, it has not been known whether the different variants had specific roles in the regulation of nuclear processes or were differentially distributed across the genome. To address this, an increasing effort has been made to investigate divergent features among H1 variants, regarding their structure, expression patterns, chromatin dynamics, post-translational modifications and genome-wide distribution. Although H1 subtypes seem to have redundant functions, several reports point to the idea that they are also differently involved in specific cellular processes. Initial studies investigating the genomic distribution of H1 variants have started to suggest that despite a wide overlap, different variants may be enriched or preferentially located at different chromatin types, but this may depend on the cell type, the relative abundance of the variants, the differentiation state of the cell, or whether cells are derived from a neoplastic process.

     "abstract": "In the present review, we summarize advances in our knowledge on the role of the histone H1 family of proteins in breast cancer cells, focusing on their response to progestins. Histone H1 plays a dual role in gene regulation by hormones, both as a structural component of chromatin and as a dynamic modulator of transcription. It contributes to hormonal regulation of the MMTV promoter by stabilizing a homogeneous nucleosome positioning, which reduces basal transcription whereas at the same time promoting progesterone receptor binding and nucleosome remodeling. These combined effects enhance hormone dependent gene transcription, which eventually requires H1 phosphorylation and displacement. Various isoforms of histone H1 have specific functions in differentiated breast cancer cells and compact nucleosomal arrays to different extents in vitro. Genome-wide studies show that histone H1 has a key role in chromatin dynamics of hormone regulated genes. A complex sequence of enzymatic events, including phosphorylation by CDK2, PARylation by PARP1 and the ATP-dependent activity of NURF, are required for H1 displacement and gene de-repression, as a prerequisite for further nucleosome remodeling. Similarly, during hormone-dependent gene repression a dedicated enzymatic mechanism controls H1 deposition at promoters by a complex containing HP1\u03b3, LSD1 and BRG1, the ATPase of the BAF complex. Thus, a broader vision of the histone code should include histone H1, as the linker histone variants actively participate in the regulation of the chromatin structure. How modifications of the core histones tails affect H1 modifications and vice versa is one of the many questions that remains to be addressed to provide a more comprehensive view of the histone cross-talk mechanisms.

TEs can duplicate, mobilize, and recombine normal genes or gene fragments, with the potential to generate new genes or modify the structure of existing genes. TEs also donate their transposase coding regions for cellular functions in a process called TE domestication. Despite the host defense against TE activity, a subset of TEs survived and thrived through discreet selection of transposition activity, target site, element size, and the internal sequence.

Here, we report that transcription of human glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP) in regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) is tightly regulated by two alternative promoters. An intragenic promoter contains several CpGs and acts as a weak promoter that is demethylated and initiates transcription Treg-specifically. The strong up-stream promoter containing a CpG-island is, in contrast, fully demethylated throughout tissues. Transcriptional activity of the strong promoter was surprisingly down-regulated upon demethylation of the weak promoter. This demethylation-induced transcriptional attenuation regulated the magnitude of GARP expression and correlated with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. Treg-specific GARP transcription was initiated by synergistic interaction of forkhead box protein 3 (Foxp3) with nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and was underpinned by permissive chromatin remodeling caused by release of the H3K4 demethylase, PLU-1. Our findings describe a novel function of alternative promoters in regulating the extent of transcription. Moreover, since GARP functions as a transporter of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), a cytokine with broad pleiotropic traits, GARP transcriptional attenuation by alternative promoters might provide a mechanism regulating peripheral TGF\u03b2 to avoid unwanted harmful effects.",

The presented works describe a novel mechanism and molecular target to downregulate kRAS expression \u2014 a previously undescribed G-quadruplex (G4) secondary structure within the proximal promoter acting as a transcriptional silencer. There are three distinct guanine-rich regions within the core kRAS promoter, including a previously examined region (G4near). Of these regions, the most distal region does not form an inducible and stable structure, whereas the two more proximal regions (termed near and mid) do form strong G4s. G4near is predominantly a tri-stacked structure with a discontinuous guanine run incorporated; G4mid consists of seven distinct runs of continuous guanines and forms numerous competing isoforms, including a stable three-tetrad stacked mixed parallel and antiparallel loop structures with longer loops of up to 10 nucleotides. Comprehensive analysis of the regulation of transcription by higher order structures has revealed that the guanine-rich region in the middle of the core promoter, termed G4mid, is a stronger repressor of promoter activity than G4near. Using the extensive guanine-rich region of the kRAS core promoter, and particularly the G4mid structure, as the primary target, future drug discovery programs will have potential to develop a potent, specifically targeted small molecule to be used in the treatment of pancreatic, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.",

In this study we used CoQ0 (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, zero isoprenoid side-chains), a novel quinone derivative, and investigated its molecular actions against LPS-induced inflammation and redox imbalance in murine RAW264.7 macrophages and mice. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, non-cytotoxic concentrations of CoQ0 (2.5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibited iNOS/COX-2 protein expressions with subsequent reductions of NO, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 secretions. This inhibition was reasoned by suppression of NF\u03baB (p65) activation, and inhibition of AP-1 (c-Jun., c-Fos, ATF2) translocation. Our findings indicated that IKK\u03b1-mediated I-\u03baB degradation and MAPK-signaling are involved in regulation of NF\u03baB/AP-1 activation. Furthermore, CoQ0 triggered HO-1 and NQO-1 genes through increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and Nrf2/ARE-signaling. This phenomenon was confirmed by diminished CoQ0 protective effects in Nrf2 knockdown cells, where LPS-induced NO, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 productions remained high. Molecular evidence revealed that CoQ0 enhanced Nrf2 steady-state level at both transcriptional and translational levels. CoQ0-induced Nrf2 activation appears to be regulated by ROS\u2013JNK-signaling cascades, as evidenced by suppressed Nrf2 activation upon treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of ROS (N-acetylcysteine) and JNK (SP600125). Besides, oral administration of CoQ0 (5\u00a0mg/kg) suppressed LPS-induced (1\u00a0mg/kg) induction of iNOS/COX-2 and TNF-\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2 through tight regulation of NF\u03baB/Nrf2 signaling in mice liver and spleen. Our findings conclude that pharmacological actions of CoQ0 are mediated via inhibition of NF\u03baB/AP-1 activation and induction of Nrf2/ARE-signaling.

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate insulin secretion, pancreas development, and beta cell differentiation. In this study, to screen for miRNAs and their targets that function during insulin-producing cells (IPCs) formation, we examined the messenger RNA and microRNA expression profiles of pancreatic progenitor cells (PPCs) and IPCs using microarray and deep sequencing approaches, respectively. Combining our data with that from previous reports, we found that miR-21 and its targets play an important role in the formation of IPCs. However, the function of miR-21 in the formation of IPCs from PPCs is poorly understood. Therefore, we over-expressed or inhibited miR-21 and expressed small interfering RNAs of miR-21 targets in PPCs to investigate their functions in IPCs formation. We found that miR-21 acts as a bidirectional switch in the formation of IPCs by regulating the expression of target and downstream genes (SOX6, RPBJ and HES1). Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down these genes in PPCs to investigate their effects on IPCs formation. Single expression of si-RBPJ, si-SOX6 and si-HES1 in PPCs showed that si-RBPJ was an inhibitor, and that si-SOX6 and si-HES1 were promoters of IPCs formation, although si-HES1 induced formation of IPCs at higher rates than si-SOX6. These results suggest that endogenous miRNAs involved in the formation of IPCs from PPCs should be considered in the development of an effective cell transplant therapy for diabetes.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic homeostasis is achieved through balanced energy storage and output. Impairment of energy expenditure is a hallmark event in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Previously we have shown that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) disrupts energy expenditure in skeletal muscle cells via hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1)-class II transactivator (CIITA) dependent repression of SIRT1 transcription. Here we report that repression of SIRT1 transcription by IFN-\u03b3 paralleled loss of histone acetylation on the SIRT1 promoter region with simultaneous recruitment of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). IFN-\u03b3 activated HDAC4 in vitro and in vivo by up-regulating its expression and stimulating its nuclear accumulation. HIC1 and CIITA recruited HDAC4 to the SIRT1 promoter and cooperated with HDAC4 to repress SIRT1 transcription. HDAC4 depletion by small interfering RNA or pharmaceutical inhibition normalized histone acetylation on the SIRT1 promoter and restored SIRT1 expression in the presence of IFN-\u03b3. Over-expression of HDAC4 suppressed the transcription of genes involved in energy expenditure in a SIRT1-dependent manner. In contrast, HDAC4 knockdown/inhibition neutralized the effect of IFN-\u03b3 on cellular metabolism by normalizing SIRT1 expression. Therefore, our data reveal a role for HDAC4 in regulating cellular energy output and as such provide insights into rationalized design of novel anti-diabetic therapeutics.",

To determine the molecular markers of immune response activation when using RNAi reagents, we analyzed the results of experiments gathered in the RNAimmuno (v 2.0) and GEO Profiles databases.

We demonstrate that RNAi reagents induce a broad variety of sequence-non-specific effects, including the deregulation of cellular miRNA levels.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mass spectrometry analyses on SOD1 promoter highlighted the formation of a transcriptional complex bound to the ARE sequences. Western Blotting experiments showed that in our in vitro model, H2O2 exposure increases Nrf2 expression in the nuclear fraction while immunoprecipitation confirmed its phosphorylation and release from Keap1 inhibition. However, H2O2 treatment did not modify Nrf2 binding on SOD1 promoter, which seems to be regulated by different transcription factors (TFs).Although our data suggest that SOD1 is transcriptionally regulated in response to OS, Nrf2 does not appear to associate with SOD1 promoter in this cellular model of neurodegeneration.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in both normal development and diseases including cancer. Here, we elucidated the expression of lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and defined its functional role in the regulation of BTB function as well as its possible molecular mechanisms. Our results proved that MALAT1 expression was up-regulated in brain microvessels of human glioma and glioma endothelial cells (GECs) which were obtained by co-culturing endothelial cells with glioma cells. Functionally, knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in an impairment and increased the permeability of BTB as well as decreased the expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Further, there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-140, and miR-140 mediated the effects that MALAT1 knockdown exerted. Mechanistic investigations defined that nuclear factor YA (NFYA), a CCAAT box-binding transcription factor, was a direct and functional downstream target of miR-140, which was involved in the MALAT1 knockdown induced regulation of BTB function. Furthermore, NFYA could up-regulate the promoter activities and bind to the promoters of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Taken together, we have demonstrated the fact that knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in the increased permeability of BTB, which might contribute to establishing potential therapeutic strategies for human gliomas.",

Unlike their lower counterparts that are directly involved in the extending of lifespan, mammalian SIRTs mainly function in metabolism and cellular homeostasis, among them, SIRT7 is the least understood. SIRT7 is localized in the nucleus and rich in nucleoli associated with RNA polymerase I, and correlated with cell proliferation. In contrast, SIRT7 has recently been demonstrated to specifically deacetylate H3K18ac in the chromatin, and in most cases represses proliferation. Although MicroRNA as miR-125b has been reported to down-regulate SIRT7 by binding to its 3'UTR, however, how SIRT7 gene is regulated remains unclear. Here, we identified the transcription initiation site of human SIRT7 gene at the upstream 23rd A nucleotide respective to the translational codon, and the SIRT7 is a TATA-less and initiator-less gene. The sequences in the upstream region between \u2212\u00a0256 and \u2212\u00a0129\u00a0bp are identical with important functions in the three species detected.

However, we previously showed that RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III) from mouse B2 SINE could be polyadenylated in an AAUAAA-dependent manner. Many species of mammalian SINEs end with the pol III transcriptional terminator (TTTTT) and contain hexamers AATAAA in their A-rich tail. Such SINEs were united into Class T+, whereas SINEs lacking the terminator and AATAAA sequences were classified as T\u2212. Here we studied the structural features of SINE pol III transcripts that are necessary for their polyadenylation. Eight and six SINE families from classes T+ and T\u2212, respectively, were analyzed. The replacement of AATAAA with AACAAA in T+ SINEs abolished the RNA polyadenylation. Interestingly, insertion of the polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) and pol III transcription terminator in T\u2212 SINEs did not result in polyadenylation. The detailed analysis of three T+ SINEs (B2, DIP, and VES) revealed areas important for the polyadenylation of their pol III transcripts: the polyadenylation signal and terminator in A-rich tail, \u03b2 region positioned immediately downstream of the box B of pol III promoter, and \u03c4 region located upstream of the tail. In DIP and VES (but not in B2), the \u03c4 region is a polypyrimidine motif which is also characteristic of many other T+ SINEs.

Whereas strong evidence supports a key role of BAs and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) for the control of FGF19 expression, information on other regulators is limited. In mice, FGF15 expression (ortholog of human FGF19) is induced by vitamin A (VitA) in an FXR-dependent manner. However, the significance of this finding for human FGF19 is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that VitA derivatives induce FGF19 in human intestinal cell lines by a direct transcriptional mechanism. In contrast to mouse FGF15, however, this direct regulation is not dependent on FXR but mediated by retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and their interaction with a novel DR-5 element in the human FGF19 gene. In addition to this direct effect, VitA derivatives impacted on the BA-mediated control of FGF19 by regulation of FXR protein levels. In conclusion, VitA regulates human FGF19 expression through FXR-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, we suggest that considerable mechanistic differences exist between humans and mice with regard to the nuclear receptors controlling the VitA-FGF15/19 axis. These findings may implicate a clinical relevance of RAR-activating VitA derivatives for the regulation of FGF19 levels in humans.",

Using a yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified a putative Phytochrome-Interacting bHLH Factor (OsPIF14), as binding to the OsDREB1B promoter. bHLH proteins are able to bind to hexameric E-box (CANNTG) or N-box (CACG(A/C)G) motifs, depending on transcriptional activity. We have shown that OsPIF14 binds to the OsDREB1B promoter through two N-boxes and that the flanking regions of the hexameric core are essential for protein\u2013DNA interaction and stability. We also showed that OsPIF14 down-regulates OsDREB1B gene expression in rice protoplasts, corroborating the OsPIF14 repressor activity observed in the transactivation assays using Arabidopsis protoplasts. In addition, we showed that OsPIF14 is indeed a phytochrome interacting factor, which preferentially binds to the active form (Pfr) of rice phytochrome B. This raises the possibility that OsPIF14 activity might be modulated by light. However, we did not observe any regulation of the OsDREB1B gene expression by light under control conditions. Moreover, OsPIF14 gene expression was shown to be modulated by different treatments, such as drought, salt, cold and ABA. Interestingly, OsPIF14 showed also a specific cold-induced alternative splicing. All together, these results suggest the possibility that OsPIF14 is involved in cross-talk between light and stress signaling through interaction with the OsDREB1B promoter. Although in the absence of stress, OsDREB1B gene expression was not regulated by light, given previous reports, it remains possible that OsPIF14 has a role in light modulation of stress responses.",

Previously, we described Cbc1 to be required for cell growth under osmotic stress and to mediate osmostress-induced translation reprogramming. Here, we observe delayed global transcription kinetics in cbc1\u0394 during osmotic stress that correlates with delayed recruitment of TBP and RNA polymerase II to osmo-induced promoters. Interestingly, we detect an interaction between Cbc1 and the MAPK Hog1, which controls most gene expression changes during osmostress, and observe that deletion of CBC1 delays the accumulation of the activator complex Hot1\u2013Hog1 at osmostress promoters. Additionally, CBC1 deletion specifically reduces transcription rates of highly transcribed genes under non-stress conditions, such as ribosomal protein (RP) genes, while having low impact on transcription of weakly expressed genes. For RP genes, we show that recruitment of the specific activator Rap1, and subsequently TBP, to promoters is Cbc1-dependent. Altogether, our results indicate that binding of Cbc1 to the capped mRNAs is necessary for the accumulation of specific activators as well as PIC components at the promoters of genes whose expression requires high and rapid transcription.",

Depletion of SETD6 from cells results in elevated Nrf2 levels and a significant increase in Nrf2 antioxidant target gene expression. Using proteomic tools, we uncovered a novel interaction between SETD6 and the oxidative stress sensor DJ1, a protein required for Nrf2-dependent transcription of antioxidant target genes. We show that SETD6 binds DJ1 both in-vitro and in cells but does not methylate DJ1. Under basal conditions, SETD6 and DJ1 are associated at chromatin. Through this interaction, SETD6 inhibits DJ1 activity, which in turn leads to the repression of Nrf2-dependent transcription. In response to oxidative stress, the transcription of Nrf2 antioxidant genes increases. We here show that under this condition, SETD6 mRNA and protein levels are reduced, leading to elevation in Nrf2 expression level and to a weaken interaction between SETD6 and DJ1 at chromatin.Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SETD6 negatively regulates the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response through a physical and catalytically independent interaction with DJ1 at chromatin.",

     "abstract": "Over the last decade, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a fundamental molecular class whose members play pivotal roles in the regulation of the genome. The observation of pervasive transcription of mammalian genomes in the early 2000s sparked a revolution in the understanding of information flow in eukaryotic cells and the incredible flexibility and dynamic nature of the transcriptome. As a molecular class, distinct loci yielding lncRNAs are set to outnumber those yielding mRNAs. However, like many important discoveries, the road leading to uncovering this diverse class of molecules that act through a remarkable repertoire of mechanisms, was not a straight one. The same characteristic that most distinguishes lncRNAs from mRNAs, i.e. their developmental-stage, tissue-, and cell-specific expression, was one of the major impediments to their discovery and recognition as potentially functional regulatory molecules. With growing numbers of lncRNAs being assigned to biological functions, the specificity of lncRNA expression is now increasingly recognized as a characteristic that imbues lncRNAs with great potential as biomarkers and for the development of highly targeted therapeutics. Here we review the history of lncRNA research and how technological advances and insight into biological complexity have gone hand-in-hand in shaping this revolution. We anticipate that as increasing numbers of these molecules, often described as the dark matter of the genome, are characterized and the structure\u2013function relationship of lncRNAs becomes better understood, it may ultimately be feasible to decipher what these non-(protein)-coding genes encode.

     "abstract": "The field of structural biology has the unique advantage of being able to provide a comprehensive picture of biological mechanisms at the molecular and atomic level. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the new frontier in the molecular biology of complex organisms yet remain the least characterised of all the classes of RNA. Thousands of new lncRNAs are being reported each year yet very little structural data exists for this rapidly expanding field. The length of lncRNAs ranges from 200\u00a0nt to over 100\u00a0kb in length and they generally exhibit low cellular abundance. Therefore, obtaining sufficient quantities of lncRNA to use for structural analysis is challenging. However, as technologies develop structures of lncRNAs are starting to emerge providing important information regarding their mechanism of action. Here we review the current methods used to determine the structure of lncRNA and lncRNA:protein complexes and describe the significant contribution structural biology has and will make to the field of lncRNA research.

Similarly, emerging \u2018epitranscriptomics\u2019 research has shown that chemically modified nucleosides, thought to be largely the domain of tRNAs and other infrastructural RNAs, are far more widespread and can exert unexpected influence on RNA utilization. Both areas are characterized by the often-ephemeral nature of the subject matter in that few individual examples have been fully assessed for their molecular or cellular function, and effects might often be subtle and cumulative.

Small RNAs, including microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs, assemble with Argonaute (Ago) family proteins into the effector complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates sequence-specific target gene silencing. RISC assembly is not a simple binding between a small RNA and Ago; rather, it follows an ordered multi-step pathway that requires specific accessory factors. Some steps of RISC assembly and RISC-mediated gene silencing are dependent on or facilitated by particular intracellular platforms, suggesting their spatial regulation. In this review, we summarize the currently known mechanisms for RISC assembly of each small RNA class and propose a revised model for the role of the chaperone machinery in the duplex-initiated RISC assembly pathway.

     "abstract": "Genomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning. Whereas others act via transcriptional occlusion or transcriptional collision-based mechanisms. By establishing genomic imprinting of target genes, the lncRNAs play a critical role in important biological functions, such as placental and embryonic growth, pluripotency maintenance, cell differentiation, and neural-related functions such as synaptic development and plasticity. An emerging consensus from the recent evidence is that the imprinted lncRNAs fine-tune gene expression of the protein-coding genes to maintain their dosage in cell. Hence, lncRNAs from imprinted clusters offer insights into their mode of action, and these mechanisms have been the basis for uncovering the mode of action of lncRNAs in several other biological contexts.

In the event of X chromosome inactivation, robust epigenetic marks are established in a long noncoding Xist RNA-dependent manner, giving rise to a distinct epigenetic landscape on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). The X inactivation center (Xic) is essential for induction of X chromosome inactivation and harbors two topologically associated domains (TADs) to regulate monoallelic Xist expression: one at the noncoding Xist gene and its upstream region, and the other at the antisense Tsix and its upstream region. The monoallelic expression of Xist is tightly regulated by these two functionally distinct TADs as well as their constituting lncRNAs and proteins. In this review, we summarize recent updates in our knowledge of lncRNAs found at the Xic and discuss their overall mechanisms of action.

Many of these transcripts have a 5\u2032 cap and a poly(A) tail, yet some of the most abundant long noncoding RNAs are processed in unexpected ways and lack these canonical structures. Here, I highlight the mechanisms by which several of these well-characterized noncoding RNAs are generated, stabilized, and function. The MALAT1 and MEN \u03b2 (NEAT1_2) long noncoding RNAs each accumulate to high levels in the nucleus, where they play critical roles in cancer progression and the formation of nuclear paraspeckles, respectively. Nevertheless, MALAT1 and MEN \u03b2 are not polyadenylated as the tRNA biogenesis machinery generates their mature 3\u2032 ends. In place of a poly(A) tail, these transcripts are stabilized by highly conserved triple helical structures. Sno-lncRNAs likewise lack poly(A) tails and instead have snoRNA structures at their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Recent work has additionally identified a number of abundant circular RNAs generated by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery that are resistant to degradation by exonucleases. As these various transcripts use non-canonical strategies to ensure their stability, it is becoming increasingly clear that long noncoding RNAs may often be regulated by unique post-transcriptional control mechanisms.

The alteration of the transcriptome is not restricted to the production of aberrant levels of protein-coding RNAs, but also refers to the dysregulation of the expression of the multiple noncoding members that comprise the human genome.

These over-estimates were drawn from the inherent developmental and stimuli-responsive complexity found in humans and other mammals, when compared to lower eukaryotic organisms. This left a conceptual void in many cellular networks, as a new class of functional molecules was necessary for \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the basic proteomic machinery. Transcriptomics analyses have determined that the vast majority of the genetic material is transcribed as noncoding RNA, suggesting that these molecules could provide the functional diversity initially sought from proteins. Indeed, as discussed in this review, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), the largest family of noncoding transcripts, have emerged as common regulators of many cellular stressors; including heat shock, metabolic deprivation and DNA damage. These stimuli, while divergent in nature, share some common stress-responsive pathways, notably inhibition of cell proliferation. This role intrinsically makes stress-responsive lncRNA regulators potential tumor suppressor or proto-oncogenic genes.

     "abstract": "The membrane-bound mucin MUC4 is a high molecular weight glycoprotein frequently deregulated in cancer. In pancreatic cancer, one of the most deadly cancers in occidental countries, MUC4 is neo-expressed in the preneoplastic stages and thereafter is involved in cancer cell properties leading to cancer progression and chemoresistance. K-ras oncogene is a small GTPase of the RAS superfamily, highly implicated in cancer. K-ras mutations are considered as an initiating event of pancreatic carcinogenesis and K-ras oncogenic activities are necessary components of cancer progression. However, K-ras remains clinically undruggable. Targeting early downstream K-ras signaling in cancer may thus appear as an interesting strategy and MUC4 regulation by K-ras in pancreatic carcinogenesis remains unknown. Using the Pdx1-Cre; LStopL-K-rasG12D mouse model of pancreatic carcinogenesis, we show that the in vivo early neo-expression of the mucin Muc4 in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic lesions (PanINs) induced by mutated K-ras is correlated with the activation of ERK, JNK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. In vitro, transfection of constitutively activated K-rasG12V in pancreatic cancer cells led to the transcriptional upregulation of MUC4. This activation was found to be mediated at the transcriptional level by AP-1 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors via MAPK, JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways and at the post-transcriptional level by a mechanism involving the RalB GTPase. Altogether, these results identify MUC4 as a transcriptional and post-transcriptional target of K-ras in pancreatic cancer. This opens avenues in developing new approaches to target the early steps of this deadly cancer.",

One of the transcription factors activated through this pathway is Hot1, which contributes to the control of the expression of several genes involved in glycerol synthesis and flux, or in other functions related to adaptation to adverse conditions. This work provides new data about the interaction mechanism of this transcription factor with DNA. By means of one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility assays, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region, which corresponds to amino acids 610\u2013719, is the DNA-binding domain of Hot1. We also describe how this domain recognizes sequence 5\u2019-GGGACAAA-3\u2019 located in the promoter of gene STL1. The bioinformatics analysis carried out in this work allowed the identification of identical or similar sequences (with up to two mismatches) in the promoter of other Hot1 targets, where central element GGACA was quite conserved among them. Finally, we found that small variations in the sequence recognized by Hot1 may influence its ability to recognize its targets in vivo.",

In the last few years several high-throughput screenings have generated a plethora of data, which are difficult to compare due to the different experimental designs and models explored. In this study by using the Affymetrix Exon Arrays, we were able to assess and compare the effects of both TDP-43 and FUS loss-of-function on the whole transcriptome using the same human neuronal SK-N-BE cell model. We showed that TDP-43 and FUS depletion induces splicing and gene expression changes mainly distinct for the two RBPs, although they may regulate common pathways, including neuron differentiation and cytoskeleton organization as evidenced by functional annotation analysis. In particular, TDP-43 and FUS were found to regulate splicing and expression of genes related to neuronal (SEPT6, SULT4A1, TNIK) and RNA metabolism (DICER, ELAVL3/HuC, POLDIP3). Our extended analysis at protein level revealed that these changes have also impact on the protein isoform ratio and content, not always in a direct correlation with transcriptomic data. Contrarily to a loss-of-function mechanism, we showed that mutant TDP-43 proteins maintained their splicing activity in human ALS fibroblasts and experimental cell lines. Our findings further contribute to define the biological functions of these two RBPs in physiological and disease state, strongly encouraging the evaluation of the identified transcriptomic changes at protein level in neuronal experimental models.",

Differentiated intestinal epithelial cells produce antimicrobial and regenerative components that protect against such challenges. Few intestinal specific transcription factors have been identified to control the switching from repression to activation of this class of gene. Herein, we show that gene transcription of some regenerating islet-derived (REG) family members is dependent on the transcription factor GATA-4. Silencing of GATA-4 expression in cultured intestinal epithelial cells identified Reg3\u03b2 as a target gene using an unbiased approach of gene expression profiling. Co-transfection and RNA interference assays identified complex GATA-4-interactive transcriptional components required for the activation or repression of Reg3\u03b2 gene activity. Conditional deletion of Gata4 in the mouse intestinal epithelium supported its regulatory role for Reg1, Reg3\u03b1, Reg3\u03b2 and Reg3\u03b3 genes. Reg1 dramatic down-modulation of expression in Gata4 conditional null mice was associated with a significant decrease in intestinal epithelial cell migration.

     "abstract": "Excessive mitochondrial fission is associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) possesses specific fission activity in the mitochondria and peroxisomes. Various post-translational modifications of Drp1 are known to modulate complex mitochondrial dynamics. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of Drp1 remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) regulates Drp1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. hnRNP A1 directly interacts with Drp1 mRNA at its 3\u2032UTR region, and enhances translation potential without affecting mRNA stability. Down-regulation of hnRNP A1 induces mitochondrial elongation by reducing Drp1 expression. Moreover, depletion of hnRNP A1 suppresses 3-NP-mediated mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. In contrast, over-expression of hnRNP A1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation by increasing Drp1 expression. Additionally, hnRNP A1 significantly exacerbates 3-NP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, treatment with 3-NP induces subcellular translocation of hnRNP A1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which accelerates the increase in Drp1 expression in hnRNP A1 over-expressing cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that hnRNP A1 controls mitochondrial dynamics by post-transcriptional regulation of Drp1.",

     "abstract": "Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) is a common characteristic of solid tumors and strongly correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to treatment. In response to hypoxia, cells initiate a cascade of transcriptional events regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) heterodimer. Since the oxygen-sensitive HIF-1\u03b1 subunit is stabilized during hypoxia, it functions as the regulatory subunit of the protein. To date, while the mechanisms governing HIF-1\u03b1 protein stabilization and function have been well studied, those governing HIF1A gene expression are not fully understood. However, recent studies have suggested that methylation of a HIF-1 binding site in the HIF1A promoter prevents its autoregulation. Here we report that the POZ-ZF transcription factor Kaiso modulates HIF1A gene expression by binding to the methylated HIF1A promoter in a region proximal to the autoregulatory HIF-1 binding site. Interestingly, Kaiso's regulation of HIF1A occurs primarily during hypoxia, which is consistent with the finding that Kaiso protein levels peak after 4\u00a0h of hypoxic incubation and return to normoxic levels after 24\u00a0h. Our data thus support a role for Kaiso in fine-tuning HIF1A gene expression after extended periods of hypoxia.",

     "abstract": "In metazoans, DNA replication is a highly regulated and ordered process that occurs during the S phase of cell cycle. It begins with the licensing of origins of replication usually found in close proximity of actively transcribing genes owing perhaps to a profound influence of transcription factors on the epigenetic signatures and architecture of chromatin. Here we show that ETS transcription factors are novel regulators of MCM4 origin, whose binding sites are localized between two divergently transcribing MCM4 and PRKDC genes. c-ETS1 and c-ETS2 were recruited to the MCM4 origin respectively during the S and G1 phases of cell cycle. c-ETS2 binding was facilitated by an active chromatin distinguished by acetylated histone H3 orchestrated by histone acetyl transferase GCN5 and followed by HBO1 mediated histone H4 acetylation. Interestingly, c-ETS2 overexpression led to increased BrdU incorporation in the S phase cells while its down-regulation by RNA interference compromised the loading of pre-replicative complex at the origin. Conversely, the recruitment of c-ETS1 at the origin coincided with histone H3 methylation signature characteristic of closed chromatin conformation. As expected, enforced expression of c-ETS1 severely compromised DNA replication whereas its down-regulation enhanced DNA replication as evident from increased BrdU incorporation. Thus, c-ETS transcription factors appear to be key regulators of MCM4 origin where c-ETS2 seems to promote DNA replication whereas c-ETS1 functions as a negative regulator.",

There are three PKA catalytic subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Tpk1, Tpk2, and Tpk3 and one regulatory subunit: Bcy1. Previously, it has been demonstrated that Tpk1 and Tpk2 are associated with coding regions and promoters of target genes in a carbon source and oxidative stress dependent manner. Here we studied five genes, ALD6, SED1, HSP42, RPS29B, and RPL1B whose expression is regulated by saline stress. We found that PKA catalytic and regulatory subunits are associated with both coding regions and promoters of the analyzed genes in a stress dependent manner. Tpk1 and Tpk2 recruitment was completely abolished in catalytic inactive mutants. BCY1 deletion changed the binding kinetic to chromatin of each Tpk isoform and this strain displayed a deregulated gene expression in response to osmotic stress. In addition, yeast mutants with high PKA activity exhibit sustained association to target genes of chromatin-remodeling complexes such as Snf2-catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex and Arp8-component of INO80 complex, leading to upregulation of gene expression during osmotic stress. Tpk1 accumulation in the nucleus was stimulated upon osmotic stress, while the nuclear localization of Tpk2 and Bcy1 showed no change. We found that each PKA subunit is transported into the nucleus by a different \u03b2-karyopherin pathway. Moreover, \u03b2-karyopherin mutant strains abolished the chromatin association of Tpk1 or Tpk2, suggesting that nuclear localization of PKA catalytic subunits is required for its association to target genes and properly gene expression.",

We found that Bud27 associates with pol III in active as well as repressed states. Pol III transcription and occupancy at the target genes reduce with the deletion of BUD27. It promotes the interaction of pol III with the chromatin remodeler RSC found on most of the pol III targets, and with the heat shock protein Ssa4, which helps in nuclear import of the assembled pol III. Under nutrient-starvation, Ssa4\u2013pol III interaction increases, while pol III remains inside the nucleus. Bud27 but not Ssa4 is required for RSC\u2013pol III interaction, which reduces under nutrient-starvation. In the bud27\u0394 cells, total protein level of the largest pol III subunit Rpc160 but not of Rpc128, Rpc34 and Rpc53 subunits is reduced. This is accompanied by lower transcription of RPC128 gene and lower RPC160 translation due to reduced association of mRNA with the ribosomes. The resultant alteration in the normal cellular ratio of the two largest subunits of pol III core leads to reduced association of other pol III subunits and hampers the normal assembly of pol III at an early step in the cytoplasm. Our results show that Bud27 is required in multiple activities responsible for pol III biogenesis and activity.",

In this paper, we investigate the transport into the nucleus of several large and small Pol II subunits in the mutants of genes involved in Pol II biogenesis. We also analyse subcellular localization in the presence of drugs that can potentially affect Pol II nuclear import. Our results show differences in the cellular distribution between large and small subunits when Pol II biogenesis was impaired.

However, RB proteins are functionally versatile, and numerous genetic and biochemical studies point to expansive roles in cellular growth control, pluripotency, and apoptotic response. For the vast majority of genes, RB family members target the E2F family of transcriptional activators as an integral component of its gene regulatory mechanism. These interactions are regulated via reversible phosphorylation by Cyclin/Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes, a major molecular mechanism that regulates transcriptional output of RB/E2F target genes. Recent studies indicate an additional level of regulation involving the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system that renders pervasive control over each component of the RB pathway. Disruption of the genetic circuitry for proteasome-mediated targeting of the RB pathway has serious consequences on development and cellular transformation, and is associated with several forms of human cancer.

     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the spatial association of critical genomic elements in the effect of TNF-\u03b1 on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression in human leukemia U937 cells. TNF-\u03b1 up-regulated MMP-9 protein expression and mRNA level in U937 cells, and Akt-mediated-NF\u03baB/p65 activation and JNK-mediated c-Jun activation were proven to be involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced MMP-9 up-regulation. Promoter luciferase activity assay revealed that NF\u03baB (nt-600) and AP-1 (nt-79) binding sites were crucial for TNF-\u03b1-induced transcription of MMP-9 gene. The results of a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that TNF-\u03b1 reduced histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) recruitment but increased p300 (a histone acetyltransferase) recruitment to MMP-9 promoter regions surrounding NF\u03baB and AP-1 binding sites. Consistently, TNF-\u03b1 increased enrichment of the acetylated histone H3 mark on MMP-9 promoter regions. DNA affinity purification assay revealed that p300 and HDAC1 could bind oligonucleotides containing AP-1/c-Jun and NF\u03baB/p65 binding sites. Chromosome conformation capture assay showed that TNF-\u03b1 stimulated chromosomal loops in the MMP-9 promoter via NF\u03baB/p65 and AP-1/c-Jun. The p300-associated acetyltransferase activity was crucial for p65/c-Jun-mediated DNA looping, and inhibition of HDAC activity increased the level of DNA looping. Reduction in the level of DNA looping eliminated all TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MMP-9 up-regulation. Taken together, our data suggest that p65/c-Jun-mediated DNA looping is involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced MMP-9 up-regulation and that the recruitment of p300 or HDAC1 to NF\u03baB and AP-1 binding sites modifies the level of DNA looping.",

     "abstract": "Expression of the antioxidant gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is primarily induced through NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated activation of the antioxidant response element (ARE). Gene transcription is coordinately regulated by transcription factor activity at enhancer elements and epigenetic alterations such as the posttranslational modification of histone proteins. However, the role of histone modifications in the Nrf2\u2013ARE axis remains largely uncharacterized. The environmental contaminant arsenite is a potent inducer of both HO-1 expression and phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10); therefore, we investigated the relationships between Nrf2 and H3S10 phosphorylation in arsenite-induced, ARE-dependent, transcriptional activation of the human HO-1 gene. Arsenite increased phosphorylation of H3S10 both globally and at the HO-1 promoter concomitantly with HO-1 transcription in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Conversely, arsenite-induced H3S10 phosphorylation and HO-1 expression were blocked by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125, and JNK knockdown (siJNK). Interestingly, ablation of arsenite-induced H3S10 phosphorylation by SP600125 or siJNK did not inhibit Nrf2 nuclear accumulation nor ARE binding, despite inhibiting HO-1 expression. In response to arsenite, binding of Nrf2 to the HO-1 ARE preceded phosphorylation of H3S10 at the HO-1 ARE. Furthermore, arsenite-mediated occupancy of phosphorylated H3S10 at the HO-1 ARE was decreased in Nrf2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These results suggest the involvement of H3S10 phosphorylation in the Nrf2-ARE axis by proposing that Nrf2 may influence H3S10 phosphorylation at the HO-1 ARE and additional promoter regions. Our data highlights the complex interplay between Nrf2 and H3S10 phosphorylation in arsenite-activated HO-1 transcription.",

In the framework of a proteome-wide screening aiming at identifying proteins interacting with Hoxa2, KPC2, an adapter protein constitutive of the KPC ubiquitin-ligase complex, was identified. In this work, KPC2 was confirmed as being a genuine interactor of Hoxa2 by co-precipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. At functional level, KPC2 diminishes the transcriptional activity and induces the nuclear exit of Hoxa2. Gene expression analyses revealed that Kpc2 is active in restricted areas of the developing mouse embryo which overlap with the Hoxa2 expression domain. Together, our data support that KPC2 regulates Hoxa2 by promoting its relocation to the cytoplasm.",

Identification and functional analysis of such gene pairs is only in its infancy. Recently, we identified PRR11 as a novel cancer-related gene that is implicated in cell cycle and lung cancer. Here we demonstrate that PRR11 is oriented in a head-to-head configuration with its neighboring gene, SKA2. 5\u2032-RACE assay revealed that the intergenic spacer region between the two genes is <\u00a0500\u00a0bp. Serial luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a minimal 80-bp intergenic region functions as a core bidirectional promoter to drive basal transcription in both the PRR11 and SKA2 orientations. EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrated that NF-Y binds to and directly transactivates the PRR11\u2013SKA2 bidirectional promoter. SiRNA-mediated NF-Y depletion significantly downregulated PRR11 and SKA2 expression. Expression of both PRR11 and SKA2 was significantly upregulated in lung cancer. Expression of the two genes was highly correlated with each other and with NF-Y expression. Remarkably, high expression of both PRR11 and SKA2 was associated with poorer prognosis in lung cancer patients compared with high expression of one gene or low expression of both genes. Knockdown of PRR11 and/or SKA2 remarkably reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in lung cancer cells. Thus, the PRR11\u2013SKA2 bidirectional transcription unit, which is a novel direct target of NF-Y, is essential for the accelerated proliferation and motility of lung cancer cells and may represent a potential target in the diagnosis and/or treatment of human lung cancer.",

GABP is involved in haematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages in mice. To elucidate the molecular function of GABP in human haematopoiesis, the present study addressed effects of ectopic overexpression of GABP focussing on the myeloid compartment. Combined overexpression of GABPA and GABPB1 caused a proliferation block in cell lines and drastically reduced the colony-forming capacity of murine lineage-negative cells. Impaired proliferation resulted from perturbed cellular cycling and induction of myeloid differentiation shown by surface markers and myelomonocytic morphology of U937 cells. Depending on the dosage and functional integrity of GABP, ITGAM expression was induced. ITGAM encodes CD11b, the alpha subunit of integrin Mac-1, whose beta subunit, ITGB2/CD18, was already described to be regulated by GABP. Finally, Shield1-dependent proteotuning, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GABP activates the ITGAM/CD11b promoter via three binding sites close to the translational start site. In conclusion, the present study supports the crucial role of GABP in myeloid cell differentiation and identified ITGAM/CD11b as a novel GABP target gene.",

     "abstract": "HSPA2 belongs to the multigene HSPA family, whose members encode chaperone proteins. Although expression and function of HSPA2 is mainly associated with spermatogenesis, recent studies demonstrated that in humans, the gene is active in various cancers, as well as in normal tissues, albeit in a cell type-specific manner. In the epidermis, HSPA2 is expressed in keratinocytes in the basal layer. Currently, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of HSPA2 expression remain unknown. This study was aimed at determining whether HIF-1 and its binding site, the hypoxia-response element (HRE) located in the HSPA2 promoter, are involved in HSPA2 regulation. As a model system, we used an immortal human keratinocyte line (HaCaT) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) grown under control or hypoxic conditions. Using an in vitro gene reporter assay, we demonstrated that in keratinocytes HSPA2 promoter activity is reduced under conditions that facilitate stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1, whereas HIF-1 inhibitors abrogated the suppressive effect of hypoxia on promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that HIF-1\u03b1 binds to the HSPA2 promoter. In keratinocytes, hypoxia or overexpression of a stable form of HIF-1\u03b1 attenuated the expression of endogenous HSPA2, whereas targeted repression of HIF-1\u03b1 by RNAi increased transcription of HSPA2 under hypoxia. Conversely, in HeLa cells, HSPA2 expression increased under conditions that stimulated HIF-1\u03b1 activity, whereas inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 abrogated hypoxia-induced up-regulation of HSPA2 expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HIF-1 can exert differential, cell context-dependent regulatory control of the HSPA2 gene. Additionally, we also showed that HSPA2 expression can be stimulated during hypoxia/reoxygenation stress.",

Previously, we found that p53 interacts with KAISO, and acetylation of p53 lysine residues by p300 is modulated by KAISO. APAF1, the core molecule of the apoptosome, is transcriptionally activated by KAISO only in cells expressing p53, which binds to APAF1 promoter p53-response elements (p53REs). APAF1 transcriptional upregulation is further enhanced by KAISO augmentation of p53 binding to the APAF1 promoter distal p53RE#1 (bp, \u2212\u00a0765 to \u2212\u00a0739). Interestingly, a NF-\u03baB response element, located close to the p53RE#1, mediates APAF1 transcriptional repression by affecting interaction between KAISO and p53. Ectopic RelA/p65 expression led to depletion of nuclear KAISO, with KAISO being mainly detected in the cytoplasm. RelA/p65 cytoplasmic sequestration of KAISO prevents its nuclear interaction with p53, decreasing APAF1 transcriptional activation by a p53\u2013KAISO\u2013p300 complex in cells exposed to genotoxic stresses. While KAISO enhances p53-dependent apoptosis by increasing APAF1 gene expression, RelA/p65 decreases apoptosis by blocking interaction between KAISO and p53.

Our earlier studies have shown that three differentially spliced human DMP1 mRNAs, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3, arise from the human gene. We now show that DMP1\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 isoforms differentially regulate ARF expression and promote distinct cellular functions. In contrast to DMP1\u03b1, DMP1\u03b2 and \u03b3 did not activate the ARF promoter, whereas only \u03b2 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of DMP1\u03b1-induced transactivation of the ARF promoter. Ectopic expression of DMP1\u03b2 reduced endogenous ARF mRNA levels in human fibroblasts. The DMP1\u03b2- and \u03b3-isoforms share domains necessary for the inhibitory function of the \u03b2-isoform. That DMP1\u03b2 may interact with DMP1\u03b1 to antagonize its function was shown in DNA binding assays and in cells by the close proximity of DMP1\u03b1/\u03b2 in the nucleus. Cells stably expressing DMP1\u03b2, as well as shRNA targeting all DMP1 isoforms, disrupted cellular growth arrest induced by serum deprivation or in PMA-derived macrophages in the presence or absence of cellular p53. DMP1 mRNA levels in acute myeloid leukemia samples, as compared to granulocytes, were reduced. Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia patient samples with all-trans retinoic acid promoted differentiation to granulocytes and restored DMP1 transcripts to normal granulocyte levels. Our findings imply that DMP1\u03b1- and \u03b2-ratios are tightly regulated in hematopoietic cells and DMP1\u03b2 antagonizes DMP1\u03b1 transcriptional regulation of ARF resulting in the alteration of cellular control with a gain in proliferation.",

At the molecular level, this involves interactions with E-box (CACC/GGTG) consensus elements within target gene promoters to achieve transcriptional repression. However, precise elucidation of events involved in this DNA recognition and binding of specific promoters to regulate target genes have not been achieved. In the present study, we show that besides transcriptional repression, Slug can also directly activate its own expression by preferential binding to specific E-box elements in the distal binding region of its promoter. Our findings suggest that while the first ZF does not contribute to the transcription-associated functions of Slug, all the remaining four ZFs are involved in regulating the expression of target genes with ZF3 and ZF4 being more crucial than ZF2 or ZF5. We also report that recognition and binding preferences of ZFs are defined through intrinsic differences in the E-box core base pairs and/or flanking sequences, with the S2 E-box element being most critical during autoregulation. However, specific target E-box recognition and binding are also defined by the cellular context, which implies that in silico and/or biochemical DNA binding preferences may not necessarily be able to accurately predict in situ events.

We report here that MKL1 deficiency ameliorated BDL-induced liver fibrosis in mice as assessed by histological stainings and expression levels of pro-fibrogenic genes. MKL1 silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated TGF-\u03b2 induced transactivation of pro-fibrogenic genes in portal fibroblast cells.

TGF-\u03b2 treatment induced the accumulation of trimethylated histone H3K4 on the gene promoters by recruiting a methyltransferase complex. Knockdown of individual members of this complex significantly weakened the binding of SMAD3 and down-regulated the activation of portal fibroblast cells.

     "abstract": "Streptomyces are Gram-positive microorganisms able to adapt and respond to different environmental conditions. It is the largest genus of Actinobacteria comprising over 900 species. During their lifetime, these microorganisms are able to differentiate, produce aerial mycelia and secondary metabolites. All of these processes are controlled by subtle and precise regulatory systems. Regulation at the transcriptional initiation level is probably the most common for metabolic adaptation in bacteria. In this mechanism, the major players are proteins named transcription factors (TFs), capable of binding DNA in order to repress or activate the transcription of specific genes. Some of the TFs exert their action just like activators or repressors, whereas others can function in both manners, depending on the target promoter. Generally, TFs achieve their effects by using one- or two-component systems, linking a specific type of environmental stimulus to a transcriptional response. After DNA sequencing, many streptomycetes have been found to have chromosomes ranging between 6 and 12\u00a0Mb in size, with high GC content (around 70%). They encode for approximately 7000 to 10,000 genes, 50 to 100 pseudogenes and a large set (around 12% of the total chromosome) of regulatory genes, organized in networks, controlling gene expression in these bacteria. Among the sequenced streptomycetes reported up to now, the number of transcription factors ranges from 471 to 1101. Among these, 315 to 691 correspond to transcriptional regulators and 31 to 76 are sigma factors. The aim of this work is to give a state of the art overview on transcription factors in the genus Streptomyces.",

In this study, we examined the expression of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating the 5-HTT gene in tumor cells. The 5-HTT gene expression was almost silenced in chicken lymphoma DT40, myelomonocytic tumor HD11 and hepatoma DU249 cells, compared to their physiological counterpart. In contrast, HDAC1 mRNA expression was increased in these cell lines. Indeed, the pan-HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced the 5-HTT mRNA expression in several tumor cell lines including the human cell lines HepG2 and THP-1 and increased the 5-HT uptake in HD11 cells. In addition, treatment with parthenolide, which is capable of depleting HDAC1, and knockdown of HDAC1 using siRNA resulted in increased 5-HTT mRNA expression, confirming the role of HDAC1 in the down-regulation of 5-HTT in the tumor cells. Deletion analysis of the 5-HTT promoter and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP\u00df), in interacting with the 5-HTT promoter, mediated both the inhibition of the 5-HTT expression by HDAC1 and the activation by CREB-binding protein (CBP). Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found increased acetylation of histone H4 associated with the 5-HTT promoter in cells treated with TSA. Our results suggest that the 5-HTT gene is epigenetically downregulated by HDAC1 in several types of cancer.",

It was shown that in all types of complexes cross-links of the mRNA analogs to ribosomal protein (rp) uS3 occur and the yield of these cross-links does not depend on the presence of tRNA and on sequences of the mRNA analogs. Site of the mRNA analogs cross-linking in rp uS3 was mapped to the peptide in positions 55\u201364 that is located away from the mRNA binding site. Additionally, in complexes with P site-bound tRNA, riboses of mRNA nucleotides in positions +\u00a04 to +\u00a07 cross-linked to the C-terminal tail of rp uS19 displaying a contact specific to the decoding site of the mammalian ribosome, and tRNA bound at the A site completely blocked this cross-linking. Remarkably, rps uS3 and uS19 were also able to cross-link to the fragment of HCV IRES containing unstructured 3\u2032-terminal part restricted by the AUGC tetraplet with oxidized 3\u2032-terminal ribose. However, no cross-linking to rp uS3 was observed in the 48S preinitiation complex assembled in reticulocyte lysate with this HCV IRES derivative.

Despite the importance of RTT for gene regulation, its effects on mRNA and protein concentrations have not been quantitatively characterized. Here we demonstrate that the exogenous cfp gene encoding the cyan fluorescent protein can serve as a model for gene regulation by RTT. This was confirmed by showing that Psu and bicyclomycin decrease RTT and increase full length cfp mRNAs (but remarkably they have little effect on protein production). We then use cfp to characterize the relationship between its protein and full length mRNA concentrations when the translation initiation rate is varied by sequence modifications of the translation initiation region (TIR). These experiments reveal that the fold change in protein concentration (RP) and the fold change in full length mRNA concentration (Rm) have the relationship RP\u00a0\u2248\u00a0Rmb, where b is a constant. The average value of b was determined from three separate data sets to be ~\u00a03.6. We demonstrate that the above power law function can predict how altering the translation initiation rate of a gene in an operon will affect the mRNA concentrations of downstream genes and specify a lower bound for the associated changes in protein concentrations. In summary, this study defines a simple phenomenological model to help program expression from single genes and operons that are regulated by RTT, and to guide molecular models of RTT.",

We found that in early erythroid differentiation the FOLR1 gene presents a permissive chromatin configuration that allows its expression. Once the transition to the next differentiation state occurs, the heterochromatin spreads into the FOLR1 domain, concomitant with the dissociation of CTCF from a novel binding site, thereby resulting in irreversible silencing of the FOLR1 gene. We demonstrate that the sequences surrounding the CTCF-binding site possess classical insulator properties in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the chicken cHS4 \u03b2-globin insulator present on the other side of the heterochromatic segment is in a constitutive open chromatin configuration, with CTCF constantly bound from the early stages of erythroid differentiation. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the 16\u00a0kb of constitutive heterochromatin contributes to silencing of the FOLR1 gene during erythroid differentiation.",

Mutations and deletions of mtDNA and/or nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins have been implicated in a wide range of diseases. Thus, cell survival and health of the organism require some steady-state level of the mitochondrial genome and its expression. In mammalian systems, the mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (mtTFB2 or TFB2M) is indispensable for transcription initiation. TFB2M along with two other proteins, mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP or POLRMT) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA or TFAM), are key components of the core mitochondrial transcription apparatus. Structural information for POLRMT and TFAM from humans is available; however, there is no available structure for TFB2M. In the present study, three-dimensional structure of TFB2M from humans was modeled using a combination of homology modeling and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The TFB2M structural model adds substantively to our understanding of TFB2M function. An explanation for the low or absent RNA methyltransferase activity is provided. A putative nucleic acid-binding site is revealed.

Through an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis, we have found that 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5, 5-LO) which is a key enzyme of leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis, is a direct target gene of p53 and its expression is induced by genotoxic stress via actinomycin D (Act.D) or etoposide (Eto) treatment. 5-LO and LTs play a role in immunological diseases as well as in tumorigenesis and tumor growth. p53 binds to a specific binding site consisting of a complete p53 consensus-binding motif in ALOX5 intron G which is located about 64\u00a0kbp downstream of the transcriptional start site. We confirmed the strong binding of p53 to the 5-LO target site in ChIP-qPCR experiments. Expression analyses by qRT-PCR and immunoblot further revealed that genotoxic stress induces the ALOX5 mRNA and protein expression in a p53-dependent manner. Knockdown of p53 in U2OS cells leads to a downregulation of 5-LO mRNA and protein expression. In addition, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays indicate the direct binding of 5-LO to p53 protein. Furthermore, we found that 5-LO can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 suggesting that 5-LO acts in a negative feedback loop to limit induction of p53 target genes.",

CHD5 remodelers are vertebrate-specific, raising the prospect that CHD5 plays one or more conserved roles in this phylum. Expression of chd5 in adult fish closely mirrors expression of CHD5 in adult mammals. Knockdown of Chd5 during embryogenesis suggests new roles for CHD5 remodelers based on resulting defects in craniofacial development including reduced head and eye size as well as reduced cartilage formation in the head. In addition, knockdown of Chd5 results in altered expression of neural markers in the developing brain and eye as well as a profound defect in differentiation of dopaminergic amacrine cells. Recombinant zebrafish Chd5 protein exhibits nucleosome remodeling activity in vitro, suggesting that it is the loss of this activity that contributes to the observed phenotypes.

Post-transcriptional gene regulation is known to be involved in mRNA stability and, in NB, microRNAs (miRNAs) seem to be responsible for altered expression of genes driving differentiation, apoptosis, and migration. To assess the possible impact of post-transcriptional regulation in NB cell lines, we have focused on the PHOX2B mRNA stability by both in silico analysis and functional studies on its 3\u2032untranslated region (3\u2032UTR). PHOX2B gene expression has resulted under post-transcriptional control, as suggested by: i) instability of PHOX2B mRNA, demonstrated by short mRNA half-life levels in both IMR32 and LAN-1 cell lines, ii) role of the PHOX2B-3\u2032UTR, confirmed by the activity of proper reporter constructs, and iii) miRNA-204, shown to enhance the PHOX2B 3\u2032UTR mediated down-regulation of the reporter construct activity. Finally, miRNA-204 has resulted to decrease the stability of the PHOX2B mRNA at different extents in the presence of different SNP rs1063611 alleles.

Here we provide evidence for a unique regulatory mechanism of MyoD transcriptional activity through demethylation by Jmjd2C demethylase whose level increases during muscle differentiation. G9a decreases MyoD stability via methylation-dependent MyoD ubiquitination. Jmjd2C directly associates with MyoD in vitro and in vivo to demethylate and stabilize MyoD.

By the stabilization of MyoD, Jmjd2C increases myogenic conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and MyoD transcriptional activity with erasing repressive H3K9me3 level at the promoter of MyoD target genes.

This TSA effect was independent of TGF\u03b21; however, only in the presence of TGF\u03b21 was TSA able to change the splicing regulators hnRNP F/H by slightly reducing their mRNA transcripts but strongly preventing protein degradation. The latter was also efficiently prevented by lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, suggesting their protein stability control by both acetylation and ubiquitination pathways. Three lysines K87, K98 and K224 of hnRNP F are potential targets of the mutually exclusive acetylation or ubiquitination (KAc/Ub) in the protein modification database PhosphoSitePlus. Mutating each of them but not a control non-KAc/Ub (K68) specifically abolished the TSA enhancement of protein stability. Moreover, mutating K98 (K98R) and K224 (K224R) also abolished the TSA regulation of alternative splicing of a Bcl-x mini-gene. Furthermore, about 86% (30 of 35) of the multi-functional hnRNP proteins in the database contain lysines that are potential sites for acetylation/ubiquitination. We demonstrate that the degradation of three of them (A1, I and L) are also prevented by TSA. Thus, the deacetylase inhibitor TSA enhances hnRNP F stability through the KAc/Ub lysines, with some of them essential for its regulation of alternative splicing. Such a regulation of protein stability is perhaps common for a group of hnRNPs and RNA metabolism.",

We have found that several PTC+ transcripts including that of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) were specifically increased in cells by curcumin. We also observed a similar curcumin effect on the PTC+ mutant transcript from a Tay\u2013Sachs-causing HEXA allele or from a beta-globin reporter gene. The curcumin effect was accompanied by significantly reduced expression of the NMD factors UPF1, 2, 3A and 3B. Consistently, in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, curcumin specifically reduced the occupancy of acetyl-histone H3 and RNA polymerase II at the promoter region (\u2212\u00a0376 to \u2212\u00a0247\u00a0nt) of human UPF1, in a time- and dosage-dependent way. Importantly, knocking down UPF1 abolished or substantially reduced the difference of PTC+ transcript levels between control and curcumin-treated cells. The disrupted curcumin effect was efficiently rescued by expression of exogenous Myc\u2013UPF1 in the knockdown cells. Together, our data demonstrate that a group of PTC+ transcripts are stabilized by a dietary compound curcumin through the inhibition of UPF factor expression and the NMD pathway.",

     "abstract": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is highly regulated in cells and plays an integral role in the overall process of gene expression. The initiation phase of translation is considered to be the most rate-limiting and is often targeted by oncogenic signaling pathways to promote global protein synthesis and the selective translation of tumor-promoting mRNAs. Translational control is a crucial component of cancer development as it allows cancer cells to adapt to the altered metabolism that is generally associated with the tumor state. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are strongly implicated in cancer etiology, and they exert their biological effects by modulating both global and specific mRNA translation. In addition to having respective translational targets, these pathways also impinge on the mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which acts as a critical signaling node linking nutrient sensing to the coordinated regulation of cellular metabolism. mTOR is best known as a central regulator of protein synthesis and has been implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including cancer.

These findings point at the cellular level of eIF4E as an important sensor for normal or pro-neoplastic propagation of cells.

     "abstract": "Protein synthesis is an essential cellular process that is highly responsive to extra- and intracellular cues such as mitogens, growth signals, nutrient and energy status, and stress. Much regulation of translation is directed towards initiation, more specifically the ribosome recruitment phase which requires the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4\u00a0F complex to prepare the mRNA for the incoming 40S ribosome (and associated factors). As many commonly deregulated signaling pathways found in cancers converge to influence protein synthesis, targeting factors involved in translation initiation is a viable anti-neoplastic strategy that has demonstrated success in pre-clinical settings. Furthermore, transcripts that are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in levels of the eIF4F complex are often associated with oncogenic characteristics (eg proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis) and their translational output appears to be preferentially reduced when eIF4F is inhibited. In particular, the enzymatic subunit of the eIF4F complex, eIF4A, has been extensively explored as a druggable target with several natural products identified as potent and selective inhibitors.

One mechanism in this response is the translational repression of multiple mRNAs that encode components of the translational apparatus. This coordinated translational control is carried through a common cis-regulatory element, the 5\u2032 Terminal OligoPyrimidine motif (5\u2032TOP), after which these mRNAs are referred to as TOP mRNAs. Subsequent to the initial structural and functional characterization of members of this family, the research of TOP mRNAs has progressed in three major directions: a) delineating the landscape of the family; b) establishing the pathways that transduce stress cues into selective translational repression; and c) attempting to decipher the most proximal trans-acting factor(s) and defining its mode of action \u2014 a repressor or activator.

Ribosomes have evolved to take on this responsibility and, although there are some differences in their molecular make-up, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes share a common structural architecture and similar underlying mechanisms of protein synthesis.

In the last decade however, new and unexpected roles have emerged that place deregulated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis at the crossroads of pathological settings, particularly cancer, revealing a set of novel cellular checkpoints. Moreover, it is also becoming evident that mTOR signaling, which regulates an array of anabolic processes, including ribosome biogenesis, is often exploited by cancer cells to sustain proliferation through the upregulation of global protein synthesis. The use of pharmacological agents that interfere with ribosome biogenesis and mTOR signaling has proven to be an effective strategy to control cancer development clinically.

In this context, we propose that eIF6 impedes unproductive 80S formation, namely, the formation of 80S subunits without mRNA. Genetic evidence shows that eIF6 has a dual function: in yeast and mammals, nucleolar eIF6 is necessary for the biogenesis of 60S subunits. In mammals, cytoplasmic eIF6 is required for insulin and growth factor-stimulated translation. In contrast to other translation factors, eIF6 activity is not under mTOR control. The physiological significance of eIF6 impacts on cancer and on inherited Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome. eIF6 is overexpressed in specific human tumors. In a murine model of lymphomagenesis, eIF6 depletion leads to a striking increase of survival, without adverse effects. Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome is caused by loss of function of SBDS protein. In yeast, point mutations of Tif6, the yeast homolog of eIF6, rescue the quasi-lethal effect due to the loss of the SBDS homolog, Sdo1. We propose that eIF6 is a node regulator of ribosomal function and predict that prioritizing its pharmacological targeting will be of benefit in cancer and Shwachman\u2013Bodian\u2013Diamond syndrome.

Additionally, it is implicated in transcription, mRNA turnover and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Two eIF5A isoforms are generated from distinct but related genes. The major isoform, eIF5A1, is considered constitutive, is abundantly expressed in most cells, and is essential for cell proliferation. The second isoform, eIF5A2, is expressed in few normal tissues but is highly expressed in many cancers and has been designated a candidate oncogene. Elevated expression of either isoform carries unfavorable prognostic implications for several cancers, and both have been advanced as cancer biomarkers. The amino acid hypusine, a presumptively unique eIF5A post-translational modification, is required for most known eIF5A functions and it renders eIF5A susceptible to inhibitors of the modification pathway as therapeutic targets. eIF5A has been shown to regulate a number of gene products specifically, termed the eIF5A regulon, and its role in translating proline-rich sequences has recently been identified. A model is advanced that accommodates eIF5A in both the initiation and elongation phases of translation. We review here the biochemical functions of eIF5A, the relationship of its isoforms with human cancer, and evolving clinical applications.

     "abstract": "Cells respond to various forms of stress by activating anti-proliferative pathways, which allow them to correct the damage caused by stress before re-entering proliferation. If the damage, however, is beyond repair, stressed cells are eliminated from the host by undergoing death. The balance between cell survival and death is essential for cancer formation and is determined by several key pathways that impact on different stages of gene expression. In recent years, it has become evident that phosphorylation of the alpha (\u03b1) subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 at serine 51 (eIF2\u03b1S51P) is an important determinant of cell fate in response to stress. Induction of eIF2\u03b1S51P is mediated by a family of four kinases namely, HRI, PKR, PERK and GCN2, each of which responds to distinct forms of stress. Increased eIF2\u03b1S51P results in a global inhibition of protein synthesis but at the same time enhances the translation of select mRNAs encoding for proteins that control cell adaptation to stress. Short-term induction of eIF2\u03b1S51P has been associated with cell survival whereas long-term induction with cell death. Studies in mouse and human models of cancer have provided compelling evidence that eIF2\u03b1S51P plays an essential role in stress-induced tumorigenesis. Increased eIF2\u03b1S51P exhibits cell autonomous as well as immune regulatory effects, which can influence tumor growth and the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies.

They are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase III and undergo many modifications before contributing to cytoplasmic protein synthesis.

First, I review how oncogenes and tumour suppressor signalling pathways, such as the PI3 kinase/TORC1, Ras/ERK, Myc, p53 and Rb pathways, regulate Pol III and tRNA synthesis. In several cases, this regulation contributes to cell, tissue and body growth, and has implications for our understanding of tumorigenesis. Second, I highlight some recent work, particularly in model organisms such as yeast and Drosophila, that shows how alterations in tRNA synthesis may be not only necessary, but also sufficient to drive changes in mRNA translation and growth. These effects may arise due to both absolute increases in total tRNA levels, but also changes in the relative levels of tRNAs in the overall pool. Finally, I review some recent studies that have revealed how tRNA modifications (amino acid acylation, base modifications, subcellular shuttling, and cleavage) can be regulated by growth and stress cues to selectively influence mRNA translation. Together these studies emphasize the importance of the regulation of tRNA synthesis and modification as critical control points in protein synthesis and growth.

The expression of JAM-B is tightly regulated to modulate the passage of spermatocytes across the BTB as well as the release of mature spermatozoa from the seminiferous epithelium. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) family is implicated in the regulation of testicular cell junction dynamics during spermatogenesis. This study aims to investigate the effects of TGF-\u03b23 on the expression of JAM-B as well as the underlying mechanisms on how TGF-\u03b23 regulates JAM-B expression to facilitate the disassembly of the BTB and apical ES. Our results revealed that TGF-\u03b23 suppresses JAM-B at post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Inhibitor, siRNA knockdown and co-immunoprecipitation have shown that TGF-\u03b23 induces JAM-B protein degradation via ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed that blockage of ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway could abrogate TGF-\u03b23-induced loss of JAM-B at the cell\u2013cell interface. siRNA knockdown and immunofluorescence staining also demonstrated that activation of Smad signaling is required for TGF-\u03b23-induced JAM-B protein degradation. In addition, TGF-\u03b23 reduces JAM-B mRNA levels, at least in part, via post-transcriptional regulation. mRNA stability assay has confirmed that TGF-\u03b23 promotes the degradation of JAM-B transcript and TGF-\u03b23-mediated mRNA destabilization requires the activation of ERK1/2 and p54 JNK signal cascades.

We show that 15d-PGJ2 enhances the efficiency of MKP-1 pre-mRNA processing (constitutive splicing and 3\u2032-end processing) and increases the stability of the mature mRNA. We further report that this occurs via the RNA-binding protein, Hu antigen R (HuR). Our experiments show that HuR knockdown abrogates the 15d-PGJ2-induced increases in the pre-mRNA processing and mature mRNA stability of MKP-1, whereas HuR overexpression further enhances the 15d-PGJ2-induced increases in these parameters. Using cysteine (Cys)-mutated HuR proteins, we show that the Cys-245 residue of HuR (but not Cys-13 or Cys-284) is critical for the direct binding of HuR with 15d-PGJ2 and the effects downstream of this interaction. Collectively, our data show that HuR is a novel target of 15d-PGJ2 and reveal HuR-mediated pre-mRNA processing and mature mRNA stabilization as important regulatory steps in the 15d-PGJ2-induced expression of MKP-1. The potential to use a small molecule such as 15d-PGJ2 to regulate the induction of MKP-1 at multiple levels of gene expression could be exploited as a novel therapeutic strategy aimed at combating a diverse range of MKP-1-associated pathologies.",

Insulitis (aka islet inflammation), which can be present in both T1DM and T2DM, is one factor influencing pancreatic \u03b2-cell death and dysfunction. IL-1\u03b2, an inflammatory mediator in both T1DM and T2DM, acutely (within 1\u00a0h) induced expression of the CCL20 gene in rat and human islets and clonal \u03b2-cell lines. Transcriptional induction of CCL20 required the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB to replace the p50 subunit at two functional \u03baB sites within the CCL20 proximal gene promoter. The NF-\u03baB p50 subunit prevents CCL20 gene expression during unstimulated conditions and overexpression of p50 reduces CCL20, but enhances cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transcript accumulation after exposure to IL-1\u03b2. We also identified differential recruitment of specific co-activator molecules to the CCL20 gene promoter, when compared with the CCL2 and COX2 genes, revealing distinct transcriptional requirements for individual NF-\u03baB responsive genes. Moreover, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 individually increased the expression of CCR6, the receptor for CCL20, on the surface of human neutrophils. We further found that the chemokine CCL20 is elevated in serum from both genetically obese db/db mice and in C57BL6/J mice fed a high-fat diet. Taken together, these results are consistent with a possible activation of the CCL20-CCR6 axis in diseases with inflammatory components. Thus, interfering with this signaling pathway, either at the level of NF-\u03baB-mediated chemokine production, or downstream receptor activation, could be a potential therapeutic target to offset inflammation-associated tissue dysfunction in obesity and diabetes.",

     "abstract": "Environmental alkalinisation represents a stress condition for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to which this organism responds with extensive gene expression remodelling. We show here that alkaline pH causes an overall decrease in the transcription rate (TR) and a fast destabilisation of mRNAs, followed by a more prolonged stabilisation phase. In many cases, augmented mRNA levels occur without the TR increasing, which can be attributed to mRNA stabilisation. In contrast, the reduced amount of mRNAs is contributed by both a drop in the TR and mRNA stability. A comparative analysis with other forms of stress shows that, unlike high pH stress, heat-shock, osmotic and oxidative stresses present a common transient increase in the TR. An analysis of environmentally-responsive (ESR) genes for the four above stresses suggests that up-regulated genes are governed mostly by TR changes and complex transient bidirectional changes in mRNA stability, whereas the down-regulated ESR gene set is driven by mRNA destabilisation and a lowered TR. In all the studied forms of stress, mRNA stability plays an important role in ESR. Overall, changes in mRNA levels do not closely reflect the rapid changes in the TR and stability upon exposure to stress, which highlights the existence of compensatory mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), by expressing and presenting major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) molecules, help recruit T lymphocyte and initiate the inflammatory response within the vasculature. We have previously shown that VSMCs isolated from mice with deficient adenosine A2b receptor (A2b-null) exhibit higher expression of class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of MHC II transcription, compared to wild type littermates. Here we report that activation of A2b adenosine signaling suppresses CIITA expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Down-regulation of CIITA expression was largely attributable to transcriptional repression of type III and IV promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that A2b signaling repressed CIITA transcription by attenuating specific histone modifications on the CIITA promoters in a STAT1-dependent manner. STAT1 interacted with PCAF/GCN5, histone H3K9 acetyltransferases, and WDR5, a key component of the mammalian H3K4 methyltransferase complex, to activate CIITA transcription. A2b signaling prevented recruitment of PCAF/GCN5 and WDR5 to the CIITA promoters in a STAT1-dependent manner. In conclusion, our data suggest that adenosine A2b signaling represses CIITA transcription in VSMCs by manipulating the interaction between STAT1 and the epigenetic machinery.",

We have previously shown that Hsp70.3 expression is controlled through coordinated post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs and alternative polyadenylation (APA), and APA-mediated shortening of the Hsp70.3 3\u2032-UTR facilitates increased protein expression. A stress-induced increase in Hsp70.3 mRNA and protein expression is accompanied by alternative polyadenylation (APA)-mediated truncation of the 3\u2032UTR of the Hsp70.3 mRNA transcript. However, the role that APA plays in stress-induced expression of Hsp70.3 remains unclear. Our results show that APA-mediated truncation of the Hsp70.3 3\u2032UTR increases protein expression through enhanced polyribosome loading. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RNA binding protein HuR, which has been previously shown to play a role in mediating APA, is necessary for heat shock mediated increase in Hsp70.3 mRNA and protein. However, it is somewhat surprising to note that HuR does not play a role in APA of the Hsp70.3 mRNA, and these two regulatory events appear to be mutually exclusive regulators of Hsp70.3 expression. These results not only provide important insight to the regulation of stress response genes following heat shock, but also contribute an enhanced understanding of how alternative polyadenylation contributes to gene regulation.",

We observed that HOXC6 is differentially over-expressed in breast cancer tissue. E2 induces HOXC6 expression in cultured breast cancer cells and in mammary glands of Sprague Dawley rats. HOXC6 expression is also induced upon exposure to BPA both in vitro and in vivo. Estrogen-receptor-alpha (ER\u03b1) and ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases are bound to the HOXC6 promoter upon exposure to E2 or BPA and that resulted in increased histone H3K4-trimethylation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the HOXC6 promoter. HOXC6 overexpression induces expression of tumor growth factors and facilitates growth 3D-colony formation, indicating its potential roles in tumor growth.

We report that an Fbxo25-mediated SCF ubiquitination pathway regulates the protein levels and activities of Tbx5 and Nkx2\u20135 based on our studies using MG132, proteasome inhibitor, and the temperature sensitive ubiquitin system in ts20 cells. Our data indicate that Fbxo25 directly interacts with Tbx5 and Nkx2\u20135 in vitro and in vivo. In support of our findings, a dominant-negative mutant of Fbxo25, Fbxo251\u2013236, prevents Tbx5 degradation and increases Tbx5 transcriptional activity in a Tbx5 responsive luciferase assay. Therefore, Fbxo25 facilitates Tbx5 degradation in an SCF-dependent manner. In addition, the silencing of endogenous Fbxo25 increases Tbx5 and Nkx2\u20135 mRNA levels and suppresses mESC-derived cardiomyocyte differentiation. Likewise, the exogenous expression of FBXO25 downregulates NKX2\u20135 level in human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. In myocardial infarction model, Fbxo25 mRNA decreases, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of Tbx5 and Nkx2\u20135 increase. The protein levels of Tbx5 and Nkx2\u20135 are regulated negatively by Fbxo25-mediated SCF ubiquitination pathway.

To characterize the transience of protein\u2013protein interactions we utilized a recently described enzymatic in vivo protein proximity assay (M-track). Accordingly, interaction signals between Ste11 and many of its signaling partners can already be detected even under basal conditions. In most cases these signals increase after stress induction. All the interactions are completely dependent on the function of the Ste11-adaptor protein Ste50. Moreover, the presence of either Msb2 or Hkr1 is necessary for observing the interaction between Ste11 and scaffolding factors such as Sho1 and Pbs2. Additional assays suggest that Msb2 is not only in close proximity to Ste11 but might function as an individual Ste11 concentrator at the plasma membrane.

As such, understanding its molecular activities and biological functions has been a field of active research since its discovery more than three decades ago. Genome-wide studies have revealed Myc to be a global regulator of gene expression. The identification of its DNA-binding partner protein, Max, launched an area of extensive research into both the protein\u2013protein interactions and protein structure of Myc. In this review, we highlight key insights with respect to Myc interactors and protein structure that contribute to the understanding of Myc's roles in transcriptional regulation and cancer. Structural analyses of Myc show many critical regions with transient structures that mediate protein interactions and biological functions. Interactors, such as Max, TRRAP, and PTEF-b, provide mechanistic insight into Myc's transcriptional activities, while others, such as ubiquitin ligases, regulate the Myc protein itself. It is appreciated that Myc possesses a large interactome, yet the functional relevance of many interactors remains unknown.

     "abstract": "The transcription factor MYC and its related family members MYCN and MYCL have been implicated in the etiology of a wide spectrum of human cancers. Compared to other oncoproteins, such as RAS or SRC, MYC is unique because its protein coding region is rarely mutated. Instead, MYC\u2019s oncogenic properties are unleashed by regulatory mutations leading to unconstrained high levels of expression. Under both normal and pathological conditions MYC regulates multiple aspects of cellular physiology including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, growth and metabolism by controlling the expression of thousands of genes. How a single transcription factor exerts such broad effects remains a fascinating puzzle. Notably, MYC is part of a network of bHLHLZ proteins centered on the MYC heterodimeric partner MAX and its counterpart, the MAX-like protein MLX. This network includes MXD1-4, MNT, MGA, MONDOA and MONDOB proteins. With some exceptions, MXD proteins have been functionally linked to cell cycle arrest and differentiation, while MONDO proteins control cellular metabolism. Although the temporal expression patterns of many of these proteins can differ markedly they are frequently expressed simultaneously in the same cellular context, and potentially bind to the same, or similar DNA consensus sequence. Here we review the activities and interactions among these proteins and propose that the broad spectrum of phenotypes elicited by MYC deregulation is intimately connected to the functions and regulation of the other network members. Furthermore, we provide a meta-analysis of TCGA data suggesting that the coordinate regulation of the network is important in MYC driven tumorigenesis.

     "abstract": "c-Myc is upregulated in response to growth factors and transmits the signal to proliferate by altering the gene expression landscape. When genetic alterations result in growth factor-independent c-Myc expression, it can become an oncogene. The majority of human tumour types exhibit a degree of c-Myc deregulation, resulting in unrestrained cell proliferation. c-Myc binds proximal to the promoter region of genes and recruits co-factors including histone acetyltransferases and RNA pol II kinases, which promote transcription. c-Myc also promotes formation of the cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of mRNA. The cap is 7-methylguanosine linked to the first transcribed nucleotide of RNA pol II transcripts via a 5\u2032 to 5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. The cap is added to the first transcribed nucleotide by the capping enzymes, RNGTT and RNMT\u2013RAM. During the early stages of transcription, the capping enzymes are recruited to RNA pol II phosphorylated on Serine-5 of the C-terminal domain. The mRNA cap protects transcripts from degradation during transcription and recruits factors which promote RNA processing including, splicing, export and translation initiation. The proportion of transcripts with a cap structure is increased by elevating c-Myc expression, resulting in increased rates of translation. c-Myc promotes capping by promoting RNA pol II phosphorylation and by upregulating the enzyme SAHH which neutralises the inhibitory bi-product of methylation reactions, SAH. c-Myc-induced capping is required for c-Myc-dependent gene expression and cell proliferation. Targeting capping may represent a new therapeutic opportunity to inhibit c-Myc function in tumours. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Myc proteins in cell biology and pathology.",

     "abstract": "Soon after the discovery of the Myc gene (c-Myc), it became clear that Myc expression levels tightly correlate to cell proliferation. The entry in cell cycle of quiescent cells upon Myc enforced expression has been described in many models. Also, the downregulation or inactivation of Myc results in the impairment of cell cycle progression. Given the frequent deregulation of Myc oncogene in human cancer it is important to dissect out the mechanisms underlying the role of Myc on cell cycle control. Several parallel mechanisms account for Myc-mediated stimulation of the cell cycle. First, most of the critical positive cell cycle regulators are encoded by genes induced by Myc. These Myc target genes include Cdks, cyclins and E2F transcription factors. Apart from its direct effects on the transcription, Myc is able to hyperactivate cyclin/Cdk complexes through the induction of Cdk activating kinase (CAK) and Cdc25 phosphatases. Moreover, Myc antagonizes the activity of cell cycle inhibitors as p21 and p27 through different mechanisms. Thus, Myc is able to block p21 transcription or to induce Skp2, a protein involved in p27 degradation. Finally, Myc induces DNA replication by binding to replication origins and by upregulating genes encoding proteins required for replication initiation. Myc also regulates genes involved in the mitotic control. A promising approach to treat tumors with deregulated Myc is the synthetic lethality based on the inhibition of Cdks. Thus, the knowledge of the Myc-dependent cell cycle regulatory mechanisms will help to discover new therapeutic approaches directed against malignancies with deregulated Myc.

     "abstract": "The c-Myc (Myc) oncoprotein is among the most attractive of cancer targets given that it is de-regulated in the majority of tumors and that its inhibition profoundly affects their growth and/or survival. However, its role as a seldom-mutated transcription factor, its lack of enzymatic activity for which suitable pharmaceutical inhibitors could be crafted and its expression by normal cells have largely been responsible for its being viewed as \u201cundruggable\u201d. Work over the past several years, however, has begun to reverse this idea by allowing us to view Myc within the larger context of global gene regulatory control. Thus, Myc and its obligate heterodimeric partner, Max, are integral to the coordinated recruitment and post-translational modification of components of the core transcriptional machinery. Moreover, Myc over-expression re-programs numerous critical cellular functions and alters the cell's susceptibility to their inhibition. This new knowledge has therefore served as a framework upon which to develop new pharmaceutical approaches. These include the continuing development of small molecules which act directly to inhibit the critical Myc\u2013Max interaction, those which act indirectly to prevent Myc-directed post-translational modifications necessary to initiate productive transcription and those which inhibit vital pathways upon which the Myc-transformed cell is particularly reliant.

     "abstract": "In the past ten years microRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely implicated as components of tumor suppressive and oncogenic pathways. Also the proto-typic oncogene c-MYC has been connected to miRNAs. The c-MYC gene is activated in approximately half of all tumors, and its product, the c-MYC transcription factor, regulates numerous processes e.g. cell cycle progression, metabolism, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, stemness, and angiogenesis, thereby facilitating tumor initiation and progression. c-MYC target-genes, which mediate these functions of c-MYC, represent a complex network of protein- and non-coding RNAs, including numerous miRNAs. For example, c-MYC directly regulates expression of the miR-17\u201392 cluster, miR-34a, miR-15a/16-1 and miR-9. Moreover, the expression and activity of c-MYC itself are under the control of miRNAs. Here, we survey how these networks mediate and regulate c-MYC functions. In the future, miRNAs connected to c-MYC may be used for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Efforts over the past 30\u00a0years to define the transcriptional activities of MYC and how MYC functions to promote proliferation have produced evolving models of MYC function. One picture that has emerged of MYC and its partner protein MAX is of a transcription factor complex with a seemingly unique ability to stimulate the transcription of genes that are epigenetically poised for transcription and to amplify the transcription of actively transcribed genes. During lymphocyte activation, MYC is upregulated and stimulates a pro-proliferative program in part through the upregulation of a wide variety of metabolic effector genes that facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. MYC upregulation simultaneously sensitizes cells to apoptosis and activated lymphocytes and lymphoma cells have pro-survival attributes that allow MYC-driven proliferation to prevail. For example, the MAX-interacting protein MNT is upregulated in activated lymphocytes and was found to protect lymphocytes from MYC-dependent apoptosis.

We review below the evidence for the occurrence of processes such as dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation within mammalian tissues in vivo, and in cells removed from their protective microenvironment and seeded in culture under conditions poorly resembling their physiological state in situ. Overall, these studies point to one major conclusion: stressful conditions, whether due to in vivo tissue damage or otherwise to isolation of cells from their in vivo restrictive niches, lead to extreme fate changes. Some examples of dedifferentiation are discussed in detail showing that rare cells within the population tend to turn back into less mature ones due to severe cell damage. It is proposed that cell stress, mechanistically sensed by isolation from neighboring cells, leads to dedifferentiation, in an attempt to build a new stem cell reservoir for subsequent regeneration of the damaged tissue.

We emphasize the epigenetic modifications associated with stress-induced global changes in chromatin structure and conclude with the implications for genetic variation and for induced pluripotent stem cells in animals.

     "abstract": "Plants as sessile organisms have remarkable developmental plasticity ensuring heir continuous adaptation to the environment. An extreme example is somatic embryogenesis, the initiation of autonomous embryo development in somatic cells in response to exogenous and/or endogenous signals. In this review I briefly overview the various pathways that can lead to embryo development in plants in addition to the fertilization of the egg cell and highlight the importance of the interaction of stress- and hormone-regulated pathways during the induction of somatic embryogenesis. Somatic embryogenesis can be initiated in planta or in vitro, directly or indirectly, and the requirement for dedifferentiation as well as the way to achieve developmental totipotency in the various systems is discussed in light of our present knowledge. The initiation of all forms of the stress/hormone-induced in vitro as well as the genetically provoked in planta somatic embryogenesis requires extensive and coordinated genetic reprogramming that has to take place at the chromatin level, as the embryogenic program is under strong epigenetic repression in vegetative plant cells. Our present knowledge on chromatin-based mechanisms potentially involved in the somatic-to-embryogenic developmental transition is summarized emphasizing the potential role of the chromatin to integrate stress, hormonal, and developmental pathways leading to the activation of the embryogenic program. The role of stress-related chromatin reorganization in the genetic instability of in vitro cultures is also discussed.

     "abstract": "LTR retrotransposons are major components of plant genomes. They are regulated by a diverse array of external stresses and tissue culture conditions, displaying finely tuned responses to these stimuli, mostly in the form of upregulation. Second to stress conditions and tissue culture, meristems are also permissive for LTR retrotransposon expression, suggesting that a dedifferentiated cell status may represent a frequent activating condition. LTR regions are highly plastic and contain regulatory motifs similar to those of cellular genes. The activation of LTR retrotransposons results from interplay between the release of epigenetic silencing and the recruitment by LTRs of specific regulatory factors. Despite the role of LTR retrotransposons in driving plant genome diversification, convincing evidence for major mobilizations of LTR retrotransposons remains much rarer than observations of massive bursts of transcriptional upregulation. Current evidence suggests that LTR retrotransposon expression may be involved in host functional plasticity, acting as dispersed regulatory modules able to redirect stress stimuli to adjacent plant genes. This may be of crucial importance for plants that cannot escape stress, and have evolved complex and highly coordinated responses to external challenges.

     "abstract": "Transposable Elements are pieces of DNA able to mobilize from one location to another within genomes. Although they constitute more than 50% of the human genome, they have been classified as selfish DNA, with the only mission to spread within genomes and generate more copies of themselves that will ensure their presence over generations. Despite their remarkable prevalence, only a minor group of transposable elements remain active in the human genome and can sporadically be associated with the generation of a genetic disorder due to their ongoing mobility. Most of the transposable elements identified in the human genome corresponded to fixed insertions that no longer move in genomes. As selfish DNA, transposable element insertions accumulate in cell types where genetic information can be passed to the next generation. Indeed, work from different laboratories has demonstrated that the main heritable load of TE accumulation in humans occurs during early embryogenesis. Thus, active transposable elements have a clear impact on our pluripotent genome. However, recent findings suggest that the main proportion of fixed non-mobile transposable elements might also have emerging roles in cellular plasticity. In this concise review, we provide an overview of the impact of currently active transposable elements in our pluripotent genome and further discuss new roles of transposable elements (active or not) in regulating pluripotency.

Human cancers exhibit tumor-specific genomic aberrations, which often affect their malignancy and drug response. During their culture propagation, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) also acquire characteristic genomic aberrations, which may have significant impact on their molecular and cellular phenotypes. These aberrations vary in size from single nucleotide alterations to copy number alterations to whole chromosome gains. A prominent challenge in both cancer and stem cell research is to identify \u201cdriver aberrations\u201d that confer a selection advantage, and \u201cdriver genes\u201d that underlie the recurrence of these aberrations. Following principles that are already well-established in cancer research, candidate driver genes have also been suggested in hPSCs. Experimental validation of the functional role of such candidates can uncover whether these are bona fide driver genes. The identification of driver genes may bring us closer to a mechanistic understanding of the genomic instability of stem cells. Guided by terminologies and methodologies commonly applied in cancer research, such understanding may have important ramifications for both stem cell and cancer biology.

Plasticity is essential for normal development and for tissue regeneration and, in an experimental setting, for the induction of pluripotency. All these processes involve a reprogramming of the cellular identity, mediated by signals from the environment and/or by internal changes at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. Tumorigenesis is a process in which normal cells acquire a new malignant identity and give rise to a clonal aberrant population. This is only possible if the initiating cell has the necessary plasticity to undergo such changes, and if the oncogenic event(s) initiating cancer has the essential reprogramming capacity so as to be able to lead a change in cellular identity. The molecular mechanisms underlying tumoral reprogramming are the pathological counterparts of the normal processes regulating developmental plasticity or experimentally-induced reprogramming. In this review we will first revise the main features of non-pathological examples of reprogramming, and then we will describe the parallelisms with tumoral reprogramming, and we will also delineate how the precise knowledge of the reprogramming mechanisms offers the potential for the development of new therapeutical interventions.

Their principal function in the body is to regulate blood flow and pressure through vessel wall contraction and relaxation. Unlike many other mature cell types in the adult body, SMC do not terminally differentiate but retain a remarkable plasticity. They have the unique ability to toggle between a differentiated and quiescent \u201ccontractile\u201d state and a highly proliferative and migratory \u201csynthetic\u201d phenotype in response to environmental stresses.While there have been major advances in our understanding of SMC plasticity through the identification of growth factors and signals that can influence the SMC phenotype, how these regulate SMC plasticity remains unknown. To date, several key transcription factors and regulatory cis elements have been identified that play a role in modulating SMC state. The frontier in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying SMC plasticity has now advanced to the level of epigenetics. This review will summarize the epigenetic regulation of SMC, highlighting the role of histone modification, DNA methylation, and our most recent identification of a DNA demethylation pathway in SMC that is pivotal in the regulation of the SMC phenotypic state.Many disorders are associated with smooth muscle dysfunction, including atherosclerosis, the major underlying cause of stroke and coronary heart disease, as well as transplant vasculopathy, aneurysm, asthma, hypertension, and cancer.

Furthermore, ConA-associated endonuclease was capable of generating nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in tobacco nuclei. Since S1-type endonucleases lack canonical nuclear localization signal it was necessary to determine their subcellular localization. To this end, a cDNA encoding for a putative 34\u00a0kDa S1-type nuclease, designated TaS1-like (TaS1L) was synthesized based on available sequence data of \u00a0Triticum aestivum and fused with RFP. Introduction into protoplasts showed that TaS1L-RFP is cytoplasmic 24\u00a0h post transformation but gradually turn nuclear at 48\u00a0h concomitantly with induction of cell death. Our results suggest that DNA fragmentation occurring in leaves of wild emmer wheat may be attributed to S1-type endonuclease(s) that reside in the cytoplasm but translocate to the nucleus upon induction of cell death.",

     "abstract": "Inactivation of p14ARF and p16INK4A by epigenetic changes in cutaneous and uveal melanoma has been here investigated. Compared with melanocytes, p14ARF mRNA reduction and p16INK4A inactivation were frequently noticed. No association between p14ARF promoter methylation and mRNA levels was found, whereas aberrant p16INK4A methylation was associated with gene silencing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Comparative analysis within melanomas of different Breslow's thicknesses showed that drastic reductions in p14ARF and p16INK4A expression appeared at the level of thin/intermediate and intermediate/thick transitions. The effects of 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) on in vivo binding of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and acetyl histone H3/H4 to p14ARF and p16INK4A promoters were tested together with the impact of ectopic expression of p14ARF and p16INK4A on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SAHA treatment induced H3 and H4 hyperacetylation at the p14ARF promoter followed by increased p14ARF expression, whereas exposure to 5-aza-dC decreased the recruitment of DNMT1 and DNMT3b at the p16INK4A promoter and reactivated p16INK4A. Studies on promoter-associated di-methyl histone H3 (Lys4) levels ruled out an involvement of this epigenetic trait on p14ARF and p16INK4A expression. The enforced expression of p14ARF or p16INK4A and, even more so, their co-expression, significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Our data pinpoint: i) a frequent impairment of p14ARF and p16INK4A gene expression by epigenetic modifications in melanoma; ii) histone hypoacetylation as the dominant mechanism of p14ARF silencing; and iii) 5\u2032 CpG promoter methylation as the major mechanism of p16INK4A gene inactivation. Collectively, our data suggest that selected epi-drugs may be useful in melanoma treatment.",

     "abstract": "The cohesin complex has essential roles in cell division, DNA damage repair and gene transcription. The transcriptional function of cohesin is thought to derive from its ability to connect distant regulatory elements with gene promoters. Genome-wide binding of cohesin in breast cancer cells frequently coincides with estrogen receptor alpha (ER), leading to the hypothesis that cohesin facilitates estrogen-dependent gene transcription. We found that cohesin modulates the expression of only a subset of genes in the ER transcription program, either activating or repressing transcription depending on the gene target. Estrogen-responsive genes most significantly influenced by cohesin were enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer progression such as PI3K and ErbB1. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, cohesin depletion enhanced transcription of TFF1 and TFF2, and was associated with increased ER binding and increased interaction between TFF1 and its distal enhancer situated within TMPRSS3. In contrast, cohesin depletion reduced c-MYC mRNA and was accompanied by reduced interaction between a distal enhancer of c-MYC and its promoters. Our data indicates that cohesin is not a universal facilitator of ER-induced transcription and can even restrict enhancer\u2013promoter communication. We propose that cohesin modulates transcription of estrogen-dependent genes to achieve appropriate directionality and amplitude of expression.",

In this study, we show that Pokemon can interact directly with Smad4 both in vitro and in vivo.

The aberrant expression of Mcl-1 is important for sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs in gastric cancer. However, the regulatory mechanism of Mcl-1 in gastric cancer cells remains unclear. In this study, we first found that Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and Mcl-1 expression levels were positively correlated in human gastric cancer specimens and that both are associated with poor prognosis of patients treated with oxaliplatin. Second, we demonstrated that the expression level of Mcl-1 was correlated with FOXM1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Third, reporter assays showed that FOXM1 upregulated the promoter activity of the Mcl-1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further demonstrated that FOXM1 could bind to a particular site (\u2212\u00a0635acaaacaa\u2212\u00a0628) in the promoter region of the Mcl-1 gene. Moreover, CCK-8 assays and analyses of apoptosis revealed that the suppression of the FOXM1/Mcl-1 pathway induced apoptosis and thus increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer cells, whereas the enhancement of the FOXM1/Mcl-1 pathway inhibited apoptosis and decreased sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer cells. Taken together, this study is the first to not only show that Mcl-1 is a novel target gene of FOXM1 but also suggest that targeting FOXM1/Mcl-1 may be a novel strategy to enhance sensitivity to oxaliplatin in gastric cancer.",

Transcriptome-wide analysis of THP-1 human monocytes had indicated more than 600 genes to be significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) stimulated after 4\u00a0h incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3, but only 67 of them where more than 1.5-fold up-regulated. These include the genes encoding for the transcription factors BCL6, NFE2, POU4F2 and ELF4, which are controlled by one or two VDR binding sites within their chromosomal domains. The latter are defined via DNA loop formation mediated by the transcription factor CTCF that is highly conserved in its genome-wide loci. We found BCL6 being most responsive to 1,25(OH)2D3 and selected it for further analysis. An incubation of THP-1 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24\u00a0h resulted in a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) change in the mRNA expression of more than 1600 genes, of which 132 were at least 2-fold up-regulated. About half of the latter genes are secondary 1,25(OH)2D3 targets, since they do not carry any VDR binding site within their chromosomal domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing datasets indicated that the majority of these domains contain a BCL6 binding site. We followed the secondary transcriptional response to 1,25(OH)2D3 for eight representative gene examples and confirmed the binding of CTCF and BCL6 to their respective chromosomal domains. In conclusion, our study indicated that in monocytes most of the physiological responses to 1,25(OH)2D3 involve the action of the transcription factor BCL6.",

We investigated whether the human BCRP promoter contains a functional cAMP response element (CRE). 8Br-cAMP, a cAMP analogue, increased the activity of a BCRP promoter reporter construct and BCRP mRNA in human carcinoma cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway activation also led to an increase in p-CREB and in BCRP promoter reporter activity via two major downstream EGFR signaling pathways: the phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. EGF treatment increased the phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT, ERK and CREB, while simultaneously enhancing BCRP mRNA and functional protein expression. EGF-stimulated CREB phosphorylation and BCRP induction were diminished by inhibition of EGFR, PI3K/AKT or RAS/MAPK signaling. CREB silencing using RNA interference reduced basal levels of BCRP mRNA and diminished the induction of BCRP by EGF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that a putative CRE site on the BCRP promoter bound p-CREB by a point mutation of the CRE site abolished EGF-induced stimulation of BCRP promoter reporter activity. Furthermore, the CREB co-activator, cAMP-regulated transcriptional co-activator (CRTC2), is involved in CREB-mediated BCRP transcription: androgen depletion of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells increased both CREB phosphorylation and CRTC2 nuclear translocation, and enhanced BCRP expression. Silencing CREB or CRTC2 reduced basal BCRP expression and BCRP induction under androgen-depletion conditions. This novel CRE site plays a central role in mediating BCRP gene expression in several human cancer cell lines following activation of multiple cancer-relevant signaling pathways.",

     "abstract": "The genes encoding luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone are activated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and we hypothesized that this involves GnRH-induction of various histone modifications. At basal conditions in an immature gonadotrope-derived cell line, the hormone-specific \u03b2-subunit gene promoters are densely packed with histones, and contain low levels of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). GnRH both induces this modification and causes histone loss, creating a more active chromatin state. The H3K4me3 appears to be mediated by menin and possibly catalyzed by the menin-mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) 1/2 methyl transferase complex, as inhibition of MLL recruitment or menin knockdown reduced gene expression and the levels of H3K4me3 on all three promoters. Menin recruitment to the \u03b2-subunit gene promoters is increased by GnRH, possibly involving transcription factors such as estrogen receptor \u03b1 and/or steroidogenic factor 1, with which menin interacts. Menin also interacts with ring finger protein 20, which ubiquitylates H2BK120 (H2BK120ub), which was reported to be a pre-requisite for H3K4me3 at various gene promoters. Although levels of H2BK120ub are increased by GnRH in the coding regions of these genes, levels at the promoters do not correlate with those of H3K4me3, nor with gene expression, suggesting that H3K4me3 is not coupled to H2BK120ub in transcriptional activation of these genes.",

ARSB controls the degradation of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) by removing the 4-sulfate group at the non-reducing end of the C4S chain, but has not previously been shown to affect C4S biosynthesis. The decline in CHST11 expression following ARSB reduction is attributable to effects of ARSB on bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)4, since BMP4 expression and secretion declined when ARSB was silenced. Inhibition of BMP4 by neutralizing antibody also reduced CHST11 expression. When C4S was more sulfated due to decline in ARSB, more BMP4 was sequestered by C4S in the cell membrane, and CHST11 expression declined. Exogenous recombinant BMP4, acting through a phospho-Smad3 binding site in the CHST11 promoter, increased the mRNA expression of CHST11. In contrast to the decline in BMP4 that followed decline in ARSB, Wnt9A mRNA expression was previously shown to increase when ARSB was silenced and C4S was more highly sulfated. Galectin-3 bound less to the more highly sulfated C4S, leading to increased nuclear translocation and enhanced galectin-3 interaction with Sp1 in the Wnt9A promoter. Silencing Wnt9A increased the expression of CHST11 in the colonic epithelial cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated enhancing effects of Wnt9A siRNA and exogenous BMP4 on the CHST11 promoter through the pSmad3 binding site. These findings suggest that cellular processes mediated by differential effects of Wnt9A and BMP4 can result from opposing effects on CHST11 expression.",

Methylation was analyzed by Methylation Specific PCR, sequencing of bisulfite treated DNA and luciferase assay.qRT-PCR analysis revealed that miR-155 was differentially expressed in MM and its upregulation was associated with longer survival. DNA methylation of CpG island present in the first exon of miR-155 host gene was associated with its low expression in MM cell lines and patient samples. Our results showed for the first time that in vitro methylation of part of the promoter and first exon abrogated the miR-155 expression.

Additionally, we found that LPS \u201cimmunological challenge\u201d was insufficient to induce miR-155 expression in MM cell lines with methylated DNA around transcription start site (TSS).This study provides evidence that DNA methylation contributes to miR-155 expression in myeloma cells.

     "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA), the main active vitamin A derivative, is crucial for embryo development, regulating cellular processes, embryo patterning and organogenesis. Many studies performed in mammalian or avian models have successfully undertaken the investigation of the role played by RA during embryogenesis.Since the early 1980s, the zebra\ufb01sh (Danio rerio) has emerged as a powerful developmental model to study the in vivo role of RA during embryogenesis. Unlike mammalian models, zebra\ufb01sh embryogenesis is external, not only allowing the observation of the translucent embryo from the earliest steps but also providing an easily accessible system for pharmacological treatment or genetic approaches. Therefore, zebra\ufb01sh research largely participates in deciphering the role of RA during development.This review aims at illustrating different concepts of RA signaling based on the research performed on zebra\ufb01sh. Indeed, RA action relies on a multitude of cross-talk with other signaling pathways and requires a coordinated, dynamic and \ufb01ne-regulation of its level and activity in both temporal and spatial dimensions. This review also highlights major advances that have been discovered using zebra\ufb01sh such as the observation of the RA gradient in vivo for the \ufb01rst time, the effects of RA signaling in brain patterning, its role in establishing left\u2013right asymmetry and its effects on the development of a variety of organs and tissues including the heart, blood, bone and fat.This review demonstrates that the zebra\ufb01sh is a convenient and powerful model to study retinoic acid signaling during vertebrate embryogenesis.

The available clinical and experimental data provide uncontested evidence for the pleiotropic roles of RA signaling in development of multiple embryonic structures and organs such eyes, central nervous system, gonads, lungs and heart. The development of any of these above-mentioned embryonic organ systems can be effectively utilized to showcase the many strategies utilized by RA signaling. However, it is very likely that the strategies employed to transfer RA signals during cardiac development comprise the majority of the relevant and sophisticated ways through which retinoid signals can be conveyed in a complex biological system. Here, we provide the reader with arguments indicating that RA signaling is exquisitely regulated according to specific phases of cardiac development and that RA signaling itself is one of the major regulators of the timing of cardiac morphogenesis and differentiation. We will focus on the role of signaling by RA receptors (RARs) in early phases of heart development. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear receptors in animal development.",

     "abstract": "The essential roles of thyroid hormone (TH) in perinatal brain development have been known for decades. More recently, many of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multiple effects of TH on proliferation, differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis and myelination in the developing nervous system have been elucidated. At the same time data from both epidemiological studies and animal models have revealed that the influence of thyroid signaling on development of the nervous system, extends to all periods of life, from early embryogenesis to neurogenesis in the adult brain. This review focuses on recent insights into the actions of TH during early neurogenesis. A key concept is that, in contrast to the previous ideas that only the unliganded receptor was implicated in these early phases, a critical role of the ligand, T3, is increasingly recognized. These findings are considered in the light of increasing knowledge of cell specific control of T3 availability as a function of deiodinase activity and transporter expression. These requirements for TH in the early stages of neurogenesis take on new relevance given the increasing epidemiological data on adverse effects of TH lack in early pregnancy on children's neurodevelopmental outcome. These ideas lead logically into a discussion on how the actions of TH during the first phases of neurogenesis can be potentially disrupted by gestational iodine lack and/or chemical pollution.

     "abstract": "Thyroid hormones (THs) play an essential role in vertebrate development, acting predominantly via nuclear TH receptors (TRs) which are ligand-dependent transcription factors. Binding of the ligand (predominantly T3) induces a switch from gene activation to gene repression or vice versa. Iodothyronine deiodinases (Ds) and TH transporters are important regulators of intracellular T3 availability and therefore contribute to the control of TR-dependent development.The present review discusses the possible roles of Ds and TH transporters in regulating embryonic and larval (pre-juvenile) TR-dependent development in vertebrates. It focuses mainly on well-known model species for direct and indirect vertebrate development, including zebrafish, Xenopus, chicken and mouse. Data are provided on stage- and tissue/cell-specific changes in expression of Ds and TH transporters. This information is combined with functional data obtained from gain-and-loss of function studies.Knockout/knockdown of each type of D has provided strong evidence for their implication in the control of important developmental processes and several D expression patterns and functions have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Knockout/knockdown of the inactivating D3 enzyme indicates that a premature switch from unliganded to liganded TR action is often more detrimental than a delayed one. The majority of ontogenetic studies on TH transporter distribution and function have focused on brain development, showing variable impact of knockout/knockdown depending on the species. Future research in different models using conditional silencing will hopefully further improve our understanding on how TH transporters, Ds and TRs cooperate to regulate TR-mediated impact on vertebrate development.

     "abstract": "Estrogens affect brain development of vertebrates, not only by impacting activity and morphology of existing circuits, but also by modulating embryonic and adult neurogenesis. The issue is complex as estrogens can not only originate from peripheral tissues, but also be locally produced within the brain itself due to local aromatization of androgens. In this respect, teleost fishes are quite unique because aromatase is expressed exclusively in radial glial cells, which represent pluripotent cells in the brain of all vertebrates. Expression of aromatase in the brain of fish is also strongly stimulated by estrogens and some androgens. This creates a very intriguing positive auto-regulatory loop leading to dramatic aromatase expression in sexually mature fish with elevated levels of circulating steroids. Looking at the effects of estrogens or anti-estrogens in the brain of adult zebrafish showed that estrogens inhibit rather than stimulate cell proliferation and newborn cell migration. The functional meaning of these observations is still unclear, but these data suggest that the brain of fish is experiencing constant remodeling under the influence of circulating steroids and brain-derived neurosteroids, possibly permitting a diversification of sexual strategies, notably hermaphroditism. Recent data in frogs indicate that aromatase expression is limited to neurons and do not concern radial glial cells. Thus, until now, there is no other example of vertebrates in which radial progenitors express aromatase. This raises the question of when and why these new features were gained and what are their adaptive benefits.

Despite the critical function of androgens in masculinization, the downstream molecular mechanisms of androgen signaling are poorly understood. Tissue recombination experiments and tissue specific androgen receptor (AR) knockout mouse studies have revealed epithelial or mesenchymal specific androgen-AR signaling functions. These findings also indicate that epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interactions are a key feature of AR specific activity, and paracrine growth factor action may mediate some of the effects of androgens.

     "abstract": "Expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is widespread but may vary depending on the developmental stage of the animal, and therefore may differentially influence phenotypic function. Thus, the major role of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]/VDR system is to regulate mineral and skeletal homeostasis, although mainly after birth. Post-natally, under conditions of low dietary calcium, the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system enhances intestinal transcellular transport of calcium and possibly paracellular calcium entry by regulating genes that are critical for these functions. This process, by providing adequate calcium, is essential for normal development of the skeletal growth plate and mineralization of bone. Furthermore, blood calcium and phosphorus homeostasis is maintained by an interplay between feedback loops of the 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system with parathyroid hormone and with fibroblast-growth factor (FGF) 23 respectively. The 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system can also modulate the expression of genes involved in both bone formation and resorption post-natally. Ligand independent activity of the VDR normally influences mammalian hair cycling after birth by potentiating Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Nevertheless ligand bound VDR may also modulate epidermal cell proliferation/differentiation by regulating the balance in function of c-MYC and its antagonist the transcriptional repressor MAD1/MXD1 in skin epithelia. The 1,25(OH)2D/VDR system can also modulate innate immune cells and promote a more tolerogenic immunological status and may therefore influence inflammation and the development of autoimmunity; whether this impacts the fetus is uncertain.

     "abstract": "Although a great deal of information is available concerning the role of ecdysone in insect oogenesis, research has tended to focus on vitellogenesis and choriogenesis. As such, the study of oogenesis in a strict sense has received much less attention. This situation changed recently when a number of observations carried out in the meroistic polytrophic ovarioles of Drosophila melanogaster started to unravel the key roles played by ecdysone in different steps of oogenesis. Thus, in larval stages, a non-autonomous role of ecdysone, first in repression and later in activation, of stem cell niche and primordial germ cell differentiation has been reported. In the adult, ecdysone stimulates the proliferation of germline stem cells, plays a role in stem cell niche maintenance and is needed non-cell-autonomously for correct differentiation of germline stem cells. Moreover, in somatic cells ecdysone is required for 16-cell cyst formation and for ovarian follicle development. In the transition from stages 8 to 9 of oogenesis, ecdysone signalling is fundamental when deciding whether or not to go ahead with vitellogenesis depending on the nutritional status, as well as to start border cell migration.

     "abstract": "During the development of both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons undergo a crucial remodeling process that is necessary for their new function. Neuronal remodeling is composed of two stages: first, axons and dendrites are pruned without the loss of the cell body; later, this process is most commonly followed by a regrowth step. Holometabolous insects like the fruitfly Drosophila exhibit striking differences between their larval and adult stages. These neuronal remodeling processes occur during metamorphosis, the period of transformation from a larva to an adult. All axon and dendrite pruning events ultimately depend on the EcR nuclear receptor. Its ligand, the steroid molting hormone ecdysone, binds to heteromeric receptors comprising the nuclear receptor ECR and USP, and this complex regulates target genes involved in neuronal remodeling. Here we review the nuclear receptor-mediated genetic control of the main neuronal remodeling events described so far in Drosophila. These events consist of neurite degeneration in the mushroom bodies (MBs: the brain memory center) and in the dendritic arborizing sensory neurons, of neurite retraction or small scale elimination in the thoracic ventral neurosecretory cells, in the olfactory circuits and in the neuromuscular junction. MB axon regrowth after pruning and the role of MB neuron remodeling in memory formation are also reviewed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear receptors in animal development.",

This is accomplished by a complex network of different cell types and signals both inside and outside the liver. Bile acids (BAs) are recently identified as liver-specific metabolic signals and promote liver regeneration by activating their receptors: Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and G-protein-coupled BA receptor 1 (GPBAR1, or TGR5). FXR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. FXR promotes liver regeneration after 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx) or liver injury. Moreover, activation of FXR is able to alleviate age-related liver regeneration defects. Both liver- and intestine-FXR are activated by BAs after liver resection or injury and promote liver regeneration through distinct mechanism. TGR5 is a membrane-bound BA receptor and it is also activated during liver regeneration. TGR5 regulates BA hydrophobicity and stimulates BA excretion in urine during liver regeneration. BA signaling thus represents a novel metabolic pathway during liver regeneration. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Nuclear receptors in animal development.",

The locus of the fertility problem has not been determined. The behavioral arrhythmicity is due to the unfulfilled-dependent disruption of gene expression in a set of pacemaker neurons. The eclosion and the mushroom body lobe phenotypes of unfulfilled mutants are the result of developmental problems associated with failures in axon pathfinding or re-extension.

     "abstract": "The development of complex multicellular organisms is dependent on regulatory decisions that are necessary for the establishment of specific differentiation and metabolic cellular states. Nuclear receptors (NRs) form a large family of transcription factors that play critical roles in the regulation of development and metabolism of Metazoa. Based on their DNA binding and ligand binding domains, NRs are divided into eight NR subfamilies from which representatives of six subfamilies are present in both deuterostomes and protostomes indicating their early evolutionary origin. In some nematode species, especially in Caenorhabditis, the family of NRs expanded to a large number of genes strikingly exceeding the number of NR genes in vertebrates or insects. Nematode NRs, including the multiplied Caenorhabditis genes, show clear relation to vertebrate and insect homologues belonging to six of the eight main NR subfamilies. This review summarizes advances in research of nematode NRs and their developmental functions. Nematode NRs can reveal evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that regulate specific developmental and metabolic processes as well as new regulatory adaptations. They represent the results of a large number of natural experiments with structural and functional potential of NRs for the evolution of the phylum.

However, the regulatory mechanism of SCN3A expression under epileptic condition is still unknown. Here we showed a high level of Scn3a mRNA expression in mouse embryonic hippocampus with gradually decreasing to a low level during the postnatal development and a methylation of a specific CpG site (\u2212\u00a039C) in the Scn3a promoter was increased in hippocampus during postnatal development, corresponding to the downregulation of Scn3a expression. Furthermore, in vitro methylation and \u2212\u00a039C\u00a0>\u00a0T mutation of the Scn3a promoter decreased the reporter gene expression, suggesting an important role of the \u2212\u00a039C site in regulating gene expression. We then demonstrated that the sequence containing \u2212\u00a039C was a MBD2-binding motif and the CpG methylation of the promoter region increased the capability of MBD2's binding to the motif. Knockdown of MBD2 in mouse N1E-115 cells led to the \u2212\u00a039C methylation and the downregulation of Scn3a transcription by decreasing the Scn3a promoter activity. In the hippocampus of seizure mice, the expressions of Scn3a and Mbd2 were upregulated after 10-day KA treatment. At the same time point, the \u2212\u00a039C site was demethylated and the capability of MBD2's binding to the Scn3a promoter motif was decreased. Taken together, these findings suggest that CpG methylation and MBD2 are involved in altering Scn3a expression during postnatal development and seizure condition.",

     "abstract": "Macrophages (M\u03a6) often accumulate in hypoxic areas, where they significantly influence disease progression. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, generate alternatively activated macrophages that support tumor growth. To understand how alternative activation affects the transcriptional profile of hypoxic macrophages, we globally mapped binding sites of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages prestimulated with IL-10. 713 HIF-1 and 795 HIF-2 binding sites were identified under hypoxia. Pretreatment with IL-10 altered the binding pattern, with 120 new HIF-1 and 188 new HIF-2 binding sites emerging. HIF-1 binding was most prominent in promoters, while HIF-2 binding was more abundant in enhancer regions. Comparison of ChIP-seq data obtained in other cells revealed a highly cell type specific binding of HIF. In M\u03a6 HIF binding occurred preferentially in already active enhancers or promoters. To assess the roles of HIF on gene expression, primary human macrophages were treated with siRNA against HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1, followed by genome-wide gene expression analysis. Comparing mRNA expression to the HIF binding profile revealed a significant enrichment of hypoxia-inducible genes previously identified by ChIP-seq. Analysis of gene expression under hypoxia alone and hypoxia/IL-10 showed the enhanced induction of a set of genes including PLOD2 and SLC2A3, while another group including KDM3A and ADM remained unaffected or was reduced by IL-10. Taken together IL-10 influences the DNA binding pattern of HIF and the level of gene induction",

It has been shown that lipid biosynthesis is increased in ER-stressed cells. The N\u03b5-lysine acetylation of ER-resident proteins, including chaperones and enzymes involved in the post-translational protein modification and folding, occurs upon UPR activation. In both ER proteins acetylation and lipid synthesis, acetyl-CoA is the donor of acetyl group and it is transported from the cytosol into the ER. The cytosolic pool of acetyl-CoA is mainly derived from the activity of mitochondrial citrate carrier (CiC). Here, we have demonstrated that expression of CiC is activated in human HepG2 and rat BRL-3A cells during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. This occurs through the involvement of an ER stress responsive region identified within the human and rat CiC proximal promoter. A functional Unfolded Protein Response Element (UPRE) confers responsiveness to the promoter activation by UPR transducers ATF6\u03b1 and XBP1. Overall, our data demonstrate that CiC expression is activated during ER stress through the binding of ATF6\u03b1 and XBP1 to an UPRE element located in the proximal promoter of Cic gene. The role of ER stress-mediated induction of CiC expression has been discussed.",

     "abstract": "MiRNAs and transcription factors have emerged as important regulators for gene expression and are known to regulate various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Previously, using genome-wide expression profiling studies, we have shown an inverse relationship of STAT6 and cholesterol biosynthesis and also identified FOXJ2 binding sites in the upstream region of 3 key genes (HMGCR, HMGCS1 and IDI1) of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Our previous study also provided clues toward the anti-apoptotic role played by STAT6. For better understanding of the cellular response and underlying signaling pathways activated by STAT6 silencing, we examined the changes in miRNome profile after the siRNA-mediated silencing of STAT6 gene in NCI-H460 cells using LNA-based miRNA microarray. Our analysis showed significant downregulation of miRNAs, let-7b and miR-197, out of which miR-197 was predicted to target FOXJ2. We here show that miR-197 not only negatively regulates FOXJ2 expression through direct binding to its respective binding site in its 3\u2032UTR but also alters total cholesterol levels by regulating genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We further demonstrated that STAT6 silencing elicited ER stress-mediated apoptosis in NCI-H460 cells through C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) induction, alteration of BH3 only proteins expression and ROS production. The apoptosis induced by STAT6 downregulation was partially reversed by NAC, the ROS scavenger. Based on the above findings, we suggest that ER stress plays a major role in STAT6-induced apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "The SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 enzymes introduce H3K9me3, which is essential for the viability of mammalian cells. It was the aim of the present work to investigate the substrate specificity and product pattern of SUV39H2. Methylation of peptide SPOT arrays showed that SUV39H2 recognizes a long motif on H3 comprising T6\u2013K14, with highly specific readout of R8, S10, T11 and G12 and partial specificity at T6, A7, G13 and K14. Modification of R8 and phosphorylation of S10 or T11 lead to a reduction or loss of SUV39H2 activity towards H3K9. The specificity of SUV39H2 differs from other H3K9 PKMTs, like Dim-5 or G9a, and these biochemical differences can be explained by the structures of the corresponding enzymes. Based on the specificity profile we identified additional non-histone candidate substrates in human proteins, but all of them were only weakly methylated by SUV39H2 at the peptide level. We conclude that SUV39H2 displays a high preference for the methylation of H3. Using the catalytic SET domain we show here that the enzyme prefers H3K9me0 as a substrate over H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 and it introduces the first two methyl groups into H3K9me0 in a processive reaction. SUV39H2 can transfer up to three methyl groups to lysine 9 of histone H3 but the last methylation reaction is much slower than the first two steps. We also demonstrate that the N324K mutant in the SET domain of SUV39H2 that has been shown to cause an inherited nasal skin disease in Labrador Retrievers renders SUV39H2 inactive. Differences in the circular dichroism spectra of wild type and mutant proteins indicated that the mutation causes slight structural changes.",

     "abstract": "Cells can adapt to their environment and develop distinct identities by rewiring their transcriptional networks to regulate the output of key biological pathways without concomitant mutations to the underlying genes. These alterations, called epigenetic changes, persist stably through mitotic or, in some instances, meiotic cell divisions. In eukaryotes, heritable changes to chromatin structure are a prominent, but not exclusive, mechanism by which epigenetic changes are mediated. These changes are initiated by sequence-specific events, which trigger a cascade of molecular interactions resulting in feedback mechanisms, alterations in chromatin structure, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and ultimately establishment of distinct transcriptional states. In recent years, advances in next generation sequencing have led to the discovery of several novel classes of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In addition to their well-established cytoplasmic roles in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, ncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of epigenetic changes via chromatin-dependent mechanisms in organisms ranging from yeast to man. They function by affecting chromatin structure, histone PTMs, and the recruitment of transcriptional activating or repressing complexes. Among histone PTMs, lysine methylation serves as the binding substrate for the recruitment of key protein complexes involved in the regulation of genome architecture, stability, and gene expression. In this review, we will outline the known mechanisms by which ncRNAs of different origins regulate histone methylation, and in doing so contribute to a variety of genome regulatory functions in eukaryotes.

In this review, we discuss recent work implicating histone methylation in aging. Loss of certain histone methyltransferases and demethylases changes lifespan in invertebrates, and alterations in histone methylation in aged organisms regulate lifespan and aging phenotypes, including oxidative stress-induced hormesis in yeast, insulin signaling in Caenorhabiditis elegans and mammals, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in mammals. In all cases where histone methylation has been shown to impact aging and aging phenotypes, it does so by regulating transcription, suggesting that this is a major mechanism of its action in this context. Histone methylation additionally regulates or is regulated by other cellular pathways that contribute to or combat aging.

Most studies of PABPC1 have focused on its N-terminal RRM domains, which bind the mRNA 3\u2032 poly(A) tail and 5\u2032 translation complex eIF4F via eIF4G; however, the protein also contains a C-terminal MLLE domain that binds a peptide motif, termed PAM2, found in many proteins involved in translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Studies over the past decade have revealed additional functions of PAM2-containing proteins (PACs) in neurodegenerative diseases, circadian rhythms, innate defense, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Here, we summarize functional and structural studies of the MLLE/PAM2 interaction and discuss the diverse roles of PACs.",

     "abstract": "Transcription regulation depends on interactions between repressor or activator proteins with promoter sequences, while post-transcriptional regulation typically relies on microRNA (miRNA) interaction with sequences in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-Untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNA (mRNA). However, several pieces of evidence suggest that miRNA:Argonaute (AGO) complexes may also suppress transcription through RNA interference (RNAi) components and epigenetic mechanisms. However, recent observations suggest that miRNA-induced transcriptional silencing could be exerted by an unknown mechanism independent of chromatin modifiers. The RNA\u2013DNA\u2022DNA triplex structure has emerged as an important RNA tertiary motif in which successive non-canonical base pairs form between a DNA\u2013DNA duplex and a third strand. Frequently, promoters have Purine (PU)-rich tracts, and some Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) targeting these regulatory regions have been shown to inhibit transcription selectively. Here, we summarize observations suggesting that miRNAs exert regulation over promoter regions through miRNA\u2013DNA\u2022DNA triplex structure formation stabilized by AGO proteins which represents a plausible model of RNA-mediated Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS).",

Recent evidence suggests that FOXM1 also has a role in many aspects of the DNA damage response. Accordingly, FOXM1 drives the transcription of genes for DNA damage sensors, mediators, signal transducers and effectors. As a result of these functions, it plays an integral part in maintaining the integrity of the genome and so is key to the propagation of accurate genetic information to the next generation. Preserving the genetic code is a vital means of suppressing cancer and other genetic diseases. Conversely, FOXM1 is also a potent oncogenic factor that is essential for cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance. An enhanced FOXM1 DNA damage repair gene expression network can confer resistance to genotoxic agents. Developing a thorough understanding of the regulation and function of FOXM1 in DNA damage response will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative conditions and immunodeficiency disorders.

These variable 5\u2032UTRs are encoded by a series of alternative 1st exons, and together with their associated promoters they maintain tissue-specific GR expression levels. In this study we over-expressed GR transcripts containing individual 1st exons, and assessed their effect on RNA stability, 3\u2032-splicing, translation initiation and protein isoform production. We showed that these alternative 5\u2032UTRs influence the predicted mRNA structure and free energy, and were associated with differential levels of functional spliced mRNA. However, the 5\u2032UTR had little influence on the relative levels of the two principal 3\u2032 splice transcripts, GR-\u03b1 and -\u03b2. The overall mRNA length, the free energy of the transcript and the translational efficiency directly influenced total GR levels. However, individual N-terminal protein isoform levels appeared to depend upon elements within the 5\u2032UTR. Membrane-GR specific labelling suggested that the mGR originates from transcripts containing exon 1D and possibly 1H, although the specific trafficking sequences or structures within these transcripts remain unidentified. The role of the alternative first exons and their associated 5\u2032UTRs has now been expanded to translational control, influencing total GR levels, individual constituent isoform levels, as well as trafficking to the cell surface.",

Deletion of RGG or both RGG and OB-fold does not change the transcriptional activity of RHA, nor does the stability of viral RNA. However, deletion of both RGG and OB-fold rather than deletion of RGG only results in less production of multiply spliced 6D RNAs.

Emerging lines of evidence showed that microRNAs play crucial roles in bone metabolism and osteoclast differentiation, but no microRNA has yet been reported to be directly related to OCPs fusion. Through a microarray, we found that the expression of miR-7b in RAW264.7 cells was significantly decreased after induction with M-CSF and RANKL. The overexpression of miR-7b in RAW264.7 cells attenuated the number of TRAP-positive cells number and the formation of multinucleated cells, whereas the inhibition of miR-7b enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Through a dual luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed that miR-7b directly targets DC-STAMP. Other fusogenic molecules, such as CD47, ATP6v0d2, and OC-STAMP, were detected to be down-regulated in accordance with the inhibition of DC-STAMP. Because DC-STAMP also participates in osteoclast differentiation through the ITAM-ITIM network, multiple osteoclast-specific genes in the ITAM-ITIM network were detected to identify how DC-STAMP is involved in this process. The results showed that molecules associated with the ITAM-ITIM network, such as NFATc1 and OSCAR, which are crucial in osteoclastogenesis, were consistently altered due to DC-STAMP inhibition. These findings suggest that miR-7b inhibits osteoclastogenesis and cell-cell fusion by directly targeting DC-STAMP. In addition, the inhibition of DC-STAMP and its downstream signals changed the expression of other fusogenic genes and key regulating genes, such as Nfatc1, c-fos, Akt, Irf8, Mapk1, and Traf6. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-7b may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of osteoclast-related bone disorders.",

As a primary transcription factor, Nrf2 controls the antioxidant response to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Herein we systemically examined the role of Nrf2 in DN progression and its regulatory mechanism in a mouse model bearing type II diabetes and in cultured human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs). We found that Nrf2 could ameliorate DN progression by transcriptional repression of TGF\u03b21 in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Nrf2 bound to the specific region in TGF\u03b21 promoter by interactions with transcription factors c-Jun and SP1. Significant abolishment of Nrf2-mediated TGF\u03b21 transcriptional repression could be accomplished by knockdown of either c-Jun or SP1, and site-directed mutagenesis of c-Jun and SP1 binding sites in the TGF\u03b21 promoter specific region. Moreover, after interacting with c-Jun and SP1, Nrf2 inhibited c-Jun and SP1 activations, and thus reversed c-Jun- and SP1-promoted TGF\u03b21 transcription. In all, Nrf2 could slow down DN progression by repression of TGF\u03b21 in a c-Jun and SP1-dependent way. Our findings may provide novel clues for DN preventions and interventions in clinic.",

     "abstract": "The proper establishment of the dorsal root ganglion/spinal cord nociceptive circuitry depends on a group of homeodomain transcription factors that includes Prrxl1, Brn3a and Tlx3. By the use of epistatic analysis, it was suggested that Tlx3 and Brn3a, which highly co-localize with Prrxl1 in these tissues, are required to maintain Prrxl1 expression. Here, we report two Tlx3-dependent transcriptional mechanisms acting on Prrxl1 alternative promoters, referred to as P3 and P1/P2 promoters. We demonstrate that (i) Tlx3 induces the transcriptional activity of the TATA-containing promoter P3 by directly binding to a bipartite DNA motif and (ii) it synergistically interacts with Prrxl1 by indirectly activating the Prrxl1 TATA-less promoters P1/P2 via the action of Brn3a. The Tlx3 N-terminal domain 1\u201338 was shown to have a major role on the overall Tlx3 transcriptional activity and the C-terminus domain (amino acids 256\u2013291) to mediate the Tlx3 effect on promoters P1/P2. On the other hand, the 76\u2013111 domain was shown to decrease Tlx3 activity on the TATA-promoter P3. In addition to its action on Prrxl1 alternative promoters, Tlx3 proved to have the ability to induce Prrxl1 phosphorylation. The Tlx3 domain responsible for Prrxl1 hyperphosphorylation was mapped and encompasses amino acid residues 76 to 111. Altogether, our results suggest that Tlx3 uses distinct mechanisms to tightly modulate Prrxl1 activity, either by controlling its transcriptional levels or by increasing Prrxl1 phosphorylation state.",

Data collected so far suggests that CNBP is required for proper craniofacial development. Despite the advances achieved in the last decade, the identity of the molecular targets of CNBP responsible for its role in rostral head development remains elusive.Methods: In this work we used the CNBP single-stranded DNA-consensus binding sequence to find out putative CNBP target genes present in the human, mouse, chicken, Xenopus and zebrafish genomes.Results: Most of the identified genes are associated with embryonic developmental processes, being three of them (cdk14, ptk7 and tcf7l2) members of the Wnt signaling pathway. This finding, along with previous one showing that CNBP down-regulates the transcription of Wnt5, aimed our work to address the role of CNBP on the WNT signaling players and pathway regulation. Experiments carried out in zebrafish developing embryos revealed that craniofacial morphology was more adversely affected as CNBP abundance decreased. Furthermore, we observed that CNBP up-regulated in a dose-dependent fashion the transcription of cdk14, ptk7 and tcf7l2, which in turn was reflected in c-myc, ccnd1 and axin2 expression.Conclusions: Results reveal a role of CNBP in transcriptional control of components of the Wnt signaling pathway, which might explain its requirement for proper craniofacial development.",

There are three consecutive putative binding sites for the transcription factor early growth response protein 1(Egr-1) in promoter region II of the gdnf gene, and Egr-1 participates in gdnf gene transcription activation. Here we show that the acetylation level of H3K9 at Egr-1 binding sites in gdnf gene promoter region II in rat C6 astroglioma cells was significantly higher than that in normal astrocytes, and the binding capacity was also significantly higher. In C6 astroglioma cells, gdnf gene transcription significantly decreased after Egr-1 knock-down. In addition, the deletion or mutation of the Egr-1 binding site also significantly down-regulated the activity of promoter region II of this gene in vitro. When curcumin decreased the acetylation level of H3K9 at the Egr-1 binding site, the binding of Egr-1 to promoter region II and GDNF mRNA levels significantly decreased. In contrast, trichostatin A treatment significantly increased H3K9 acetylation at the Egr-1 binding site, which significantly increased both the binding of Egr-1 with promoter region II and GDNF mRNA levels. In this context, knocking down Egr-1 significantly reduced the elevation in gdnf gene transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the hyperacetylation of H3K9 at Egr-1 binding sites in promoter region II of the gdnf gene can up-regulate the binding of Egr-1 to increase gdnf gene transcription in glioma cells.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic silencing mechanisms are essential for regulating germ cell apoptosis in response to different stimuli during complicated spermatogenesis. Herein, we report the potential signaling events related to up-regulation of metastasis associated protein 1 (Mta1), a master chromatin modifier, during mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP)-induced Sertoli cells (SCs) injury. Mta1 up-regulation correlated to the gradual increases of MYC expression in MEHP-treated SCs. Selective knockdown of MYC abolished MEHP-induced activation of Mta1, suggesting that MYC may regulate the Mta1 signaling following MEHP injury. Furthermore, MTA1 acted as a specific corepressor of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (Timp2) during SCs injury. Mta1 repressed Timp2 expression either directly by recruiting histone deacetylase 2 onto the Timp2 promoter or indirectly by enhancing NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses during MEHP injury. This transcriptional and post-translational down-regulation of Timp2/TIMP2 expression consequently resulted in the stimulated activation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in SCs, which should ultimately promote germ cell death upon MEHP insult. From a functional standpoint, inhibition of endogenous Mta1 expression along with anti-inflammation treatment in cultured SCs could rescue MEHP-inhibited TIMP2 and subsequently rebalanced MMP2 activity to the control level.

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle formation is controlled by multiple processes. These processes are tightly regulated by muscle regulatory factors. Genes that are highly and specifically expressed during myogenesis need to be identified. In the present study, the role of an anti-adipogenic gene adipose (Adp) in myogenesis is demonstrated. We discover that the expression of Adp is increased during myoblast differentiation. Overexpression of Adp in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells leads to an increase of myogenesis and up-regulation of MyoG expression. The inhibition effect of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) on myogenic differentiation is reversed by Adp-overexpression. Further research showed that TNF\u03b1 significantly decreases Adp expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase reporter assays showed that TNF\u03b1 can inhibit Adp gene promoter activity and impair gene transcription. KLF15 was found to regulate the transcription of Adp. Furthermore, the expression of KLF15 and its binding to Adp promoter were reduced due to TNF\u03b1 treatment. The reduced KLF15 expression after TNF\u03b1 treatment is responsible for the repression of Adp gene promoter activity. KLF15 was also found to participate in Adp-mediated myogenic differentiation. Taken together, these data identify Adp as a positive modulator of myoblast differentiation and provide new insights for Adp function research.",

Notably, mutations in both of these genes lead to dystonia (DYT6 or DYT1). Surprisingly, expressional changes of TOR1A in THAP1 mutation carriers have not been detected indicating additional levels of regulation. Here, we investigated whether THAP1 is able to autoregulate its own expression. Using in-silico prediction, luciferase reporter gene assays, and (quantitative) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we defined the THAP1 minimal promoter to a 480\u00a0bp-fragment and demonstrated specific binding of THAP1 to this region which resulted in repression of the THAP1 promoter. This autoregulation was disturbed by different DYT6-causing mutations. Two mutants (Ser6Phe, Arg13His) were shown to be less stable than wildtype THAP1 adding to the effect of reduced binding to the THAP1 promoter. Overexpressed THAP1 is preferably degraded through the proteasome. Notably, endogenous THAP1 expression was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing wildtype THAP1 as demonstrated by quantitative PCR. In contrast, higher THAP1 levels were detected in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived neurons from THAP1 mutation carriers. Thus, we identified a feedback-loop in the regulation of THAP1 expression and demonstrated that mutant THAP1 leads to higher THAP1 expression levels. This compensatory autoregulation may contribute to the mean age at onset in the late teen years or even reduced penetrance in some THAP1 mutation carriers.",

The mitochondrial citrate carrier (CIC), encoded by the SLC25A1 gene, promotes the export of citrate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, a process that profoundly influences energy balance in the cells. We have previously shown that SLC25A1 is a target gene for lipopolysaccharide signaling and promotes the production of inflammatory mediators. We now demonstrate that SLC25A1 is induced at the transcriptional level by two key pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), and such induction involves the activity of the nuclear factor kappa B and STAT1 transcription factors. By studying the down-stream events following SLC25A1 activation during signals that mimic inflammation, we demonstrate that CIC is required for regulating the levels of nitric oxide and of prostaglandins by TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3. Importantly, we show that the citrate exported from mitochondria via CIC and its downstream metabolic intermediate, acetyl-coenzyme A, are necessary for TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 to induce nitric oxide and prostaglandin production. These findings provide the first line of evidence that the citrate export pathway, via CIC, is central for cytokine-induced inflammatory signals and shed new light on the relationship between energy metabolism and inflammation.",

In the present study, we show that PDYN is targeted by the transcription factor REST in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and that that interfering with REST activity increases PDYN expression in these cells. We also show that REST binding to PDYN is reduced in the adult human brain compared to SH-SY5Y cells, which coincides with higher PDYN expression. This may be related to MIR-9 mediated down-regulation of REST as suggested by a strong inverse correlation between REST and MIR-9 expression.

Despite unprecedented progress in the knowledge of enhancer mechanisms of action, there are still many unanswered questions. In particular, the contribution of an enhancer's local chromatin configuration to its mechanism of action is not completely understood. Here we describe a novel regulatory element, the Upstream Enhancer Element (UEE), which modulates the activity of the chicken \u03b1-globin 3\u2032 enhancer by regulating its chromatin structure, specifically by positioning a nucleosome upstream of the core enhancer. This element binds nuclear factors and confers a more restricted activation on the \u03b1-globin 3\u2032 enhancer, suggesting a progressive/rheostatic model for enhancer activity. Our results suggest that the UEE activity contributes to the positioning of a nucleosome that is necessary for the \u03b1-globin 3\u2032 enhancer activation.",

The yeast histone deacetylases, Hda1p and Rpd3p, occupy the repressed FLO1 promoter region in a Cyc8\u2013Tup1 dependent manner and coordinate histone deacetylation, nucleosome stabilisation and gene repression. Moreover, we show that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex Swi\u2013Snf occupies the site vacated by Cyc8\u2013Tup1 in a cyc8 mutant. These data suggest that distinctly bound Cyc8\u2013Tup1 cooperates with Hda1p and Rpd3p to establish or maintain an extensive array of strongly positioned, deacetylated nucleosomes over the FLO1 promoter and upstream region which inhibit histone acetylation, block Swi\u2013Snf binding and prevent transcription.",

Consequently, the incubation of HUVECs with CRC-MVs promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation activities of these cells.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that GATA4 promotes a jejunal versus ileal identity in mouse intestine by directly activating and repressing specific subsets of absorptive enterocyte genes by modulating the acetylation of histone H3, lysine 27 (H3K27), a mark of active chromatin, at sites of GATA4 occupancy. Global analysis of mouse jejunal epithelium showed a statistically significant association of GATA4 occupancy with GATA4-regulated genes. Occupancy was equally distributed between down- and up-regulated targets, and occupancy sites showed a dichotomy of unique motif over-representation at down- versus up-regulated genes. H3K27ac enrichment at GATA4-binding loci that mapped to down-regulated genes (activation targets) was elevated, changed little upon conditional Gata4 deletion, and was similar to control ileum, whereas H3K27ac enrichment at GATA4-binding loci that mapped to up-regulated genes (repression targets) was depleted, increased upon conditional Gata4 deletion, and approached H3K27ac enrichment in wild-type control ileum.

Natural mRNAs are degraded by NMD due to the presence of specific NMD targeting features. An atypically long 3\u2032-UTR is one of the features that has been shown to induce the rapid degradation of mRNAs by NMD in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms. S. cerevisiae CTR2 mRNAs have long 3\u2032-UTRs and are sensitive to NMD, although the extent by which these long 3\u2032-UTRs target the CTR2 mRNAs to the pathway is unknown. Here, we investigated the sequence elements that induce NMD of the CTR2 mRNAs and determined that the long CTR2 3\u2032-UTR is sufficient to target an NMD-insensitive mRNA to the pathway. We also found that, although the CTR2 3\u2032-UTR contributes to NMD-induced degradation, CTR2 mRNAs contain additional NMD-inducing features that function cooperatively with the atypically long 3\u2032-UTR to trigger mRNA degradation. Lengthening the CTR2 ORF abrogates NMD and renders the mRNAs immune to the NMD pathway. Moreover, we found that transcription of CTR2 driven by the GPD promoter, which is not identical to the CTR2 promoter, affects degradation of the transcripts by NMD.",

In this study, we used transcriptional profiling to identify genes and cellular processes that are responsive during arsenite and tert-butyl hydroperoxide exposure in Kluyveromyces lactis. Many arsenite-responsive genes encode proteins involved in redox processes, protein folding and stabilization, and transmembrane transport. The majority of peroxide-responsive genes encode functions related to transcription, translation, redox processes, metabolism and transport. A substantial number of these stress-regulated genes contain binding motifs for the AP-1 like transcription factors KlYap1 and KlYap8. We demonstrate that KlYap8 binds to and regulates gene expression through a 13 base-pair promoter motif, and that KlYap8 provides protection against arsenite, antimonite, cadmium and peroxide toxicity. Direct transport assays show that Klyap8\u0394 cells accumulate more arsenic and cadmium than wild type cells and that the Klyap8\u0394 mutant is defective in arsenic and cadmium export. KlYap8 regulates gene expression in response to both arsenite and peroxide, and might cooperate with KlYap1 in regulation of specific gene targets. Comparison of KlYap8 with its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue ScYap8 indicates that KlYap8 senses and responds to multiple stress signals whereas ScYap8 is only involved in the response to arsenite and antimonite. Thus, our data suggest that functional specialization of ScYap8 has occurred after the whole genome duplication event.

DZNep affected promoter enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, whereas H3K4me3 remained stable.

Loss/gain of H3K27me3 on promoters did not result in changes in gene expression levels until 24\u00a0h post-fertilization. In contrast, genes gaining H3K9me3 displayed strong and constant down-regulation upon DZNep treatment.

The Stat3 and histone markings data were also intersected with a set of microarray data from C6 glioma cells after inhibition of Jak2/Stat3 signaling. Subsequently, we found 284 genes characterized by p-Stat3 occupancy, activating histone marks and transcriptional changes. Novel genes were screened for their potential involvement in oncogenesis, and the most interesting hits were verified by ChIP-PCR and STAT3 knockdown in human glioma cells.Non-random association between silent genes, histone marks and p-Stat3 binding near transcription start sites was observed, consistent with its repressive role in transcriptional regulation of target genes in glioma cells with specific genetic background.",

Riboswitches were originally discovered as part of the sequence analysis of the 5\u2032-untranslated region of mRNAs in the hope of finding novel gene regulatory sites, and the existence of structural RNAs appeared to be a spurious phenomenon. As more riboswitches were discovered, they illustrated the diversity and adaptability of these RNA regulatory sequences. The fact that a chemically monotonous molecule like RNA can discern a wide range of substrates and exert a variety of regulatory mechanisms was subsequently demonstrated in diverse genomes and has hastened the development of sophisticated algorithms for their analysis and prediction. In this review, we focus on some of the computational tools for riboswitch detection and secondary structure prediction. The study of this simple yet efficient form of gene regulation promises to provide a more complete picture of a world that RNA once dominated and allows rational design of artificial riboswitches.

     "abstract": "The complexity of gene expression control by non-coding RNA has been highlighted by the recent progress in the field of riboswitches. Discovered a decade ago, riboswitches represent a diverse group of non-coding mRNA regions that possess a unique ability to directly sense cellular metabolites and modulate gene expression through formation of alternative metabolite-free and metabolite-bound conformations. Such protein-free metabolite sensing domains utilize sophisticated three-dimensional folding of RNA molecules to discriminate between a cognate ligand from related compounds so that only the right ligand would trigger a genetic response. Given the variety of riboswitch ligands ranging from small cations to large coenzymes, riboswitches adopt a great diversity of structures. Although many riboswitches share structural principles to build metabolite-competent folds, form precise ligand-binding pockets, and communicate a ligand-binding event to downstream regulatory regions, virtually all riboswitch classes possess unique features for ligand recognition, even those tuned to recognize the same metabolites. Here we present an overview of the biochemical and structural research on riboswitches with a major focus on common principles and individual characteristics adopted by these regulatory RNA elements during evolution to specifically target small molecules and exert genetic responses.

     "abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens is an increasing threat to public health. The fundamental mechanisms that control the high levels of expression of antibiotic resistance genes are not yet completely understood. The aminoglycosides are one of the earliest classes of antibiotics that were introduced in the 1940s. In the clinic aminoglycoside resistance is conferred most commonly through enzymatic modification of the drug although resistance through enzymatic modification of the target rRNA through methylation or the overexpression of efflux pumps is also appearing. An aminoglycoside sensing riboswitch has been identified that controls expression of the aminoglycoside resistance genes that encode the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase (ANT) (adenyltransferase (AAD)) enzymes. AAC and ANT cause resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics through modification of the drugs. Expression of the AAC and ANT resistance genes is regulated by aminoglycoside binding to the 5\u2032 leader RNA of the aac/aad genes. The aminoglycoside sensing RNA is also associated with the integron cassette system that captures antibiotic resistance genes. Specific aminoglycoside binding to the leader RNA induces a structural transition in the leader RNA, and consequently induction of resistance protein expression. Reporter gene expression, direct measurements of drug RNA binding, chemical probing and UV cross-linking combined with mutational analysis demonstrated that the leader RNA functioned as an aminoglycoside sensing riboswitch in which drug binding to the leader RNA leads to the induction of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.

     "abstract": "Many prokaryotic genes are organized in operons. Genes organized in such transcription units are co-transcribed into a polycistronic mRNA. Despite being clustered in a single mRNA, individual genes can be subjected to differential regulation, which is mainly achieved at the level of translation depending on initiation and elongation. Efficiency of translation initiation is primarily determined by the structural accessibility of the ribosome binding site (RBS). Structured cis-regulatory elements like RNA thermometers (RNATs) can contribute to differential regulation of individual genes within a polycistronic mRNA. RNATs are riboregulators that mediate temperature-responsive regulation of a downstream gene by modulating the accessibility of its RBS. At low temperature, the RBS is trapped by intra-molecular base pairing prohibiting translation initiation. The secondary structure melts with increasing temperature thus liberating the RBS. Here, we present an overview of different RNAT types and specifically highlight recently discovered RNATs. The main focus of this review is on RNAT-based differential control of polycistronic operons. Finally, we discuss the influence of temperature on other riboregulators and the potential of RNATs in synthetic RNA biology. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Riboswitches.",

     "abstract": "Catalysis in the biological context was largely thought to be a protein-based phenomenon until the discovery of RNA catalysts called ribozymes. These discoveries demonstrated that many RNA molecules exhibit remarkable structural and functional versatility. By virtue of these features, naturally occurring ribozymes have been found to be involved in catalyzing reactions for fundamentally important cellular processes such as translation and RNA processing. Another class of RNAs called riboswitches directly binds ligands to control downstream gene expression. Most riboswitches regulate downstream gene expression by controlling premature transcription termination or by affecting the efficiency of translation initiation. However, one riboswitch class couples ligand-sensing to ribozyme activity. Specifically, the glmS riboswitch is a nucleolytic ribozyme, whose self-cleavage activity is triggered by the binding of GlcN6P. The products of this self-cleavage reaction are then targeted by cellular RNases for rapid degradation, thereby reducing glmS expression under conditions of sufficient GlcN6P. Since the discovery of the glmS ribozyme, other metabolite-binding ribozymes have been identified. Together, these discoveries have expanded the general understanding of noncoding RNAs and provided insights that will assist future development of synthetic riboswitch\u2013ribozymes. A very broad overview of natural and synthetic ribozymes is presented herein with an emphasis on the structure and function of the glmS ribozyme as a paradigm for metabolite-binding ribozymes that control gene expression.

By compiling the work of many laboratories investigating riboswitches using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we uncover general trends and common themes.

It is generally believed that transcription initiation plays a minor role in regulating the transcript level of genes in trypanosomes, which are mainly regulated post-transcriptionally.Recent advances have revealed that epigenetic mechanisms play an essential role in the transcriptional regulation of Trypanosoma brucei. This suggested that the modulation of gene activity, particularly that of pol I transcribed genes, is, indeed, an important control mechanism, and that the epigenome is critical in regulating gene expression programs that allow the successful migration of this parasite between hosts, as well as the continuous evasion of the immune system in mammalian hosts.A wide range of epigenetic signals, readers, writers and erasers have been identified in trypanosomes, some of which have been mapped to essential genetic functions.

The HHAAG are induced during diauxic shift, when the levels of acetyl-CoA and global histone acetylation decrease. The histone hypoacetylation-induced activation of HHAAG is independent of Msn2/Msn4. The repression of HSP12, one of the HHAAG, is associated with well-defined nucleosomal structure in the promoter region, while histone hypoacetylation-induced activation correlates with delocalization of positioned nucleosomes or with reduced nucleosome occupancy.

While many studies have linked the action of these complexes to specific transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes and much is known about their catalytic activity, less is known about the nuclear elements that can enhance or modulate their activity. A number of studies have found that certain High Mobility Group (HMG) proteins are able to stimulate ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity, but their influence on the different biochemical outcomes of this activity is still unknown. In this work we studied the influence of the yeast Nhp6A, Nhp6B and Hmo1 proteins (HMGB family members) on different biochemical outcomes of yeast SWI/SNF remodeling activity. We found that all these HMG proteins stimulate the sliding activity of ySWI/SNF, while transient exposure of nucleosomal DNA and octamer transfer catalyzed by this complex are only stimulated by Hmo1. Consistently, only Hmo1 stimulates SWI/SNF binding to the nucleosome. Additionally, the sliding activity of another chromatin remodeling complex, ISW1a, is only stimulated by Hmo1.

Once considered noise, these non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) appear capable of controlling gene expression by various means. We find that Drosophila sex determination, specifically the master-switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl), is regulated by long ncRNAs (>\u00a0200\u00a0nt). The lncRNAs influence the dose sensitive establishment promoter of Sxl, SxlPe, which must be activated to specify female sex. They are primarily from two regions, R1 and R2, upstream of SxlPe and show a dynamic developmental profile. Of the four lncRNA strands only one, R2 antisense, has its peak coincident with SxlPe transcription, suggesting that it may promote activation. Indeed, its expression is regulated by the X chromosome counting genes, whose dose determines whether SxlPe is transcribed. Transgenic lines which ectopically express each of the lncRNAs show they can act in trans, not only impacting the process of sex determination but also altering the levels of the other lncRNAs. Generally, expression of R1 is negative whereas R2 is positive to females. This ectopic expression also results in a change in the local chromatin marks, affecting the timing and strength of SxlPe transcription. The chromatin marks are those deposited by the Polycomb and trithorax groups of chromatin modifying proteins, which we find bind to the lncRNAs. We suggest that the increasing numbers of non-coding transcripts being identified are a harbinger of interacting networks similar to the one we describe.",

ChIP assays determined that in IL-6-treated cells, c-JUN and p-STAT3 bound to CDX2 promoter in MKN45 cells whereas in NUGC-4 cells, p-STAT3 binds to and c-JUN releases from the CDX2 promoter. Specific inhibition of STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation through AG490 and U0126, respectively, and STAT3 down-regulation using shRNA verified that the SHP-2/ERK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of CDX2 in basal conditions, and the CDX2 up-regulation by IL-6 is through the JAK/STAT pathway in NUGC-4 cells whereas in MKN45 cells both pathways contribute to the CDX2 up-regulation. In conclusion, the signalling pathways activated by IL-6 have a crucial role in the regulation of CDX2 that is a key factor in the process of gastric carcinogenesis, suggesting that the inflammatory infiltrate in the gastric mucosa is relevant in this process and a potential target for new therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved Hox genes are organized in clusters and expressed colinearly to specify body patterning during embryonic development. Previously, Akt1 has been identified as a putative Hox gene regulator through in silico analysis. Substantial upregulation of consecutive 5\u2032 Hoxc genes has been observed when Akt1 is absent in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. In this study, we provide evidence that Akt1 regulates the 5\u2032 Hoxc gene expression by epigenetic modifications. Enrichment of histone H3K9 acetylation and a low level of the H3K27me3 mark were detected at the posterior 5\u2032 Hoxc loci when Akt1 is absent. A histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor de-repressed 5\u2032 Hoxc gene expression when Akt1 is present, and a DNA demethylating reagent synergistically upregulated HDAC-induced 5\u2032 Hoxc gene expression. A knockdown study revealed that Hdac6 is mediated in the Hoxc12 repression through direct binding to the transcription start site (TSS) in the presence of Akt1. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that endogenous Akt1 directly interacted with Hdac6. Furthermore, exogenous Akt1 was enriched at the promoter region of the posterior Hoxc genes such as Hoxc11 and Hoxc12, not the Akt1-independent Hoxc5 and Hoxd10 loci. The regulation of the H3K27me3 mark by Ezh2 and Kdm6b at the 5\u2032 Hoxc gene promoter turned out to be Akt1 dependent. Taken together, these results suggest that Akt1 mediates the posterior 5\u2032 Hoxc gene expression through epigenetic modification such as histone methylation and acetylation, and partly through a direct binding to the promoter region of the 5\u2032 Hoxc genes and/or Hdac6 in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.",

Myb complex functions to activate or repress transcription in a site-specific manner; however, the detailed mechanism is yet to be clearly understood. Members of the Drosophila melanogaster Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex have been known to regulate expression of a wide range of genes including those involved in regulating apoptosis. E2F and its corepressor RBF also belong to this complex and together they regulate expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. In the present study, we examined whether the depletion of dlin52 in developing photoreceptor neurons results in enhanced apoptosis and disorganisation of the ommatidia. Strikingly, we found that dLin52 is essential for transcriptional repression of the pro-apoptotic gene, hid; decrease in dlin52 levels led to dramatic induction of hid and apoptosis in eye-antennal discs. Reduction of Rpd3 (HDAC1), another member of the dREAM complex, also led to marginal upregulation of Hid. In addition, we also demonstrated that an optimum level of dLin52 is needed for dE2F1/2 activity on the hid promoter. dlin52 cooperates with dRBF and dE2F1/2 for recruitment of repressor complex on the hid promoter. Preliminary data indicate that Rpd3/HDAC1 also contributes to hid repression. Based on the findings, we conclude that dLin52 functions as a co-factor and modulates activity of members of dMyb/dREAM complex at hid promoter, thus regulating apoptosis by repressing this pro-apoptotic gene in the developing Drosophila eye.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant upregulation of NOTCH3 gene plays a critical role in cancer pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. We tested here the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic modifications in the NOTCH3 promoter region might account for its upregulation in cancer cells. We compared DNA and histone methylation status of NOTCH3 promoter region in human normal blood cells and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, differentially expressing NOTCH3. We found that histone methylation, rather than DNA hypomethylation, contributes towards establishing an active chromatin status of NOTCH3 promoter in NOTCH3 overexpressing cancer cells. We discovered that the chromatin regulator protein BORIS/CTCFL plays an important role in regulating NOTCH3 gene expression. We observed that BORIS is present in T-ALL cell lines as well as in cell lines derived from several solid tumors overexpressing NOTCH3. Moreover, BORIS targets NOTCH3 promoter in cancer cells and it is able to induce and to maintain a permissive/active chromatin conformation. Importantly, the association between NOTCH3 overexpression and BORIS presence was confirmed in primary T-ALL samples from patients at the onset of the disease. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the determinants of NOTCH3 overexpression in cancer cells, by revealing a key role for BORIS as the main mediator of transcriptional deregulation of NOTCH3.",

     "abstract": "Ischemic cerebral stroke is one of the leading global causes of mortality and morbidity. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) refers to a sublethal ischemia and resulting in tolerance to subsequent severe ischemic injury. Although several pathways are reportedly involved in IPC-mediated neuroprotection, the functional role of astrocytes is not fully understood. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a CXC chemokine produced mainly in astrocytes, is a ligand for chemokine receptor CXCR4. SDF-1 is reported to play a critical role in neuroprotection after stroke by mediating the migration of neuronal progenitor cells. We hypothesized that stimuli derived from ischemic brain were involved in the protective effects of IPC. To investigate this hypothesis, the mechanism in which ischemic brain extract (IBE) induced SDF-1 expression was investigated in C6 astrocytoma cells. IBE treatment of C6 cells increased SDF-1 expression compared to that in untreated or normal brain extract (NBE)-treated cells by downregulating SDF-1 targeting miRNA, miR-27b. MiR-223 was inversely upregulated in IBE-treated cells; overexpression of miR-223 decreased the expression of miR-27b by suppressing IKK\u03b1 expression. Analysis of cytokine array data revealed an IBE associated enhanced expression of CINC-1 (CXCL1) and LIX1 (CXCL5). Knockdown or inhibition of their receptor, CXCR2, abolished IBE-mediated increased expression of SDF-1. These results were confirmed in primary cultured astrocytes. Taken together, the data demonstrate that IBE-elicited signals increase SDF-1 expression through the CXCR2/miR-223/miR-27b pathway in C6 astrocytoma cells and primary astrocytes, supporting the view that increased expression of SDF-1 by ischemic insults is a possible mechanism underlying therapeutic application of IPC.",

The long, noncoding RNA HOTAIR has been strongly associated with the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. In this study, we found that recombinant human OPN could induce HOTAIR expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and our data also showed that OPN transcriptionally activated the expression of HOTAIR in cancer cells. Furthermore, through chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase activity assays, we found that IRF1 could bind to the HOTAIR promoter region and decrease its transcriptional activity, and cellular overexpression of IRF1 downregulated the level of HOTAIR. The receptor CD44 has also been verified as a regulator of OPN-induced HOTAIR expression. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that OPN could regulate PI3K/AKT and IRF1 expression and signaling, thereby influencing the expression of HOTAIR. In hepatocellular carcinoma samples, levels of HOTAIR correlated with the expression of OPN and IRF1. We therefore conclude that OPN, as an extracellular matrix protein, can stimulate the expression of HOTAIR by attenuating the inhibitory effect of IRF1, and this results in promotion of the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.",

Protein expression was detected with immunoblotting. The binding capacity between p53 and chromatin DNA was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The role of miR-23a in mediating suppression of HCC by berberine was determined both in vitro and in vivo.miR-23a was up-regulated upon berberine treatment in human HCC cells, and berberine could increase the expression of primary precursor, precursor and mature forms of miR-23a. The up-regulation of miR-23a by berberine is p53-dependent. Inhibition of p53 expression and activity could block the up-regulation of miR-23a induced by berberine. Furthermore, berberine-induced miR-23a expression may mediate the transcription activation of p53-related tumor suppressive genes p21 and GADD45\u03b1. Inhibition of miR-23a abolishes the binding of p53 onto chromatin and attenuates transcription activation of p21 and GADD45\u03b1.

To date, little is known about the underlying cellular function and regulatory networks of EZH2 in PCa. This study aims to determine whether or not the autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 serves key functions in PCa development. Bioinformatics and integrative analytical approaches were employed to identify the relationships of EZH2 to specific cancer-related gene sets. Results indicated that the enrichment of gene sets about cell cycle progression was associated with EZH2 expression. The depletion of EZH2 in cell experiments inhibited PCa cell growth and blocked cell cycle accompanying the downregulation of E2F3 expression. Furthermore, miR-200c served as an important mediator between EZH2 and E2F3. Compared with scrambled control cells, sh-EZH2 cells showed lower H3K27me3 expression and higher miR-200c expression. Western blot and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-200c inversely modulated E2F3 by directly targeting the binding site within 3\u2032UTR. Moreover, decreased miR-200c expression largely abrogated the effect of sh-EZH2 on E2F3 expression and E2F3-induced cell cycle progression. EZH2 was positively regulated by E2F3 at the transcriptional level. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed a significant correlation among EZH2, miR-200c, and E2F3 expression in human PCa tissues. In conclusion, the autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 served an important function in PCa development.

Furthermore, the effect of dexamethasone on these genes, regarding both mRNA levels and the abundance of H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac in their promoters, can be inhibited by the presence of nicotinamide, a metabolic molecule which has been shown to possess anxiolytic properties.",

Loss of nectin-2 causes male infertility, suggesting nectin-2-based ES is crucial for spermatogenesis. Cadmium (Cd) has been known to induce severe testicular injury. Recent evidence has shown that the basal ES at the BTB and apical ES are the targets of Cd, suggesting that unique junction protein at the ES may explain why testis is more susceptible than other tissues. Since nectin-2 is expressed exclusively at the ES, it is highly possible that nectin-2 is the direct target of Cd. In this study, we investigate if nectin-2 is the target protein of Cd toxicity and the mechanism on how Cd down-regulates nectin-2 to achieve ES disruption. Our results revealed that Cd suppresses nectin-2 at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Inhibitor and shRNA knockdown have shown that Cd induces nectin-2 protein degradation via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Immunofluorescence staining and endocytosis assays further confirmed that nectin-2 internalization is promoted upon Cd treatment. Besides, Cd directly represses nectin-2 transcription. EMSA and ChIP assays showed that Cd inhibits the binding of positive regulators to nectin-2 promoter. siRNA and overexpression analyses have demonstrated that Cd reduces the expression and binding affinity of positive regulators for transcription. Taken together, nectin-2 is the direct molecular target of Cd and its disruptive effects are mediated via direct repressing nectin-2 transcription and endocytosis of nectin-2 for degradation.",

It both organises nuclear DNA and protects it from adventitious binding of transcription factors and the consequent deregulation of gene expression. Both properties are essential to allow the genome expansion characteristic of complex eukaryotes.The nucleosome is a flexible structure in vivo, allowing selective relaxation of its intrinsically inhibitory effects in response to external signals. Structural changes are brought about by dedicated remodelling enzymes and by posttranslational modifications of the core histones.Histone modifications occasionally alter nucleosome structure directly, but their more usual roles are to act as receptors on the nucleosome surface that are recognised by specific protein domains. The bound proteins, in turn, affect nucleosome structure and function. This strategy enormously expands the signalling capacity of the nucleosome and its ability to influence both the initiation and elongation stages of transcription.The enzymes responsible for placing and removing histone modifications, and the modification-binding proteins themselves, are ubiquitous, numerous and conserved amongst eukaryotes. Like the nucleosome, they date back to the earliest eukaryotes and may have played integral and essential roles in eukaryotic evolution.

     "abstract": "Chromatin is the macromolecular nucleoprotein complex that governs the organization of genetic material in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. In chromatin, DNA is packed with histone proteins into nucleosomes. Core histones are prototypes of hyper-modified proteins, being decorated by a large number of site-specific reversible and irreversible post-translational modifications (PTMs), which contribute to the maintenance and modulation of chromatin plasticity, gene activation, and a variety of other biological processes and disease states. The observations of the variety, frequency and co-occurrence of histone modifications in distinct patterns at specific genomic loci have led to the idea that hPTMs can create a molecular barcode, read by effector proteins that translate it into a specific transcriptional state, or process, on the underlying DNA. However, despite the fact that this histone-code hypothesis was proposed more than 10\u00a0years ago, the molecular details of its working mechanisms are only partially characterized. In particular, two questions deserve specific investigation: how the different modifications associate and synergize into patterns and how these PTM configurations are read and translated by multi-protein complexes into a specific functional outcome on the genome. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a versatile tool to investigate chromatin biology, useful for both identifying and validating hPTMs, and to dissect the molecular determinants of histone modification readout systems. We review here the MS techniques and the proteomics methods that have been developed to address these fundamental questions in epigenetics research, emphasizing approaches based on the proteomic dissection of distinct native chromatin regions, with a critical evaluation of their present challenges and future potential.

Together, these studies have provided crucial insight into how chromatin pathways influence key cellular programs.

The bromodomain, the conserved structural module present in transcription-associated proteins, functions exclusively to recognize acetyl-lysine on histones and non-histone proteins. The structural analyses of bromodomains' recognition of lysine-acetylated peptides derived from histones and cellular proteins provide detailed insights into the differences and unifying features of biological ligand binding selectivity by the bromodomains. Newly developed small-molecule inhibitors targeting bromodomain proteins further highlight the functional importance of bromodomain/acetyl-lysine binding as a key mechanism in orchestrating molecular interactions and regulation in chromatin biology and gene transcription. These new studies argue that modulating bromodomain/acetyl-lysine interactions with small-molecule chemicals offer new opportunities to control gene expression in a wide array of human diseases including cancer and inflammation.

Over the past decade a number of methyllysine-specific readers have been discovered and their interactions with histone tails have been structurally and biochemically characterized. More recently innovative experimental approaches have emerged that allow for studying reader interactions in the context of the full nucleosome and nucleosomal arrays.In this review we give a brief overview of the known mechanisms of histone lysine methylation readout, summarize progress recently made in exploring interactions with methylated nucleosomes, and discuss the latest advances in the development of small molecule inhibitors of the methyllysine-specific readers.New studies reveal various reader-nucleosome contacts outside the methylated histone tail, thus offering a better model for association of histone readers to chromatin and broadening our understanding of the functional implications of these interactions. In addition, some progress has been made in the design of antagonists of these interactions.Specific lysine methylation patterns are commonly associated with certain chromatin states and genomic elements, and are linked to distinct biological outcomes such as transcription activation or repression. Disruption of patterns of histone modifications is associated with a number of diseases, and there is tremendous therapeutic potential in targeting histone modification pathways. Thus, investigating binding of readers of these modifications is not only important for elucidating fundamental mechanisms of chromatin regulation, but also necessary for the design of targeted therapeutics.

The posttranslational modification of the core histones and the action of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes represent two primary mechanisms by which chromatin dynamics are controlled and linked to nuclear events. Although there are examples in which a histone modification or a remodeling enzyme may be sufficient to drive a chromatin transition, these mechanisms typically work in concert to integrate regulatory inputs, leading to a coordinated alteration in chromatin structure and function. Indeed, site-specific histone modifications can facilitate the recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes to particular genomic regions, or they can regulate the efficiency or the outcome of a chromatin remodeling reaction. Conversely, chromatin remodeling enzymes can also influence, and sometimes directly modulate, the modification state of histones. These functional interactions are generally complex, frequently transient, and often require the association of myriad additional factors.

The inclusion levels of four depolarization-regulated alternative exons were measured by RT-PCR in GH3 pituitary cells under different conditions of stimulation and/or RNA interference of splicing factors. The usage of the exons was reduced by membrane depolarization to various extents and was differentially modulated by the knock-down of splicing factors hnRNP L, L-like, I (PTBP1) or K or their combinations. A spectrum of each exon's level was produced under six knock-down conditions and was significantly shifted by depolarization. When all these conditions were considered together, a more refined or expanded spectrum of exon usage was obtained for each of the four exons. As a proof of principle for the molecular basis of the fine-tuning of exon usage, we show in the cases of hnRNP L and LL that their differential effects through the same element or different combinations of RNA sequences by the same factor hnRNP L are critical. The results thus demonstrate that the combined effect of varying extracellular stimuli and intracellular factors/RNA sequences refines or expands the spectra of endogenous exon usage, likely contributing to the fine-tuning of cellular properties.",

Robust control of Pax3 neural expression is ensured by two redundant sets of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that integrate anterior\u2013posterior (such as Wnt\u2013\u03b2Catenin signaling) as well as dorsal\u2013ventral (such as Shh\u2013Gli signaling) instructive cues. In previous work, we sought to characterize the Wnt-mediated regulation of Pax3 expression and identified the Cdx transcription factors (Cdx1/2/4) as critical intermediates in this process. We identified the neural crest enhancer-2 (NCE2) from the 5\u2032-flanking region of Pax3 as a Cdx-dependent CRM that recapitulates the restricted expression of Pax3 in the mouse caudal neuroectoderm. While this is consistent with a key role in relaying the inductive signal from posteriorizing Wnt ligands, the broad expression of Cdx proteins in the tailbud region is not consistent with the restricted activity of NCE2. This implies that other positive and/or negative inputs are required and, here, we report a novel role for the transcription factor Zic2 in this regulation. Our data strongly suggests that Zic2 is involved in the induction (as a direct Pax3NCE2 activator and Cdx neural cofactor) as well as the maintenance of Pax3 dorsal restriction (as a target of the ventral Shh repressive input). We also provide evidence that the inductive Cdx\u2013Zic2 interaction is integrated on NCE2 with a positive input from the neural-specific transcription factor Sox2. Altogether, our data provide important mechanistic insights into the coordinated integration of different signaling pathways on a short Pax3 CRM.",

Teleost fish possess two MEF2C paralogues, mef2ca and mef2cb. In zebrafish, the Mef2cs function to promote cardiomyogenic differentiation and myofibrillogenesis in nascent skeletal myofibers. We found that zebrafish mef2ca and mef2cb are alternatively spliced in the coding exons 4\u20136 region and these splice variants differ in their biological activity. Of the two, mef2ca is more abundantly expressed in developing skeletal muscle, its activity is tuned through zebrafish development by AS. By 24\u00a0hpf, we found the prevalent expression of the highly active full length protein in differentiated muscle in the somites. The splicing isoform of mef2ca that lacks exon 5 (mef2ca 4\u20136), encodes a protein that has 50% lower transcriptional activity, and is found mainly earlier in development, before muscle differentiation. mef2ca transcripts including exon 5 (mef2ca 4\u20135\u20136) are present early in the embryo. Over-expression of this isoform alters the expression of genes involved in early dorso-ventral patterning of the embryo such as chordin, nodal related 1 and goosecoid, and induces severe developmental defects. AS of mef2cb generates a long splicing isoform in the exon 5 region (Mef2cbL) that predominates during somitogenesis. Mef2cbL contains an evolutionarily conserved domain derived from exonization of a fragment of intron 5, which confers the ability to induce ectopic muscle in mesoderm upon over-expression of the protein.

However, the molecular mechanism of this phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Using microcapillary liquid chromatography MS/MS and biochemical assays, we identified a novel phosphorylation site in HNF1\u03b1 at Ser249. We also found that the ATM protein kinase phosphorylated HNF1\u03b1 at Ser249 in vitro in an ATM-dependent manner and that ATM inhibitor KU55933 treatment inhibited phosphorylation of HNF1\u03b1 at Ser249 in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the association between HNF1\u03b1 and ATM. Moreover, ATM enhanced HNF1\u03b1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the ATM kinase-inactive mutant did not. The use of KU55933 confirmed our observation. Compared with wild-type HNF1\u03b1, a mutation in Ser249 resulted in a pronounced decrease in HNF1\u03b1 transactivation, whereas no dominant-negative effect was observed. The HNF1\u03b1Ser249 mutant also exhibited normal nuclear localization but decreased DNA-binding activity. Accordingly, the functional studies of HNF1\u03b1Ser249 mutant revealed a defect in glucose metabolism.

     "abstract": "Despite recent treatment advances, an increase in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality is expected for the next years. Mediator (MED) complex plays key roles in eukaryotic gene transcription. Currently, while numerous studies have correlated MED alterations with several diseases, like cancer or neurological disorders, fewer studies have investigated MED role in CVD initiation and progression. The first finding of MED involvement in these pathologies was the correlation of missense mutations in MED13L gene with transposition of the great arteries. Nowadays, also MED13 and MED15 have been associated with human congenital heart diseases and others could be added, like MED12 that is involved in early mouse development and heart formation. Interestingly, a missense mutation in MED30 gene causes a progressive cardiomyopathy in homozygous mice suggesting a potential role for this subunit also in human CVDs. Moreover, several subunits like MED1, MED13, MED14, MED15, MED23, MED25 and CDK8 exert important roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. Although these evidences derive from in vitro and animal model studies, they indicate that their deregulation may have a significant role in human CVD-related metabolic disorders. Finally, alternative transcripts of MED12, MED19 and MED30 are differently expressed in circulating endothelial progenitor cells thus suggesting they can play a role in the field of regenerative medicine. Overall, further functional studies exploring MED role in human CVD are warranted. The results could allow identifying novel biomarkers to use in combination with imaging techniques for early diagnosis; otherwise, they could be useful to develop targets for novel therapeutic approaches.",

The unique structural properties of the cap, which consists of 7-methylguanosine attached to the first transcribed nucleoside by a triphosphate chain (m7GpppN), guarantee its resistance to non-specific exonucleases. DcpS enzymes are dimers belonging to the Histidine Triad (HIT) superfamily of pyrophosphatases. The specific hydrolysis of m7GpppN by DcpS yields m7GMP and NDP. By precluding inhibition of other cap-binding proteins by short m7GpppN-containing mRNA fragments, DcpS plays an important role in the cap-dependent mRNA metabolism. Over the past decade, lots of new structural, biochemical and biophysical data on DcpS has accumulated. We attempt to integrate these results, referring to DcpS enzymes from different species. Such a synergistic characteristic of the DcpS structure and activity might be useful for better understanding of the DcpS catalytic mechanism, its regulatory role in gene expression, as well as for designing DcpS inhibitors of potential therapeutic application, e.g. in spinal muscular atrophy.",

Despite the contributions of this protein to several biological processes, the regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of the AGR2 gene in different organs remain unclear. Zebrafish anterior gradient 2 (agr2) is expressed in several organs, including the otic vesicles that contain mucus-secreting cells. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms controlling agr2 expression in otic vesicles, we generated a Tg(\u2212\u00a06.0\u00a0k agr2:EGFP) transgenic fish line that expressed EGFP in a pattern recapitulating that of agr2. Double immunofluorescence studies were used to demonstrate that Agr2 and GFP colocalize in the semicircular canals and supporting cells of all sensory patches in the otic vesicles of Tg(\u2212\u00a06.0\u00a0k agr2:EGFP) embryos. Transient/stable transgenic analyses coupled with 5\u2032-end deletion revealed that a 100\u00a0bp sequence within the \u2212\u00a02.6 to \u2212\u00a02.5\u00a0kbp region upstream of agr2 directs EGFP expression specifically in the otic vesicles. Two HMG-binding motifs were detected in this region. Mutation of these motifs prevented EGFP expression. Furthermore, EGFP expression in the otic vesicles was prevented by knockdown of the sox10 gene. This corresponded with decreased agr2 expression in the otic vesicles of sox10 morphants during different developmental stages. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to show that Sox10 binds to HMG-binding motifs located within the \u2212\u00a02.6 to \u2212\u00a02.5\u00a0kbp region upstream of agr2. These results demonstrate that agr2 expression in the otic vesicles of zebrafish embryos is regulated by Sox10.",

     "abstract": "The prostanoid thromboxane (TX) A2 plays a central role in hemostasis and is increasingly implicated in neoplastic disease, including prostate and breast cancers. In humans, TXA2 signals through the TP\u03b1 and TP\u03b2 isoforms of the T prostanoid receptor, two structurally related receptors transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters, Prm1 and Prm3, respectively, within the TP gene. Focusing on TP\u03b1, the current study investigated its expression and transcriptional regulation through Prm1 in prostate and breast cancers.Expression of TP\u03b1 correlated with increasing prostate and breast tissue tumor grade while the TXA2 mimetic U46619 promoted both proliferation and migration of the respective prostate (PC3) and breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231) derived-carcinoma cell lines. Through 5\u2032 deletional and genetic reporter analyses, several functional upstream repressor regions (URRs) were identified within Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells while site-directed mutagenesis identified the tumor suppressors Wilms' tumor (WT)1 and hypermethylated in cancer (HIC) 1 as the trans-acting factors regulating those repressor regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies confirmed that WT1 binds in vivo to multiple GC-enriched WT1 cis-elements within the URRs of Prm1 in PC3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, ChIP analyses established that HIC1 binds in vivo to the HIC1(b)cis-element within Prm1 in PC3 and MCF-7 cells but not in the MDA-MB-231 carcinoma line. Collectively, these data establish that WT1 and HIC1, both tumor suppressors implicated in prostate and breast cancers, transcriptionally repress TP\u03b1 expression and thereby provide a strong genetic basis for understanding the role of TXA2 in the progression of certain human cancers.",

Previously, we discovered that human mEH gene transcription is initiated from alternative promoters. The respective transcripts are programmed with tissue specificity and the upstream E1b promoter contributes predominantly to mEH expression. The results presented demonstrate that exposures to the Nrf2 activators, sulforaphane (SFN) and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), markedly activate E1b transcription in human lung and liver cells. Genomic analyses identified two major DNase I hypersensitive regions (HS-1 and HS-2) within the ~\u00a015\u00a0kb intervening sequence separating E1b from the downstream E1 promoter. In BEAS-2B cells, the Nrf2 effectors, SFN and tBHQ, selectively activated the more distal HS-2 through an antioxidant response element (ARE). An activator protein 1/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate interaction was further identified within the HS-2 enhancer that functioned to additionally contribute to ARE-mediated induction responsiveness of the E1b promoter. The results demonstrate that ARE modulation, integrated with additional transcriptional complexes, regulates the tissue-specific expression of mEH and that these processes likely coordinate both the protective and bioactivation functions contributed by mEH activities in human tissues.",

CDK5 and p35 have a fundamental role in neuronal migration and differentiation during CNS development. Both the CDK5R1 3\u2032-UTR's remarkable size and its conservation during evolution strongly indicate an important role in post-transcriptional regulation. We previously validated different regulatory elements in the 3\u2032-UTR of CDK5R1, which affect transcript stability, p35 levels and cellular migration through the binding with nELAV proteins and miR-103/7 miRNAs. Interestingly, a 138\u00a0bp-long region, named C2.1, was identified as the most mRNA destabilizing portion within CDK5R1 3\u2032-UTR. This feature was maintained by a shorter region of 73\u00a0bp, characterized by two poly-U stretches. UV-CL experiments showed that this region interacts with protein factors. UV-CLIP assays and pull-down experiments followed by mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that nELAV and hnRNPA2/B1 proteins bind to the same U-rich element. These RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were shown to oppositely control CDK5R1 mRNA stability and p35 protein content at post-trascriptional level. While nELAV proteins have a positive regulatory effect, hnRNPA2/B1 has a negative action that is responsible for the mRNA destabilizing activity both of the C2.1 region and of the full-length 3\u2032-UTR. In co-expression experiments of hnRNPA2/B1 and nELAV RBPs we observed an overall decrease of p35 content. We also demonstrated that hnRNPA2/B1 can downregulate nELAV protein content but not vice versa. This study, by providing new insights on the combined action of different regulatory factors, contributes to clarify the complex post-transcriptional control of CDK5R1 gene expression.",

SMN has also been suggested to direct axonal transport of \u03b2-actin mRNA in neurons. Humans contain a second SMN gene called SMN2 thus SMA patients produce some SMN but not with sufficient levels. The majority of SMN2 mRNA does not include exon 7. Here we show that increased expression of PSF promotes inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 whereas reduced expression of PSF promotes exon 7 skipping. In addition, we present evidence showing that PSF interacts with the GAAGGA enhancer in exon 7. We also demonstrate that a mutation in this enhancer abolishes the effects of PSF on exon 7 splicing. Furthermore we show that the RNA target sequences of PSF and tra2\u03b2 in exon 7 are partially overlapped.

In the present study we show that the winged helix/forkhead box containing transcription factor A2 (FOXA2) shown previously to play a role in glucose and bile acid homeostasis in the liver and in energy utilization in adipose tissue is a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells. We show that the ABCA1 promoter contains three FOXA2 binding elements in the proximal region. Two of the sites are localized in a region of the ABCA1 promoter enriched in binding elements for transcriptional repressor proteins whereas the third site is the core of the TATA element of the ABCA1 promoter. Inhibition of FOXA2 binding to the ABCA1 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis or FOXA2 gene expression by siRNA was associated with increased ABCA1 promoter activity and protein levels. Overexpression of FOXA2 inhibited both the constitutive ABCA1 gene expression as well as ABCA1 gene induction by oxysterols and retinoids via nuclear receptors LXR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1. In summary, the present study identifies transcription factor FOXA2 as a negative modulator of ABCA1 gene expression in hepatic cells and reveals a novel mechanism of transcriptional repression by FOXA2 which involves the TATA element of the ABCA1 gene.",

     "abstract": "Despite the fact that telomeres carry chromatin marks typically associated with silent heterochromatin, they are actively transcribed into TElomeric Repeat containing RNA (TERRA). TERRA transcription is conserved from yeast to man, initiates in the subtelomeric region and proceeds through the telomeric tract of presumably each individual telomere. TERRA levels are increased in yeast survivors and in cancer cells employing ALT as a telomere maintenance mechanism (TMM). Thus, TERRA may be a promising biomarker and potential target in anti-cancer therapy. Interestingly, several recent publications implicate TERRA in regulatory processes including telomere end protection and the establishment of the heterochromatic state at telomeres. A picture is emerging whereby TERRA acts as a regulator of telomere length and hence the associated onset of replicative senescence in a cell. In this review we will summarize the latest results regarding TERRA transcription, localization and related function. A special focus will be set on the potential role of TERRA in the regulation of telomere length and replicative senescence. Possible implications of increased TERRA levels in yeast survivors and in ALT cancer cells will be discussed.",

To identify factors involved in hsp70 expression, we developed a screen that capitalizes on a visual assessment of heat shock activation using a hsp70-beta galactosidase reporter and publicly available RNAi fly lines to deplete candidate proteins. We validated the screen by showing that the depletion of HSF, CycT, Cdk9, Nurf 301, or ELL prevented the full induction of hsp70 by heat shock. Our screen also identified the histone deacetylase HDAC3 and its associated protein SMRTER as positive regulators of hsp70 activation.

NSC126188 increased expression of p300 and c-Jun. Conversely, knockdown of p300 decreased RhoB expression in the presence of NSC126188. We found that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was associated with the p300 binding site and that PARP-1 knockdown inhibited NSC126188-mediated RhoB expression. In the cells treated with NSC126188, p300, PARP-1, and c-Jun interacted and bound the p300 binding site. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed strong p300 binding and weak c-Jun binding at the p300 binding site of RhoB promoter in cells treated with NSC126188. We also demonstrated that c-Jun played a crucial role in p300 binding. However, PARP-1 did not directly bind the p300 binding site, suggesting a bridging role between p300 and c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated a complex comprising p300/c-Jun/PARP-1 that bound wild type, but not a mutated, p300 binding site. In addition, overexpression of p300, PARP-1, or c-Jun dramatically enhanced RhoB promoter activity when it contained the wild type sequence but not mutated sequences, indicating the crucial role of the p300 binding site in NSC126188-induced transcription of RhoB.

     "abstract": "let-7 microRNA (miRNA) is implicated in various biological processes, and its downregulation essentially linked to human malignancy. Regulation of gene expression of the let-7 family is critically linked to RNA-binding proteins. For instance, Lin28B and its paralog, Lin28A, inhibit the pre-let-7 precursor from being processed to mature miRNA by recruiting terminal uridyltransferase, TUT4, which adds oligomeric U at the 3\u2032 end, suggesting that deregulation of Lin28B, together with Lin28A, may alter various biological processes through modulation of let-7 expression. Here, we showed that the Lin28B protein level is regulated via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and identified the ubiquitin ligase as human TRIM-NHL domain-containing TRIM71. In cells, TRIM71 negatively regulates Lin28B protein stability by catalyzing polyubiquitination. Compared with its paralog, Lin28A, a C-terminal unique ~\u00a050 amino acid stretch of Lin28B is essential for TRIM71 interactions and subsequent polyubiquitination. Moreover, the N-terminal RING finger motif of TRIM71 is critical for protein\u2013protein interactions and polyubiquitination of Lin28B, and consequent let-7 expression. Consistent with the let-7 stimulatory role of TRIM71 via Lin28B polyubiquitination, specific knockdown of TRIM71 led to downregulation of let-7 expression. Expression of one of the known let-7 targets, HMGA2, was derepressed after knockdown of TRIM71.

     "abstract": "MYC is an oncogenic DNA-binding transcription activator of many genes and is often upregulated in human cancers. MYC has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that is also required for cell transformation. Various MYC TAD-interacting coactivators have been identified, including the transcription/transformation-associated protein (TRRAP), a subunit of different histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes such as the human \u201cSPT3\u2013TAF9\u2013GCN5 Acetyltransferase\u201d (STAGA) complex involved in MYC transactivation of the TERT gene. However, it remains unclear whether TRRAP and/or other subunits are directly contacted by MYC within these macromolecular complexes. Here, we characterize the interactions of MYC TAD with the STAGA complex. By protein crosslinking we identify both TRRAP and the GCN5 acetyltransferase as MYC TAD-interacting subunits within native STAGA. We show that purified GCN5 binds to an N-terminal sub-domain of MYC TAD (residues 21\u2013108) and that the interaction of GCN5 and STAGA with this sub-domain is dependent on two related sequence motifs: M2 within the conserved MYC homology box I (MBI), and M3 located between residues 100\u2013106. Interestingly, specific substitutions within the M2/3 motifs that only moderately reduce the intracellular MYC\u2013STAGA interaction and do not influence dimerization of MYC with its DNA-binding partner MAX, strongly inhibit MYC acetylation by GCN5 and reduce MYC binding and transactivation of the GCN5-dependent TERT promoter in vivo. Hence, we propose that MYC associates with STAGA through extended interactions of the TAD with both TRRAP and GCN5 and that the TAD\u2013GCN5 interaction is important for MYC acetylation and MYC binding to certain chromatin loci.",

In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of embryonic Lrh-1 using ES and embryonal carcinoma F9 cells. Reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Sox2 and Gabp proteins bind to the promoter region of embryonic Lrh-1, and are necessary for its activation. The Sox2 site showed strong promoter activity and affinity for protein binding. Upon differentiation into the parietal endoderm by retinoic acid and cAMP, Lrh-1 promoter activity and transcripts were markedly reduced within 24\u00a0h. At the same time, Sox2 and Gabp binding to the promoter region of Lrh-1 were decreased, followed by a reduction of their expression.

To clarify the transcriptional changes and regulatory networks that involve transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes during the priming phase, an advanced mouse oligonucleotide array-based transcription factor assay (MOUSE OATFA), mRNA microarray analysis, bioinformatic analysis and ChIP-on-chip experiments were used. A total of 774 genes were upregulated or downregulated in PH liver samples compared with the sham operation (SH) group. Seventeen TFs showed significant changes in activity in the regenerating livers, some of which have not been extensively studied in previous reports, including upstream stimulatory transcription factor 1 (USF1). The TF signatures from MOUSE OATFA were combined with mRNA expression profiles and ChIP-on-chip analyses to construct experimental transcriptional regulatory networks in regenerating livers. USF1-centered regulatory networks were further confirmed by ChIP assays, revealing some of its target genes and novel coregulatory networks.

Ess1 is conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. In budding yeast, Ess1 is essential for growth and is required for efficient transcription initiation and termination, RNA processing, and suppression of cryptic transcription. In mammals, Ess1 (called Pin1) functions in a variety of pathways, including transcription, but it is not essential. Recent work has shown that Ess1 coordinates the binding and release of CTD-binding proteins that function as co-factors in the RNA pol II complex. In this way, Ess1 plays an integral role in writing (and reading) the so-called CTD code to promote production of mature RNA pol II transcripts including non-coding RNAs and mRNAs.",

The cellular localization of this protein is regulated by a short C-terminus motif (M9) and other less defined sequences. The RNA binding specificity of this protein is dependent on multiple RNA binding domains (RBDs), which regulate its role in RNA processing and expression. hnRNP A1 plays multiple roles in gene expression by regulating the biogenesis and translation of messengers RNAs, the processing of miRNAs, affecting transcription and controlling telomere maintenance. The multiple functions of this protein correlate with diverse roles in genetic disease, cancer and the replication of viral pathogens. Utilizing a tagged hnRNP A1 deletion library we have shown that the three hnRNP A1 RBDs contribute to the prevalent nuclear distribution of the protein. Our data also indicate that a truncated form of the protein, lacking one of the RBDs, the RGG-box, can regulate splicing of a splicing reporter minigene and down-regulate replication of the HIV-1 virus with efficiency comparable to the wild-type protein.

K562/DNR overexpressed major enzymes of NHEJ, DNA-PKcs and DNA ligase IV, and K562/DNR repaired DSB more rapidly than K562 after DNA damage by neocarzinostatin (MDR1-independent radiation-mimetic).

Because this region is GC-rich, we tried to suppress Sp1 family transcription factor using mithramycin A (MMA), a specific Sp1 family inhibitor, and siRNAs for Sp1 and Sp3. Both MMA and siRNAs suppressed DNA-PKcs expression. Higher serine-phosphorylated Sp1 but not total Sp1 of both K562/DNR and HL60/DNR was observed compared with their parental K562 and HL60 cells.

Through both overexpression and knockdown approaches, we found that in addition to its effects on the E2F pathway, the cell proliferation specific transcription factor FOXM1 stimulated CDC6 transcription in cooperation with AR. We have identified a forkhead box motif in the CDC6 proximal promoter that is occupied by FOXM1 and is sufficient to drive FOXM1-regulated transcription. Indirectly, FOXM1 elevated AR protein levels and AR dependent transcription. Furthermore, FOXM1 and AR proteins physically interact. Using synchronized cultures, we observed that CDC6 expression is elevated near S phase of the cell cycle, at a time coinciding with elevated FOXM1 and AR expression and CDC6 promoter occupancy by both AR and FOXM1 proteins. Androgen increased the binding of AR protein to CDC6 promoter, and AR and FOXM1 knockdown decreased AR binding. These results provided new evidence for the regulatory mechanism of aberrant CDC6 oncogene transcription by FOXM1 and AR, two highly expressed transcription factors in PCa cells. Functionally, the cooperation of FOXM1 and AR accelerated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation by affecting CDC6 gene expression. Furthermore, siomycin A, a proteasome inhibitor known to inhibit FOXM1 expression and activity, inhibited PCa cell proliferation and its effect was additive to that of bicalutamide, an antiandrogen commonly used to treat PCa patients.",

Genetic cause of SMA is the deletion or mutation of SMN1 gene, which encodes the SMN protein. Although SMA patients include SMN2 gene, a duplicate of SMN1 gene, predominant production of exon 7 skipped isoform from SMN2 pre-mRNA, fails to rescue SMA patients. Here we show that hnRNP M, a member of hnRNP protein family, when knocked down, promotes exon 7 skipping of both SMN2 and SMN1 pre-mRNA. By contrast, overexpression of hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN2 and SMN1 pre-mRNA. Significantly, hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion in SMA patient cells. Thus, we conclude that hnRNP M promotes exon 7 inclusion of both SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNA. We also demonstrate that hnRNP M contacts an enhancer on exon 7, which was previously shown to provide binding site for tra2\u03b2. We present evidence that hnRNP M and tra2\u03b2 contact overlapped sequence on exon 7 but with slightly different RNA sequence requirements. In addition, hnRNP M promotes U2AF65 recruitment on the flanking intron of exon 7.

They mostly regulate the levels of their target genes at the post transcriptional stage by primarily binding to the 3\u2032 UTR. Elevated hepatic levels of miR-107 are a consistent feature associated with several obese and diabetic models. Here, we show that miR-107 post-transcriptionally regulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) by binding to its 3\u2032 UTR and reduces its protein levels and the 3\u2032UTR luciferase reporter activity, which are blunted by the miR-107 inhibitor and mutation in the miR-107 binding site in the 3\u2032 UTR. Knock-down of endogenous miR-107 levels increased FASN levels in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-107 led to significant accumulation of malonyl CoA, accompanied by ER stress induction. All these events were prevented in the presence of the miR-107 inhibitor. While overexpression of FASN could attenuate miR-107 mediated ER stress markers' induction; the ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenyl-butyric acid did not rescue miR-107 induced FASN inhibition. This was followed by increased triglyceride formation and lipid accumulation in the presence of miR-107. These indicate that miR-107 inhibits FASN levels by binding to its 3\u2032 UTR and this interaction promotes ER stress induction and malonyl CoA and lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. Our results suggest that increased levels of miR-107 are critical in promoting lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and this might form the basis of diverse etiologies encountered in a fatty liver.",

These \u2018serum\u2019 ESCs are in a metastable state characterized by the expression of many lineage-specifying genes. The use of two small-molecule kinase inhibitors (2i), targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), has enabled derivation of mouse ESCs in defined serum-free conditions. These \u20182i\u2019 ESCs are more homogeneous in morphology and gene expression than serum ESCs, and are postulated to represent the ground state of pluripotency. Recent studies have shown that the epigenome and transcriptome of 2i and serum ESCs are markedly different, suggesting that these ESCs represent two distinct states of pluripotency regulated by different factors and pathways. There is growing evidence that the 2i ESCs closely parallel the early blastocyst cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) or even earlier stages, while serum cells possibly reflect later stages. In this review, we will focus on the difference in chromatin structure, transcription regulation and cell cycle regulation between ground state pluripotent 2i ESCs and serum ESCs, and compare to corresponding data in embryos if available.

     "abstract": "OCT4 was discovered more than two decades ago as a transcription factor specific to early embryonic development. Early studies with OCT4 were descriptive and looked at determining the functional roles of OCT4 in the embryo as well as in pluripotent cell lines derived from embryos. Later studies showed that OCT4 was one of the transcription factors in the four-factor cocktail required for reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and that it is the only factor that cannot be substituted in this process by other members of the same protein family. In recent years, OCT4 has emerged as a master regulator of the induction and maintenance of cellular pluripotency, with crucial roles in the early stages of differentiation. Currently, mechanistic studies look at elucidating the molecular details of how OCT4 contributes to establishing selective gene expression programs that define different developmental stages of pluripotent cells. OCT4 belongs to the POU family of proteins, which have two conserved DNA-binding domains connected by a variable linker region. The functions of OCT4 depend on its ability to recognize and bind to DNA regulatory regions alone or in cooperation with other transcription factors and on its capacity to recruit other factors required to regulate the expression of specific sets of genes. Undoubtedly, future iPSC-based applications in regenerative medicine will benefit from understanding how OCT4 functions. Here we provide an integrated view of OCT4 research conducted to date by reviewing the different functional roles for OCT4 and discussing the current progress in understanding their underlying molecular mechanisms.

     "abstract": "The function of sperm is to safely transport the haploid paternal genome to the egg containing the maternal genome. The subsequent fertilization leads to transmission of a new unique diploid genome to the next generation. Before the sperm can set out on its adventurous journey, remarkable arrangements need to be made during the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. Haploid spermatids undergo extensive morphological changes, including a striking reorganization and compaction of their chromatin. Thereby, the nucleosomal, histone-based structure is nearly completely substituted by a protamine-based structure. This replacement is likely facilitated by incorporation of histone variants, post-translational histone modifications, chromatin-remodeling complexes, as well as transient DNA strand breaks. The consequences of mutations have revealed that a protamine-based chromatin is essential for fertility in mice but not in Drosophila. Nevertheless, loss of protamines in Drosophila increases the sensitivity to X-rays and thus supports the hypothesis that protamines are necessary to protect the paternal genome. Pharmaceutical approaches have provided the first mechanistic insights and have shown that hyperacetylation of histones just before their displacement is vital for progress in chromatin reorganization but is clearly not the sole inducer. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge on post-meiotic chromatin reorganization and reveal for the first time intriguing parallels in this process in Drosophila and mammals. We conclude with a model that illustrates the possible mechanisms that lead from a histone-based chromatin to a mainly protamine-based structure during spermatid differentiation.

PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) initiate transcriptional silencing of transposable elements, which leads to heterochromatin formation and/or DNA methylation.

Subsequently, the name was extended to proteins that mediate the post-translational assembly of oligomeric complexes protecting them from denaturation and/or aggregation. Hsp90 is a 90-kDa molecular chaperone that represents the major soluble protein of the cell. In contrast to most conventional chaperones, Hsp90 functions as a refined sensor of protein function and its principal role in the cell is to facilitate biological activity to properly folded client proteins that already have a preserved tertiary structure. Consequently, Hsp90 is related to basic cell functions such as cytoplasmic transport of soluble proteins, translocation of client proteins to organelles, and regulation of the biological activity of key signaling factors such as protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases, steroid receptors, cell cycle regulators, and transcription factors. A growing amount of evidence links the protective action of this molecular chaperone to mechanisms related to posttranslational modifications of soluble nuclear factors as well as histones. In this article, we discuss some aspects of the regulatory action of Hsp90 on transcriptional regulation and how this effect could have impacted genetic assimilation mechanism in some organisms.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that the level of PinX1 is regulated by p53, and p53 functions as a transcriptional factor to directly activate the expression of PinX1 in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, we found that HPV16 E6 suppresses the expression of PinX1 via inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity, resulting in the enhancement of telomerase activity.

The exact roles of these miRNAs in cellular stress responses, however, are not clear. Here we showed that many Sfmbt2-hosted miRNAs were highly hypertonic stress responsive in vitro and in vivo. In renal medulla, water deprivation induced alterations in the expression of miR-466(a/b/c/e/p)-3p in a pattern similar to that of miR-200b-3p, a known regulator of osmoresponsive transcription factor Nfat5. Remarkably, exposure of mIMCD3 cells to an arginine vasopressin analog time-dependently down-regulated the expression of miR-466(a/b/c/e/p)-3p and miR-200b-3p, which provides a novel regulatory mechanism for these osmoresponsive miRNAs. In cultured mIMCD3 cells we further demonstrated that miR-466a-3p and miR-466g were capable of targeting Nfat5 by interacting with its 3\u2032UTR. In transgenic mice overexpressing miR-466a-3p, significant down-regulation of Nfat5 and many other osmoregulation-related genes was observed in both the renal cortex and medulla. Moreover, sustained transgenic over-expression of miR-466a-3p was found to be associated with polydipsia, polyuria and disturbed ion homeostasis and kidney morphology. Since the mature sequence of miR-466a-3p is completely equivalent to that of miR-466e-3p and that the seed sequence of miR-466a-3p is completely equivalent to that of miR-297(a/b/c)-3p, miR-466d-3p, miR-467g and miR-669d-3p, and that miR-466a-3p differs from miR-466(b/c/p)-3p only in a 5\u2032 nucleotide, we propose that miR-466a-3p and many of its close relatives are important epigenetic regulators of renal Nfat5 signaling, osmoregulation and urine concentration in mice.",

Activated AhR can induce CYP1A1 transcription by binding to the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE). However, the mechanism of activation of the CYP1A1 promoter region is poorly understood. Previous reports showed that Sp1 could bind to a GC-rich region near the CYP1A1 promoter. This study sought to clarify the function of Sp1 in CYP1A1 transcription. Phosphorylation of Sp1 at Ser-59 (pSer-59) was previously reported to be closely related to transcriptional regulation. We used a site-specific phospho-antibody to show that treatment with TCDD or OP drastically reduced the level of pSer-59 in Sp1 from HepG2 cells. This reduction was too much, we hypothesized that the reduced phosphorylation level resulted from activation of phosphatase activity. Given that pSer-59 is dephosphorylated by PP2A, we examined the effect of a PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA), on pSer-59 and transcription of CYP1A1. The results showed that OA blocked dephosphorylation of Ser-59 and drastically inhibited transcription of CYP1A1. Similar results were obtained after knockdown of PP2A. Treatment with OA had no effect on the expression of AhR, its nuclear translocation, or its ability to bind to the XRE. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of Sp1 at Ser-59 was not affected by knockdown of AhR. These results indicate that the signals from TCDD or OP caused PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Sp1 at Ser-59 and induced CYP1A1 transcription. This signaling pathway was independent of the AhR-mediated pathway.",

Varieties with adult plant resistance (APR) maintain effective and durable disease resistance. APR to stripe rust in wheat cultivar XZ9104 (XZ) is associated with extensive hypersensitive cell death and production of reactive oxygen species in the host. MDHAR is an important gene in the AsA\u2013GSH cycle, and it plays an important role in maintaining the reduced pool of AsA scavenging hydrogen peroxide. microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to engage in post-transcriptional regulation by degrading target mRNAs or repressing gene translation in plants responding to abiotic/biotic stresses. Previously, two novel miRNAs (1136-P3 and PN-2013) were isolated in wheat and the target gene of them was determined using degradome sequencing technology. In this study, the target gene was isolated and characterized as TaMDHAR, a monodehydroascorbate reductase gene. We first demonstrated that the target gene could be cleaved by these two miRNAs in tobacco leaves experimentally. However, TaMDHAR was regulated by PN-2013, not 1136-P3, in wheat\u2013Pst adult incompatible interaction according to the expression patterns. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in improved wheat resistance to Pst at the seedling stage, with no influence on 1136-P3 and PN-2013 expression. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in a much greater H2O2 accumulation and lower APX and CAT activities together with higher expression in several PR genes. We deduced that TaMDHAR could contribute to the APR of XZ through ROS metabolism as regulated by the AsA\u2013GSH cycle.",

     "abstract": "NPAS4 is a brain restricted, activity-induced transcription factor which regulates the expression of inhibitory synapse genes to control homeostatic excitatory/inhibitory balance in neurons. NPAS4 is required for normal social interaction and contextual memory formation in mice. Protein and mRNA expression of NPAS4 is tightly coupled to neuronal depolarization and most prevalent in the cortical and hippocampal regions in the brain, however the precise mechanisms by which the NPAS4 gene is controlled remain unexplored. Here we show that expression of NPAS4 mRNA is actively repressed by RE-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) in embryonic stem cells and non-neuronal cells by binding multiple sites within the promoter and Intron I of NPAS4. Repression by REST also appears to correlate with the binding of the zinc finger DNA binding protein CTCF within Intron I of NPAS4. In addition, we show that the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of NPAS4 can be targeted by two microRNAs, miR-203 and miR-224 to further regulate its expression. miR-224 is a midbrain/hypothalamus enriched microRNA which is expressed from an intron within the GABAA receptor epsilon (GABRE) gene and may further regionalize NPAS4 expression. Our results reveal REST and microRNA dependent mechanisms that restrict NPAS4 expression to the brain.",

Caspase-2 pre-mRNA produces anti-apoptotic Casp-2S and pro-apoptotic Casp-2L proteins through exon 9 inclusion or skipping. However, the molecular mechanisms of exon 9 splicing are not well understood. Here we show that knockdown of SRSF3 (also known as SRp20) with siRNA induced significant increase of endogenous exon 9 inclusion. In addition, overexpression of SRSF3 promoted exon 9 skipping. Thus we conclude that SRSF3 promotes exon 9 skipping. In order to understand the functional target of SRSF3 on caspase-2 pre-mRNA, we performed substitution and deletion mutagenesis on the potential SRSF3 binding sites that were predicted from previous reports. We demonstrate that substitution mutagenesis of the potential SRSF3 binding site on exon 8 severely disrupted the effects of SRSF3 on exon 9 skipping. Furthermore, with the approach of RNA pulldown and immunoblotting analysis we show that SRSF3 interacts with the potential SRSF3 binding RNA sequence on exon 8 but not with the mutant RNA sequence. In addition, we show that a deletion of 26\u00a0nt RNA from 5\u2032 end of exon 8, a 33\u00a0nt RNA from 3\u2032 end of exon 10 and a 2225\u00a0nt RNA from intron 9 did not compromise the function of SRSF3 on exon 9 splicing.

FDXR functions in various metabolic processes including steroidogenesis. It is well known that multiple steroidogenic enzymes are regulated by a transcription factor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, also known as Ad4BP). Previously, we have shown that SF-1 transduction causes human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into steroidogenic cells. Genome-wide analysis of differentiated cells, using a combination of DNA microarray and promoter tiling array analyses, showed that FDXR is a novel SF-1 target gene. In this study, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of FDXR was examined in steroidogenic cells. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that a novel SF-1 binding region was located within intron 2 of the human FDXR gene. Luciferase reporter assays showed that FDXR transcription was activated through the novel SF-1 binding site within intron 2. Endogenous SF-1 knockdown in human adrenocortical H295R and KGN cells decreased FDXR expression. In H295R cells, strong binding of two histone markers of active enhancers, histones H3K27ac and H3K4me2, were detected near the SF-1 binding site within intron 2. Furthermore, the binding of these histone markers was decreased concurrent with SF-1 knockdown in H295R cells. These results indicated that abundant FDXR expression in these steroidogenic cells was maintained through SF-1 binding to the intronic enhancer of the FDXR gene.",

In all vertebrates, the Runx1 gene is transcribed from two promoters: a proximal promoter (P2), and a distal promoter (P1). We previously found that runx1 expression in a specific hematopoietic cell population in zebrafish embryos depends on cohesin. Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. Cohesin initiates expression of runx1 in the posterior lateral mesoderm and influences promoter use, while CTCF represses its expression in the newly emerging cells of the tail bud. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay. The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). CTCF depletion excluded RNAPII from two intronic CREs but not the promoters of runx1. We propose that cohesin and CTCF have distinct functions in the regulation of runx1 during zebrafish embryogenesis, and that these regulatory functions are likely to involve runx1 intronic CREs. Cohesin (but not CTCF) depletion enhanced RUNX1 expression in a human leukemia cell line, suggesting conservation of RUNX1 regulation through evolution.",

Further investigation revealed that DNAJB1 stabilizes MDM2 at the post-translational level. The C-terminus of DNAJB1 is essential for its interaction with MDM2 and for MDM2 accumulation. MDM2 was degraded faster by a ubiquitin-mediated pathway when DNAJB1 was depleted. DNAJB1 inhibited the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and contributed to p53 activation in cancer cells. Depletion of DNAJB1 in cancer cells inhibited activity of the p53 pathway, enhanced the activity of the Rb/E2F pathway, and promoted cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. This function was p53 dependent, and either human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein or siRNA against p53 was able to block the contribution caused by DNAJB1 depletion.

In this report, we have identified an inverted repeat sequence (ATGGTcttACCTA) within 1700\u00a0bp (\u2212\u00a01675/+\u00a035) of the HFE promoter capable to form cruciform structure that binds PARP1 and strongly represses HFE promoter. Knockdown of PARP1 increases HFE mRNA and protein. Similarly, hemin or FeCl3 treatments resulted in increase in HFE expression by reducing nuclear PARP1 pool via its apoptosis induced cleavage, leading to upregulation of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin mRNA. Thus, PARP1 binding to the inverted repeat sequence on the HFE promoter may serve as a novel iron sensing mechanism as increased iron level can trigger PARP1 cleavage and relief of HFE transcriptional repression.",

At 165 of them 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 strongly increases chromatin accessibility and has at further 217 sites weaker effects.

DR3-containing VDR sites are enriched in the neighborhood of genes that are involved in controling cellular growth, while non-DR3 VDR binding is often found close to genes related to immunity. At the example of six early VDR target genes we show that the slope of their 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcription correlates with the basal chromatin accessibility of their major VDR binding regions. However, the chromatin loci controlling these genes are indistinguishable in their VDR association kinetics.

SMG1 phosphorylates Upf1, a key NMD factor.

Upf1 is also known to be involved in staufen 1 (Stau1)-mediated mRNA decay (SMD), which is closely related to NMD. However, the biological and molecular roles of SMG1 in SMD remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that SMG1 is involved in SMD. The immunoprecipitation results show that SMG1 is complexed with Stau1, Upf1, and Dcp1a. Downregulation of SMG1 or overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of SMG1 inhibits SMD efficiency. In addition, downregulation of SMG1 inhibits rapid degradation elicited by artificially tethered Stau1 or Upf1 downstream of the normal termination codon. Furthermore, Stau1 and Upf1 colocalize in processing bodies in an SMG1-dependent manner. We also find that the level of SMG1 increases during adipogenesis. Accordingly, downregulation of SMG1 causes the reduction in the level of Upf1 phosphorylation and delays adipogenesis, suggesting the functional involvement of SMG1 in adipogenesis via SMD.",

Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel Bcrp1 promoter and first exon, E1U, located upstream from the other Bcrp1 promoters/first exons, which is the predominant alternative promoter utilized in murine testis. Using in silico analysis we identified a putative steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) response element that was unique to the Bcrp1 E1U alternative promoter. Overexpression of SF-1 in murine TM4 Sertoli cells enhanced Bcrp1 E1U mRNA expression and increased Bcrp1 E1U alternative promoter activity in a reporter assay, whereas mutation of the SF-1 binding site totally eliminated Bcrp1 E1U alternative promoter activity. Moreover, expression of Bcrp1 E1U and total mRNA and Bcrp1 protein was markedly diminished in the testes from adult Sertoli cell-specific SF-1 knockout mice, in comparison to the testes from wild-type mice. Binding of SF-1 to the SF-1 response element in the E1U promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.

Use of a systematic approach that integrates gene expression and chromatin binding profiling identified several candidate EDD-target genes, one of which is ACVRL1, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor with functional implications in blood vessel development. Further characterization revealed a negative regulation of ACVRL1 gene expression by EDD that is exerted at the promoter.

As a result, recent studies have shown that not only promoters but also intragenic and intergenic regions are widely modulated during physiological processes and disease. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that DNA methylation in the gene body is not just a passive witness of gene transcription but it seems to be actively involved in multiple gene regulation processes.

Atonal homolog 8 (Atoh8) displays high similarity in the bHLH domain with NeuroD proteins. Yet, available evidences indicate that Atoh8 has distinctive features including a ubiquitous expression pattern in embryonic tissues and the ability to inhibit differentiation. To gain insights into Atoh8 function, we aimed at identifying Atoh8 targets and investigated the effects of Atoh8 on global gene expression patterns in pancreatic mPAC cells, a model of bHLH-dependent endocrine differentiation. Our data reveal that Atoh8 is a weak transcriptional activator and does not exhibit proendocrine activity. Conversely, it blocks the induction of a reduced group of gene targets of the atonal-related proendocrine factor Neurogenin3. We show that Atoh8 lacks a transactivation domain and possesses intrinsic repressor activity that depends on a conserved Proline-rich domain. Atoh8 binds the ubiquitous E protein E47 and its ability to repress transcription may partly result from its ability to inhibit E47/E47 and Neurogenin3/E47 dimer activities. These results reveal distinctive transcriptional properties of Atoh8 within the atonal-related bHLH family that may be associated with the acquisition of new biological functions.",

CIITA is a transcriptional co-activator that regulates \u03b3-interferon-activated transcription of MHC class I and class II genes. It is also a functional homolog of TAF1, a component of the general transcription factor complex TFIID. TAF1 and CIITA both possess intrinsic acetyltransferase (AT) activity that is required for transcription initiation. In response to induction by \u03b3-interferon, CIITA and it's AT activity bypass the requirement for TAF1 AT activity. TAF1 also has kinase activity that is essential for its function. However, no similar activity has been identified for CIITA thus far.Here we report that CIITA, like TAF1, is a serine\u2013threonine kinase. Its substrate specificity parallels, but does not duplicate, that of TAF1 in phosphorylating the TFIID component TAF7, the RAP74 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIF and histone H2B. Like TAF1, CIITA autophosphorylates, affecting its interaction with TAF7. Additionally, CIITA phosphorylates histone H2B at Ser36, a target of TAF1 that is required for transcription during cell cycle progression and stress response. However, unlike TAF1, CIITA also phosphorylates all the other histones. The identification of this novel kinase activity of CIITA further clarifies its role as a functional homolog of TAF1 which may operate during stress and \u03b3-IFN activated MHC gene transcription.",

However, the factors regulating expression of the human myocardin (Myocd) gene, the master gene regulator of SMC differentiation, have yet to be identified. In this study, we sought to identify the critical factors regulating Myocd expression in human SMCs. Using deletion/genetic reporter analyses, an upstream repressor region (URR) was localised within the Myocd promoter, herein termed PrmM. Bioinformatic analysis revealed three evolutionary conserved Klf4 sites within the URR and disruption of those elements led to substantial increases in PrmM-directed gene expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression established that Klf4 significantly decreased Myocd mRNA levels and PrmM-directed gene expression while electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed specific binding of endogenous Klf4, and not Klf5 or Klf2, to the URR of PrmM. Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), a potent inhibitor of SMC differentiation, reduced Myocd mRNA levels and PrmM-directed gene expression in SMCs. A PDGF-BB-responsive region (PRR) was also identified within PrmM, overlapping with the previously identified URR, where either siRNA knockdown of Klf4 or the combined disruption of the Klf4 elements completely abolished PDGF-BB-mediated repression of PrmM-directed gene expression in SMCs. Moreover, ChIP analysis established that PDGF-BB-induced repression of Myocd gene expression is most likely regulated by enhanced binding of Klf4 and Klf5 to a lesser extent, to the PRR of PrmM. Taken together, these data provide critical insights into the transcriptional regulation of the Myocd gene in vascular SMCs, including during SMC differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) is the member of a family of related basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and is critical for granulopoiesis. We previously demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b1 interacts with the ETS domain of widely expressed GABP\u03b1, which leads to cooperative transcriptional activation of the myeloid-specific promoter for human FCAR encoding the Fc receptor for IgA (Fc\u03b1R, CD89) in part by facilitating recruitment of C/EBP\u03b1 to the promoter. The C/EBP\u03b1 molecule contains transactivation domains (TADs) at its N-terminus and a DNA-binding and dimerization bZIP structure at its C-terminus. We demonstrate here that GABP\u03b1 interacts with the last 18 residues of the C/EBP\u03b1 C-terminus beyond the bZIP DNA-binding and dimerizing region. Deletion of this C-terminus resulted in loss of GABP\u03b1 interaction but not affecting its DNA binding ability, indicating that it is not required for homodimer formation. Moreover, the C-terminus confers the ability to functionally synergize with GABP on a heterologous TAD when fused to the C-terminus of the VP16 TAD. We identified a three-amino acid stretch (amino acids 341\u2013343) that is important for both functional and protein interactions with GABP. Ectopic expression in K562 cells of C/EBP\u03b1 mutant incapable of interacting with GABP\u03b1 does not induce expression of granulocytic differentiation markers including CD15, CD11b, GCSF-R and C/EBP\u03b5, and does not inhibit proliferation, whereas wild type does. These results demonstrate the functional importance of the C/EBP\u03b1 C-terminus beyond the bZIP DNA-binding and dimerization region, which may mediate cooperative activation by C/EBP\u03b1 and GABP of myeloid-specific genes involved in C/EBP\u03b1-dependent granulopoiesis.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has previously been shown to be critical for maintaining glycemia and \u03b2-cell function. Efforts to maintain or increase ACE2 expression in pancreatic \u03b2-cells might therefore have therapeutic potential for treating diabetes. In our study, we investigated the transcriptional role of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF1\u03b1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b2 (HNF1\u03b2) in induction of ACE2 expression in insulin-secreting cells. A deficient allele of HNF1\u03b1 or HNF1\u03b2 causes maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) types 3 and 5, respectively, in humans. We found that ACE2 is primarily transcribed from the proximal part of the ACE2 promoter in the pancreas. In the proximal part of the human ACE2 promoter, we further identified three functional HNF1 binding sites, as they have binding affinity for HNF1\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b2 and are required for induction of promoter activity by HNF1\u03b2 in insulinoma cells. These three sites are well-conserved among mammalian species. Both HNF1\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b2 induce expression of ACE2 mRNA and lead to elevated levels of ACE2 protein and ACE2 enzymatic activity in insulinoma cells. Furthermore, HNF1\u03b1 dose-dependently increases ACE2 expression in primary pancreatic islet cells. We conclude that HNF1\u03b1 can induce the expression of ACE2 in pancreatic islet cells via evolutionarily conserved HNF1 binding sites in the ACE2 promoter. Potential therapeutics aimed at counteracting functional HNF1\u03b1 depletion in diabetes and MODY3 will thus have ACE2 induction in pancreatic islets as a likely beneficial effect.",

Therefore in free-living organisms that are able to grow at various environmental temperatures, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, evolution should have not only shaped the structural and functional properties of this key enzyme, but should have also provided mechanisms and pathways to adapt its activity to the optimal performance required. We studied the changes in RNA pol II elongation speed caused by alternations in growth temperature in yeast to find that they strictly follow the Arrhenius equation, and that they also provoke an almost inverse proportional change in RNA pol II density within the optimal growth temperature range (26\u201337\u00a0\u00b0C).

Accordingly, ATAD2 has been shown to cooperate with a series of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers to regulate specific set of genes.Here we discuss our knowledge on ATAD2 to evaluate its role as a cancer driver and its value as a new anti-cancer target.Upon its activation, ATAD2 through its interaction with defined transcription factors, initiates a loop of transcriptional stimulation of target genes, including ATAD2 itself, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in an ATAD2-dependent manner.

Under basal conditions, mutation of the non-perfect DR1 decreased promoter activity by 50%, whereas mutation of neither the DR1 nor the H4-SBM had any effect. In marked contrast, only mutation of the H4-SBM decreased HNF4\u03b1-transactivation of the promoter activity by 65%. EMSA revealed that HNF4\u03b1 binds to the DR1site and H4-SBM with similar affinity while it binds poorly to the non-perfect DR1. Interestingly, this non-perfect DR1 also coincides with two E-boxes. Mutation of the non-perfect DR1 together with the nearby E-box reduced USF1- but not USF2-transactivation of promoter activity, suggesting that USF1 partly contributes to the basal activity of the promoter. Substitution of the H4-SBM with the DR1 marginally reduced the basal promoter activity but did not eliminate HNF4\u03b1-transactivation, suggesting that HNF4\u03b1 can exert its effect via DR1 within this promoter context. ChIP-assay confirmed that HNF4\u03b1 is associated with the H4-SBM. Suppression of HNF4\u03b1 expression in AML12 cells down-regulated PC mRNA and PC protein by 60% and 50%, respectively, confirming that PC is a target of HNF4\u03b1.

Xenopus laevis Zygote arrest 2 (Zar2) binds to the Translational Control Sequence (TCS) in maternal mRNAs and regulates translation. The molecular mechanism of Zar1 has not been described. Here we report similarities and differences between Xenopus Zar1 and Zar2. Analysis of Zar sequences in vertebrates revealed two Zar family members with conserved, characteristic amino acid differences in the C-terminal domain. The presence of only two vertebrate Zar proteins was supported by analyzing Zar1 synteny. We propose that the criteria for naming Zar sequences are based on the characteristic amino acids and the chromosomal context. We also propose reclassification of some Zar sequences. We found that Zar1 is expressed throughout oogenesis and is stable during oocyte maturation. The N-terminal domain of Zar1 repressed translation of a reporter construct in immature oocytes. Both Zar1 and Zar2 bound to the TCS in the Wee1 and Mos 3\u2032 UTRs using a zinc finger in the C-terminal domain. However, Zar1 had much higher affinity for RNA than Zar2. To show the functional significance of the conserved amino acid substitutions, these residues in Zar2 were mutated to those found in Zar1. We show that these residues contributed to the different RNA binding characteristics of Zar1 compared to Zar2. Our study shows that Zar proteins have generally similar molecular functions in the translational regulation of maternal mRNAs, but they may have different roles in early development.",

     "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is the best-characterized mRNA surveillance mechanism that degrades a premature-termination codon (PTC)-containing mRNA. During mammalian NMD, SMG1 and UPF1, key proteins in NMD, join at a PTC and form an SMG1\u2013UPF1\u2013eRF1\u2013eRF3 (SURF) complex by binding UPF1 to eRF3 after PTC-recognition by the translating ribosome. Subsequently, UPF1 is phosphorylated after UPF1\u2013SMG1 moves onto the downstream exon junction complex (EJC). However, the cellular events that induce UPF1 and SMG1 complex formation and increase NMD efficiency before PTC recognition remain unclear. Here, we show that telomere-maintenance 2 (TEL2) phosphorylation by casein-kinase 2 (CK2) increases SMG1 stability, which increases UPF1 phosphorylation and, ultimately, augments NMD. Inhibition of CK2 activity or downregulation of TEL2 impairs NMD. Intriguingly, loss of TEL2 phosphorylation reduces UPF1-bound PTC-containing mRNA and the formation of the SMG1\u2013UPF1 complex. Thus, our results identify a new function of CK2-mediated TEL2 phosphorylation in a mammalian NMD.",

Genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome in S2 cells indicated that repression of Trl is very likely unique, being GAGA factor a transactivator for all the other promoters.

     "abstract": "The architectural high mobility group box 1 (Hmgb1) protein acts as both a nuclear and an extracellular regulator of various biological processes, including skeletogenesis. Here we report its contribution to the evolutionarily conserved, distinctive regulation of the matrilin-1 gene (Matn1) expression in amniotes. We previously demonstrated that uniquely assembled proximal promoter elements restrict Matn1 expression to specific growth plate cartilage zones by allowing varying doses of L-Sox5/Sox6 and Nfi proteins to fine-tune their Sox9-mediated transactivation. Here, we dissected the regulatory mechanisms underlying the activity of a conserved distal promoter element 1. We show that this element carries three Sox-binding sites, works as an enhancer in vivo, and allows promoter activation by the Sox5/6/9 chondrogenic trio. In early steps of chondrogenesis, declining Hmgb1 expression overlaps with the onset of Sox9 expression. Unlike repression in late steps, Hmgb1 overexpression in early chondrogenesis increases Matn1 promoter activation by the Sox trio, and forced Hmgb1 expression in COS-7 cells facilitates induction of Matn1 expression by the Sox trio. The conserved Matn1 control elements bind Hmgb1 and SOX9 with opposite efficiency in vitro. They show higher HMGB1 than SOX trio occupancy in established chondrogenic cell lines, and HMGB1 silencing greatly increases MATN1 and COL2A1 expression. Together, these data thus suggest a model whereby Hmgb1 helps recruit the Sox trio to the Matn1 promoter and thereby facilitates activation of the gene in early chondrogenesis. We anticipate that Hmgb1 may similarly affect transcription of other cartilage-specific genes.",

This competition may complicate the interpretations of phenotypes observed through siRNA-mediated knockdown of genes, especially those genes implicated in the RISC pathway. In this study, we re-examined the function of RNA helicase A (RHA), which has been previously proposed to function in RISC loading based on siRNA-mediated knockdown studies. Here we show that reduced RISC activity or loading of siRNAs was observed only in cells depleted of RHA using siRNA, but not using RNaseH-dependent antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), suggesting that the impaired RISC function stems from the competition between pre-existing and newly transfected siRNAs, but not from reduction of the RHA protein. This view is further supported by the findings that cells depleted of a control protein, NCL1, using siRNA, but not ASO, exhibited similar defects on the loading and activity of a subsequently transfected siRNA. Transfection of RHA or NCL1 siRNAs, but not ASOs, reduced the levels of endogenous miRNAs, suggesting a competition mechanism. As a positive control, we showed that reduction of MOV10 by either siRNA or ASO decreased siRNA activity, confirming its role in RISC function.

     "abstract": "In various human malignancies, widespread dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression is reported to occur and affects various cell growth programs. Recent studies suggest that the expression levels of miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors are frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome deletions, epigenetical changes, aberrant transcription, and disturbances in miRNA processing. MiR-143 and -145 are well-recognized miRNAs that are highly expressed in several tissues, but down-regulated in most types of cancers. However, the mechanism of this down-regulation has not been investigated in detail. Here, we show that DEAD-box RNA helicase 6, DDX6 (p54/RCK), post-transcriptionally down-regulated miR-143/145 expression by prompting the degradation of its host gene product, NCR143/145 RNA. In human gastric cancer cell line MKN45, DDX6 protein was abundantly expressed and accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies). DDX6 preferentially increased the instability of non-coding RNA, NCR143/145, which encompasses the miR-143/145 cluster, and down-regulated the expression of mature miR-143/145. In human monocytic cell line THP-1, lipopolysaccharide treatment promoted the assembly of P-bodies and down-regulated the expression of NCR143/145 and its miR-143/145 rapidly. In these cells, cycloheximide treatment led to a loss of P-bodies and to an increase in NCR143/145 RNA stability, thus resulting in up-regulation of miR-143/145 expression. These data demonstrate that DDX6 contributed to the control of NCR143/145 RNA stability in P-bodies and post-transcriptionally regulated miR-143/145 expression in cancer cells.",

The MAP kinase Hog1 activates several transcription factors, regulates chromatin-modifying enzymes and, through its interaction with RNA polymerase II, it directs this enzyme to osmotic stress-controlled genes. For such targeting, this kinase requires the interaction with transcription factors Hot1 and Sko1. However, phosphorylation of these proteins by Hog1 is not required for their functionality. In this study, we aim to identify the Hot1 elements involved in Hog1-binding and in the activation of transcription. Two-hybrid experiments demonstrated that the Hot1 sequence between amino acids 340 and 534 and the CD element of Hog1 are required for the interaction between the two proteins and the Hot1-dependent transcription regulation. Inside this Hot1 region, short sequence KRRRR (KR4, amino acids 381\u2013385) is essential for the kinase binding. Our data show that another element, sequence EDDDDD (ED5, amino acids 541\u2013546), is essential for Hot1 binding to chromatin. Under osmotic stress conditions, both Hot1 elements, Hog1-interaction KR4 and DNA-binding ED5, are involved in the appropriate recruitment of Hog1 and RNA polymerase II to genes controlled by this transcription factor. Moreover, both sequences are required for osmotolerance and KR4 is necessary for the functionality of the HOG pathway. According to several experiments described in this study, the Hot1 protein is capable of forming homodimers.",

RNA interference of DREF in S2 cells reinforces these results showing a decrease in the mRNA levels of d-mtDNA helicase and d-mtTFB2 and no changes in those of the d-mtTFB1.

     "abstract": "Immediate early genes (IEGs) are expressed upon re-entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle following serum stimulation. These genes are involved in growth control and differentiation and hence their expression is tightly controlled. Many IEGs are regulated through Serum Response Elements (SREs) in their promoters, which bind Serum Response Factor (SRF). However, many other IEGs do not have SREs in their promoters and their serum regulation is poorly understood. We have identified SRF-independent IEGs in SRF-depleted fibroblasts. One of these, Id1, was examined more closely. We mapped a serum responsive element in the Id1 promoter and find that it is identical to a BMP responsive element (BRE). The Id1 BRE is necessary and sufficient for the serum regulation of Id1. Inhibition of the BMP pathway by siRNA depletion of Smad 4, treatment with the BMP antagonist noggin, or the BMP receptor inhibitor dorsomorphin blocked serum induction of Id1. Further, BMP2 is sufficient to induce Id1 expression. Given reports that SRC inhibitors can block Id1 expression, we tested the SRC inhibitor, AZD0530, and found that it inhibits the serum activation of Id1. Surprisingly, this inhibition is independent of SRC or its family members. Rather, we show that AZD0530 directly inhibits the BMP type I receptors. Serum induction of the Id1 related gene Id3 also required the BMP pathway. Given these and other findings we conclude that the Id family of IEGs is regulated by BMPs in serum through similar BREs. This represents a second pathway for serum regulation of IEGs.",

Starvation alters pre-mRNA splicing by decreasing the rate of intron removal, leading to intron retention and a decrease in the accumulation of mature mRNA. A regulatory element within exon 12 of G6PD pre-mRNA controls splicing efficiency. Starvation caused an increase in the expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K protein and this increase coincided with the increase in the binding of hnRNP K to the regulatory element and a decrease in the expression of G6PD mRNA. HnRNP K bound to two C-rich motifs forming an ESS within exon 12. Overexpression of hnRNP K decreased the splicing and expression of G6PD mRNA, while siRNA-mediated depletion of hnRNP K caused an increase in the splicing and expression of G6PD mRNA. Binding of hnRNP K to the regulatory element was enhanced in vivo by starvation coinciding with a decrease in G6PD mRNA. HnRNP K binding to the C-rich motifs blocked binding of serine-arginine rich, splicing factor 3 (SRSF3), a splicing enhancer. Thus hnRNP K is a nutrient regulated splicing factor responsible for the inhibition of the splicing of G6PD during starvation.",

     "abstract": "S100A9 is a calcium-binding protein and subunit of antimicrobial calprotectin complex (S100A8/A9). Produced by neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and keratinocytes, S100A9 expression increases in response to inflammation. For example, IL-1\u03b1 produced by epithelial cells acts autonomously on the same cells to induce the expression of S100A8/A9 and cellular differentiation. Whereas it is well known that IL-1\u03b1 and members of the IL-10 family of cytokines upregulate S100A8 and S100A9 in several cell lineages, the pathway and mechanism of IL-1\u03b1-dependent transcriptional control of S100A9 in epithelial cells are not established. Modeled using human epidermal keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), IL-1\u03b1 stimulated the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and induced S100A9 expression, which was blocked by IL-1 receptor antagonist, RNAi suppression of p38, or a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Transcription of S100A9 in HaCaT cells depended on nucleotides \u2212\u00a094 to \u2212\u00a053 in the upstream promoter region, based upon the use of deletion constructs and luciferase reporter activity. Within the responsive promoter region, IL-1\u03b1 increased the binding activity of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2). Mutated C/EBP\u03b2 binding sequences or C/EBP\u03b2-specific siRNA inhibited the S100A9 transcriptional response. Hence, IL-1\u03b1 is strongly suggested to increase S100A9 expression in a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line by signaling through the IL-1 receptor and p38 MAPK, increasing C/EBP\u03b2-dependent transcriptional activity.",

These transcription regulatory elements forming loops have highly acetylated histones. To understand the correlation between histone acetylation and chromatin loop formation, we inhibited the expression of histone acetyltransferase CBP and p300 in erythroid K562 cells and analyzed the chromatin structure of the \u03b2-globin locus. The proximity between the locus control region (LCR) and the active G\u03b3-globin gene was decreased in the \u03b2-globin locus when histones were hypoacetylated by the double knockdown of CBP and p300. Sensitivity to DNase I and binding of erythroid specific activators were reduced in the hypoacetylated LCR hypersensitive sites (HSs) and gene promoter. Interestingly, the chromatin loop between HS5 and 3\u2032HS1 was formed regardless of the hypoacetylation of the \u03b2-globin locus. CTCF binding was maintained at HS5 and 3\u2032HS1 in the hypoacetylated locus. Thus, these results indicate that histone acetylation contributes to chromatin looping through the formation of HSs in the LCR and gene promoter. However, looping between insulators appears to be independent from histone acetylation.",

     "abstract": "DEAD-box proteins represent the largest family of RNA helicases, present in all three kingdoms of life. They are involved in a variety of processes involving RNA metabolism and in some instances also in processes that use guide RNAs. Since their first descriptions in the late 1980s, the perception of their molecular activities has dramatically changed. At the time when only eight proteins with 9 conserved motifs constituted the DEAD-box protein family, it was the biochemical characterization of mammalian eIF4A that first suggested a local unwinding activity. This was confirmed in vitro using partially double stranded RNA substrates with the unexpected result of a bidirectional unwinding activity. A real change of paradigm from the classical helicase activity to localized RNA unwinding occurred with the publication of the vasa\u2022RNA structure with a bend in the RNA substrate and the insightful work from several laboratories demonstrating local unwinding without translocation. Finally, elegant work on the exon-junction complex revealed how DEAD-box proteins can bind to RNA to serve as clamps to function as nucleation centers to form RNP complexes.

Apart from unwinding RNA duplexes, which established these proteins as RNA helicases, DEAD box proteins have been shown to also catalyse RNA annealing and to displace proteins from RNA. DEAD box proteins generally act as components of large multi-protein complexes and it is thought that interactions, via their divergent N- and C-terminal extensions, with other factors in the complexes may be responsible for the many different functions attributed to these proteins.In addition to their established crucial roles in the manipulation of RNA structure, it is becoming increasingly clear that several members of the DEAD box family act as regulators of transcription.

     "abstract": "In eukaryotes, many genes are transcribed as precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) that contain exons and introns, the latter of which must be removed and exons ligated to form the mature mRNAs. This process is called pre-mRNA splicing, which occurs in the nucleus. Although the chemistry of pre-mRNA splicing is identical to that of the self-splicing Group II introns, hundreds of proteins and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, are essential for executing pre-mRNA splicing. Spliceosome, arguably the most complex cellular machine made up of all those proteins and snRNAs, is responsible for carrying out pre-mRNA splicing. In contrast to the transcription and the translation machineries, spliceosome is formed anew onto each pre-mRNA and undergoes a series of highly coordinated reconfigurations to form the catalytic center. This amazing process is orchestrated by a number of DExD/H-proteins that are the focus of this article, which aims to review the field in general and to project the exciting challenges and opportunities ahead.

Although spectacular progress has been made in understanding mammalian ribosome synthesis in recent years, by far, this process has still been best characterised in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, besides the rRNAs, the ribosomal proteins and the 75 small nucleolar RNAs, more than 250 non-ribosomal proteins, generally referred to as trans-acting factors, are involved in ribosome biogenesis. These factors include nucleases, RNA modifying enzymes, ATPases, GTPases, kinases and RNA helicases. Altogether, they likely confer speed, accuracy and directionality to the ribosome synthesis process, however, the precise functions for most of them are still largely unknown.

In addition to its role in mRNA export, a second important function of Dbp5 was identified in translation termination, where it acts together with eRF1 once the translation machinery has reached the stop codon. Similar to mRNA export, this function also requires Gle1\u2013IP6, however, the counterpart of Nup159 is still missing.

If an mRNA is not translating, it will associate with translation repression factors; the mRNA can be stored in these non-translating states. The movement of mRNA into storage and back to translation is dictated by the recognition of the mRNA by trans factors. So, remodeling the factors that bind mRNA is critical for changing the fate of mRNA.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the nuclear genome encodes four DExH/D superfamily members (MSS116, SUV3, MRH4, IRC3) that act as helicases and/or RNA chaperones. Their activity is necessary for mitochondrial RNA splicing, degradation, translation and genome maintenance. In humans the ortholog of SUV3 (hSUV3, SUPV3L1) so far is the best described mitochondrial RNA helicase. The enzyme, together with the matrix-localized pool of PNPase (PNPT1), forms an RNA-degrading complex called the mitochondrial degradosome, which localizes to distinct structures (D-foci). Global regulation of mitochondrially encoded genes can be achieved by changing mitochondrial DNA copy number. This way the proteins involved in its replication, like the Twinkle helicase (c10orf2), can indirectly regulate gene expression.

On the other hand, it is accepted that DexD/H-box helicases also engage in activities that do not require helicase activity. A number of DExD/H-box helicases have been shown to be involved in anti-viral immunity. The RIG-like helicases, RIG-I, mda5 and lgp2, act as important cytosolic pattern recognition receptors for viral RNA. Detection of viral nucleic acids by the RIG-like helicases or other anti-viral pattern recognition receptors leads to the induction of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. More recently, additional DExD/H-box helicases have also been implicated to act as cytosolic sensors of viral nucleic acids, including DDX3, DDX41, DHX9, DDX60, DDX1 and DHX36. However, there is evidence that at least some of these helicases might have more downstream functions in pattern recognition receptor signalling pathways, as signalling adaptors or transcriptional regulators. In an interesting twist, a lot of DExD/H-box helicases have also been identified as essential host factors for the replication of different viruses, suggesting that viruses \u2018hijack\u2019 their RNA helicase activities for their benefit.

     "abstract": "DEAD-box proteins are RNA-dependent ATPases that are widespread in all three kingdoms of life. They are thought to rearrange the structures of RNA or ribonucleoprotein complexes but their exact mechanism of action is rarely known. Whereas in yeast most DEAD-box proteins are essential, no example of an essential bacterial DEAD-box protein has been reported so far; at most, their absence results in cold-sensitive growth. Moreover, whereas yeast DEAD-box proteins are implicated in virtually all reactions involving RNA, in E. coli (the bacterium where DEAD-box proteins have been mostly studied) their role is limited to ribosome biogenesis, mRNA degradation, and possibly translation initiation. Plausible reasons for these differences are discussed here.In spite of their dispensability, E. coli DEAD-box proteins are valuable models for the mechanism of action of DEAD-box proteins in general because the reactions in which they participate can be reproduced in vitro. Here we review our present understanding of this mechanism of action. Using selected examples for which information is available: (i) we describe how, by interacting directly with a particular RNA motif or by binding to proteins that themselves recognize such a motif, DEAD-box proteins are brought to their specific RNA substrate(s); (ii) we discuss the nature of the structural transitions that DEAD-box proteins induce on their substrates; and (iii) we analyze the reasons why these proteins are mostly important at low temperatures.

     "abstract": "In order to adapt to changing environmental conditions and regulate intracellular events such as division, cells are constantly producing new RNAs while discarding old or defective transcripts. These functions require the coordination of numerous ribonucleases that precisely cleave and trim newly made transcripts to produce functional molecules, and rapidly destroy unnecessary cellular RNAs. In recent years our knowledge of the nature, functions and structures of these enzymes in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes has dramatically expanded. We present here a synthetic overview of the recent development in this dynamic area which has seen the identification of many new endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases. Moreover, the increasing pace at which the structures of these enzymes, or of their catalytic domains, have been solved has provided atomic level detail into their mechanisms of action. Based on sequence conservation and structural data, these proteins have been grouped into families, some of which contain only ribonuclease members, others including a variety of nucleolytic enzymes that act upon DNA and/or RNA. At the other extreme some ribonucleases belong to families of proteins involved in a wide variety of enzymatic reactions. Functional characterization of these fascinating enzymes has provided evidence for the extreme diversity of their biological functions that include, for example, removal of poly(A) tails (deadenylation) or poly(U) tails from eukaryotic RNAs, processing of tRNA and mRNA 3\u2032 ends, maturation of rRNAs and destruction of unnecessary mRNAs.

Moreover, the processes are well controlled, thereby ensuring that degradation is orderly and coordinated. Throughout much of the bacterial kingdom, RNA degradation processes originate through the actions of assemblies of key RNA enzymes, known as RNA degradosomes. Neither conserved in composition, nor unified by common evolutionary ancestry, RNA degradosomes nonetheless can be found in divergent bacterial lineages, implicating a common requirement for the co-localisation of RNA metabolic activities. We describe how the cooperation of components in the representative degradosome of Escherichia coli may enable controlled access to transcripts, so that they have defined and programmable lifetimes. We also discuss how this cooperation contributes to precursor processing and to the riboregulation of intricate post-transcriptional networks in the control of gene expression. The E. coli degradosome interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane, and we discuss how this interaction may spatially organise the assembly and contribute to subunit cooperation and substrate capture.

     "abstract": "Toxin\u2013antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea and play important roles in a diverse range of cellular activities. TA systems have been broadly classified into 5 types and the targets of the toxins are diverse, but the most frequently used cellular target is mRNA. Toxins that target mRNA to inhibit translation can be classified as ribosome-dependent or ribosome-independent RNA interferases. These RNA interferases are sequence-specific endoribonucleases that cleave RNA at specific sequences. Despite limited sequence similarity, ribosome-independent RNA interferases belong to a limited number of structural classes. The MazF structural family includes MazF, Kid, ParE and CcdB toxins. MazF members cleave mRNA at 3-, 5- or 7-base recognition sequences in different bacteria and have been implicated in controlling cell death (programmed) and cell growth, and cellular responses to nutrient starvation, antibiotics, heat and oxidative stress. VapC endoribonucleases belong to the PIN-domain family and inhibit translation by either cleaving tRNAfMet in the anticodon stem loop, cleaving mRNA at -AUA(U/A)-hairpin-G- sequences or by sequence-specific RNA binding. VapC has been implicated in controlling bacterial growth in the intracellular environment and in microbial adaptation to nutrient limitation (nitrogen, carbon) and heat shock. ToxN shows structural homology to MazF and is also a sequence-specific endoribonuclease. ToxN confers phage resistance by causing cell death upon phage infection by cleaving cellular and phage RNAs, thereby interfering with bacterial and phage growth. Notwithstanding our recent progress in understanding ribonuclease action and function in TA systems, the environmental triggers that cause release of the toxin from its cognate antitoxin and the precise cellular function of these systems in many bacteria remain to be discovered.

A hallmark of these enzymes is their ability to catalyze both endo- and exo-ribonucleolytic degradation. Exo-ribonucleolytic degradation proceeds in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction and is sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the 5\u2032 end of a transcript. Recent phylogenomic analyses have shown that the \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases can be partitioned into two major subdivisions that correspond to orthologs of eukaryal CPSF73 and bacterial RNase J. We discuss the known functions of the CPSF73 and RNase J orthologs, their association into complexes, and their structure as it relates to mechanism of action. Eukaryal CPSF73 is part of a large multiprotein complex that is involved in the maturation of the 3\u2032 end of RNA Polymerase II transcripts and the polyadenylation of messenger RNA. RNase J1 and J2 are paralogs in Bacillus subtilis that are involved in the degradation of messenger RNA and the maturation of non-coding RNA. RNase J1 and J2 co-purify as a heteromeric complex and there is recent evidence that they interact with other enzymes to form a bacterial RNA degradosome. Finally, we speculate on the evolutionary origin of \u03b2-CASP ribonucleases and on their functions in Archaea. Orthologs of CPSF73 with endo- and exo-ribonuclease activity are strictly conserved throughout the archaea suggesting a role for these enzymes in the maturation and/or degradation of messenger RNA.

All this is achieved by about a dozen proteins with only three ribonuclease activities between them. At first glance, the versatility of the pathways involving the exosome and the sheer multitude of its substrates are astounding. However, after fifteen years of research we have some understanding of how exosome activity is controlled and applied inside the cell. The catalytic properties of the eukaryotic exosome are fairly well described and attention is now drawn to how the interplay between these activities impacts cell physiology. Also, it has become evident that exosome function relies on many auxiliary factors, which are intensely studied themselves. In this way, the focus of exosome research is slowly leaving the test tube and moving back into the cell.The exosome also has an interesting evolutionary history, which is evident within the eukaryotic lineage but only fully appreciated when considering similar protein complexes found in Bacteria and Archaea. Thus, while we keep this review focused on the most comprehensively described yeast and human exosomes, we shall point out similarities or dissimilarities to prokaryotic complexes and proteins where appropriate.The article is divided into three parts. In Part One we describe how the exosome is built and how it manifests in cells of different organisms.

Many major pathways for mRNA decay involve the removal of the 5\u2032 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) cap in the cytoplasm to allow for 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 exonucleolytic decay. The most well studied and conserved eukaryotic decapping enzyme is Dcp2, and its function is aided by co-factors and decapping enhancers. A subset of these factors can act to enhance the catalytic activity of Dcp2, while others might stimulate the remodeling of proteins bound to the mRNA substrate that may otherwise inhibit decapping. Structural studies have provided major insights into the mechanisms by which Dcp2 and decapping co-factors activate decapping. Additional mRNA decay factors can function by recruiting components of the decapping machinery to target mRNAs. mRNA decay factors, decapping factors, and mRNA substrates can be found in cytoplasmic foci named P bodies that are conserved in eukaryotes, though their function remains unknown. In addition to Dcp2, other decapping enzymes have been identified, which may serve to supplement the function of Dcp2 or act in independent decay or quality control pathways.

Highly conserved across species, the family is typically represented by one cytoplasmic enzyme (XRN1/PACMAN or XRN4) and one or more nuclear enzymes (XRN2/RAT1 and XRN3). Cytoplasmic and/or nuclear XRNs have proven to be essential in all organisms tested, and deficiencies can have severe developmental phenotypes, demonstrating that XRNs are indispensable in fungi, plants and animals. XRNs degrade diverse RNA substrates during general RNA decay and function in specialized processes integral to RNA metabolism, such as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), gene silencing, rRNA maturation, and transcription termination. Here, we review current knowledge of XRNs, highlighting recent work of high impact and future potential. One example is the breakthrough in our understanding of how XRN1 processively degrades 5\u2032 monophosphorylated RNA, revealed by its crystal structure and mutational analysis. The expanding knowledge of XRN substrates and interacting partners is outlined and the functions of XRNs are interpreted at the organismal level using available mutant phenotypes. Finally, three case studies are discussed in more detail to underscore a few of the most exciting areas of research on XRN function: XRN4 involvement in small RNA-associated processes in plants, the roles of XRN1/PACMAN in Drosophila development, and the function of human XRN2 in nuclear transcriptional quality control.

     "abstract": "Biological processes are not exempt from errors and RNA production is not an exception to this rule. Errors can arise stochastically or be genetically fixed and systematically appear in the biochemical or cellular phenotype. In any case, quality control mechanisms are essential to minimize the potentially toxic effects of faulty RNA production or processing. Although many RNA molecules express their functional potential in the cytoplasm, as messengers, adaptors or operators of gene expression pathways, a large share of quality control occurs in the nucleus. This is likely because the early timing of occurrence and the subcellular partition make the control more efficient, at least as long as the defects can be detected ahead of the cytoplasmic phase of the RNA life cycle. One crucial point in discussing RNA quality control resides in its definition. A stringent take would imply the existence of specific mechanisms to recognize the error and the consequent repair or elimination of the faulty molecule. One example in the RNA field could be the recognition of a premature stop codon by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway, discussed elsewhere in this issue. A more relaxed view posits that the thermodynamic or kinetic aftermath of a mistake (e.g. a blockage or a delay in processing) by itself constitutes the recognition event, which triggers downstream quality control. Because whether inappropriate molecules are specifically recognized remains unclear in many cases, we will adopt the more relaxed definition of RNA quality control. RNA repair remains episodic and the degradative elimination of crippled molecules appears to be the rule. Therefore we will briefly describe the actors of RNA degradation in the nucleus. Detailed analyses of the mechanism of action of these enzymes can be found in several excellent and recent reviews, including in this issue. Finally, we will restrict our analysis to the yeast model, which is used in the majority of RNA quality control studies, but examples exist in the literature indicating that many of the principles of RNA quality control described in yeast also apply to other eukaryotes.

     "abstract": "The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is well known as a translation-coupled quality control system that recognizes and degrades aberrant mRNAs with truncated open reading frames (ORF) due to the presence of a premature termination codon (PTC). However, a more general role of NMD in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression is indicated by transcriptome-wide mRNA profilings that identified a plethora of physiological mRNAs as NMD targets. In this review, we focus on mechanistic aspects of target mRNA identification and degradation in mammalian cells, based on the available biochemical and genetic data, and point out knowledge gaps. Translation termination in a messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) environment lacking necessary factors for proper translation termination emerges as a key determinant for subjecting an mRNA to NMD, and we therefore review recent structural and mechanistic insight into translation termination. In addition, the central role of UPF1, its crucial phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle and dynamic interactions with other NMD factors are discussed.

Recent studies have shown that NMD also targets mRNAs transcribed from a large subset of wild-type genes. This raises the possibility that NMD itself is under regulatory control. Indeed, several recent studies have shown that NMD activity is modulated in specific cell types and that key components of the NMD pathway are regulated by several pathways, including microRNA circuits and NMD itself. Cellular stress also modulates the magnitude of NMD by mechanisms that are beginning to be understood. Here, we review the evidence that NMD is regulated and discuss the physiological role for this regulation. We propose that the efficiency of NMD is altered in some cellular contexts to regulate normal biological events.

Various aberrant mRNAs transiently produced during RNA processing reactions are recognized and eliminated by specific quality control systems. It has been demonstrated that these mRNA quality control systems stimulate the degradation of aberrant mRNA to prevent the potentially harmful products derived from aberrant mRNAs. Recent studies on quality control systems induced by abnormal translation elongation and termination have revealed that both aberrant mRNAs and proteins are subjected to rapid degradation. In NonStop Decay (NSD) quality control system, a poly(A) tail of nonstop mRNA is translated and the synthesis of poly-lysine sequence results in translation arrest followed by co-translational degradation of aberrant nonstop protein. In No-Go Decay (NGD) quality control system, the specific amino acid sequences of the nascent polypeptide induce ribosome stalling, and the arrest products are ubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In Nonfunctional rRNA Decay (NRD) quality control system, aberrant ribosomes composed of nonfunctional ribosomal RNAs are also eliminated when aberrant translation elongation complexes are formed on mRNA. I describe recent progresses on the mechanisms of quality control systems and the relationships between quality control systems.

     "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rise in publications demonstrating coupling between transcription and mRNA decay. This coupling most often accompanies cellular processes that involve transitions in gene expression patterns, for example during mitotic division and cellular differentiation and in response to cellular stress. Transcription can affect the mRNA fate by multiple mechanisms. The most novel finding is the process of co-transcriptional imprinting of mRNAs with proteins, which in turn regulate cytoplasmic mRNA stability. Transcription therefore is not only a catalyst of mRNA synthesis but also provides a platform that enables imprinting, which coordinates between transcription and mRNA decay. Here we present an overview of the literature, which provides the evidence of coupling between transcription and decay, review the mechanisms and regulators by which the two processes are coupled, discuss why such coupling is beneficial and present a new model for regulation of gene expression.

     "abstract": "The post-transcriptional addition of non-templated nucleotides to the 3\u2032 ends of RNA molecules can have a profound impact on their stability and biological function. Evidence accumulated over the past few decades has identified roles for polyadenylation in RNA stabilisation, degradation and, in the case of eukaryotic mRNAs, translational competence. By contrast, the biological significance of RNA 3\u2032 modification by uridylation has only recently started to become apparent. The evolutionary origin of eukaryotic RNA terminal uridyltransferases can be traced to an ancestral poly(A) polymerase. Here we review what is currently known about the biological roles of these enzymes, the ways in which their activity is regulated and the consequences of this covalent modification for the target RNA molecule, with a focus on those instances where uridylation has been found to contribute to RNA degradation. Roles for uridylation have been identified in the turnover of mRNAs, pre-microRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs and the products of microRNA-directed mRNA cleavage; many mature microRNAs are also modified by uridylation, though the consequences in this case are currently less well understood. In the case of piwi-interacting RNAs, modification of the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide by the HEN1 methyltransferase blocks uridylation and so stabilises the small RNA. The extent to which other uridylation-dependent mechanisms of RNA decay are similarly regulated awaits further investigation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA Decay mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation is a crucial step for coordinating immune responses. Post-transcriptional mechanisms exquisitely control inflammation by increasing or decreasing both the stability of mRNAs and the efficiency of protein translation. Regulatory RNase 1 (Regnase-1, also known as Zc3h12a or MCPIP1) was identified as a novel protein harboring a CCCH-type zinc-finger domain and a PIN-like RNase domain. Regnase-1 mRNA expression is induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and MCP-1. Regnase-1 destabilizes mRNAs encoding immune related proteins including IL-6 and IL-12p40 via their 3\u2032 untranslated regions. In Regnase-1-deficient (\u2212/\u2212) macrophages, IL-6 is overproduced in response to LPS because Il6 mRNA is stabilized because of Regnase-1 deficiency. Regnase-1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed severe systemic inflammation, characterized by production of autoantibodies. It is now known that Regnase-1 protein expression is dynamically regulated during the course of inflammation. Upon IL-1\u03b2 and TLR stimulation, Regnase-1 is rapidly phosphorylated by I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) and degraded via ubiquitin\u2013proteasome machinery. Regnase-1 degradation allows Il6 mRNA to be expressed rapidly and robustly upon stimulation. Furthermore, Regnase-1 destabilizes its own mRNA, thereby preventing excessive translation of Regnase-1 and degradation of cytokine-encoding mRNAs. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism of Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay and describe the mechanism by which Regnase-1 is tightly regulated in innate immune cells.

     "abstract": "mRNA regulation is essential in germ cells and early embryos. In particular, late oogenesis and early embryogenesis occur in the absence of transcription and rely on maternal mRNAs stored in oocytes. These maternal mRNAs subsequently undergo a general decay in embryos during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in which the control of development switches from the maternal to the zygotic genome. Regulation of mRNA stability thus plays a key role during these early stages of development and is tightly interconnected with translational regulation and mRNA localization. A common mechanism in these three types of regulation implicates variations in mRNA poly(A) tail length. Recent advances in the control of mRNA stability include the widespread and essential role of regulated deadenylation in early developmental processes, as well as the mechanisms regulating mRNA stability which involve RNA binding proteins, microRNAs and interplay between the two. Also emerging are the roles that other classes of small non-coding RNAs, endo-siRNAs and piRNAs play in the control of mRNA decay, including connections between the regulation of transposable elements and cellular mRNA regulation through the piRNA pathway.

Furthermore, there are several types of RNA granules, many of which are sites of mRNA degradation; these are frequently found associated with membrane-bound organelles such as endosomes and mitochondria.

Here, we present the results of an extensive review of the literature revealing that the post-translational modification (PTM) of chaperones has been selected during evolution as an efficient mean to regulate the activity and specificity of these key proteins. Because the addition and reciprocal removal of chemical groups can be triggered very rapidly, this mechanism provides an efficient switch to precisely regulate the activity of chaperones on specific substrates. The large number of PTMs detected in chaperones suggests that a combinatory code is at play to regulate function, activity, localization, and substrate specificity for this group of biologically important proteins.

In the present study, we report the identification of a novel Dazl isoform (Dazl_\u03948) that results from alternative splicing of exon8 of mouse Dazl. We observed the expression of Dazl_\u03948 in various pluripotent cell types, but not in somatic cells. Furthermore, the Dazl_\u03948 splice variant was expressed along with the full-length isoform of Dazl (Dazl_FL) throughout male germ-cell development and in the ovary. Sub-cellular localization studies of Dazl_\u03948 revealed a diffused cytoplasmic and large granular pattern, which is similar to the localization patterns of Dazl_FL protein. In contrast to the well documented translation stimulation function in germ cells, overexpression and downregulation studies of Dazl isoforms (Dazl_FL and Dazl_\u03948) revealed a role for Dazl in the negative translational regulation of Mvh, a known target of Dazl, as well as Oct3/4 and Sox2 in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In line with these observations, a luciferase reporter assay with the 3\u2032UTRs of Oct3/4 and Mvh confirmed the translational repressive role of Dazl isoforms in ESCs but not in germ cells derived cell line GC-1. Further, we identified several putative target mRNAs of Dazl_FL and Dazl_\u03948 in ESCs through RNA-binding immunoprecipitation followed by whole genome transcriptome analysis.

Genetic and molecular evidence suggests that expression of HNF-4\u03b1 is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Activation of HNF-4A gene involves the interaction of distinct sets of transcription factors and co-transcription factors within enhancer and promoter regions. Here we study the inhibitory effect of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of HNF-4A mRNA. The potential recognition elements of a set of miRNAs were identified utilizing bioinformatics analysis. The family members of miR-34 and miR-449, including miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a, share the same target elements located at two distinct locations within the 3\u2032-UTR of HNF-4A. The over-expression of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p or miR-449a in HepG2 cells led to a significant decrease in the activity of luciferase reporter carrying 3\u2032-UTR of HNF-4A. The repressive effect on reporter activity was partially or fully eliminated when one or two of the binding site(s) for miR-34a/miR-34c-5p/miR-449a were deleted within the 3\u2032-UTR. The protein level of HNF-4\u03b1 was dramatically reduced by over-expression of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a, which correlates with a decrease in the binding activity of HNF-4\u03b1 and transactivation of HNF-4\u03b1 target genes. These results suggest that the recognition sites of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a within 3\u2032-UTR of HNF-4A are functional. The mechanism of down-regulation of the binding activity and transactivation of HNF-4\u03b1 by the miRNAs involves the decrease in HNF-4\u03b1 protein level via miRNAs selectively targeting HNF-4A 3\u2032-UTR, leading to the translational repression of HNF-4\u03b1 expression.",

As a consequence of such competition, we observed that \u03b1-tubulin, a substrate of two up-regulated proteases, granzyme B and granzyme M, was rapidly degraded at the protein level upon siRNA transfection.

To investigate the role of the RNA binding protein KSRP in controlling neural differentiation, we used the P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line that is able to differentiate into neuron-like cells under appropriate culture conditions. We have recently reported that KSRP controls the differentiative fate of multipotent mesenchymal cells owing to its ability to promote decay of unstable transcripts and to favor maturation of selected micro-RNAs (miRNAs) from precursors. Here we report that KSRP silencing in P19 cells favors neural differentiation increasing the expression of neuronal markers. Further, the expression of two master transcriptional regulators of neurogenesis, ASCL1 and JMJD3, was enhanced while the maturation of miR-200 family members from precursors was impaired in KSRP knockdown cells. These molecular changes can contribute to the reshaping of P19 cells transcriptome that follows KSRP silencing. Our data suggests that KSRP function is required to maintain P19 cells in a multipotent undifferentiated state and that its inactivation can orient cells towards neural differentiation.",

     "abstract": "More than 70% of breast cancers in women require estrogens for cell proliferation and survival. 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) effect on mammary target cells is almost exclusively mediated by its binding to the estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) that joins chromatin where it assembles active transcription complexes. The proliferative and pro-survival action of estrogens is antagonized in most cases by retinoic acid (RA), even though the cognate retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 (RAR\u03b1) cooperates with ER\u03b1 on promoters of estrogen-responsive genes.We have examined at the molecular level the crosstalk between these nuclear receptors from the point of view of their control of cell growth and show here that RA reverts estrogen-stimulated transcription of the pivotal anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene by preventing demethylation of dimethyl lysine 9 in histone H3 (HeK9me2). As we previously reported, this is obtained by means of E2-triggered activation of the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an enzyme that manages chromatin plasticity in order to allow specific movements of chromosomal regions within the nucleus. We find that E2 fuels LSD1 by inducing migration of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) into the nucleus, where it targets estrogen-responsive loci. RA rescues LSD1-dependent disappearance of H3K9me2 at bcl-2 regulatory regions upon the prevention of PKA assembly to the same sites.",

The TFIIB-like general transcription factors (GTFs) function during several important and conserved steps in the initiation pathway for Pols II, III, and archaeal Pol. Until recently, the mechanism of Pol I initiation seemed unique, since it appeared to lack a GTF paralogous to the TFIIB-like proteins. The surprising recent discovery of TFIIB-related Pol I general factors in yeast and humans highlights the evolutionary conservation of transcription initiation mechanisms for all eukaryotic and archaeal Pols. These findings reveal new roles for the function of the Pol I GTFs and insight into the function of TFIIB-related factors. Models for Pol I transcription initiation are reexamined in light of these recent findings. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcription by Odd Pols.",

The TFIIIA protein, found in every organism, has been characterized in several species. It shows remarkably poor conservation of primary protein sequence, but all orthologues analyzed carry several C2H2-zinc fingers that are required for TFIIIA binding to both 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and RNA (rRNA). Alignments of TFIIIA protein and 5S rRNA gene sequences suggest a parallel evolution of the transcription factor and its natural binding site, the internal control region of the 5S rRNA gene.

     "abstract": "RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a multitude of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes as well as other small RNA genes distributed through the genome. By being sequence-specific, precise and efficient, transcription termination by pol III not only defines the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA which directs subsequent association with the stabilizing La protein, it also prevents transcription into downstream DNA and promotes efficient recycling. Each of the RNA polymerases appears to have evolved unique mechanisms to initiate the process of termination in response to different types of termination signals. However, in eukaryotes much less is known about the final stage of termination, destabilization of the elongation complex with release of the RNA and DNA from the polymerase active center. By comparison to pols I and II, pol III exhibits the most direct coupling of the initial and final stages of termination, both of which occur at a short oligo(dT) tract on the non-template strand (dA on the template) of the DNA. While pol III termination is autonomous involving the core subunits C2 and probably C1, it also involves subunits C11, C37 and C53, which act on the pol III catalytic center and exhibit homology to the pol II elongation factor TFIIS and TFIIF\u03b1/\u03b2 respectively. Here we compile knowledge of pol III termination and associate mutations that affect this process with structural elements of the polymerase that illustrate the importance of C53/37 both at its docking site on the pol III lobe and in the active center. The models suggest that some of these features may apply to the other eukaryotic pols. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcription by Odd Pols.",

     "abstract": "The retention of transcription proteins at an actively transcribed gene contributes to maintenance of the active transcriptional state and increases the rate of subsequent transcription cycles relative to the initial cycle. This process, called transcription reinitiation, generates the abundant RNAs in living cells. The persistence of stable preinitiation intermediates on activated genes representing at least a subset of basal transcription components has long been recognized as a shared feature of RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II and III-dependent transcription in eukaryotes. Studies of the Pol III transcription machinery and its target genes in eukaryotic genomes over the last fifteen years, has uncovered multiple details on transcription reinitiation. In addition to the basal transcription factors that recruit the polymerase, Pol III itself can be retained on the same gene through multiple transcription cycles by a facilitated recycling pathway. The molecular bases for facilitated recycling are progressively being revealed with advances in structural and functional studies. At the same time, progress in our understanding of Pol III transcriptional regulation in response to different environmental cues points to the specific mechanism of Pol III reinitiation as a key target of signaling pathway regulation of cell growth.

Diseases caused by loss of function mutations in the molecular constituents of the ribosome, or factors intimately associated with RNA polymerase I transcription and processing are collectively termed ribosomopathies. Ribosomopathies are generally rare and treatment options are extremely limited tending to be more palliative than curative. Other more common diseases are associated with profound changes in cellular growth such as cardiac hypertrophy, atrophy or cancer. In contrast to ribosomopathies, altered RNA polymerase I transcriptional activity in these diseases largely results from dysregulated upstream oncogenic pathways or by direct modulation by oncogenes or tumor suppressors at the level of the RNA polymerase I transcription apparatus itself. Ribosomopathies associated with mutations in ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNA processing or assembly factors have been covered by recent excellent reviews. In contrast, here we review our current knowledge of human diseases specifically associated with dysregulation of RNA polymerase I transcription and its associated regulatory apparatus, including some cases where this dysregulation is directly causative in disease. We will also provide insight into and discussion of possible therapeutic approaches to treat patients with dysregulated RNA polymerase I transcription.

The phosphorylation status of Maf1 determines its nuclear localization and interaction with the Pol III complex and several Maf1 kinases have been identified to be involved in Pol III control.

In addition to its canonical roles in cell cycle control, RB functions as a global repressor of RNA polymerase (Pol) III transcription. Indeed, Pol III transcripts accumulate in cancer cells and their heightened levels are implicated in accelerated growth associated with RB dysfunction. Herein we review the mechanisms of RB repression for the different types of Pol III genes. For type 1 and type 2 genes, RB represses transcription through direct contacts with the core transcription machinery, notably Brf1\u2013TFIIIB, and inhibits preinitiation complex formation and Pol III recruitment. A contrasting model for type 3 gene repression indicates that RB regulation involves stable and simultaneous promoter association by RB, the general transcription machinery including SNAPc, and Pol III, suggesting that RB may impede Pol III promoter escape or elongation. Interestingly, analysis of published genomic association data for RB and Pol III revealed added regulatory complexity for Pol III genes both during active growth and during arrested growth associated with quiescence and senescence.

     "abstract": "tRNA genes (tDNAs) have been known to have barrier insulator function in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for over a decade. tDNAs also play a role in genome organization by clustering at sites in the nucleus and both of these functions are dependent on the transcription factor TFIIIC. More recently TFIIIC bound sites devoid of pol III, termed Extra-TFIIIC sites (ETC) have been identified in budding yeast and these sites also function as insulators and affect genome organization. Subsequent studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that TFIIIC bound sites were insulators and also functioned as Chromosome Organization Clamps (COC); tethering the sites to the nuclear periphery. Very recently studies have moved to mammalian systems where pol III genes and their associated factors have been investigated in both mouse and human cells. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) that bind TFIIIC, function as insulator elements and tDNAs can also function as both enhancer \u2014 blocking and barrier insulators in these organisms. It was also recently shown that tDNAs cluster with other tDNAs and with ETCs but not with pol II transcribed genes. Intriguingly, TFIIIC is often found near pol II transcription start sites and it remains unclear what the consequences of TFIIIC based genomic organization are and what influence pol III factors have on pol II transcribed genes and vice versa.

In Escherichia coli RNAP, a bulky hydrophobic segment near the N-terminal end of the bridge helix is identified (\u03b2\u2032 772-YFI-774; the YFI motif). YFI is located at a distance from the active center and adjacent to a glycine hinge (\u03b2\u2032 778-GARKG-782) involved in dynamic bending of the bridge helix. Remarkably, amino acid substitutions in YFI significantly alter intrinsic termination, pausing, fidelity and translocation of RNAP. F773V RNAP largely ignores the \u03bb tR2 terminator at 200\u00a0\u03bcM NTPs and is strongly reduced in \u03bb tR2 recognition at 1\u00a0\u03bcM NTPs. F773V alters RNAP pausing and backtracking and favors misincorporation. By contrast, the adjacent Y772A substitution increases fidelity and exhibits other transcriptional defects generally opposite to those of F773V. All atom molecular dynamics simulation revealed two separate functional connections emanating from YFI explaining the distinct effects of substitutions: Y772 communicates with the active site through the link domain in the \u03b2 subunit, whereas F773 communicates through the fork domain in the \u03b2 subunit.

PICKLE codes for a putative ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that exhibits sequence similarity to members of subfamily II of animal CHD remodelers, which includes remodelers such as CHD3/Mi-2 that also restrict expression of developmental regulators. Whereas animal CHD3 remodelers are a component of the Mi-2/NuRD complex that promotes histone deacetylation, PICKLE promotes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 suggesting that it acts via a distinct epigenetic pathway. Here, we examine whether PICKLE is also a member of a multisubunit complex and characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant PICKLE protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PICKLE-related proteins in plants share a common ancestor with members of subfamily II of animal CHD remodelers. Biochemical characterization of PICKLE in planta, however, reveals that PICKLE primarily exists as a monomer. Recombinant PICKLE protein is an ATPase that is stimulated by ssDNA and mononucleosomes and binds to both naked DNA and mononucleosomes. Furthermore, recombinant PICKLE exhibits ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity.

     "abstract": "A study is presented on the regulation of alternative splicing (AS) of the Ndufb11 gene of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the impact on this process of rotenone treatment in neuroblastoma cells. In physiological conditions the Ndufb11 gene produces at high level a short transcript isoform encoding for a 153 aa protein. This subunit is essential for the assembly of a functional and stable mammalian complex I. The gene produces also, at low level, a longer transcript isoform encoding for a 163 aa protein whose role is unknown. Evidence is presented here showing that the level of the two isoforms is regulated by three DGGGD ESS elements located in exon 2 which can bind the hnRNPH1 protein. In neuronal cells rotenone treatment affects the Ndufb11 alternative splicing pathway, with the increase of the 163/153 mRNAs ratio. This effect appears to be due to the down-regulation of the hnRNPH1 protein. Since rotenone induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, the post-transcriptional regulation of the Ndufb11 gene can be involved in the programmed cell death process.",

Here we identified a Pseudomonas putida RNA polymerases-associated protein as a homolog of Escherichia coli RapA. We found that P. putida RapA stimulates the transcription from promoters dependent on a variety of \u03c3-factors (\u03c370, \u03c3S, \u03c354, \u03c332, \u03c3E) in vitro. The level of stimulation varied from 2- to 10-fold, with the maximal effect observed with the \u03c3E-dependent PhtrA promoter. Stimulation by RapA was apparent in the multi-round reactions and was modulated by salt concentration in vitro. However, in contrast to findings with E. coli RapA, P. putida RapA-mediated stimulation of transcription was also evident using linear templates. These properties of P. putida RapA were apparent using either E. coli- or P. putida-derived RNA polymerases. Analysis of individual steps of transcription revealed that P. putida RapA enhances the stability of competitor-resistant open-complexes formed by RNA polymerase at promoters. In vivo, P. putida RapA can complement the inhibitory effect of high salt on growth of an E. coli RapA null strain. However, a P. putida RapA null mutant was not sensitive to high salt. The in vivo effects of lack of RapA were only detectable for the \u03c3E-PhtrA promoter where the RapA-deficiency resulted in lower activity. The presented characteristics of P. putida RapA indicate that its functions may extend beyond a role in facilitating RNA polymerase recycling to include a role in transcription initiation efficiency.",

The interaction of neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) with this motif was later indicated via gel mobility shift and ChIP assays. The silencing activity of NRSF was confirmed by over-expression and also by shRNA knock-down of endogenous NRSF. These studies showed an inverse relationship between the expression levels of NRSF and hSCTR in the cells. As hSCTR gene was previously shown to be controlled by two GC-boxes which are regulated by the ratio of Sp1 to Sp3, in the present study, the functional interactions of NRSF and Sp proteins to regulate hSCTR gene was investigated. By co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found that NRSF could be co-precipitated with Sp1 as well as Sp3 in PANC-1 cells. Interestingly, co-expressions of these factors showed that NRSF could suppress Sp1-mediated, but not Sp3-mediated, transactivation of hSCTR. Taken together, we propose here that the down-regulatory effects of NRSF on hSCTR gene expression are mediated via its suppression on Sp1-mediated transactivation.",

In this study, we found that miR-145 was significantly downregulated in the plasma and cancer tumor tissues of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, and overexpression of miR-145 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. To understand the potential mechanism of miR-145 in inhibiting tumor growth, we showed that miR-145 blocked the activation of AKT and ERK1/2 pathways, and the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF via directly targeting N-RAS and IRS1, and VEGF is an important effector for tumor growth. Forced expression of N-RAS and IRS1 restored VEGF expression via transcriptional activation. MiR-145 also inhibited N-RAS and IRS1 expression to suppress AKT and ERK1/2 activation, and VEGF expression in mouse xenograft tumors.

     "abstract": "Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and all RNA polymerases for that matter, may be understood as comprising two cycles. The first cycle relates to the basic mechanism of the transcription process wherein Pol II must select the appropriate nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrate complementary to the DNA template, catalyze phosphodiester bond formation, and translocate to the next position on the DNA template. Performing this cycle in an iterative fashion allows the synthesis of RNA chains that can be over one million nucleotides in length in some larger eukaryotes. Overlaid upon this enzymatic cycle, transcription may be divided into another cycle of three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. Each of these phases has a large number of associated transcription factors that function to promote or regulate the gene expression process. Complicating matters, each phase of the latter transcription cycle are coincident with cotranscriptional RNA processing events. Additionally, transcription takes place within a highly dynamic and regulated chromatin environment. This chromatin environment is radically impacted by active transcription and associated chromatin modifications and remodeling, while also functioning as a major platform for Pol II regulation. This review will focus on our basic knowledge of the Pol II transcription mechanism, and how altered Pol II activity impacts gene expression in vivo in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Moderate-level transcription of eukaryotic genes by Pol II is accompanied by nucleosome survival, extensive exchange of histones H2A/H2B and minimal exchange of histones H3/H4. Complementary in vitro studies have shown that transcription through chromatin by single Pol II complexes is uniquely coupled with nucleosome survival via formation of a small intranucleosomal DNA loop (\u00d8-loop) containing the transcribing enzyme. In contrast, transient displacement and exchange of all core histones are observed during intense transcription. Indeed, multiple transcribing Pol II complexes can efficiently overcome the high nucleosomal barrier and displace the entire histone octamer in vitro. Thus, various Pol II complexes can remodel chromatin to different extents.

Our aims were to determine whether let-7 miRNA directly regulates Bach1, a transcriptional repressor of the HMOX1 gene, and whether indirect up-regulation of HMOX1 by let-7 miRNA attenuates oxidant injury in human hepatocytes. The effects of let-7 miRNA on Bach1 and HMOX1 gene expression in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells were determined by real-time qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase reporter assays. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that let-7b, let-7c, or miR-98 significantly decreased Bach1 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR)-dependent luciferase activity but not mutant Bach1 3\u2032-UTR-dependent luciferase activity, whereas mutant let-7 miRNA containing base complementarity with mutant Bach1 3\u2032-UTR restored its effect on mutant reporter activity. let-7b, let-7c, or miR-98 down-regulated Bach1 protein levels by 50\u201370%, and subsequently up-regulated HMOX1 gene expression by 3\u20134 fold, compared with non-specific controls. Furthermore, Huh-7 cells transfected with let-7b, let-7c or miR-98 mimic showed increased resistance against oxidant injury induced by tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (tBuOOH), whereas the protection was abrogated by over-expression of Bach1. In conclusion, let-7 miRNA directly acts on the 3\u2032-UTR of Bach1 and negatively regulates expression of this protein, and thereby up-regulates HMOX1 gene expression. Over-expression of the let-7 miRNA family members may represent a novel approach to protecting human hepatocytes from oxidant injury.",

In various non-neuronal cells, mGluR1 expression is regulated via binding of Neuron-Restrictive-Silencer-Factor (NRSF) to a Neuron-Restrictive-Silencer-Element (NRSE). Here, we report on the possibility that aberrant mGluR1 expression in melanoma is due to alterations in NRSF and/or NRSE. We show that in human melanocytes, binding of NRSF to NRSE in the GRM1 promoter region is necessary for the suppression of mGluR1 expression. We also show that inhibiting the expression of the transcription factor Sp1 or interference with its ability to bind DNA can result in increased mGluR1 expression perhaps via its function as a negative regulator. In addition, we also provide evidence that demethylation within the promoter region of GRM1 may also be a mechanism for the derepression of mGluR1 expression in melanocytes that progress to cell transformation and tumor formation.",

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) regulates expression of diverse genes and alters expression of PAI-1 in several types of cells. However, the nature of posttranscriptional regulation of expression of PAI-1 by S1P has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. The present study was undertaken to determine whether S1P has important effects on the posttranscriptional regulation of PAI-1 expression. To evaluate this possibility, we determined promoter activity, mRNA levels, 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) activity, and protein levels of PAI-1 in HepG2 cells. S1P increased PAI-1 promoter activity and the expression of PAI-1 mRNA within 4\u00a0h of exposure. It decreased the expression of PAI-1 mRNA and the accumulation of PAI-1 protein into the media in 24\u00a0h. Human PAI-1 mRNA exists in two subspecies (3.2 and 2.2\u00a0kb). S1P decreased the baseline luciferase activity of the 1\u00a0kb fragment of the 3\u2032 terminus (+\u00a02177 to 3176\u00a0nt) of the 3\u2032-UTR of the 3.2\u00a0kb PAI-1 mRNA [3\u2032-UTR (+\u00a02177\u20133176)]. S1P decreased expression of PAI-1 protein, presumably by regulating PAI-1 expression at the posttranscriptional level thereby affecting mRNA stability. SERPINE1 mRNA binding protein (SERBP1) and ARE3 in the 3\u2032-UTR were involved in the posttranscriptional regulation by S1P. Our data suggest that S1P can destabilize 3.2\u00a0kb PAI-1 mRNA through specific effects on the 3\u2032-UTR. These effects appear to involve SERBP1 leading to decreased expression of PAI-1 protein.",

Both proteins bind to cAMP and TPA response elements and repress transcription by multiple mechanisms. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in gene inactivation by deacetylating lysine residues on histones. Here we describe the association of JDP2 and ATF3 with HDACs 1, 2\u20136 and 10. Association of HDAC3 and HDAC6 with JDP2 and ATF3 occurs via direct protein\u2013protein interactions. Only part of the N-terminal bZIP motif of JDP2 and ATF3 basic domain is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with HDACs in a manner that is independent of coiled-coil dimerization. Class I HDACs associate with the bZIP repressors via the DAC conserved domain whereas the Class IIb HDAC6 associates through its C-terminal unique binder of ubiquitin Zn finger domain. Both JDP2 and ATF3 are known to bind and repress the ATF3 promoter. MEF cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) display enhanced ATF3 transcription. ATF3 enhanced transcription is significantly reduced in MEF cells lacking both ATF3 and JDP2. Collectively, we propose that the recruitment of multiple HDAC members to JDP2 and ATF3 is part of their transcription repression mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released to the extracellular milieu through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. These vesicles contain microRNAs and might therefore be vehicles transferring genetic information between cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In addition, microRNAs in PC-3 cells and in the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1 were compared. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media from PC-3 cells by ultracentrifugation and inspected by electron microscopy. Total RNA was isolated and microRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and real time RT-PCR. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that the microRNA profile of PC-3 released exosomes was similar to the profile of the corresponding parent cells. Nevertheless, a sorting of certain microRNAs into exosomes was observed, and low number microRNAs (microRNAs with a low number in their name) were found to be underrepresented in these vesicles. Moreover, the miRNA profile of PC-3 cells resembled the miRNA profile of RWPE-1 cells, though some miRNAs were found to be differently expressed in these cell lines. These results show that exosomes from PC-3 cells, in agreement with previous reports from other cell types, contain microRNAs. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that there is a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes and adds a new perspective by pointing at the underrepresentation of low number miRNAs in PC-3 released exosomes.",

However, the factors that regulate its expression are not well understood. Loss as well as gain-of-function p53 mutations up-regulate STMN1 and in acute myelogenous leukemia where p53 is predominantly wild\u2010type, STMN1 is also over-expressed. Here we show regulatory control of STMN1 expression by the leucine zipper transcription factor (TF) CREB1 and the basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix TF LYL1. By ChIP-chip experiments we demonstrate in vivo the presence of LYL1 and CREB1 in close proximity on the STMN1 promoter and using promoter assays we reveal co-regulation of STMN1 by CREB1 and LYL1. By contrast, TAL1, another suspected oncoprotein in leukemia and close relative of LYL1, exerts no regulatory effect on the STMN1 promoter. NLI, LMO2 and GATA2 are previously described co-activators of Tal1/Lyl1-E47 transcriptional complexes and potentiate Lyl1 activation of the STMN1 promoter while having no effect on TAL1 transactivation. Promoter mutations that abrogate CREB1 proximal binding or mutations of the DNA-binding domain of CREB1 abolish LYL1 transcriptional activation. These results show that CRE and Ebox sites function as coordinated units and support previous evidence of joint CREB1-and LYL1 transcription events activating an aberrant subset of promoters in leukemia. CREB1 or LYL1 shRNA knock-down down-regulate STMN1 expression. Because down-regulation of STMN1 has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects, while CREB1 and LYL1 are suspected oncoproteins, interference with CREB1\u2013LYL1 interactions may complement standard chemotherapy and yield additional beneficial effects.",

Despite the clear involvement of CDKL5 mutations in intellectual disability, the function of this protein during brain development and the molecular mechanisms involved in its regulation are still unknown. Using human neuroblastoma cells as a model system we found that an increase in CDKL5 expression caused an arrest of the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phases and induced cellular differentiation. Interestingly, CDKL5 expression was inhibited by MYCN, a transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation during brain development and plays a relevant role in neuroblastoma biology. Through a combination of different and complementary molecular and cellular approaches we could show that MYCN acts as a direct repressor of the CDKL5 promoter. Overall our findings unveil a functional axis between MYCN and CDKL5 governing both neuron proliferation rate and differentiation. The fact that CDKL5 is involved in the control of both neuron proliferation and differentiation may help understand the early appearance of neurological symptoms in patients with mutations in CDKL5.",

It is a member of DEAH-box protein family with nine collinear sequence motifs, a characteristic of helicase proteins. Experiments with the recombinantly expressed and purified PfPrp16 helicase domain revealed binding to RNA, hydrolysis of ATP as well as catalytic helicase activities. Expression of helicase domain with the C-terminal helicase-associated domain (HA2) reduced these activities considerably, indicating that the helicase-associated domain may regulate the PfPrp16 function. Localization studies with the PfPrp16 GFP transgenic lines suggested a role of its N\u2010terminal domain (1\u201380 amino acids) in nuclear targeting. Immunodepletion of PfPrp16p, from nuclear extracts of parasite cultures, blocked the second catalytic step of an in vitro constituted splicing reaction suggesting a role for PfPrp16p in splicing catalysis. Further we show by complementation assay in yeast that a chimeric yeast-Plasmodium Prp16 protein, not the full length PfPrp16, can rescue the yeast prp16 temperature\u2010sensitive mutant. These results suggest that although the role of Prp16p in catalytic step II is highly conserved among Plasmodium, human and yeast, subtle differences exist with regards to its associated factors or its assembly with spliceosomes.",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that binding of JMJD2B on the cyclin A1 (CCNA1) promoter resulted in CCNA1 upregulation under hypoxic conditions.

Here, we confirm these array data using quantitative ChIP and further detected that \u03b1NAC binds to these promoters in myoblasts. Since these genes are differentially regulated during osteoblastogenesis or myogenesis, these results suggest cell- and promoter-context specific functions for \u03b1NAC. We hypothesized that \u03b1NAC dynamically recruits corepressors to inhibit Myogenin expression in cells committing to the osteoblastic lineage or to inhibit Osteocalcin transcription in differentiating myoblasts. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we detected complexes between \u03b1NAC and the corepressors HDAC1 and HDAC3, in myoblasts and osteoblasts. Sequential ChIP confirmed HDAC1 recruitment by \u03b1NAC at the Osteocalcin and Myogenin promoters. Interaction with the corepressors was detectable in pre-osteoblasts and in myoblasts but disappeared as the cells differentiate. Treatment with an HDAC inhibitor caused de-repression of Osteocalcin expression in myoblasts. Overexpression of \u03b1NAC in myoblasts inhibits expression of Myogenin and differentiation. However, overexpression of an N-terminus truncated \u03b1NAC mutant allowed myoblasts to express Myogenin and differentiate, and this mutant did not interact with HDAC1 or HDAC3.

Defects in normal ATP production due to dysfunctions in mitochondrial gene expression are responsible for many mitochondrial and aging related disorders. Mitochondria carry their own DNA genome which is transcribed by relatively simple transcriptional machinery consisting of the mitochondrial RNAP (mtRNAP) and one or more transcription factors. The mtRNAPs are remarkably similar in sequence and structure to single-subunit bacteriophage T7 RNAP but they require accessory transcription factors for promoter-specific initiation. Comparison of the mechanisms of T7 RNAP and mtRNAP provides a framework to better understand how mtRNAP and the transcription factors work together to facilitate promoter selection, DNA melting, initiating nucleotide binding, and promoter clearance. This review focuses primarily on the mechanistic characterization of transcription initiation by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mtRNAP (Rpo41) and its transcription factor (Mtf1) drawing insights from the homologous T7 and the human mitochondrial transcription systems.

This process is accomplished, with the help of several accessory proteins, by the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT, also known as h-mtRNAP), a nuclear-encoded single-subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRp or RNAP) that is distantly related to the bacteriophage T7 class of single-subunit RNAPs. In addition to its role in transcription, POLRMT serves as the primase for mitochondrial DNA replication. Therefore, this enzyme is of fundamental importance for both expression and replication of the human mitochondrial genome. Over the past several years rapid progress has occurred in understanding POLRMT and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription. Important accomplishments include development of recombinant systems that reconstitute human mitochondrial transcription in vitro, determination of the X-ray crystal structure of POLRMT, identification of distinct mechanisms for promoter recognition and transcription initiation, elucidation of the kinetic mechanism for POLRMT-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation and discovery of unique mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription inhibition including the realization that POLRMT is an off target for antiviral ribonucleoside analogs.

All the components needed for transcription and replication of the mtDNA are, therefore, encoded in the nuclear genome, as are the remaining components of the OXPHOS system and the mitochondrial translation machinery. Regulation of mtDNA gene expression is very important for modulating the OXPHOS capacity in response to metabolic requirements and in pathological processes. The combination of in vitro and in vivo studies has allowed the identification of the core machinery required for basal mtDNA transcription in mammals and a few proteins that regulate mtDNA transcription. Specifically, the generation of knockout mouse strains in the last several years, has been key to understanding the basis of mtDNA transcription in vivo. However, it is well accepted that many components of the transcription machinery are still unknown and little is known about mtDNA gene expression regulation under different metabolic requirements or disease processes. In this review we will focus on how the creation of knockout mouse models and the study of their phenotypes have contributed to the understanding of mitochondrial transcription in mammals.

     "abstract": "How mitochondria process DNA damage and whether a change in the steady-state level of mitochondrial DNA damage (mtDNA) contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction are questions that fuel burgeoning areas of research into aging and disease pathogenesis. Over the past decade, researchers have identified and measured various forms of endogenous and environmental mtDNA damage and have elucidated mtDNA repair pathways. Interestingly, mitochondria do not appear to contain the full range of DNA repair mechanisms that operate in the nucleus, although mtDNA contains types of damage that are targets of each nuclear DNA repair pathway. The reduced repair capacity may, in part, explain the high mutation frequency of the mitochondrial chromosome. Since mtDNA replication is dependent on transcription, mtDNA damage may alter mitochondrial gene expression at three levels: by causing DNA polymerase \u03b3 nucleotide incorporation errors leading to mutations, by interfering with the priming of mtDNA replication by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, or by inducing transcriptional mutagenesis or premature transcript termination. This review summarizes our current knowledge of mtDNA damage, its repair, and its effects on mtDNA integrity and gene expression.

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome encodes a very small fraction of the macromolecular components that are required to generate functional mitochondria. Therefore, most components are encoded within the nuclear genome and are imported into mitochondria from the cytosol. Understanding how mitochondria are assembled, function, and dysfunction in diseases requires detailed knowledge of mitochondrial import mechanisms and pathways. The import of nucleus-encoded RNAs is required for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, but unlike pre-protein import, the pathways and cellular machineries of RNA import are poorly defined, especially in mammals. Recent studies have shown that mammalian polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPASE) localizes in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to regulate the import of RNA. The identification of PNPASE as the first component of the RNA import pathway, along with a growing list of nucleus-encoded RNAs that are imported and newly developed assay systems for RNA import studies, suggest a unique opportunity is emerging to identify the factors and mechanisms that regulate RNA import into mammalian mitochondria. Here we summarize what is known in this fascinating area of mitochondrial biogenesis, identify areas that require further investigation, and speculate on the impact unraveling RNA import mechanisms and pathways will have for the field going forward.

Release of tRNAs from these precursors is thus not only required to produce functional adaptors for translation, but also responsible for the maturation of other mitochondrial RNA species. Cleavage of mitochondrial tRNAs appears to be exclusively accomplished by endonucleases. 5\u2032-end maturation in the mitochondria of different Eukarya is achieved by various kinds of RNase P, representing the full range of diversity found in this enzyme family. While ribonucleoprotein enzymes with RNA components of bacterial-like appearance are found in a few unrelated protists, algae, and fungi, highly degenerate RNAs of dramatic size variability are found in the mitochondria of many fungi. The majority of mitochondrial RNase P enzymes, however, appear to be pure protein enzymes. Human mitochondrial RNase P, the first to be identified and possibly the prototype of all animal mitochondrial RNases P, is composed of three proteins. Homologs of its nuclease subunit MRPP3/PRORP, are also found in plants, algae and several protists, where they are apparently responsible for RNase P activity in mitochondria (and beyond) without the help of extra subunits. The diversity of RNase P enzymes is contrasted by the uniformity of mitochondrial RNases Z, which are responsible for 3\u2032-end processing. Only the long form of RNase Z, which is restricted to eukarya, is found in mitochondria, even when an additional short form is present in the same organism. Mitochondrial tRNA processing thus appears dominated by new, eukaryal inventions rather than bacterial heritage. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Gene Expression.",

Other critical mitochondrial functions include apoptosis and free-radical production. Chemical agents, including those found in the modern pharmacopeia, may impair mitochondrial function by a number of mechanisms. The mitochondria are vulnerable to environmental injury because of their complex physical structure, electrochemical properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), dual genetic control from both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) and inherent properties of the translational and transcriptional machinery. Mitochondria have evolved from alpha-proteobacteria and the residual structural similarity to bacterial translational machinery has left the mtDNA genes vulnerable to inhibition by commonly used translation-targeted antibiotics. Many of these medications cause adverse effects in otherwise healthy people, but there are also examples where particular gene mutations may predispose to increased drug toxicity. It is hoped that preclinical pharmacogenetic and functional studies of mitochondrial toxicity, along with personalized genomic medicine, will improve both our understanding of the spectrum of disease caused by inhibition of mitochondrial translation and improve the safe and effective use of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial and human mitochondrial translation.

These range from embryonic lethality and severe respiratory chain deficiency to relatively mild mitochondrial defects seen only under conditions of physiological stress.

In addition, recent evidence suggests that PGC-1 coactivators may balance the cellular response to oxidant stress by promoting a pro-oxidant environment or by orchestrating an inflammatory response to severe metabolic stress.

All of these proteins show a relatively high degree of sequence conservation across the animal and plant kingdoms. The essential Drosophila melanogaster GAGA factor (dGAF) interacts with these two types of CAP to regulate homeobox genes and thus contributes to a wide range of developmental events. Surprisingly, however, it is not conserved in plants. In this review, following an overview of fly GAF functions, we discuss the role of plant BBR/BPC proteins.

The expression of the Drosha, Dgcr8, Exportin 5, Dicer, Ago1, Ago2, Ago3, Ago4 and Ago5 genes was downregulated from the zygotic cleavage stage, except for the increase of Ago1, Ago3 and Ago4 expression in the 2-cell embryo, and of Ago2 in 4- and 8-cell embryos. These findings suggest that the capacity to process miRNAs, by the considered canonical pathway, diminishes after fertilization, primarily reducing miRNA activity in the later stages of preimplantation development. However, by analyzing the different precursor and mature forms of specific miRNAs that are abundantly expressed in the blastocyst, such as miR-292-3p and miR-292-5p, we identified miRNA-duplexes and/or miRNAs bound to target mRNAs that may serve as potential stockpiles of miRNAs.

     "abstract": "The promoters of genes which regulate entry into and progress through mitosis are typically induced maximally in G2 by transcription factors that include B-Myb and FoxM1. As FoxM1 gene transcription is a target of B-Myb, we investigated in this study how these transcription factors functionally interact to regulate these G2/M genes. Using a 3T3 cell line containing floxed B-myb alleles (B-mybF/F) that could be conditionally deleted by Cre recombinase, we confirmed that B-myb knockout caused both decreased mRNA expression of several G2/M genes, including FoxM1, and delayed entry into mitosis. Although FoxM1 protein expression was actually unaffected by B-myb knockout when quiescent B-mybF/F 3T3 cells re-entered the cell cycle upon serum-stimulation, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that FoxM1 binding to G2/M promoters was substantially reduced. FoxM1 transcriptional activity requires sequential phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinases and Plk1, which are B-Myb target genes, and we found that phosphorylation at Plk1-specific sites was somewhat reduced upon B-myb knockout. Neither this effect nor nuclear accumulation of FoxM1, which was unaffected by B-myb knockout, was sufficient to account for the dependence on B-Myb for FoxM1 promoter binding, however. More significantly, assays using paired Birc5 (survivin) promoter-luciferase reporters with either wild-type or mutated Myb binding sites showed that FoxM1 was unable to bind and activate the promoter in the absence of B-Myb binding. Our data suggest that B-Myb is required as a pioneer factor to enable FoxM1 binding to G2/M gene promoters and explains how these transcription factors may collaborate to induce mitosis.",

Here, we show that Car1 mRNA decreases significantly when erythroid differentiation is induced in MEL cells. The Ldb1 protein complex including GATA1/SCL/LMO2 binds to the Car1 promoter in uninduced cells and reduced enrichment of the complex during differentiation correlates with loss of Car1 expression. Knockdown of Ldb1 results in a reduction of Ser2 phosphorylated RNA Pol II and Cdk9 at the Car1 promoter region, suggesting that Ldb1 is required for recruitment of Pol II as well as the transcription regulator P-TEFb to enhance elongation of Car1 transcripts. Taken together, these data show that Ldb1 forms a regulatory complex to maintain Car1 expression in erythroid cells.",

We find that four of the zinc fingers in the DNA binding domain are essential for function but the DNA binding domain does not contribute to the metal discrimination by dMTF-1. We find that the conserved C-terminus of the cysteine-rich domain provides cadmium specificity while copper specificity maps to the previously described copper-binding region (Chen et al.).

As virtually all DNA transactions are in turn affected by the torsional state of DNA, these changes have the potential to serve as regulatory signals detected by protein partners. This two-way relationship indicates that DNA dynamics may contribute to the regulation of many events occurring during cell life.

We define such a set of overlapping positions as a \u201cposition cluster\u201d, and the 5S RNA gene positioning sequence is presented as an example. The notable exception is the synthetic 601-sequence, which can position a nucleosome perfectly in vitro, though not in vivo. Many years ago, we demonstrated that nucleosome position clusters are present on the CUP1 and HIS3 genes in native yeast chromatin. Recently, using genome-wide paired-end sequencing of nucleosomes, we have shown that position clusters are the general rule in yeast chromatin, not the exception. We argue that, within a cell population, one of several alternative nucleosomal arrays is formed on each gene. We show how position clusters and alternative arrays can give rise to typical nucleosome occupancy profiles, and that position clusters are disrupted by transcriptional activation. The centromeric nucleosome is a rare example of perfect positioning in vivo. It is, however, a special case, since it contains the centromeric histone H3 variant instead of normal H3. Perfect positioning might be due to centromeric sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. Finally, we point out that the existence of position clusters implies that the putative nucleosome code is degenerate. We suggest that degeneracy might be a crucial point in the debate concerning the code. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Chromatin in time and space.",

Enhancer blocking elements interfere with interaction between an enhancer and promoter when placed between them. We have dissected a compound insulator element found at the 5\u2032 end of the chicken \u03b2-globin locus, which possesses both activities. Barrier insulation is mediated by two kinds of DNA binding proteins: USF1/USF2, a heterodimer which recruits multiple enzyme complexes capable of marking histone on adjacent nucleosomes with \u2018activating\u2019 marks, and Vezf1, which protects against DNA methylation. We have found that the heterochromatic region upstream of the insulator element is maintained in its silent state by a dicer-dependent mechanism, suggesting a mechanism for Vezf1 function in the insulator.Enhancer blocking function in the \u03b2-globin insulator element is conferred by a binding site for CTCF. Consistent with this property, CTCF binding was found some years ago to be essential for imprinted expression at the Igf2/H19 locus. Work in many laboratories has since demonstrated that CTCF helps stabilize long-range interactions in the nucleus. We have recently shown that in the case of the human insulin locus such an interaction, over a distance of ~\u00a0300\u00a0kb, can result in stimulation of a target gene which itself is important for insulin secretion.

The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II. As a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA. Physiological barriers to pol II elongation, such as repressive chromatin structure, can thereby similarly impact splicing decisions. Surprisingly, pre-mRNA splicing can reciprocally influence pol II elongation and chromatin structure.

Over 40 FOX genes have been identified in the mammalian genome. FOX proteins share significant sequence similarities in the DBD which allow them to bind to a consensus DNA response element. However, their modes of action are quite diverse as they regulate gene expression by acting as pioneer factors, transcription factors, or both. This review focuses on the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling with an emphasis on three sub-classes\u2014FOXA, FOXO, and FOXP members. FOXA proteins serve as pioneer factors to open up local chromatin structure and thereby increase accessibility of chromatin to factors regulating transcription. FOXP proteins, in contrast, function as classic transcription factors to recruit a variety of chromatin modifying enzymes to regulate gene expression. FOXO proteins represent a hybrid subclass having dual roles as pioneering factors and transcription factors. A subset of FOX proteins interacts with condensed mitotic chromatin and may function as \u2018bookmarking\u2019 agents to maintain transcriptional competence at specific genomic sites. The overall diversity in chromatin remodeling function by FOX proteins is related to unique structural motifs present within the DBD flanking regions that govern selective interactions with core histones and/or chromatin coregulatory proteins.

Chromatin remodeling is an essential component of SR signaling, and defining the process of chromatin and nucleosome remodeling during signaling is critical to the continued development of related therapies. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a key SR that activates numerous promoters including the well defined MMTV promoter. The activation of MMTV by GR provides an excellent model for teasing apart the sequence of events between hormone treatment and changes in gene expression. Comparing hormone-induced transcription from stably integrated promoters with defined nucleosomal structure to that from transiently expressed, unstructured promoters permits key distinctions between interactions that require remodeling and those that do not. The importance of co-activators and histone modifications prior to remodeling and the formation of the preinitiation complex that follows can also be clarified by defining key transition points in the propagation of hormonal signals. Combined with detailed mapping of proteins along the promoter, a temporal and spatial understanding of the signaling and remodeling processes begins to emerge. In this review, we examine SR signaling with a focus on GR activation of the MMTV promoter. We also discuss the ATP-dependent remodeling complex SWI/SNF, which provides the necessary remodeling activity during GR signaling and interacts with several SRs. BRG1, the central ATPase of SWI/SNF, also interacts with a set of BAF proteins that help determine the specialized function and fine-tuned regulation of BRG1 remodeling activity. BRG1 regulation comes from its own subdomains as well as its interactive partners. In particular, the HSA domain region of BRG1 and unique features of its ATPase homology appear to play key roles in regulating remodeling function. Details of the inter-workings of this chromatin remodeling protein continue to be revealed and promise to improve our understanding of the mechanism of chromatin remodeling during steroid hormone signaling.

In Drosophila, however, telomere specific retrotransposons have been coerced into performing this essential function for the host.

     "abstract": "At the core of chromosome segregation is the centromere, which nucleates the assembly of a macromolecular kinetochore (centromere DNA and associated proteins) complex responsible for mediating spindle attachment. Recent advances in centromere research have led to identification of many kinetochore components, such as the centromeric-specific histone H3 variant, CenH3, and its interacting partner, Scm3. Both are essential for chromosome segregation and are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. CenH3 is proposed to be the epigenetic mark that specifies centromeric identity. Molecular mechanisms that regulate the assembly of kinetochores at specific chromosomal sites to mediate chromosome segregation are not fully understood. In this review, we summarize the current literature and discuss results from our laboratory, which show that restricting the localization of budding yeast CenH3, Cse4, to centromeres and balanced stoichiometry between Scm3 and Cse4, contribute to faithful chromosome transmission. We highlight our findings that, similar to other eukaryotic centromeres, budding yeast centromeric histone H4 is hypoacetylated, and we discuss how altered histone acetylation affects chromosome segregation.

     "abstract": "Chromosomal aneuploidies are a defining feature of carcinomas, i.e., tumors of epithelial origin. Such aneuploidies result in tumor specific genomic copy number alterations. The patterns of genomic imbalances are tumor specific, and to a certain extent specific for defined stages of tumor development. Genomic imbalances occur already in premalignant precursor lesions, i.e., before the transition to invasive disease, and their distribution is maintained in metastases, and in cell lines derived from primary tumors. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that tumor specific genomic imbalances are drivers of malignant transformation. Naturally, this precipitates the question of how such imbalances influence the expression of resident genes. A number of laboratories have systematically integrated copy number alterations with gene expression changes in primary tumors and metastases, cell lines, and experimental models of aneuploidy to address the question as to whether genomic imbalances deregulate the expression of one or few key genes, or rather affect the cancer transcriptome more globally. The majority of these studies showed that gene expression levels follow genomic copy number. Therefore, gross genomic copy number changes, including aneuploidies of entire chromosome arms and chromosomes, result in a massive deregulation of the transcriptome of cancer cells.

In the case of the FXDs, pathology results from expansion of CGG\u2022CCG-repeat tract in the 5\u2032 UTR of the FMR1 gene, while pathology in FRDA results from expansion of a GAA\u2022TTC-repeat in intron 1 of the FXN gene.

In addition, viral genomes are tethered to specific regions of host mitotic chromosomes to efficiently partition their DNA to daughter cells. Vegetative viral DNA replication also initiates at specific regions of host chromatin, where the viral E1 and E2 proteins initiate a DNA damage response that recruits cellular DNA damage and repair proteins to viral replication foci for efficient viral DNA synthesis.

     "abstract": "On the basis of limited information, bacteria were once assumed to have no more than one chromosome. In the era of genomics, it has become clear that some, like eukaryotes, have more than one chromosome. Multichromosome bacteria provide opportunities to investigate how split genomes emerged, whether the individual chromosomes communicate to coordinate their replication and segregation, and what selective advantages split genomes might provide. Our current knowledge of these topics comes mostly from studies in Vibrio cholerae, which has two chromosomes, chr1 and chr2. Chr1 carries out most of the house-keeping functions and is considered the main chromosome, whereas chr2 appears to have originated from a plasmid and has acquired genes of mostly unknown origin and function. Nevertheless, unlike plasmids, chr2 replicates once and only once per cell cycle, like a bona fide chromosome. The two chromosomes replicate and segregate using separate programs, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes. They terminate replication synchronously, suggesting that there might be communication between them. Replication of the chromosomes is affected by segregation genes but in a chromosome specific fashion, a new development in the field of DNA replication control. The split genome allows genome duplication to complete in less time and with fewer replication forks, which could be beneficial for genome maintenance during rapid growth, which is the norm for V. cholerae in broth cultures and in the human host. In the latter, the expression of chr2 genes increases preferentially. Studies of chromosome maintenance in multichromosomal bacteria, although in their infancy, are already broadening our view of chromosome biology.

Unlike the majority of other histone-like proteins, HU is highly conserved in eubacteria and unique in its ability to bind RNA. Furthermore, an HU mutation profoundly alters the cellular transcription profile and consequently has global effects on physiology and the lifestyle of E. coli. Here we provide a short overview of the mechanisms by which the nucleoid is organized into different topological domains. We propose that HU is a major player in creating domain-specific superhelicities and thus influences the transcription profile from the constituent promoters.

     "abstract": "Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the spatial organization of genes and chromosomes. Nuclear organization can be thought of as information that is not encoded in DNA, but which nevertheless impacts gene expression. Nuclear organizational influences can be cell-specific and are potentially heritable. Thus, nuclear organization fulfills all the criteria necessary for it to be considered an authentic level of epigenetic information. Chromosomal nuclear organization is primarily dictated by the biophysical properties of chromatin. Diffusion models of polymers confined in the crowded nuclear space accurately recapitulate experimental observation. Diffusion is a Brownian process, which implies that the positions of chromosomes and genes are not defined deterministically but are likely to be dictated by the laws of probability. Despite the small size of their nuclei, budding yeast have been instrumental in discovering how epigenetic information is encoded in the spatial organization of the genome. The relatively simple organization of the yeast nucleus and the very high number of genetically identical cells that can be observed under fluorescent microscopy allow statistically robust definitions of the gene and chromosome positions in the nuclear space to be constructed. In this review, we will focus on how the spatial organization of the chromatin in the yeast nucleus might impact transcription.

The length of the poly(A) tail influences the stability, nuclear export and translation of mRNA transcripts. Control of poly(A) tail length is thus an important mechanism to regulate the abundance and ultimate translation of transcripts. Understanding the global regulation of poly(A) tail length will require dissecting the contributions of enzymes, regulatory factors, and poly(A) binding proteins (Pabs) that all cooperate to regulate polyadenylation. A recent addition to the Pab family is the CCCH-type zinc finger class of Pabs that includes S. cerevisiae Nab2 and its human counterpart, ZC3H14. In S. cerevisiae, Nab2 is an essential nuclear Pab implicated in both poly(A) RNA export from the nucleus and control of poly(A) tail length. Consistent with an important role in regulation of poly(A) tail length, depletion of Nab2 from yeast cells results in hyperadenylation of poly(A) RNA. In this review, we focus on the role of Nab2 in poly(A) tail length control and speculate on potential mechanisms by which Nab2 could regulate poly(A) tail length based on reported physical and genetic interactions. We present models, illustrating how Nab2 could regulate poly(A) tail length by limiting polyadenylation and/or enhancing trimming.

     "abstract": "In the gene expression field, different steps have been traditionally viewed as discrete and unconnected events. Nowadays, genetic and functional studies support the model of a coupled network of physical and functional connections to carry out mRNA biogenesis. Gene expression is a coordinated process that comprises different linked steps like transcription, RNA processing, export to the cytoplasm, translation and degradation of mRNAs. Its regulation is essential for cellular survival and can occur at many different levels. Transcription is the central function that occurs in the nucleus, and RNAPII plays an essential role in mRNA biogenesis. During transcription, nascent mRNA is associated with the mRNA-binding proteins involved in processing and export of the mRNA particle. Cells have developed a network of multi-protein complexes whose functions regulate the different factors involved both temporally and spatially. This coupling mechanism acts as a quality control to solve some of the organization problems of gene expression in vivo, where all the factors implicated ensure that mRNAs are ready to be exported and translated. In this review, we focus on the functional coupling of gene transcription and mRNA export, and place particular emphasis on the relationship between the NPC-associated complex, TREX2, and the transcription co-activator, SAGA. We have pinpointed the experimental evidence for Sus1's roles in transcription initiation, transcription elongation and mRNA export.

     "abstract": "Over the past decade, various studies have indicated that most of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed at some level. The pervasiveness of transcription might seem surprising when one considers that only a quarter of the human genome comprises genes (including exons and introns) and less than 2% codes for protein. This conundrum is partially explained by the unique evolutionary pressures that are imposed on species with small population sizes, such as eukaryotes. These conditions promote the expansion of introns and non-functional intergenic DNA, and the accumulation of cryptic transcriptional start sites. As a result, the eukaryotic gene expression machinery must effectively evaluate whether or not a transcript has all the hallmarks of a protein-coding mRNA. If a transcript contains these features, then positive feedback loops are activated to further stimulate its transcription, processing, nuclear export and ultimately, translation. However if a transcript lacks features associated with \u201cmRNA identity\u201d, then the RNA is degraded and/or used to inhibit further transcription and translation of the gene. Here we discuss how mRNA identity is assessed by the nuclear export machinery in order to extract meaningful information from the eukaryotic genome. In the process, we provide an explanation of why certain sequences that are enriched in protein-coding genes, such as the signal sequence coding region, promote mRNA nuclear export in vertebrates.

     "abstract": "Most of the individual components of the nuclear elements of the gene expression pathway have been identified and high-resolution structural information is becoming available for many of them. Information is also starting to become available on the larger complexes they form and is beginning to give clues about how the dynamics of their interactions generate function. Although the translocation of export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) through the nuclear pore transport channel that is mediated by interactions with nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) is relatively well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus and their Dbp5-mediated disassembly in the cytoplasm is less well defined. Considerable information has been obtained on the structure of Dbp5 in its different nucleotide-bound states and in complex with Gle1 or Nup159/NUP214. Although the precise manner by which the Dbp5 ATPase cycle is coupled to mRNP remodelling remains to be established, current models capture many key details of this process. The formation of export-competent mRNPs in the nucleus remains an elusive component of this pathway and the precise nature of the remodelling that generates these mRNPs as well as detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which this step is integrated with the transcriptional, splicing and polyadenylation machinery by the TREX and TREX-2 complexes remain obscure.

Recruitment and assembly of mRNP complexes enhance and bring specificity to mRNA decay. mRNP complexes can form larger structures that have been found to be ubiquitous in nature. Discovery of P-Bodies, an archetype of this sort of aggregates, has generated interest in the question of where mRNA degrades. This is currently an open question under extensive investigation.

In this review we discuss the physiological importance for gamete formation of the molecules involved in classical nucleocytoplasmic protein transport, including importins/karyopherins, Ran and nucleoporins. To address what functions/factors are conserved or specialized for these developmental processes between species, we compare knowledge from mice, flies and worms.

Whether other genes encoding enzymes involved in the carnitine synthesis pathway, such as 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH) and trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), are also direct PPAR\u03b1 target genes is less clear. In silico-analysis of the mouse TMLD promoter and first intron and the TMABA-DH promoter revealed several putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE) with high similarity to the consensus PPRE. Luciferase reporter gene assays using either a 2\u00a0kb TMLD promoter or a 4\u00a0kb TMLD first intron reporter constructs revealed no functional PPRE. In contrast, reporter gene assays using wild-type and mutated 5\u00b4-truncation TMABA-DH promoter reporter constructs showed that one PPRE located at position \u2212\u00a0132 in the proximal promoter is probably functional. Using gel shift assays we observed in vitro-binding of PPAR\u03b1 to this PPRE. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we found that PPAR\u03b1 also binds in vivo to a nucleotide sequence spanning the PPRE at \u2212\u00a0132, which confirms that this PPRE is functional. In conclusion, the present study shows that the mouse TMABA-DH gene is a direct PPAR\u03b1 target gene. Together with the recent identification of the mouse BBD and the mouse OCTN2 genes as PPAR\u03b1 target genes this finding confirm that PPAR\u03b1 plays a key role in the regulation of carnitine homeostasis by controlling genes involved in carnitine synthesis and carnitine uptake.",

In an attempt to search for possible effects of Hho1p on the global organization of chromatin, we have applied Chromatin Comet Assay (ChCA) on HHO1 knock-out yeast cells. The results showed that the mutant cells exhibited highly distorted higher-order chromatin organization. Characteristically, linker histone depleted chromatin generally exhibited longer chromatin loops than the wild-type.

     "abstract": "E-proteins are basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that function in cell type specification. The gene E2A encodes two E-proteins, E12 and E47, which are required in B-lymphopoiesis. E2A proteins can interact directly with the transcriptional co-activators and lysine acetyltranferases (KATs) CBP, p300 and PCAF to induce target gene transcription. Prior investigations have shown that the E2A-encoded isoform E2-5 is acetylated by CBP, p300 or PCAF in vitro or in vivo. However, E2-5 lacks the important N-terminal activation domain AD1. Furthermore, the acetylated residues in E-proteins have not been mapped, and the functional consequences of acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we use mutagenesis to show that a lysine residue at position 34 within AD1 of E12/E47 is acetylated by CBP/p300 and PCAF. Lys34 lies adjacent to a conserved helical LXXLL motif that interacts directly with the KIX domain of CBP/p300. We show that acetylation at Lys34 increases the affinity of AD1 for the KIX domain and enhances AD1-driven transcriptional induction. Our results illustrate for the first time that AD1 can both recruit, and be acetylated by, KATs and that KAT recruitment may promote transcriptional induction in part through acetylation of AD1 itself.",

Coordinated action of regulatory factors keeps in check the transcriptional competence of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at different stages. Productive transcription requires the escape of the paused RNAPII from the promoter and transition to rapid elongation of the transcript. Numerous studies have identified diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter. The general theme that has emerged is that the balance between positive and negative regulatory factors determines the overall rate of transcription. Recently transcription termination has emerged as an important area of transcriptional regulation that is coupled with the efficient recycling of RNAPII. The factors associated with transcription termination can also mediate gene looping and thereby determine the efficiency of re-initiation. This review highlights these regulatory steps, the key modulators involved in transcription dynamics, and the emerging tools to analyze them.",

It showed strong RdRp activity with dinucleotide primers, and the order of template strength was poly(U)\u00a0>\u00a0(I)\u00a0>\u00a0(A)\u00a0>\u00a0(C).

     "abstract": "The ability of cells to respond to changes in their environment is mediated by transcription factors that remodel chromatin and reprogram expression of specific subsets of genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, changes in carbon source lead to gene induction by Adr1 and Cat8 that are known to require the upstream function of the Snf1 protein kinase, the central regulator of carbon metabolism, to exert their activating effect. How Snf1 facilitates transcription activation by Adr1 and Cat8 is not known. Here we show that under derepressing conditions, deletion of SNF1 abolishes the increase of histone H3 acetylation at the promoter of the glucose-repressed ADY2 gene, and as a consequence profoundly affects the chromatin structural alterations accompanying transcriptional activation. Adr1 and Cat8 are not required to regulate the acetylation switch and show only a partial influence on chromatin remodelling at this promoter, though their double deletion completely abolishes mRNA accumulation. Finally, we show that under derepressing conditions the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 is abolished by SNF1 deletion, possibly explaining the lack of increased histone H3 acetylation and nucleosome remodelling.The results highlight a mechanism by which signalling to chromatin provides an essential permissive signal that is required for activation by glucose-responsive transcription factors.",

     "abstract": "The prostanoid prostacyclin plays a central role in haemostasis and vascular repair. Recent studies investigating the regulation of the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP) gene identified an upstream repressor region (URR) within its regulatory promoter, herein termed the PrmIP. This study aimed to identify the main trans-acting factors that bind within the URR to transcriptionally repress PrmIP-directed gene expression in the megakaryoblastic human erythroleukemia (HEL) 92.1.7 cell line. Of the putative cis-acting elements examined, disruption of C/EBP and PU.1 elements within the URR substantially increased PrmIP-directed gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) confirmed that C/EBP\u03b4 and PU.1, but not C/EBP\u03b2, bind to the URR in vivo, while ectopic expression of C/EBP\u03b4 substantially reduced hIP mRNA levels and PrmIP-directed gene expression. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation increased hIP mRNA and PrmIP-directed reporter gene expression and hIP-mediated cAMP generation in HEL cells. Two PMA-responsive regions, termed PRR1 and PRR2, were identified within PrmIP. Disruption of C/EBP\u03b4 and PU.1 cis-elements within the overlapping PRR1/URR and of Sp1, PU.1 and Oct-1 cis-elements within the overlapping PRR2/core PrmIP, revealed that both PRR1 and PRR2 contribute to the PMA- induction of hIP mRNA and gene expression in HEL cells. Furthermore, ChIP analysis established that induction of PrmIP-directed gene expression during megakaryocytic differentiation is largely regulated by PMA-induced dissociation of C/EBP\u03b4 and enhanced binding of PU.1 to PRR1 in addition to increased binding of Sp1, PU.1 and Oct-1 to elements within the core promoter/PRR2 in vivo. Taken together, these data provide critical insights into the transcriptional regulation of the hIP gene within the vasculature, including during megakaryocytic differentiation.",

A somatic chromosomal translocation detectable in 5% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involves E2A and results in expression of the oncogenic transcription factor E2A-PBX1. CREB binding protein (CBP) and its close paralog p300 are transcriptional co-activators with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. We and others have shown that direct binding of an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain present in E12/E47 and E2A-PBX1 to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 contributes to E2A protein function. In the current work we show for the first time that the catalytic HAT activity of CBP/p300 is increased in the presence of residues 1\u2013483 of E2A (i.e., the portion present in E2A-PBX1). The addition of purified, recombinant E2A protein to in vitro assays results in a two-fold augmentation of CBP/p300 HAT activity, whereas in vivo assays show a ten-fold augmentation of HAT-dependent transcriptional induction and a five-fold augmentation of acetylation of reporter plasmid-associated histone by CBP in response to co-transfected E2A. Our results indicate that the HAT-enhancing effect is independent of the well-documented E2A\u2013CBP interaction involving the KIX domain and suggest a role for direct, perhaps low affinity binding of E2A to a portion of CBP that includes the HAT domain and flanking elements. Our findings add to a growing body of literature indicating that interactions between CBP/p300 and transcription factors can function in a specific manner to modulate HAT catalytic activity.",

Chromatin is a repressive barrier that plays an important role in protecting genomic DNA and regulating access to it. This barrier must be temporarily removed during transcription, replication, and repair, but it also must be rapidly restored to the original state afterwards. Further, the properties of chromatin are dynamic and must be adjusted as conditions dictate. FACT was identified as a factor that destabilizes nucleosomes in vitro, but it has now also been implicated as a central factor in the deposition of histones to form nucleosomes, as an exchange factor that swaps the histones within existing nucleosomes for variant forms, and as a tether that prevents histones from being displaced by the passage of RNA polymerases during transcription. FACT therefore plays central roles in building, maintaining, adjusting, and overcoming the chromatin barrier. This review summarizes recent results that have begun to reveal how FACT can promote what appear to be contradictory goals, using a simple set of binding activities to both enhance and diminish the stability of nucleosomes.

These evolutionarily conserved modifications, including acetylation and methylation, can occur in the cytoplasm, but their role in regulating import is not well understood. As part of histone import complexes, histone chaperones may serve to protect the histones during transport, or they may be using histones to promote their own nuclear localization. In addition, there is evidence that histone chaperones can play an active role in the import of histones. Histone chaperones have also been shown to regulate the localization of important chromatin modifying enzymes. This review is focused on the role histone chaperones play in the early biogenesis of histones, the distinct cytoplasmic subcomplexes in which histone chaperones have been found in both yeast and mammalian cells and the importins/karyopherins and nuclear localization signals that mediate the nuclear import of histones.

Several studies indicate that H2A.Z is found at specific loci in the genome such as regulatory-gene regions, where it poises genes for transcription. Its deposition creates chromatin regions with particular structural characteristics which could favor rapid transcription activation. This review focuses on the highly regulated mechanism of H2A.Z deposition in chromatin which is essential for genome integrity. Chaperones escort H2A.Z to large ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes which are responsible for its deposition/eviction. Over the last ten years, biochemical, genetic and genomic studies helped us understand the precise role of these complexes in this process. It has been suggested that a cooperation occurs between histone acetyltransferase and chromatin remodeling activities to incorporate H2A.Z in chromatin. Its regulated deposition near centromeres and telomeres also shows its implication in chromosomal structure integrity and parallels a role in DNA damage response. The dynamics of H2A.Z deposition/eviction at specific loci was shown to be critical for genome expression and maintenance, thus cell fate.

At the level of chromatin, for example, senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) form in some cell types. Chromatin is inherently dynamic and likely needs to be actively maintained to achieve a stable cell phenotype. In proliferating cells chromatin is maintained in conjunction with DNA replication, but how non-proliferating cells maintain chromatin structure is poorly understood. Some histone variants, such as H3.3 and macroH2A increase as cells undergo senescence, suggesting histone variants and their associated chaperones could be important in chromatin structure maintenance in senescent cells.

The development of stress-tolerant crops will be greatly advantageous for modern agriculture in areas that are prone to such stresses. In recent years, several advances have been made towards identifying potential stress related genes which are capable of increasing the tolerance of plants to abiotic stress. NAC proteins are plant-specific transcription factors and more than 100 NAC genes have been identified in Arabidopsis and rice to date. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the six major groups were already established at least in an ancient moss lineage. NAC transcription factors have a variety of important functions not only in plant development but also in abiotic stress responses. Stress-inducible NAC genes have been shown to be involved in abiotic stress tolerance. Transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing stress-responsive NAC (SNAC) genes have exhibited improved drought tolerance. These studies indicate that SNAC factors have important roles for the control of abiotic stress tolerance and that their overexpression can improve stress tolerance via biotechnological approaches. Although these transcription factors can bind to the same core NAC recognition sequence, recent studies have demonstrated that the effects of NAC factors for growth are different. Moreover, the NAC proteins are capable of functioning as homo- or hetero-dimer forms. Thus, SNAC factors can be useful for improving stress tolerance in transgenic plants, although the mechanism for mediating the stress tolerance of these homologous factors is complex in plants. Recent studies also suggest that crosstalk may exist between stress responses and plant growth.

In plants, several classes of small RNAs with specific sizes and dedicated functions have evolved through a series of pathways.

Besides their roles in growth and development and maintenance of genome integrity, small RNAs are also important components in plant stress responses. One way in which plants respond to environmental stress is by modifying their gene expression through the activity of small RNAs.

As a result of these molecular processes, plants are capable of adjusting to changing environmental conditions. Understanding the role of these mechanisms in plant stress responses is important and necessary for the engineering of stress-tolerant plants. Recent studies in the area of RNA regulation have increased our understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses.

     "abstract": "To deal with different kinds of DNA damages, there are a number of repair pathways that must be carefully orchestrated to guarantee genomic stability. Many proteins that play a role in DNA repair are involved in multiple pathways and need to be tightly regulated to conduct the functions required for efficient repair of different DNA damage types, such as double strand breaks or DNA crosslinks caused by radiation or genotoxins. While most of the factors involved in DNA repair are conserved throughout the different kingdoms, recent results have shown that the regulation of their expression is variable between different organisms. In the following paper, we give an overview of what is currently known about regulating factors and gene expression in response to DNA damage and put this knowledge in context with the different DNA repair pathways in plants.

Interestingly, conserved patterns of gene expression responses have been found that are common between different abiotic stresses or that are conserved between different plant species. However, the individual histories of each plant affect the inter-comparability between experiments already before the onset of the actual stress treatment.

     "abstract": "Plants have developed intricate mechanisms involving gene regulatory systems to adjust to stresses. Phenotypic variation in plants under stress is classically attributed to DNA sequence variants. More recently, it was found that epigenetic modifications \u2013 DNA methylation-, chromatin- and small RNA-based mechanisms \u2013 can contribute separately or together to phenotypes by regulating gene expression in response to the stress effect. These epigenetic modifications constitute an additional layer of complexity to heritable phenotypic variation and the evolutionary potential of natural plant populations because they can affect fitness. Natural populations can show differences in performance when they are exposed to changes in environmental conditions, partly because of their genetic variation but also because of their epigenetic variation. The line between these two components is blurred because little is known about the contribution of genotypes and epigenotypes to stress tolerance in natural populations. Recent insights in this field have just begun to shed light on the behavior of genetic and epigenetic variation in natural plant populations under biotic and abiotic stresses.

The wide tissue distribution of TNIP1 provides the opportunity to influence numerous cellular responses in these roles and defining control of TNIP1 expression would be central to improved understanding of its impact on cell function. We cloned 6\u00a0kb of the human TNIP1 promoter and performed predictive and functional analyses to identify regulatory elements. The promoter region proximal to the transcription start site is GC-rich without a recognizable TATA box. In contrast to this proximal ~\u00a0500\u00a0bp region, 6\u00a0kb of the promoter increased reporter construct constitutive activity over five-fold. Throughout the 6\u00a0kb length, in silico analysis identified several potential binding sites for both constitutive and inducible transcription factors; among the latter were candidate NF-\u03baB binding sequences and peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). We tested NF-\u03baB and PPAR regulation of the endogenous TNIP1 gene and cloned promoter by expression studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitations. We validated NF-\u03baB sites in the TNIP1 promoter proximal and distal regions as well as one PPRE in the distal region.

The HIR complex, comprised of Hir1, Hir2, Hir3 and Hpc2, regulates three of the four histone gene loci. While relief of repression at the G1/S boundary involves the HIR complex, as well as other cofactors, the mechanism by which this derepression occurs remains unknown. To better understand how transcriptional repression contributes to periodic expression in the cell cycle, we sought to identify the cell cycle signals required to alleviate HIR-mediated repression of the histone genes. By measuring histone gene transcription in strains with various combinations of clb mutations, we found that the mitotic Clb1/Clb2 cyclins are required to alleviate Hir-mediated repression during the G1/S transition and that Clb2 physically interacts with the HIR complex. While the HIR complex regulates histone gene transcription in combination with two other histone H3/H4 chaperones, Asf1 and Rtt106, our data demonstrate that the mitotic Clb cyclins are necessary to specifically alleviate the repressive action of the HIR complex itself in order to allow proper expression of the histone genes in late G1/early S phase.",

Expression of the human TSPO gene is elevated in several cancers. To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate TSPO expression in human breast cancer cells, the TSPO promoter was identified, cloned, and functionally characterized in poor-in-TSPO hormone-dependent, non-aggressive MCF-7 cells and rich-in-TSPO hormone-independent, aggressive, and metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. RNA ligase-mediated 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis indicated transcription initiated at multiple sites downstream of a GC-rich promoter that lacks functional TATA and CCAAT boxes. Deletion analysis indicated that the region from \u2212\u00a0121 to +\u00a066, which contains five putative regulatory sites known as GC boxes, was sufficient to induce reporter activity up to 24-fold in MCF-7 and nearly 120-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 bind to these GC boxes in vitro and to the endogenous TSPO promoter. Silencing of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 gene expression reduced TSPO levels. In addition, TSPO expression was epigenetically regulated at one or more of the identified GC boxes. Disruption of the sequence downstream of the main start site of TSPO differentially regulated TSPO promoter activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that essential elements contribute to its differential expression in these cells. Taken together, these experiments constitute the first in-depth functional analysis of the human TSPO gene promoter and its transcriptional regulation.",

Previous studies in teleosts demonstrated regulation of cyp19a1a expression by the NR5A nuclear receptor subfamily as well as a fork head transcription factor, FOXL2. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of fushi tarazu factor 1, FTZ-F1, a NR5A subfamily member, and FOXL2 in the regulation of cyp19a1b expression in brain of the air-breathing catfish, Clarias gariepinus. Based on the synchronous expression pattern of cyp19a1b, FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 in the brain, we isolated the 5\u2032 upstream region of cyp19a1b to analyse regulatory motifs. Promoter motif analysis revealed FTZ-F1/NR5A1 and FOXL2 binding nucleotide sequences. Transient transfection studies showed that FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 together enhanced the transcriptional activity of cyp19a1b gene in mammalian cell lines. Mutation in either of their putative binding sites within the cyp19a1b promoter abolished this effect. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments indicated that FTZ-F1 and FOXL2 proteins bind to the synthesized radio-labelled oligomers used as probes and mobility shifted upon addition of their respective antibodies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of both these transcription factors to their corresponding cis-acting elements in the upstream region of cyp19a1b.

MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that in most cases negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. EBV-transformed cells express at least 44 mature viral miRNAs that target viral and cellular genes. In addition, EBV-infection severely deregulates the miRNA profile of the host cell. The presently available information indicates that the virus uses its miRNAs to inhibit the apoptotic response of the infected cell as a means to establish a latent infection. Likewise, EBV-encoded miRNAs interfere in the expression of viral genes in order to mask the infected cell from the immune response. Cellular targets of viral miRNAs are involved in protein traffic within the cell and regulate innate immunity. MiRNA profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) showed that only 2% of the miRNAs are derived from the virus, while viral miRNAs comprise up to 20% of the total miRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and probably contribute to the formation or maintenance of NPC.

No obvious phylogenetic relationships exist among the avian herpesvirus microRNAs, but the general genomic locations of microRNA clusters are conserved, with microRNAs being located in the repeat regions of the genomes. In some cases, microRNAs are antisense to open reading frames. Among MDV1 field isolates with different virulence properties, microRNAs are highly conserved, and variations that have been observed lie in putative promoter regions. One cluster of MDV1 microRNAs lies upstream of the meq gene, and this cluster is more highly expressed in tumors caused by an extremely virulent MDV1 isolate compared to tumors caused by a less virulent isolate.

For example, mdv1-miR-M4 shares a seed sequence with gga-miR-155 (also shared with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) kshv-miR-K12), mdv2-miR-M21 shares a seed with miR-29b, and hvt-miR-H14 shares a seed sequence with miR-221. Functional analyses of avian herpesvirus microRNAs include a variety of in vitro assays to demonstrate potential function as well as the use of mutants that can exploit the ability to assess phenotypes experimentally in the natural host.

     "abstract": "Adenovirus infection has a tremendous impact on the cellular silencing machinery. Adenoviruses express high amounts of non-coding virus associated (VA) RNAs able to saturate key factors of the RNA interference (RNAi) processing pathway, such as Exportin 5 and Dicer. Furthermore, a proportion of VA RNAs is cleaved by Dicer into viral microRNAs (mivaRNAs) that can saturate Argonaute, an essential protein for miRNA function. Thus, processing and function of cellular miRNAs is blocked in adenoviral-infected cells. However, viral miRNAs actively target the expression of cellular genes involved in relevant functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair or RNA regulation. Interestingly, the cellular silencing machinery is active at early times post-infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle. This is relevant for therapeutic purposes against adenoviral infections or when recombinant adenoviruses are used as vectors for gene therapy. Manipulation of the viral genome allows the use of adenoviral vectors to express therapeutic miRNAs or to be silenced by the RNAi machinery leading to safer vectors with a specific tropism.

Cervical cancer represents a unique tumor model for understanding how viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins deregulate the expression of the miR-15/16 cluster, miR-17-92 family, miR-21, miR-23b, miR-34a, and miR-106b/93/25 cluster via the E6\u2013p53 and E7\u2013pRb pathways. Moreover, miRNAs may influence the expression of papillomavirus genes in a differentiation-dependent manner by targeting viral RNA transcripts. Cellular miRNAs affecting HPV DNA replication are of great interest and will be a future focus.

Cellular miRNAs have shown able to regulate HBV at the transcription level either by targeting to cellular transcriptions factors required for HBV gene expression, or by a directly binding to HBV transcripts. We also summarized the changed patterns of cellular miRNAs from hepatitis B progressing to cirrhosis and then liver cancer. The changing of a few of miRNAs, such as miR-122 or miR-21, were reproduced and worthy of further research by a deep sequencing and functional validation.

They are first transcribed as long, primary transcripts, which then undergo a series of processing steps to generate the single-stranded, mature miRNAs. Here, we showed that Drosha cleaved hundreds of human primary miRNA transcript substrates with different efficiencies in vitro. The differential Drosha susceptibility of the primary miRNA transcripts significantly correlated with the expression of the corresponding, mature miRNAs in vivo. Conserved miRNAs were more efficiently expressed in vivo, and their primary transcripts were also better Drosha substrates in vitro. Combining secondary structure prediction and statistical analyses, we identified features in human primary miRNA transcripts that predisposed miRNAs to efficient Drosha processing in vitro as well as to better expression in vivo. We propose that the selectivity of Drosha action contributes greatly to the specificity and efficiency of miRNA biogenesis.

Viral infection is a complex process that requires immune evasion in order to establish persistent life-long infection of the host.

In the last decade, it was uncovered that DNA viruses express a diverse and abundant pool of small non-coding RNA molecules, called microRNAs (miRNAs). These virally encoded miRNAs are non-immunogenic and therefore are important tools used to evade both innate and adaptive immune responses.

     "abstract": "The class of persistent gamma-herpesviruses has developed a variety of strategies that exploit host-cell regulatory pathways to ensure a long-lasting, well-balanced infection of their host. However when these pathways are deregulated, an otherwise harmless infection can lead to disease including cancer. We recently demonstrated that the human herpes virus 4 (HHV4) also known as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), encodes for small regulatory non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be transferred from an infected cell to uninfected neighboring cells. Upon arrival these miRNAs are functional in the recipient cell, in that they are able to down regulate specific target genes. These secreted miRNAs are transported to recipient cells via small nano-sized vesicles (known as exosomes) that are of endosomal origin, formed as intraluminal vesicles (ILV) inside multivesicular bodies (MVB). One question that needs to be addressed is how viral miRNAs are sorted into these exosomes.Mature miRNAs, including those of viral origin, are loaded into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) for gene silencing via blocking mRNA translation and/or initiating mRNA decay. Recent insights indicate that cytoplasmic RNA granules rich in RISC complexes are closely associated with endosomes. In fact, selective components of RISC, including GW182 and Argonaut proteins, miRNAs and mRNAs are present in exosomes. Thus miRNA function, mRNA stability and exosome-mediated intercellular communication converge at the level of endosomes. Since endosomes can be considered as key intracellular cross-roads that regulate communication of cells with their exterior, including neighboring cells, it is perhaps not surprising that viruses have found means to exploit this pathway to their benefit. Little is known however, how and if (micro) RNA species are specifically sorted into ILVs and what (micro)RNA-binding proteins are involved. Here we discuss recent developments relating to intracellular trafficking and function of miRNA-containing protein complexes that EBV may exploit for promoting or restricting miRNAs sorting into exosomes for intercellular regulatory functions.

RNAi can be induced via transfection of synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which results in a transient knockdown of the targeted mRNA. For stable gene silencing, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) constructs have been developed. In mammals and humans, the natural RNAi pathway is triggered via endogenously expressed miRNAs. The use of modified miRNA expression cassettes to elucidate fundamental biological questions or to develop therapeutic strategies has received much attention. Viral vectors are particularly useful for the delivery of miRNA genes to specific target cells. To date, many viral vectors have been developed, each with distinct characteristics that make one vector more suitable for a certain purpose than others. This review covers the recent progress in miRNA-based gene-silencing approaches that use viral vectors, with a focus on their unique properties, respective limitations and possible solutions.

The durable silencing that may be achieved with these RNAi activators is valuable to counter chronic viral infections, such as those caused by HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and dengue viruses. Early use of expressed antiviral miRNAs entailed generation of cassettes containing Pol III promoters (e.g. U6 and H1) that transcribe virus-targeting short hairpin RNA mimics of precursor miRNAs. Virus escape from single gene silencing elements prompted later development of combinatorial antiviral miRNA expression cassettes that form multitargeting siRNAs from transcribed long hairpin RNA and polycistronic primary miRNA sequences. Weaker Pol III and Pol II promoters have also been employed to control production of antiviral miRNA mimics, improve dose regulation and address concerns about toxicity caused by saturation of the endogenous miRNA pathway. Efficient delivery of expressed antiviral sequences remains challenging and utilizing viral vectors, which include recombinant adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses and lentiviruses, has been favored. Investigations using recombinant lentiviruses to transduce CD34+ hematological precursor cells with expressed HIV-1 gene silencers are at advanced stages and show promise in preclinical and clinical trials. Although the use of expressed antiviral miRNA sequences to treat viral infections is encouraging, eventual therapeutic application will be dependent on rigorously proving their safety, efficient delivery to target tissues and uncomplicated large scale preparation of vector formulations.

The rpoS mRNA, which codes for a transcription factor, is regulated by several sRNAs. DsrA and RprA enhance translation by pairing to a site on this mRNA, while OxyS represses rpoS mRNA translation. To better understand how Hfq interacts with these sRNAs and rpoS mRNA, the binding of wt Hfq and eleven mutant Hfqs to DsrA, RprA, OxyS and rpoS mRNA was examined. Nine of the mutant Hfq had single-residue mutations located on the proximal, distal, and outer-edge surfaces of the Hfq hexamer, while two Hfq had truncated C-terminal ends. Hfq with outer-edge mutations and truncated C-terminal ends behaved similar to wt Hfq with regard to binding the sRNAs, rpoS mRNA segments, and stimulating DsrA\u2022rpoS mRNA formation. Proximal surface mutations decreased Hfq binding to the three sRNAs and the rpoS mRNA segment containing the translation initiation region. Distal surface mutations lowered Hfq's affinity for the rpoS mRNA segment containing the (ARN)4 sequence. Strong Hfq binding to both rpoS mRNA segments appears to be needed for maximum enhancement of DsrA\u2022rpoS mRNA annealing. OxyS bound tightly to Hfq but exhibited weak affinity for rpoS mRNA containing the leader region and 75 nt of coding sequence in the absence or presence of Hfq. This together with other results suggest OxyS represses rpoS mRNA translation by sequestering Hfq rather than binding to rpoS mRNA.",

Using a similar approach, we identified two additional domains, CDI and CDII, of the Hpc2 protein that are conserved among yeast species related to S. cerevisiae. We showed that the N terminal CDI domain (spanning amino acids 63\u201379) is dispensable for HIR complex assembly, but plays an essential role in the repression of the histone genes by recruiting the HIR complex to the HIR-dependent histone gene loci.

     "abstract": "Histones are highly basic, relatively small proteins that complex with DNA to form higher order structures that underlie chromosome topology. Of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, it is H3 that is most heavily modified at the post-translational level. The human genome harbours 16 annotated bona fide histone H3 genes which code for four H3 protein variants. In 2010, two novel histone H3.3 protein variants were reported, carrying over twenty amino acid substitutions. Nevertheless, they appear to be incorporated into chromatin. Interestingly, these new H3 genes are located on human chromosome 5 in a repetitive region that harbours an additional five H3 pseudogenes, but no other core histone ORFs. In addition, a human-specific novel putative histone H3.3 variant located at 12p11.21 was reported in 2011. These developments raised the question as to how many more human histone H3 ORFs there may be. Using homology searches, we detected 41 histone H3 pseudogenes in the current human genome assembly. The large majority are derived from the H3.3 gene H3F3A, and three of those may code for yet more histone H3.3 protein variants. We also identified one extra intact H3.2-type variant ORF in the vicinity of the canonical HIST2 gene cluster at chromosome 1p21.2. RNA polymerase II occupancy data revealed heterogeneity in H3 gene expression in human cell lines. None of the novel H3 genes were significantly occupied by RNA polymerase II in the data sets at hand, however. We discuss the implications of these recent developments.",

The studies of Swi2/Snf2 have been mostly focused on their roles in chromatin and/or nucleosome remodeling in eukaryotes. A bacterial Swi2/Snf2 protein named RapA from Escherichia coli is a unique addition to these studies. RapA is an R NA polymerase (RNAP)- a ssociated p rotein and an A TPase. It binds nucleic acids including RNA and DNA. The ATPase activity of RapA is stimulated by its interaction with RNAP, but not with nucleic acids. RapA and the major sigma factor \u03c370 compete for binding to core RNAP. After one transcription cycle in vitro, RNAP is immobilized in an undefined posttranscription/posttermination complex (PTC), thus becoming unavailable for reuse. RapA stimulates RNAP recycling by ATPase-dependent remodeling of PTC, leading to the release of sequestered RNAP, which then becomes available for reuse in another cycle of transcription. Recently, the crystal structure of RapA that is also the first full-length structure for the entire Swi2/Snf2 family was determined. The structure provides a framework for future studies of the mechanism of RNAP recycling in transcription. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Snf2/Swi2 ATPase structure and function.",

     "abstract": "The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is a major target for transcriptional regulation. Mot1, a Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase, dissociates TBP from DNA in an ATP dependent process. The experimental advantages of this relatively simple reaction have been exploited to learn more about how Swi2/Snf2 ATPases function biochemically. However, many unanswered questions remain and fundamental aspects of the Mot1 mechanism are still under debate. Here, we review the available data and integrate the results with structural and biochemical studies of related enzymes to derive a model for Mot1's catalytic action consistent with the broad literature on enzymes in this family. We propose that the Mot1 ATPase domain is tethered to TBP by a flexible, spring-like linker of alpha helical hairpins. The linker juxtaposes the ATPase domain such that it can engage duplex DNA on one side of the TBP\u2013DNA complex. This allows the ATPase to employ short-range, nonprocessive ATP-driven DNA tracking to pull or push TBP off its DNA site. DNA translocation is a conserved property of ATPases in the broader enzyme family. As such, the model explains how a structurally and functionally conserved ATPase domain has been put to use in a very different context than other enzymes in the Swi2/Snf2 family.

Rad54 is a dsDNA-dependent ATPase of the Snf2/Swi2 family of SF2 helicases, although Rad54 lacks classical helicase activity and cannot carry out the strand displacement reactions typical for DNA helicases. Rad54 is a potent and processive motor protein that translocates on dsDNA, potentially executing several functions in recombinational DNA repair. Rad54 acts in concert with Rad51, the central protein of recombination that performs the key reactions of homology search and DNA strand invasion.

Targets for cytosine DNA methylation in plant genomes are CG, CHG and CHH (H is A, T, C) sequences. More than 30% total m5C in plant DNA is located in non-CG sites. DNA methylation in plants is species-, tissue-, organelle- and age-specific; it is involved in the control of all genetic functions including transcription, replication, DNA repair, gene transposition and cell differentiation. DNA methylation is engaged in gene silencing and parental imprinting, it controls expression of transgenes and foreign DNA in cell. Plants have much more complicated and sophisticated system of the multicomponent genome methylations compared to animals; DNA methylation in plant mitochondria is performed in other fashion as compared to that in nuclei. The nDNA methylation is carried out by cytosine DNA methyltransferases of, at least, three families. In contrast to animals the plants with the major maintenance methyltransferase MET1 (similar to animal Dnmt1) inactivated do survive. One and the same plant gene may be methylated at both adenine and cytosine residues; specific plant adenine DNA methyltransferase was described. Thus, two different systems of the genome modification based on methylation of cytosines and adenines seem to coexist in higher plants.

In this paper, we review data arising from genome-wide analysis of the epigenetic landscapes in different plant species to establish the correlation between specific epigenetic marks and transcription.

Cell cycle progression occurs in a unidirectional manner and requires passing through a number of stages in response to cellular, developmental and environmental cues. In addition to these signaling cascades, transcriptional regulation plays a major role and acts coordinately with genome duplication during S-phase and chromosome segregation during mitosis. In this context, chromatin is revealing as a highly dynamic and major player in cell cycle regulation not only owing to the changes that occur as a consequence of cell cycle progression but also because some specific chromatin modifications are crucial to move across the cell cycle. These are particularly relevant for controlling transcriptional activation and repression as well as initiation of DNA replication and chromosome compaction. As a consequence the epigenetic landscape of a proliferating cell is very complex throughout the cell cycle. These aspects of chromatin dynamics together with the impact of epigenetic modifications on cell proliferation will be discussed in this article.

Over the past 2 decades, a great deal has been learned about the molecular mechanism by which Agrobacterium produces T-DNA and transports it into the host nucleus. However, T-DNA integration, which is the limiting, hence, the most critical step of the transformation process, largely remains an enigma. Increasing evidence suggests that Agrobacterium utilizes the host DNA repair machinery to facilitate T-DNA integration. Meanwhile, it is well known that chromatin modifications, including the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, play an important role in DNA repair. Thus, by implication, such epigenetic codes in chromatin may also have a considerable impact on T-DNA integration, although the direct evidence to demonstrate this hypothesis is still lacking.

In the first system we demonstrate the interplay between genetic and epigenetic controls over the transcriptional activity of FLC, a major repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis. FLC is down-regulated by low temperature treatment (vernalisation) releasing the repressor effect on flowering. We discuss the mechanisms of the reduced transcription and the memory of the vernalisation treatment through vegetative development. We also discuss the resetting of the repressed activity level of the FLC gene, following vernalisation, to the default high activity level and show it occurs during both male and female gametogenesis but with different timing in each.In the second part of the review discussed the complex multigenic system which is responsible for the patterns of gene activity which bring about hybrid vigour in crosses between genetically similar but epigenetically distinct parents. The epigenetic systems that we have identified as contributing to the heterotic phenotype are the 24nt siRNAs and their effects on RNA dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) at the target loci leading to changed expression levels.We conclude that it is likely that epigenetic controls are involved in expression systems in many aspects of plant development and plant function.",

Recent advances in this field have revealed that siRNA-mediated maintenance of inert chromatin has diverse roles in development as well as in plant responses to the environment. Various proteinaceous factors required for siRNA-mediated chromatin modification have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, and much effort has been invested in understanding their function and interaction, resulting in the assignment of many of these factors to specific biochemical activities and engagement with specific steps such as transcription of intergenic RNAs, RNA processing, and cytosine methylation.

     "abstract": "Mouse models are often used to predict drug absorption in humans. Mouse Bcrp1 protein exhibits sequence and functional homology with human BCRP protein. Additionally, BCRP/Bcrp1 expression is regulated by alternative promoter usage in humans and mice; however, the precise intestine-specific alternative promoter utilized in either species is yet to be determined. Therefore we sought to identify and characterize the mouse intestinal Bcrp1 promoter. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and 5\u2032 RACE PCR we first established the predominance of a single Bcrp1 first exon (E1b) in the Bcrp1 mRNA isolated throughout the mouse intestine. Simultaneously using 5\u2032 RACE PCR we identified E1C as the predominant BCRP 5\u2032 UTR expressed in the human intestine. Next we established functional activity for the murine promoter upstream of E1b using reporter assays. Subsequently using deletion-construct analysis we found the core promoter region to span \u2212\u00a0231 to \u2212\u00a042\u00a0bps from the transcriptional start site of E1b. We then predicted a cAMP response element (CRE) as a transcription factor binding site unique only to the E1b promoter region, using in silico methods. We finally established functional interaction of phospho-CREB (p-CREB) protein with the CRE on the E1b promoter using both functional assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In conclusion, mouse intestinal Bcrp1 expression is regulated by a single alternative promoter upstream of E1b, the predominant Bcrp1 mRNA isoform expressed in the mouse intestine. Furthermore, Bcrp1 E1b mRNA expression is regulated by binding of p-CREB to its cis site on the mouse E1b promoter region.",

In the present study, using the human colon cancer cell line SW480, we observed that DKK1, an antagonist of the Wnt pathway, was significantly induced at the mRNA level after the removal of amino acids from the medium. Addition of the amino alcohol histidinol, which prevents the formation of histidinyl-tRNAHis, also increased DKK1 mRNA to a level similar to that observed when cells were deprived of all amino acids. Transcriptional activity and stability of DKK1 mRNA were both increased in the amino acid-deprived condition. The induction of DKK1 gene expression was confirmed by the increased immunofluorescent staining of the DKK1 protein in the amino acid deprived condition. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed increased RNA Polymerase II binding at the DKK1 promoter in amino acid-limited conditions, ATF4 binding to the promoter is absent. Luciferase reporter assays did not detect any functional AARE within the DKK1 gene structure. Knockdown of ATF4 by siRNA did not affect the increase of DKK1 mRNA during amino acid limitation. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation abolished the induction of DKK1. Our study revealed that DKK1 is a novel target gene in the response to amino acid deficiency and that the expression of DKK1 is up-regulated through an ATF4-independent and an ERK-dependent pathway.",

Elevated Crm1 expression has recently been identified in various tumours; however, the mechanisms driving its expression have not been investigated to date. In this study we identified the Crm1 promoter and factors associated with its elevated expression and with its repression under conditions of DNA damage. The \u2212\u00a01405 to +\u00a099 Crm1 promoter region was found to be significantly more active in cancer and transformed cells compared to normal, and the \u2212\u00a0175 to +\u00a099 region identified as responsible for the differential activity. Mutation of two CCAAT boxes and a GC box within this region significantly diminished Crm1 promoter activity and ChIP analysis revealed binding of NFY and Sp1 to these sites, with increased binding in transformed and cancer cells. In addition, p53 was found to repress Crm1 promoter activity, after induction with doxorubicin, with p53 siRNA blocking the effect. Crm1 promoter constructs with mutated CCAAT boxes were significantly less responsive to p53 repression, and in vivo binding of NFY to the CCAAT boxes was diminished upon p53 binding, suggesting that p53 mediates repression of the Crm1 promoter via interfering with NFY. This was confirmed using NFY knock-down cells, in which Crm1 promoter activity was significantly less responsive to p53. In vitro EMSAs revealed that NFY and p53 bind the CCAAT boxes as a single complex under conditions of DNA damage. In summary, this study is a first to analyse Crm1 promoter regulation and reveals NFY and Sp1 as contributors to Crm1 overexpression in cancer. In addition, this study reveals that Crm1 transcription is inhibited by DNA damage and that the mechanism of inhibition involves p53 interfering with NFY function.",

By quantitative RT-PCR of around 100 genes, most of them involved in control of cell cycle progression, we found that the treatment of human MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cells with bis-anthracycline WP631 for 24\u00a0h produced a profile of gene down-regulation markedly different from the profile caused by doxorubicin treatment or by stable Sp1 knockdown. These observations are rationalized by considering a near-specific effect of WP631 on Sp1 interaction with several gene promoters, thus representing potential therapeutic targets for WP631, in contrast to a less specific effect of reducing the availability of Sp1 through RNA interference. Genes down-regulated upon each treatment were mapped to their molecular and biological functions, which documented the down-regulation, among other things, of genes involved in mRNA transcription regulation, granting us insights into the effects of challenging the transactivation of gene expression by Sp1.",

However, the mechanism of Ngb regulation of transcription has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we analyzed the 5\u2032-flanking region of human neuroglobin gene (NGB) and identified a transcription start site (TSS) located at \u2212\u00a0306\u00a0bp relative to the translation start site ATG.

Mutation of either GC-box led to a significant reduction in NGB promoter activity, while overexpression of Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in activation of the promoter.

Sequence analysis identified a CpG island 3\u00a0kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to microarrays (ChIP-Chip) targeting the retinal transcription factor CRX was performed. Thereby, we identified a second CRX-bound region (CBR2) in the first intron of RS1 which contains six evolutionarily conserved CRX binding motifs. In vitro luciferase reporter gene assays and dsRed reporter electroporation of mouse retinal organ cultures demonstrated a strong constitutive and orientation-independent enhancing effect of the upstream CpG island. The intronic CBR2 potently suppressed CBR1-driven RS1 promoter activity in vitro but failed to regulate a CBR1-reporter in short-term cultured mouse retinae.

Gfi1 and p150 interact at endogenous expression levels and co-localize in distinct sub-nuclear structures. We show that p150 enhances Gfi1-mediated transcriptional repression and that it occupies Gfi1 target gene promoters in transfected cells and primary murine T cells only in the presence of Gfi1. Finally, size exclusion chromatography shows a fraction of p150 to coelute with Gfi1, LSD-1 and HDAC-1 and thus provides evidence that p150 is part of the Gfi1 repression complex.

We show that induction of HIF-1\u03b1 in rat kidneys can be achieved by iron reduction by the hydroxypyridin-4 one (CP94), an iron chelator administered intraperitoneally in rats. The extent of HIF protein stabilization as well as the expression of HIF target genes, including erythropoietin (EPO), in kidney tissues was comparable to those induced by known inhibitors of the PHD enzyme, such as desferrioxamine (DFO) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2). In human kidney cells and in vitro PHD activity assay, we were able to show that the HIF-1\u03b1 protein can be stabilized by addition of CP94. This appears to inactivate PHD; and thus prevents the hydroxylation of HIF-1\u03b1.

The gene is known to express inappropriately in many types of human myeloid leukemias and solid tumors. Forced expression of EVI1 in murine hematopoietic precursor cells lead to abnormal differentiation and increased proliferation. EVI1 encodes two sets of zinc finger domains due to which it behaves as a transcriptional factor. However, except a few, the targets of EVI1 are not well understood and hence also the mechanism by which it initiates oncogenesis is not very clear. In this report, we show that SIRT1, a histone deacetylase is a direct target of EVI1. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that EVI1 binds to the promoter region of SIRT1 approximately 1\u00a0kb upstream of the transcription start site. The functionality of the site was deduced by luciferase assay which showed that EVI1 significantly increases the SIRT1 promoter activity. SIRT1 was also found to be up regulated in cell lines and in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples where EVI1 was detected. Over expression of SIRT1 in cells shows that it interacts with EVI1 and this interaction lead to the deacetylation of the protein. Upon deacetylation the stability of EVI1 was found to be affected which was negatively regulated by nicotinamide (NAM). Our results thus identify an EVI1-SIRT1 axis in the regulation of EVI1 activity suggesting a possible role of SIRT1 in EVI1 positive neoplasms.",

In this study, we observed that (\u2212)-blebbistatin, which is a specific inhibitor of nonmuscle myosin II, increased the level of CYP1A1-mRNA in Hepa-1 cells. Comparison of (\u2212)-blebbistatin with (+)-blebbistatin, which is an inactive enantiomer, indicated that the increase of CYP1A1-mRNA was due to nonmuscle myosin II inhibition. Subsequent knockdown experiments observed that reduction of nonmuscle myosin IIA, which is only an isoform of nonmuscle myosin II expressed in Hepa-1 cells, was related to the enhancement of TCDD-dependent Cyp1a1 induction. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the increase of Cyp1a1 induction was the result of transcriptional activation due to increased binding of AhR and RNA polymerase II to the enhancer and proximal promoter regions of Cyp1a1, respectively. These findings provide a new insight into the correlation between the function of nonmuscle myosin II and gene induction.",

DRG2 is thought to play an essential role in the control of cell growth and differentiation. However, transcriptional regulation of DRG2 is largely unknown. To investigate the mechanisms controlling DRG2 expression, we cloned 1509\u00a0bp of the 5\u2032-flanking sequence of this gene. Deletion analysis showed that the region between \u2212113 and \u221270 is essential for the basal level expression of the DRG2 gene in K562 human erythroleukemic cells. Mutation of a putative stimulating protein 1 (Sp1) regulatory site located at position \u2212108 resulted in a significant decline in DRG2 promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Sp1 binds to this site. Knockdown of Sp1 expression using siRNA inhibited the promoter activation as well as the endogenous DRG2 transcriptional level. Taken together, these results demonstrate that basal expression level of DRG2 is regulated by the Sp1 transcription factor.",

To evaluate the role of each element in the cAMP response, these sites were mutated or deleted in rat TRH promoter linked to luciferase gene (TRH-luc) and co-transfected with \u03b2-gal expression vector in various cell lines; C6 cells gave the highest response to forskolin.

Our recent studies have implicated that \u03b4EF1, a member of the zinc finger-homeodomain transcription factor family, is required for governing both breast cancer EMT and bone remodeling, highlighting a potential role of \u03b4EF1 in modulating bone metastasis of breast cancer. In the present study, we further demonstrated that conditioned medium derived from \u03b4EF1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells significantly induces osteoclast maturation and concurrently represses osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. On the contrary, conditioned medium derived from \u03b4EF1-interfered MDA-MB-231 cells exhibits an opposite effect, thus confirming the effect of \u03b4EF to mediate osteolytic metastasis of breast cancer. Furthermore, we found that, during this process, \u03b4EF1 remarkably up-regulates matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression at both mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, the results of luciferase and CHIP assays indicated that \u03b4EF1 activates MMP-1 promoter activity through the AP-1 response element. Overexpression of \u03b4EF1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increases the recruitment of the AP-1 components, c-Jun/c-Fos, to the endogenous MMP-1 promoter, which in effect could be mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, these observations suggest a potent role of \u03b4EF1 to promote breast cancer metastasis to bone by regulating secretion of growth factors in the tumor microenvironment.",

     "abstract": "Recently, sporadic links have been published between mitochondria \u2013 membrane-confined organelles \u2013 and the cytosolic ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) for removal of cellular proteins. For example, Fzo1, a mitochondrial outer membrane mitofusin was shown to be ubiquitinated by a ubiquitin ligase, Cdc53MDM30, and degraded by the proteasome. Two additional ubiquitin ligases, MITOL/MARCH-V and MULAN, as well as a deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp16/USP30, are embedded in mitochondrial outer membranes and participate in mitochondrial dynamics. Defects in mitochondrial morphology or respiration capacity are also reported for mutations in other UPS components such as the Ub ligases Parkin and Rsp5 as well as in proteasome subunits. These examples are likely to reflect a pervasive involvement of UPS in recycling of mitochondria-associated proteins. The flux of imported proteins and the proximity to oxidative phosphorylation results in abundant damaged or misfolded proteins that generate the need for a responsive quality control system. Within the mitochondrial matrix there is a self-contained ATP-dependent system for protein turnover. However at the outer membrane, the UPS may play a corresponding role in recycling either membrane-embedded or imported proteins. In a parallel process, ubiquitination also partakes in selection of damaged mitochondria to the lysozome/vacuole via autophagy. In the reverse direction, components of the UPS are sensitive to cellular REDOX potential, and as such are affected by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated as a byproduct of mitochondrial respiration. This review will try to address the regulation of mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function by UPS, as well as the reciprocal relationship between aberrant ROS produced by mitochondria and ubiquitination or proteasome activity.

     "abstract": "A growing number of human diseases are linked to abnormal gene expression which is largely controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation. The gene-specific activator promotes the initiation of transcription through its interaction with one or more components of the transcriptional initiation machinery, hence leading to stimulated transcriptional initiation or activation. However, all activator proteins do not target the same component(s) of the transcriptional initiation machinery. Rather, they can have different target specificities, and thus, can lead to distinct mechanisms of transcriptional activation. Two such distinct mechanisms of transcriptional activation in yeast are mediated by the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase) and TFIID (Transcription factor IID) complexes, and are termed as \u201cSAGA-dependent\u201d and \u201cTFIID-dependent\u201d transcriptional activation, respectively. SAGA is the target of the activator in case of SAGA-dependent transcriptional activation, while the targeting of TFIID by the activator leads to TFIID-dependent transcriptional activation. Both the SAGA and TFIID complexes are highly conserved from yeast to human, and play crucial roles in gene activation among eukaryotes. The regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic transcriptional activation by SAGA and TFIID are discussed here.

Using these models we show that the levels of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (active Akt) are increased in E6-AP overexpressing prostate gland and LNCaP cells suggesting that E6-AP regulates the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The prostate glands in our transgenic mice are ~\u00a020% larger and produce preneoplastic lesions at the age of 18\u00a0months. Our data also suggest that E6-AP modulates PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by both androgen-independent and -dependent mechanisms. In the androgen-independent mechanism, E6-AP modulates PI3K-Akt signaling by regulating the protein levels of RhoA, a small GTPase, which is a negative regulator of the Akt signaling pathway. Further, we show that E6-AP, a known coactivator of AR, amplifies the androgen-dependent activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In addition, we show that stable overexpression of E6-AP in prostate cancer cells results in increased cell size and proliferation. Overall our data suggests that E6-AP regulates both the positive and negative modulators of the PI3K-Akt pathway in prostate cells which results in increased prostate cell growth, proliferation and decreased apoptosis.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled The 26S Proteasome: When degradation is just not enough!",

Perturbation in the UPP is also believed to play a causative role in mental disorders such as Angelman syndrome. The pathology of neurodegenerative diseases is characterized by abnormal deposition of insoluble protein aggregates or inclusion bodies within neurons. The ubiquitinated protein aggregates are believed to result from dysfunction of the UPP or from structural changes in the protein substrates which prevent their recognition and degradation by the UPP.

First, strong evidence continues to emerge to support a novel hypothesis that proteasome functional insufficiency represents a common pathological phenomenon in a large subset of heart disease, compromises protein quality control in heart muscle cells, and thereby acts as a major pathogenic factor promoting the progression of the subset of heart disease to congestive heart failure. This front is represented by the studies on the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) in cardiac proteinopathy, which have taken advantage of a transgenic mouse model expressing a fluorescence reporter for UPS proteolytic function. Second, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome has been explored experimentally as a potential therapeutic strategy to intervene on some forms of heart disease, such as pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy, viral myocarditis, and myocardial ischemic injury. Not only between the two fronts but also within each one, a multitude of inconsistencies and controversies remain to be explained and clarified. At present, the controversy perhaps reflects the sophistication of cardiac proteasomes in terms of the composition, assembly, and regulation, as well as the intricacy and diversity of heart disease in terms of its etiology and pathogenesis.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we determined that this Zorro LNA altered CTCF and RNA polymerase II binding at three separate and distinct regions in the NF1 gene. This change in protein binding was associated with changes in long-range DNA interactions at the NF1 locus and downregulation of NF1 gene expression. This study describes an efficient and convenient method to manipulate chromatin structure and alter gene expression that is regulated by long-range DNA interactions without changing the DNA sequence. The use of specific Zorro LNA probes may facilitate our efforts to understand the interactions between chromatin architecture and gene expression.",

Recent work demonstrates that transcription of many genes, including key developmental and stimulus-responsive genes, is regulated after the initiation step, by pausing of RNA polymerase II during elongation through the promoter-proximal region. Thus, there is great interest in better understanding the events that follow transcription initiation and the ways in which the efficiency of early elongation can be modulated to impact expression of these highly regulated genes. Here we describe our current understanding of the steps involved in the transition from an unstable initially transcribing complex into a highly stable and processive elongation complex. We also discuss the interplay between factors that affect early transcript elongation and the potential physiological consequences for genes that are regulated through transcriptional pausing.",

     "abstract": "Functional characterisation of vigilin, a highly conserved multi-KH-domain protein that binds RNA and ssDNA, remains elusive and, to some extent, controversial. Studies performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells indicate that vigilin localises to the cytoplasm, binds ribosomes, associates to RER and regulates mRNA translation. On the other hand, we and others reported a contribution to heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing (PEV) and chromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae, Drosophila and human cells. Whether this contribution is direct remains, however, unclear. Here, we report that Drosophila vigilin, DDP1, vastly localises to the cytoplasm, being largely excluded from the nucleus. We also show that DDP1 preferentially associates to RER and co-purifies with several ribosomal proteins, suggesting a contribution to mRNA translation. In light of these results, the contribution of DDP1 to PEV was re-examined. Here, we show that a newly generated null ddp1\u0394 mutation is only a weak suppressor of PEV, which is in contrast with our own previous results showing dominant suppression in the presence of a strong hypomorphic ddp115.1 mutation. Similar results were obtained in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where vigilin (Vgl1) also associates to RER, having no significant contribution to PEV at centromeres, telomeres and the mating-type locus. Altogether, these results indicate that cytoplasmic localisation and association to RER, but not contribution to heterochromatin organisation, are evolutionarily conserved features of vigilin, favouring a model by which vigilin acts in the cytoplasm, regulating RNA metabolism, and affects nuclear functions only indirectly.",

We examined alterations in the chromatin structure of the MT-I promoter associated with enhanced transcriptional activation. MTF-1 proved essential for zinc-induced epigenetic changes in the MT-I promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that zinc treatment rapidly decreased Lys4-trimethylated and Lys9-acetylated histone H3 in the promoter and decreased total histone H3 but not histone H3.3. Micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of the MT-I promoter was increased by zinc. Thus, the chromatin structure in the promoter may be locally disrupted by zinc-induced nucleosome removal. Without MTF-1 these changes were not observed, and an MTF-1 deletion mutant recruited to the MT-I promoter by zinc that did not recruit the coactivator p300 or activate MT-I transcription did not affect histone H3 in the MT-I promoter in response to zinc. Interleukin-6, which induces MT-I transcription independently of MTF-1, did not reduce histone H3 levels in the promoter. Rapid disruption of nucleosome structure at the MT-I promoter is mediated by zinc-responsive recruitment of an active MTF-1-coactivator complex.",

The chromatin exists as a dynamic entity, shuttling between the open and closed forms at specific nuclear regions and loci based on the requirement of the cell. This dynamicity is essential for the various DNA-templated phenomena like transcription, replication, and repair and is achieved through the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes and covalent modifiers of chromatin. A growing body of data indicates that chromatin enzymatic activities are finely and specifically regulated by a variety of small molecules derived from the intermediary metabolism. This review tries to summarize the work conducted in many laboratories and on different model organisms showing how ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are regulated by small molecules and metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and inositol polyphosphates (IPs).",

Among other indicators of redox flux, cellular NAD(H) levels play a predominant role in transcriptional reprogramming. In addition to this, normal physiological functions of a cell are regulated in response to perturbations in NAD(H) levels (for example, due to alterations in diet/metabolism) to maintain homeostatic conditions. Cells achieve this homeostasis by reprogramming various components that include changes in chromatin structure and function (transcription). The interdependence of changes in gene expression and NAD(H) is evolutionarily conserved and is considered crucial for the survival of a species (by affecting reproductive capacity and longevity). Proteins that bind and/or use NAD(H) as a co-substrate (such as, CtBP and PARPs/Sirtuins respectively) are known to induce changes in chromatin structure and transcriptional profiles. In fact, their ability to sense perturbations in NAD(H) levels has been implicated in their roles in development, stress responses, metabolic homeostasis, reproduction and aging or age-related diseases. It is also becoming increasingly clear that both the levels/activities of these proteins and the availability of NAD(H) are equally important.

Although it clearly has free radical scavenger properties, the mechanisms involved in these beneficial effects are not fully understood. In this regard, one area of major interest concerns the effects of RESV on the activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that has been implicated in aging. Indeed, the role of SIRT1 is currently the subject of intense research due to the antiaging properties of RESV, which increases life span in various organisms ranging from yeast to rodents. In addition, when RESV is administered in experimental animal models of neurological disorders, it has similar beneficial effects to caloric restriction. SIRT1 activation could thus constitute a potential strategic target in neurodegenerative diseases and in disorders involving disturbances in glucose homeostasis, as well as in dyslipidaemias or cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, small SIRT1 activators such as SRT501, SRT2104, and SRT2379, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, could be potential drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, among other disorders.

Recent evidence suggests that changes in DNA methylation patterns are involved in human disease through altering normal gene expression programming. In contrast to genetic changes aberrant DNA methylation patterns are potentially reversible raising the hope for DNA methylation based therapeutics. It was previously believed that the only relevant DNA methylation reaction in mature cells is DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which accurately copies the DNA methylation pattern during cell division. The major effort in the field has therefore focused on developing DNMT inhibitors for cancer a disease of mitotic cells. However, recent evidence suggests that the DNA methylation state in both mitotic and postmitotic cells is a balance of DNA methylating and demethylating activities. This expands the scope of DNMT inhibitors to postmitotic tissues such as the brain. Since the identity of the DNA demethylating activity is still a mystery, the development of DNA demethylation inhibitors has been lagging.

It has been shown that Rb function is essential for the proper modulation of G1/S transition and inactivation of Rb contributes to deregulated cell proliferation. Rb exerts its cell cycle regulatory functions mainly by targeting the E2F family of transcription factors and Rb has been shown to physically interact with E2Fs 1, 2 and 3, repressing their transcriptional activity. Multiple genes involved in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression are regulated by E2Fs, and Rb prevents their expression by inhibiting E2F activity, inducing growth arrest. It has been established that inactivation of Rb by phosphorylation, mutation, or by the interaction of viral oncoproteins leads to a release of the repression of E2F activity, facilitating cell cycle progression. Rb-mediated repression of E2F activity involves the recruitment of a variety of transcriptional co-repressors and chromatin remodeling proteins, including histone deacetylases, DNA methyltransferases and Brg1/Brm chromatin remodeling proteins. Inactivation of Rb by sequential phosphorylation events during cell cycle progression leads to a dissociation of these co-repressors from Rb, facilitating transcription. It has been found that small molecules that prevent the phosphorylation of Rb prevent the dissociation of certain co-repressors from Rb, especially Brg1, leading to the maintenance of Rb-mediated transcriptional repression and cell cycle arrest. Such small molecules have anti-cancer activities and will also act as valuable probes to study chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.",

In humans, among the three members of the kinase family, Aurora-A, -B and -C, only Aurora-A and -B are expressed at detectable levels in all somatic cells undergoing mitotic cell division and have been characterized in greater detail for their involvement in cellular pathways relevant to the development of cancer associated phenotypes. Aurora-A and -B are being investigated as potential targets for anticancer therapy. Development of inhibitors against Aurora kinases as anticancer molecules gained attention because of the facts that aberrant expression of these kinases leads to chromosomal instability and derangement of multiple tumor suppressor and oncoprotein regulated pathways. Preclinical studies and early phase I and II clinical trials of multiple Aurora kinase inhibitors as targeted anticancer drugs have provided encouraging results. This article discusses functional involvement of Aurora kinase-A and -B in the regulation of cancer relevant cellular phenotypes together with findings on some of the better characterized Aurora kinase inhibitors in modulating the functional interactions of Aurora kinases. Future possibilities about developing next generation Aurora kinase inhibitors and their clinical utility as anticancer therapeutic drugs are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as polyglutamine-related diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are accompanied by transcriptional dysfunctions, leading to neuronal death. It is becoming more evident that the chromatin acetylation status is impaired during the lifetime of neurons, by a common mechanism related to the loss of function of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Notably, the HAT termed cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)\u2013binding protein (CBP) was shown to display neuroprotective functions. Several other HATs have now been shown to participate in basic but vital neuronal functions. In addition, there is increasing evidence of several HATs (including CBP), as essential regulators of neuronal plasticity and memory formation processes. In order to counteract neuronal loss and/or memory deficits in neurodegenerative diseases, the current therapeutic strategies involve the use of small molecules antagonizing histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity (i.e. HDAC inhibitors). Although this strategy lacks specificity, some of these molecules display promising therapeutic properties. With the rapidly evolving literature on HATs and their respective functions in neuronal survival and memory formation, it seems essential to envisage direct stimulation of the acetyltransferase function as a new therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will highlight the present understanding and the future prospects of such therapeutic approach.",

It has rendered a severe menace to the middle-aged and elderly, while there is still lack of efficient drugs against this disease. The pathogenic mechanism for DM is complex, and the complicated networks related to this disease involve distinct signaling pathways. Currently, discovery of potential modulators targeting these pathways has become a potent approach for anti-diabetic drug lead compound development. Compared with synthetic compounds, natural products provide inherent larger-scale structural diversity and have been the major resource of bioactive agents for new drug discovery. To date, more and more active components from plants or marine organisms have been reported to regulate diabetic pathophysiological signaling pathways and exhibit anti-diabetic activity. This review will summarize the regulation of natural small molecules on some key signaling pathways involved in DM. These pathways include insulin signaling pathway, carbohydrate metabolism pathway, the pathways involving insulin secretion and PPAR regulation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation related pathways and chromatin modification pathways.",

The circadian clock protein Period 1 (Per1) is an aldosterone-induced gene that regulates mRNA expression of the rate-limiting alpha subunit of ENaC (\u03b1ENaC). In the present study, we examined the effect of Per1 on \u03b1ENaC in the cortex, the site of greatest ENaC activity in the collecting duct, and examined the mechanism of Per1 action on \u03b1ENaC. Compared to wild type mice, Per1 knockout mice exhibited a 50% reduction of steady state \u03b1ENaC mRNA levels in the cortex. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Per1 decreased total \u03b1ENaC protein levels in mpkCCDc14 cells, a widely used model of the murine cortical collecting duct (CCD). Per1 regulated basal \u03b1ENaC expression and participated in the aldosterone-mediated regulation of \u03b1ENaC in mpkCCDc14 cells. Because circadian clock proteins mediate their effects as part of multi-protein complexes at E-box response elements in the promoters of target genes, the ability of Per1 to interact with these sequences from the \u03b1ENaC promoter was tested. For the first time, we show that Per1 and Clock are present at an E-box response element found in the \u03b1ENaC promoter. Together these data support an important role for the circadian clock protein Per1 in the direct regulation of \u03b1ENaC transcription and have important implications for understanding the role of the circadian clock in the regulation of renal function.",

Comparison of expression data obtained with total cytoplasmic mRNAs or polysome-bound mRNAs (actively translated mRNAs) on Affymetrix high-density oligonucleotide microarrays revealed different characteristics of the two regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, mRNA expression from a vast majority of genes was affected, albeit most changes were relatively small and occurred at a low pace. Translational control, however, affected a smaller fraction of genes but was effective at earlier time-points. This analysis unravels six clusters of genes showing no significant variation in mRNA expression levels whereas they are submitted to translational regulation. Their involvement in terminal mouse erythropoiesis may prove to be highly relevant. Furthermore, the data from specific and functional categories of genes emphasize that translational control, not only reinforces the transcriptional effect, but allows the cell to increase the complexity in gene expression regulation patterns.",

However, the binding affinity of eIF4F with PK1 was enhanced ~\u00a011-fold with the addition of PABP, eIF4B, and poly(A)20 together. Whereas, poly(A)20 alone increases the binding affinity of eIF4F\u00b74B\u00b7PABP with PK1 RNA about 3-fold, showing an additive effect rather than the large increase in affinity as shown for cap binding. Thermodynamic data showed that PK1 RNA binding to protein complexes in the presence of poly(A)20 was enthalpy-driven and entropy-favorable. Poly(A)20 decreased the entropic contribution 75% for binding of PK1 RNA to eIF4F\u00b74B\u00b7PABP as compared to eIF4F alone, suggesting reduced hydrophobic interactions for complex formation and an overall conformational change.

They are hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Pharmacological inhibition of sEH increases the level of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which may have a cardiovascular protective effect. However, the regulation and function of sEH in cancer are largely unknown. The present study investigated whether DNA methylation regulates the expression of sEH in carcinoma HepG2 cells. The mRNA and protein expressions of sEH in HepG2 cells were lower than those in transformed human embryonic kidney cells and in primary cultured human endothelial cells. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a putative CpG island and 5 SP-1 binding sites located in the promoter region of the sEH gene. Furthermore, the sEH expression was significantly enhanced by demethylation treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and the sEH promoter was transformed from hypermethylation to hypomethylation as detected by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Transient transfection assays showed that the activity of the human sEH promoter was increased in HepG2 cells in response to 5-Aza-CdR. Five SP-1 binding sites in the promoter region responding to treatment with 5-Aza-CdR were identified by construct deletion and mutation analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Interestingly, adenoviral overexpression of sEH in HepG2 cells decreased cell proliferation. Thus, SP-1 is involved in the decrease in the transcription of sEH as a result of DNA methylation in HepG2 cells, which might contribute to epigenetic mechanism-induced carcinogenesis in hepatocytes.",

In this study we have identified alternative splicing of the Nizp1 gene resulting in transcripts encoding Nizp1 protein isoforms with a short N-terminal deletion or a SCAN-domain deletion. The alternative Nizp1 transcripts are expressed in lower levels relative to the canonical Nizp1 transcript. The Nizp1 SCAN-domain mediates Nizp1 self-association but lacks intrinsic transcriptional activating or repressing capacity and has no influence on the transcriptional repression activity of Nizp1 in reporter assays. Sub-cellular localization analysis showed that a fraction of Nizp1 localizes to CBP nuclear bodies and that the SCAN-domain is required for the localization to nuclear bodies.

     "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein Hfq has been studied extensively for its function as a modulator of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. While most Hfq studies have focused on the protein's interaction with sRNAs and mRNAs, Hfq binding to DNA has been observed but is less explored. During the isolation of Hfq from Escherichiacoli, we found genomic DNA fragments associated with the protein after multiple steps of purification. Sequences of 41 amplified segments from the DNA fragments associated with Hfq were determined. A large fraction of the DNA segments were predicted to have significant helical axis curvature and were from genes associated with membrane proteins, characteristics unexpected for non-specific binding. Analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that rA18 binding to Hfq disrupts Hfq-DNA interactions. The latter observation suggests Hfq binding to DNA involves its distal surface. This was supported by a gel mobility shift assay that showed single amino acid mutations on the distal surface of Hfq inhibited Hfq binding to duplex DNA, while six of seven mutations on the proximal surface and outer circumference of the hexamer did not prevent Hfq binding. Two mutated Hfq which have portions of their C-terminal domain removed also failed to bind to DNA. The apparent Kd for binding wild type Hfq to several duplex DNA was estimated from a gel mobility shift assay to be ~\u00a0400\u00a0nM.",

     "abstract": "Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunits (MEDs) serve to promote the assembly, activation, and regeneration of transcription complexes on core promoters during the initiation and re-initiation phases of transcription. There are no studies on the Mediator complex during development of endothelial progenitors (EPCs). Here, we have analysed all known MEDs during the differentiation of EPCs, by expression profile studies at RNA level and, for a limited subset of MED subunits, also at protein level. Since beneficial effects of l-arginine on EPCs have been described, we have also examined its effect on the expression of Mediator subunit coding genes. Through RT-PCR we have found increased expression for MED12 and decreased levels for MED30 after l-arginine treatment; Western blot analysis do not agree entirely with the RNA data in the identification of a putative protein product. Furthermore, we have analysed the three-dimensional nuclear positions of MED12 and MED30 genes in the presence of l-arginine treatment. Our major finding is the identification of a novel transcript of MED30, termed MED30 short (MED30s) generating by alternative splicing. Our results showed that the mRNA of this novel isoform is present only in circulating cells, but it is not expressed in cultured adherent cells.These findings are broadly relevant and will contribute to our understanding of the role of Mediator in eukaryotic gene expression. Despite the need to confirm the in vivo presence of the protein of this novel isoform, the presence of this novel RNA raises the possibility of regulating pathophysiological mechanism in progenitors.",

Putative EpRE core sequences (TGAnnnnGC) are localized in 5\u2032-flanking regions (5\u2032-UTR) of these genes but specificity of the internal bases and whether location affects function has not been refined. The catalytic subunit of human glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC) gene is well documented to be under EpRE regulation and four sequences having an EpRE \u201cconsensus\u201d sequence were reported with only one (EpRE 4) responsive to electrophiles. Using GCLC as a model, we asked whether the internal variable or flanking nucleotides and the location of the sequence were required for functional activity in response to 4-hydroxenonenal (HNE). We found that thirteen putative EpRE core sequences (TGAnnnnGC) were localized in 5\u2032-UTR of GCLC and confirmed that EpRE 4 showed both constitutive and HNE-inducible activity. Four other sequences exhibited only constitutive activity while other putative EpREs demonstrated no activity. Nucleotide mutagenesis demonstrated specific requirements for internal and flanking nucleotides that were specific for the electrophilic response and that a TRE-like sequence within EpRE was essential for basal (non-electrophile-dependent) activity. Furthermore, EpRE 4 relocated to positions of other putative EpREs maintained activity but moving other EpREs to the EpRE 4 location did not. Thus in GCLC, specific flanking and internal nucleotides within EpRE were far more important for function than previously described while location did not influence activity. These two findings bring into question the meaning of the phrase, \u201cconsensus sequence\u201d for this important cis element.",

This physiological pathway is believed to prevent polycystin-1 overexpression and thus renal cysts. The present study examined the mechanisms of p53-mediated repression of PKD1. The 5\u2032-upstream region of the human PKD1 gene is TATA-less, GC-rich, and contains four consensus p53 binding sites at positions \u22122.7\u00a0kb (BS4), \u22121.2\u00a0kb (BS3), \u22120.8\u00a0kb (BS2), and \u22120.2\u00a0kb (BS1), respectively. PKD1BS1\u20134 are bound to endogenous p53 in vivo and in vitro. Transient transfection assays in inner medullary collecting duct cells revealed that disruption of PKD1BS1 enhances baseline PKD1 promoter activity; in contrast, disruption of PKD1BS4 suppressed PKD1 transcription. PKD1BS1 confers p53-mediated repression when substituted for the p53 enhancer element in the bradykinin B2 receptor gene, indicating that PKD1BS1 is a bona fide p53 repressor element. Moreover, PKD1BS1 requires intact BS2-4 and cellular histone deacetylase activity for full functional activity. Indeed, the PKD1BS1/4 regions are occupied by a complex containing HDAC1/2 and mSin3. These findings suggest a model whereby p53 exerts a biphasic control on PKD1 gene transcription, depending on cellular context and the cognate cis-acting element.",

We have identified a DRE in the 5\u2032-flanking region of the D-p38b gene and showed that DREF could bind to this DRE via a gel mobility shift assay and a ChIP assay. Base-substitution mutations of the D-p38b promoter DRE and analyses of transformants carrying D-p38b-lacZ or D-p38b-DREmut-lacZ indicated that this DRE is required for the activity of the D-p38b gene promoter. Furthermore, by using the GAL4-UAS system, we showed that DREF regulates the activity of the D-p38b gene promoter in adult ISCs and progenitors. In addition, the D-p38b knockdown phenotypes in the midgut were rescued by DREF overexpression, suggesting a functional link between these two factors.

O-GlcNAc modification of proteins is regulated by cell cycle, nutrient metabolism, and other extracellular signals. Compared to protein phosphorylation, which is mediated by a large number of kinases, O-GlcNAc modification is catalyzed only by one enzyme called O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase or OGT. Removal of O-GlcNAc from proteins is catalyzed by the enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase or OGA). Altered O-linked GlcNAc modification levels contribute to the establishment of many diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration. Many transcription factors have been shown to be modified by O-linked GlcNAc modification, which can influence their transcriptional activity, DNA binding, localization, stability, and interaction with other co-factors.

     "abstract": "Genuine La proteins contain two RNA binding motifs, a La motif (LAM) followed by a RNA recognition motif (RRM), arranged in a unique way to bind RNA. These proteins interact with an extensive variety of cellular RNAs and exhibit activities in two broad categories: i) to promote the metabolism of nascent pol III transcripts, including precursor-tRNAs, by binding to their common, UUU-3\u2032OH containing ends, and ii) to modulate the translation of certain mRNAs involving an unknown binding mechanism. Characterization of several La\u2013RNA crystal structures as well as biochemical studies reveal insight into their unique two-motif domain architecture and how the LAM recognizes UUU-3\u2032OH while the RRM binds other parts of a pre-tRNA. Recent studies of members of distinct families of conserved La-related proteins (LARPs) indicate that some of these harbor activity related to genuine La proteins, suggesting that their UUU-3\u2032OH binding mode has been appropriated for the assembly and regulation of a specific snRNP (e.g., 7SK snRNP assembly by hLARP7/PIP7S). Analyses of other LARP family members suggest more diverged RNA binding modes and specialization for cytoplasmic mRNA-related functions. Thus it appears that while genuine La proteins exhibit broad general involvement in both snRNA-related and mRNA-related functions, different LARP families may have evolved specialized activities in either snRNA or mRNA-related functions. In this review, we summarize recent progress that has led to greater understanding of the structure and function of La proteins and their roles in tRNA processing and RNP assembly dynamics, as well as progress on the different LARPs.",

The Paf1C is found in simple and complex eukaryotes; in human cells hSki8 is also part of the complex. The Paf1C has been linked to a large and growing list of transcription related processes including: communication with transcriptional activators; recruitment and activation of histone modification factors; facilitation of elongation on chromatin templates; and the recruitment of 3\u2032 end-processing factors necessary for accurate termination of transcription. Absence of, or mutations in, Paf1C factors result in alterations in gene expression that can result in misregulation of developmental programs and loss of control of cell division leading to cancer in humans. This review considers recent information that may help to resolve whether the Paf1C is primarily a \u201cplatform\u201d on pol II that coordinates the association of many critical transcription factors, or if the complex itself plays a more direct role in one or more steps in transcription.",

We previously demonstrated that AS-induced retention of part of intron 3 of rpL3 pre-mRNA produces an mRNA isoform that contains a PTC and is targeted for decay by NMD. We also demonstrated that overexpression of rpL3 downregulates canonical splicing and upregulates the alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanism underlying rpL3 autoregulation. Here we report that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1 is a transacting factor able to interact in vitro and in vivo with rpL3 and with intron 3 of the rpL3 gene. We investigated the role played by hnRNP H1 in the regulation of splicing of rpL3 pre-mRNA by manipulating its expression level. Depletion of hnRNP H1 reduced the level of the PTC-containing mRNA isoform, whereas its overexpression favored the selection of the cryptic 3\u2032 splice site of intron 3. We also identified and characterized the cis-acting regulatory elements involved in hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of splicing. RNA electromobility shift assay demonstrated that hnRNP H1 specifically recognizes and binds directly to the intron 3 region that contains seven copies of G-rich elements. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis and in vivo studies showed that the G3 and G6 elements are required for hnRNP H1-mediated regulation of rpL3 pre-mRNA splicing. We propose a working model in which rpL3 recruits hnRNP H1 and, through cooperation with other splicing factors, promotes selection of the alternative splice site.",

     "abstract": "The CBF/DREB1 transcriptional activators are key regulators of plant freezing tolerance. They are members of the AP2/ERF multi-gene family, which in Arabidopsis comprises about 145 members. Common to these proteins is the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain, a 60-amino-acid fold composed of a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet followed by a C-terminal \u03b1-helix. A feature that distinguishes the CBF proteins from the other AP2/ERF proteins is the presence of \u201csignature sequences,\u201d PKKP/RAGRxKFxETRHP (abbreviated PKKPAGR) and DSAWR, which are located immediately upstream and downstream, respectively, of the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain. The signature sequences are highly conserved in CBF proteins from diverse plant species suggesting that they have an important functional role. Here we show that the PKKPAGR sequence of AtCBF1 is essential for its transcriptional activity. Deletion of the sequence or mutations within it greatly impaired the ability of CBF1 to induce expression of its target genes. This impairment was not due to the mutations eliminating CBF1 localization to the nucleus or preventing protein accumulation. Rather, we show that this loss of function was due to the mutations greatly impairing the ability of the CBF1 protein to bind to its DNA recognition sequence, the CRT/DRE element. These results establish that the ability of the CBF proteins to bind to the CRT/DRE element requires amino acids that extend beyond the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain and raise the possibility that the PKKPAGR sequence contributes to determining the DNA-binding specificity of the CBF proteins.",

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of ER\u03b1-mediated transcription, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter focused microarrays (ChIP-chip) to identify ER\u03b1 binding sites in T-47D human breast cancer cells. Transcription factor binding site analysis revealed that the estrogen response element (ERE) was significantly over-represented and was found in 50% of the 243 ER\u03b1-bound regions identified. Interestingly, multiple ER\u03b1-bound regions were detected in the upstream regulatory sequences of the CYP2B gene cluster.

By archiving the viral genetic information in the genome of the host target cell and its progeny, integrated proviruses prevent curative therapy of HIV-1 and make the development of antiretroviral drug resistance irreversible. Although the integration reaction is known to be catalyzed by the viral integrase (IN), the manner in which retroviruses engage and attach to the chromatin target is only now becoming clear. Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that binds to lentiviral IN protein dimers at its carboxyl terminus and to host chromatin at its amino terminus. LEDGF/p75 thus tethers ectopically expressed IN to chromatin. It also protects IN from proteosomal degradation and can stimulate IN catalysis in vitro. HIV-1 infection is inhibited at the integration step in LEDGF/p75-deficient cells, and the characteristic lentiviral preference for integration into active genes is also reduced. A model in which LEDGF/p75 acts to tether the viral preintegration complex to chromatin has emerged. Intriguingly, similar chromatin tethering mechanisms have been described for other retroelements and for large DNA viruses. Here we review the evidence supporting the LEDGF/p75 tethering model and consider parallels with these other viruses.",

     "abstract": "High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer. HPVs establish persistent infection by maintaining their genomes as extrachromosomal elements (episomes) that replicate along with host DNA in infected cells. The productive life cycle of HPV is intimately tied to the differentiation program of host squamous epithelium. This review examines the involvement of host chromatin in multiple aspects of the papillomavirus life cycle and the malignant progression of infected host cells. Papillomavirus utilizes host mitotic chromosomes as vehicles for transmitting its genetic materials across the cell cycle. By hitchhiking on host mitotic chromosomes, the virus ensures accurate segregation of the replicated viral episomes to the daughter cells during host cell division. This strategy allows persistent maintenance of the viral episome in the infected cells. In the meantime, the virus subverts the host chromatin-remodeling factors to promote viral transcription and efficient propagation of viral genomes. By associating with the host chromatin, papillomavirus redirects the normal cellular control of chromatin to create a cellular environment conducive to both its own survival and malignant progression of host cells. Comprehensive understanding of HPV\u2013host chromatin interaction will offer new insights into the HPV life cycle as well as chromatin regulation. This virus\u2013host interaction will also provide a paradigm for investigating other episomal DNA tumor viruses that share a similar mechanism for interacting with host chromatin.",

     "abstract": "Epigenotypes are modified cellular or viral genotypes that differ in transcriptional activity in spite of having an identical or nearly identical DNA sequence. Restricted expression of latent, episomal Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) genomes is a consequence of a series of epigenetic modifications. In tight latency, there is no virus production (lytic viral replication, associated with the expression of all viral genes), and only a limited set of viral promoters is activated in a host-cell-dependent manner. The latent EBV promoters control the expression of growth-transformation-associated viral genes. The role of major epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of latent EBV promoters is variable. DNA methylation contributes to silencing of Wp and Cp (alternative promoters for transcripts coding for nuclear antigens EBNA 1-6) and LMP1p, LMP2Ap and LMP2Bp (promoters for transcripts encoding transmembrane proteins). DNA methylation does not control, however, Qp (a promoter for EBNA1 transcripts only) in B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs, immortalized by EBV in vitro), although in vitro methylated Qp-reporter gene constructs are silenced. The invariably unmethylated Qp is probably switched off by binding of a repressor protein in LCLs.Histone modifications may also contribute to the regulation of latent EBV promoters because the active Cp, Qp and LMP2Ap promoters that are marked by strong binding of cellular regulatory proteins are located on \u201cacetylation islands\u201d enriched in diacetylated histone H3 and tetraacetylated histone H4. We speculate that binding of the chromatin insulator protein CTCF to 3 distinct sites (within, close to and far from the matrix attachment region) may contribute to the three-dimensional organization of the viral episomes. We also raise the point that latent EBV episomes may relocate to new nuclear subcompartments before the start of lytic EBV replication. We propose that a similar relocation of EBV episomes may result in a promoter switch (from Qp to Cp) due to the access of Cp to a B-lymphoblast-specific transcription factory when in vitro cultivated Burkitt's lymphoma cells undergo a phenotypic drift.",

Evidence suggests that chromatin organization is important for each of these functions and plays a regulatory role in the establishment and maintenance of latent infection.

Transcription of the genome is limited to the Latency-Associated Transcript (LAT), while the lytic genes are maintained in a transcriptionally repressed state. This partitioning of the genome into areas of active and inactive transcription suggests epigenetic control of HSV-1 latent gene expression. During latency viral transcription is not regulated by DNA methylation but likely by post-translational histone modifications. The LAT region is the only region of the genome enriched in marks indicative of transcriptional permissiveness, specifically dimethyl H3 K4 and acetyl H3 K9, K14, while the lytic genes appear under-enriched in those same marks. In addition, facultative heterochromatin marks, specifically trimethyl H3 K27 and the histone variant macroH2A, are enriched on lytic genes during latency. The distinct epigenetic domains of the LAT and the lytic genes appear to be separated by chromatin insulators. Binding of CTCF, a protein that binds to all known vertebrate insulators, to sites within the HSV-1 genome likely prevents heterochromatic spreading and blocks enhancer activity. When the latent viral genome undergoes stress-induced reactivation, it is possible that CTCF binding and insulator function are abrogated, enabling lytic gene transcription to ensue. In this review we summarize our current understanding of latent HSV-1 epigenetic regulation as it pertains to infections in both the rabbit and mouse models. CTCF insulator function and regulation of histone tail modifications will be discussed. We will also present a current model of how the latent genome is carefully controlled at the epigenetic level and how stress-induced changes to it may trigger reactivation.",

     "abstract": "The human T-cell leukemia virus, type-1 (HTLV-1)-encoded Tax protein is required for high-level transcription of the virus. Tax function is strictly dependent upon the phosphorylated form of the cellular transcription factor CREB (pCREB), and together they bind novel cAMP response elements located within the viral promoter. The DNA-bound Tax/pCREB complex recruits the cellular coactivators CBP/p300, which are essential for viral gene expression. The coactivators, via their histone acetyltransferase activity, function to promote changes in chromatin architecture that are permissive to transcriptional activation. Tax expression in vivo recruits p300 to the HTLV-1 promoter and correlates with depletion of nucleosomes from the integrated provirus. We recently developed a novel in vitro, chromatin-based experimental system that recapitulates the eviction of nucleosomes from the HTLV-1 promoter observed in vivo. These assays establish the essential function of Tax/pCREB recruitment of CBP/p300, and concomitant histone acetylation, in the nucleosome disassembly process. These observations are of particular significance, as Tax mediates disassembly of the full nucleosome octamer independent of transcriptional activity and ATP utilization. Instead, nucleosome eviction is absolutely dependent upon acetyl CoA and the histone chaperone Nap1. In this review, we will discuss HTLV-1, Tax transactivation, and our recent findings that uncover the critical role of Tax in promoting chromatin transitions that accompany activation of viral transcription. We will describe the phenomenon of acetylation-dependent promoter nucleosome disassembly and the emerging view that the formation of nucleosome-free promoter regions may represent a general prerequisite for transcriptional activation in eukaryotes.",

     "abstract": "Infection of cells with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has two potential outcomes. For instance, infection of fibroblasts results in extensive viral gene expression, viral DNA replication and release of progeny virus. In contrast, in undifferentiated myeloid cells, the lytic transcription programme of HCMV is effectively suppressed and cells undergo latent infection.It is now accepted that the suppression of viral lytic gene expression observed during latency in myeloid cells is a result of the inability of undifferentiated cell types to support robust viral immediate early (IE) gene expression \u2014 crucial genes responsible for driving the lytic cycle. The repression of IE gene expression in undifferentiated myeloid cells, at least in part, results from specific post-translational modifications of histones associated with the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). In cells of the early myeloid lineage, the histone modifications present on the MIEP impart on it a repressive chromatin structure preventing transcriptional activity. Reactivation of HCMV lytic infection is correlated to changes in histone modifications around the MIEP resulting in a chromatin structure conducive to transcriptional activity. These changes are intimately linked with the differentiation of myeloid cells \u2014 a phenomenon known to reactivate latent virus in vivo. Chromatin structure of the viral MIEP, therefore, plays a crucial role in latency and reactivation of this persistent human herpesvirus.Whether chromatin-mediated regulation of viral lytic gene expression also occurs, is only beginning to be addressed. However, recent work suggests that all classes of lytic HCMV promoters are subjected to regulation by post-translational modification of their associated histones throughout the time course of infection. Incoming viral genomes appear to be the targets of intrinsic cellular defence mechanisms which attempt to silence viral gene expression through chromatinisation. Viral functions eventually overcome these cellular repression mechanisms permitting high levels of IE gene expression which results in modification of the chromatin structure of early and late gene promoters driving a regulated cascade of viral lytic gene expression and virus production.",

     "abstract": "Double-stranded DNA viruses display a great variety of proteins that interact with host chromatin. Using the wealth of available genomic and functional information, we have systematically surveyed chromatin-related proteins encoded by dsDNA viruses. The distribution of viral chromatin-related proteins is primarily influenced by viral genome size and the superkingdom to which the host of the virus belongs. Smaller viruses usually encode multifunctional proteins that mediate several distinct interactions with host chromatin proteins and viral or host DNA. Larger viruses additionally encode several enzymes, which catalyze manipulations of chromosome structure, chromatin remodeling and covalent modifications of proteins and DNA. Among these viruses, it is also common to encounter transcription factors and DNA-packaging proteins such as histones and IHF/HU derived from cellular genomes, which might play a role in constituting virus-specific chromatin states. Through all size ranges a subset of domains in viral chromatin proteins appears to have been derived from those found in host proteins. Examples include the Zn-finger domains of the E6 and E7 proteins of papillomaviruses, SET domain methyltransferases and Jumonji-related demethylases in certain nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and BEN domains in poxviruses and polydnaviruses. In other cases, chromatin-interacting modules, such as the LXCXE motif, appear to have been widely disseminated across distinct viral lineages, resulting in similar retinoblastoma targeting strategies. Viruses, especially those with large linear genomes, have evolved a number of mechanisms to manipulate viral chromosomes in the process of replication-associated recombination. These include topoisomerases, Rad50/SbcC-like ABC ATPases and a novel recombinase system in bacteriophages utilizing RecA and Rad52 homologs. Larger DNA viruses also encode SWI2/SNF2 and A18-like ATPases which appear to play specialized roles in transcription and recombination. Finally, it also appears that certain domains of viral provenance have given rise to key functions in eukaryotic chromatin such as a HEH domain of chromosome tethering proteins and the TET/JBP-like cytosine and thymine hydroxylases.",

The transcriptional coactivator CBP, which binds in a complex with the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme is recruited by the enhanceosome replacing PCAF/GCN5. Next, SWI/SNF, which is part of the holoenzyme complex, induces a conformational change in a nucleosome positioned over the transcriptional start site allowing TFIID to bind, which promotes the sliding of this nucleosome to a new downstream position. At this point the full pre-initiation complex is assembled and transcription commences.

The HMGA proteins are chromatin architectural factors which constitute critical hubs in these networks.

A particular feature of HMGA is their intrinsically disordered status, which confers on them an unusual plasticity in contacting molecular partners.

Accessibility of DNA within chromatin is a central factor that affects DNA-dependent nuclear function such as transcription, replication, recombination and repair. To integrate complex signalling networks associated with these events, many protein and multi-protein complexes associate transiently with nucleosomes. One class of such are the High-Mobility Group (HMG) proteins which are architectural DNA and nucleosome-binding proteins that may be subdivided into three families; HMGA (HMGI/Y/C), HMGB (HMG1/2) and HMGN (HMG14/17). The structure of chromatin and nucleosomes can be altered, both locally and globally, by interaction with such architectural proteins thereby influencing accessibility of DNA. This chapter deals with the HMGN protein family, specifically their post-translational modification as part of regulatory networks. We focus particularly on HMGN1, the most extensively studied family member to date, and to a lesser extent on HMGN2.

HMGBs (there are four HMGBs in mammals, HMGB1\u20134) are highly abundant and ubiquitously expressed non-histone proteins, acting as DNA chaperones influencing multiple processes in chromatin such as transcription, replication, recombination, DNA repair and genomic stability. Although HMGB1 is a nuclear protein, it can be secreted into the extracellular milieu as a signaling molecule when cells are under stress, in particular, when necrosis occurs. Mammalian HMGBs contain two HMG-boxes arranged in tandem, share more than 80% identity and differ in the length (HMGB1-3) or absence (HMGB4) of the acidic C-tails. The acidic tails consist of consecutive runs of only Glu/Asp residues of various length, and modulate the DNA-binding properties and functioning of HMGBs. HMGBs are subject to post-translational modifications which can fine-tune interactions of the proteins with DNA/chromatin and determine their relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and secretion. Association of HMGBs with chromatin is highly dynamic, and the proteins affect the chromatin fiber as architectural factors by transient interactions with nucleosomes, displacement of histone H1, and facilitation of nucleosome remodeling and accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA to transcription factors or other sequence-specific proteins.",

HMGB1 has been successfully therapeutically targeted in multiple preclinical models of infectious and sterile diseases including arthritis. Extracellular HMGB1 mediates inflammation via induction of cytokine and metalloproteinase production and recruitment and activation of dendritic cells needed for priming of na\u00efve T helper type 1 lymphocytes. HMGB1 can bind endogenous molecules such as IL-1\u03b2 and nucleosomes and exogenous agents like endotoxin and microbial DNA. These complexes synergistically increase the capacity for activation of adaptive and innate immunity. HMGB1\u2013nucleosome complexes induce autoantibody formation against double-stranded DNA and nucleosomes, which does not occur if HMGB1 is absent. These antibodies are central in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus and patients with active disease have both increased HMGB1 and HMGB1-nucleosome levels in circulation. Furthermore, HMGB1 is strongly bipolar charged, enabling cell membrane passage and intracellular transport of complexed molecules including DNA. Rheumatoid arthritis patients have excessive extracellular HMGB1 levels in joints and serum. The HMGB1 release is caused by cytokines, activated complement and hypoxia. The most prominent HMGB1 protein and mRNA expression arthritis is present in pannus regions, where synovial tissue invades articular cartilage and bone. HMGB1 promotes the activity of proteolytic enzymes, and osteoclasts need HMGB1 for functional maturation.

     "abstract": "Extracellularly occurring HMGB1, either released during cell injury or actively secreted from cells, has profound effects on behaviour of a wide variety of cell types. Extracellular HMGB1 regulates migratory responses of many cell types, including neuron and growth cone migration, invasive migration of tumour cells, and migration of endothelial and immune cells. RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products) plays a key role as a cell surface receptor in most, if not all HMGB1-dependent migration mechanisms. HMGB1 binds to the distal immunoglobulin-like domain of RAGE, activating a signalling pathway that ends up in modulation of the cytoskeleton for regulation of cell motility. In addition to RAGE, proteoglycans and sulfated carbohydrate epitopes of glycolipids and glycoproteins may play a role as cell surface binding sites of HMGB1, affecting migratory behaviour of cells.In addition to physiological and pathophysiological cell migration control, HMGB1 has been widely studied as a molecule linking tissue injury to inflammatory mechanisms. HMGB1 by itself has little if any proinflammatory activity but it appears to activate innate immunity mechanisms as a complex with DNA, lipids and/or proinflammatory cytokines. The inflammation-inducing activity of HMGB1/DNA complexes may depend on both RAGE and Toll-like receptors of the immune cell surface. In addition to the receptors activating innate immunity, receptors downregulating inflammation upon HMGB1 release have been recently found, and include thrombomodulin and the CD-24/Siglec pathway.",

     "abstract": "Proteins belonging to the chromosomal HMGA and HMGB families have been identified in a broad range of plant species. In this article, we describe the family of HMGB proteins, which, in plants, are more diversified than in other eukaryotes. There are differences between various plant HMGB proteins regarding several properties including expression pattern, DNA\u2013 and chromatin\u2013interactions, posttranslational modifications, subcellular localisation, and interaction with other proteins, suggesting that plants have a broad repertoire of these architectural chromosomal proteins. Recent results in the Arabidopsis model system indicate that the HMGB proteins have (partially) specialised functions and are required for proper development. In addition, they are involved in plant tolerance to different stress conditions.",

     "abstract": "The small Nhp6 protein from budding yeast is an abundant protein that binds DNA non-specifically and bends DNA sharply. It contains only a single HMGB domain that binds DNA in the minor groove and a basic N-terminal extension that wraps around DNA to contact the major groove. This review describes the genetic and biochemical experiments that indicate Nhp6 functions in promoting RNA pol III transcription, in formation of preinitiation complexes at promoters transcribed by RNA pol II, and in facilitating the activity of chromatin modifying complexes. The FACT complex may provide a paradigm for how Nhp6 functions with chromatin factors, as Nhp6 allows Spt16-Pob3 to bind to and reorganize nucleosomes in vitro.",
