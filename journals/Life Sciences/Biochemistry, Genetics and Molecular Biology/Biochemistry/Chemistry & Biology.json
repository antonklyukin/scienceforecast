     "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can survive in hypoxic necrotic tissue by assimilating energy from host-derived fatty acids. While the expanded repertoire of \u03b2-oxidation auxiliary enzymes is considered crucial for Mtb adaptability, delineating their functional relevance has been challenging. Here, we show that the Mtb fatty acid degradation (FadAB) complex cannot selectively break down cis fatty acyl substrates. We demonstrate that the stereoselective binding of fatty acyl substrates in the Mtb FadB pocket is due to the steric hindrance from Phe287 residue. By developing a functional screen, we classify the family of Mtb Ech proteins as monofunctional or bifunctional enzymes, three of which complement the FadAB complex to degrade cis fatty acids. Crystal structure determination of two cis-trans enoyl coenzyme A (CoA) isomerases reveals distinct placement of active-site residue in Ech enzymes. Our studies thus reveal versatility of Mtb lipid-remodeling enzymes and identify an essential role of stand-alone cis-trans enoyl CoA isomerases in mycobacterial biology.",

Selective pharmacological modulators of bromodomains are lacking, although the largely hydrophobic nature of the pocket makes these modules attractive targets for small-molecule inhibitors. This work describes the structure-based design of a highly selective inhibitor of the CREB binding protein (CBP) bromodomain and its use in cell-based transcriptional profiling experiments. The inhibitor downregulated a number of inflammatory genes in macrophages that were not affected by a selective BET bromodomain inhibitor. In addition, the CBP bromodomain inhibitor modulated the mRNA level of the regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) gene in neurons, suggesting a potential therapeutic opportunity for CBP inhibitors in the treatment of neurological disorders.",

To cope with this high intracellular salinity, halophilic organisms modified the chemical composition of their proteins to enrich their surface with acidic and short polar side chains, while lysines and bulky hydrophobic residues got depleted. We have emulated the evolutionary process of haloadaptation with natural and designed halophilic polypeptides and applied novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology to study the different mechanisms contributing to protein haloadaptation at a per residue level. Our analysis of an extensive set of NMR observables, determined over several proteins, allowed us to disentangle the synergistic contributions of protein haloadaptation: cation exclusion and electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged residues destabilize the denatured state ensemble while cumulative weak cation-protein interactions stabilize the folded conformations.",

However, unlike ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2 has not been developed as a therapeutic target in breast cancer due to loss of ER\u03b2 in\u00a0aggressive cancers. In a small-molecule library screen for ER\u03b2 stabilizers, we identified Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), which significantly increases ER\u03b2 protein stability while decreasing ER\u03b1 protein levels. Dip G enhances the transcription and anti-proliferative activities of ER\u03b2, while attenuating the transcription and proliferative effects of ER\u03b1.

Disruption of heptose biosynthesis offers an attractive target for novel antimicrobials. A critical step in the synthesis of heptoses is\u00a0their 1-O phosphorylation, mediated by kinases such as HldE or WcbL. Here, we present the structure of WcbL from Burkholderia pseudomallei. We report that WcbL operates through a sequential ordered Bi-Bi mechanism, loading the heptose first and then ATP. We show that dimeric WcbL binds ATP anti-cooperatively in the absence of heptose, and cooperatively in its presence. Modeling of WcbL suggests that heptose binding causes an elegant switch in the hydrogen-bonding network, facilitating the binding of a second ATP molecule. Finally, we screened a library of drug-like fragments, identifying hits that potently inhibit WcbL. Our results provide a novel mechanism for control of substrate binding and emphasize WcbL as an attractive anti-microbial target for Gram-negative bacteria.",

The most potent S-tide derivative (S1.5) increased the open probability of the potassium channel KCa1.1 to levels equivalent to saturating cGMP. Introduction of S1.5 to smooth muscle cells in isolated, endothelium-denuded cerebral arteries through a modified reversible permeabilization procedure inhibited myogenic constriction. In contrast, in endothelium-intact vessels S1.5 had no effect on myogenic tone.

Further analysis of the lipidome during apoptosis in other cancer and non-cancer cell lines suggested that accumulation of ceramides and dihydroceramides is specific to cancer cells.

Most notably, the key A.\u00a0baumannii virulence factor, OmpA, was identified as crosslinked to host proteins involved in desmosomes, specialized structures that mediate host cell-to-cell adhesion. Co-immunoprecipitation and transposon mutant experiments were used to verify these interactions and demonstrate relevance for host cell invasion and acute murine lung infection. These results shed new light on A.\u00a0baumannii-host protein interactions and their structural features, and the presented approach is generally applicable to other systems.",

Optogenetic control of dominant negative versions of endogenous transcription factors provides a mechanism for mimicking the natural regulation of gene expression. Here we describe opto-DN-CREB, a blue-light-controlled inhibitor of the transcription factor CREB created by fusing the dominant negative inhibitor A-CREB to photoactive yellow protein (PYP). A light-driven conformational change in PYP prevents coiled-coil formation between A-CREB and CREB, thereby activating CREB. Optogenetic control of CREB function was characterized in\u00a0vitro, in HEK293T cells, and in neurons where blue light enabled control of expression of the CREB targets NR4A2 and c-Fos. Dominant negative inhibitors exist\u00a0for numerous transcription factors; linking these to optogenetic domains offers a general approach for spatiotemporal control of native transcriptional events.",

Here, we employ chemical biology methods for UPR regulation to show that stress-independent activation of the UPR\u2019s XBP1s transcription factor also induces a panel of N-glycan maturation-related enzymes. The downstream consequence is a distinctive shift toward specific hybrid and complex N-glycans on N-glycoproteins produced from XBP1s-activated cells, which we characterize by mass spectrometry. Pulse-chase studies attribute this shift specifically to altered N-glycan processing, rather than to changes in degradation or secretion rates.

Swapping is triggered by inserting a \u201clever\u201d protein (ubiquitin) into one of four loops of the ribose binding protein (RBP) target. The lever splits the target, forcing RBP to refold in trans to generate swapped oligomers. Identical RBP-ubiquitin fusions form homo-swapped complexes with the ubiquitin domain acting as the hinge. Surprisingly, some pairs of non-identical fusions swap more efficiently with each other than they do with themselves. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal that the hinge of these hetero-swapped complexes maps to a region of RBP distant from both ubiquitins.

Small changes in the structure of designed inhibitors can induce significant conformational changes in the \u03b2-glucuronidase active site. Finally, we establish that \u03b2-glucuronidase inhibition does not alter the serum pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its metabolites in mice.

Here, we discovered that the insensitivity of cancer cells to THPN originated from a high cellular Akt2 activity. Akt2 phosphorylation interferes with TR3 export to cytoplasm and targeting to mitochondria, which lead to the autophagic induction. Therefore, the TR3-mediated autophagy could be effectively induced in the otherwise insensitive cells by downregulating Akt2 activity. Highly effective antineoplastic compounds are developed through optimizing the structure of THPN.

Here, we report the structure of the ZTP riboswitch bound to ZMP at a resolution of 1.80\u00a0\u00c5. The RNA contains two subdomains brought together through a long-range pseudoknot further stabilized through helix-helix packing. ZMP is bound at the subdomain interface of the RNA through a set of interactions with the\u00a0base, ribose sugar, and phosphate moieties of the ligand. Unique to nucleobase recognition by RNAs, the Z base is inner-sphere coordinated to a magnesium cation bound by two backbone phosphates. This interaction, along with steric hindrance by the backbone, imparts specificity over chemically similar compounds such as ATP/AMP.",

ZMP is known to act as an allosteric activator of the cellular energy sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), when exogenously administered as the corresponding cell-permeable ribonucleoside.

Notably, Trp7.35 is completely conserved in all known DOR sequences from lamprey, fish, and amphibians. The deltorphin-insensitive phenotype was verified in fish. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the species selectivity of skin-derived opioid peptides.",

     "abstract": "Binding of transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) extracellular domain is encoded through the formation of a unique antiparallel coiled coil within the juxtamembrane segment. This new coiled coil is an \u201cinside-out\u201d version of the coiled coil formed in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). A third, intermediary coiled-coil interface is formed in the juxtamembrane region when EGFR is stimulated with betacellulin. The seven growth factors that activate EGFR in mammalian systems (EGF, TGF-\u03b1, epigen, epiregulin, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and amphiregulin) fall into distinct categories in which the structure of the coiled coil induced within the juxtamembrane region correlates with cell state. The observation that coiled-coil state tracks with the downstream signaling profiles for each ligand provides evidence for growth factor functional selectivity by EGFR. Encoding growth factor identity in alternative coiled-coil rotamers provides a simple and elegant method for communicating chemical information across the plasma membrane.",

In 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), heterozygous deletion of DiGeorge critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) causes a processing deficiency, which contributes to abnormal brain development. The DGCR8 protein is the RNA-binding partner of Drosha RNase, both essential for processing canonical pri-miRNAs. To identify an agent that can compensate reduced DGCR8 expression, we screened for metalloporphyrins that can mimic the natural DGCR8 heme cofactor. We found that Co(III) protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) stably binds DGCR8 and activates it for pri-miRNA processing in\u00a0vitro and in HeLa cells.

The biosynthesis of HHQ is generally accepted to require the pqsABCD gene products. We now reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway in\u00a0vitro, and demonstrate that in addition to PqsABCD, PqsE has a role in HHQ synthesis. PqsE acts as thioesterase, hydrolyzing the biosynthetic intermediate 2-aminobenzoylacetyl-coenzyme A to form 2-aminobenzoylacetate, the precursor of HHQ and 2-aminoacetophenone. The role of PqsE can be taken over to some extent by the broad-specificity thioesterase TesB, explaining why the pqsE deletion mutant of P.\u00a0aeruginosa still synthesizes HHQ. Interestingly, the pqsE mutant produces increased levels of 2,4-dihydroxyquinoline, resulting from intramolecular cyclization of 2-aminobenzoylacetyl-coenzyme A.

The study of the molecular mechanism of inhibition indicates that tamoxifen interacts with p25 to block the CDK5/p25 interaction and pave the way for new treatments of tauopathies.",

In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, a proteolytic virulence factor, LasB, is one such target. Unfortunately, we and others have not been successful in translating in\u00a0vitro potency of LasB inhibitors to in\u00a0vivo efficacy in an animal model. To overcome this obstacle, we now integrate in\u00a0silico and in\u00a0vitro identification of the mercaptoacetamide motif as an effective class of LasB inhibitors with full in\u00a0vivo characterization of mercaptoacetamide prodrugs using Caenorhabditis elegans.

Vitamin biosynthetic pathways are normally tightly regulated, including the pathway from pantothenate to CoA. However, no regulation of pantothenate biosynthesis has been identified. We have recently described an additional component in the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway, PanZ, which promotes the activation of the zymogen, PanD, to\u00a0form aspartate \u03b1-decarboxylase (ADC) in a CoA-dependent manner. Here we report the structure of PanZ in complex with PanD, which reveals the structural basis for the CoA dependence of this interaction and activation. In addition, we show that PanZ acts\u00a0as a CoA-dependent inhibitor of ADC catalysis. This inhibitory effect can effectively regulate the biosynthetic pathway to pantothenate, and thereby also regulate CoA biosynthesis.

Our most promising derivative is a cyclic heptapseudopeptide with inconsequential toxicity to human cells, enhanced stability in human sera, and sharp antibacterial activity. Mechanistically, linear and helical PepA1 derivatives form pores at the bacterial and erythrocyte surfaces, while the cyclic peptide induces bacterial envelope reorganization, with insignificant action on the erythrocytes.

Comprehensive dimerization yielded a relatively uncrowded spectrum, composed solely of even-sized oligomers. Modification at one or two serines decreased the average oligomeric size, while the triple mutant was predominantly a dimer. These changes were reflected in a greater propensity for oligomers to dissociate upon increased modification.

Competition for bacterial binding to CD98 and downregulation of CD98 expression may represent novel mechanisms for the antibacterial activity of hBD3.",

Surprisingly, we observe that the nor PKS can mediate an additional chain elongation to yield the higher homolog homoneoaureothin. Furthermore, we design several truncated variants of the nor PKS to use them in the context of artificial assembly lines for aureothin and homoaureothin. The resulting polypropionate derivatives provide valuable insights into chain length control and reveal structure-activity relationships relating to the size of the polypropionate backbones. Overall, we show that iterative modules are remarkably adaptable while downstream modules are gatekeepers that select for correct polyketide chain length.",

These nematode-derived modular metabolites (NDMMs) are based on the dideoxysugars ascarylose and paratose, which serve as scaffolds for the attachment of moieties from lipid, amino acid, neurotransmitter, and nucleoside metabolism. Although preliminary biosynthetic studies have confirmed the primary metabolism origin of some of the building blocks incorporated into NDMMs, the mechanisms that underlie their highly specific assembly are not understood.

     "abstract": "Early detection of colonic polyps can prevent up to 90% of colorectal cancer deaths. Conventional colonoscopy readily detects the majority of premalignant lesions, which exhibit raised morphology. However, lesions that are flat and depressed are often undetected using this method. Therefore, there is a need for molecular-based contrast agents to improve detection rates over conventional colonoscopy. We evaluated a quenched fluorescent activity-based probe (qABP; BMV109) that targets multiple cysteine cathepsins that are overexpressed in intestinal dysplasia in a genetic model of spontaneous intestinal polyp formation and in a chemically induced model of colorectal carcinoma. We found that the qABP selectively targets cysteine cathepsins, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity for intestinal tumors in mice and humans. Additionally, the qABP can be administered by either intravenous injection or by local delivery to the colon, making it a highly valuable tool for improved detection of colorectal lesions using fluorescence-guided colonoscopy.",

Despite the data supporting an indispensable role of the primary cilium in Smo activation, the mechanistic underpinnings of this dependency remain unclear. Using a cell-membrane-impermeable Smo antagonist (IHR-1), we demonstrate that Smo supplied with a synthetic agonist or activated with oncogenic mutations can signal without ciliary accumulation. Similarly, cells with compromised ciliary Smo trafficking due to loss of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-C2\u03b1 retain transcriptional response to an exogenously supplied Smo agonist.

During prometa-metaphase, P5 is accumulated around the spindle poles. Depletion of P5 induces multipolar spindles that result from premature centriole disengagement, which are rescued by ectopic introduction of P5, but not its downstream metabolites, into the cells. Premature centriole disengagement, induced by loss of P5, is not a result of precocious activation of separase, a key factor for the centriole disengagement in anaphase. Rather, P5 directly binds to the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of short-form of shugoshin 1 (sSgo1), a protector for centriole cohesion and recruits it to spindle poles in mitosis. Our results thus reveal a steroid-mediated centriole protection mechanism.",

The great diversity of angucyclinones is generated in tailoring reactions, which modify the common benz[a]anthraquinone carbon skeleton. In particular, the opposite stereochemistry of landomycins and urdamycins/gaudimycins at C-6\u00a0is generated by the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases LanV and UrdMred/CabV, respectively. Here we present crystal structures of LanV and UrdMred in complex with NADP+ and the product analog rabelomycin, which enabled us to identify four regions associated with the functional differentiation. The structural analysis was confirmed in chimeragenesis experiments focusing on these regions adjacent to the active site cavity, which led to\u00a0reversal of the activities of LanV and CabV. The results surprisingly indicated that the conformation of the substrate and the stereochemical outcome of 6-ketoreduction appear to be intimately linked.",

     "abstract": "Recalcitrant microbial infections demand new therapeutic options. Here we present an approach that exploits two prongs of the host immune cell antimicrobial response: the oxidative burst and the compartmentalization of copper (Cu) within phagolysosomes. The prochelator QBP is a nontoxic protected form of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) in which a\u00a0pinanediol boronic ester blocks metal ion coordination by 8HQ. QBP is deprotected via reactive oxygen\u00a0species produced by activated macrophages, creating 8HQ and eliciting Cu-dependent killing of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans in\u00a0vitro and in mouse pulmonary infection. 8HQ ionophoric activity increases intracellular Cu, overwhelming the Cu-resistance mechanisms of C.\u00a0neoformans to elicit fungal killing. The Cu-dependent antimicrobial activity of 8HQ against a spectrum of microbial pathogens suggests that this strategy may have broad utility. The conditional activation of Cu ionophores by innate immune cells intensifies the hostile antimicrobial environment and represents a promising approach to combat infectious disease.",

Strigolactones and cotylimides also promoted an interaction between HTL/KAI2 and the F-box protein MAX2 in yeast. Identification of this chemically dependent protein-protein interaction prompted the development of a yeast-based, high-throughput chemical screen for potential strigolactone mimics. Of the 40 lead compounds identified, three were found to have in planta strigolactone activity using Arabidopsis-based assays. More importantly, these three compounds were all found to stimulate suicide germination of the obligate parasitic plant Striga hermonthica.

     "abstract": "Gliotoxin is a redox-active nonribosomal peptide produced by Aspergillus fumigatus. Like many other disulfide-containing epipolythiodioxopiperazines, a bis-thiomethylated form is also produced. In the case of gliotoxin, bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin (BmGT) is formed for unknown reasons by a cryptic enzyme. Here, we identify the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent gliotoxin bis-thiomethyltransferase (GtmA), which converts dithiogliotoxin to BmGT. This activity, which is induced by exogenous gliotoxin, is only detectable in protein lysates of A. fumigatus deficient in the gliotoxin oxidoreductase, gliT. Thus, GtmA is capable of substrate bis-thiomethylation. Deletion of gtmA completely abrogates BmGT formation and we now propose that the purpose of\u00a0BmGT formation is primarily to attenuate gliotoxin biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analysis reveals 124 GtmA homologs within the Ascomycota phylum. GtmA is encoded outside the gliotoxin biosynthetic cluster and primarily serves to negatively regulate gliotoxin biosynthesis. This mechanism of postbiosynthetic regulation of nonribosomal peptide synthesis appears to be quite unusual.",

We report an unusual mechanism of proteasome inhibition that involves a hydroamination reaction of alkene derivatives of the epoxyketone natural product carmaphycin. We show that the carmaphycin enone first forms a hemiketal intermediate with the catalytic Thr1 residue of the proteasome before cyclization by an unanticipated intramolecular alkene hydroamination reaction, resulting in a stable six-membered morpholine ring. The carmaphycin enone electrophile, which does not undergo a 1,4-Michael addition as previously observed with vinyl sulfone and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated amide-based inhibitors, is partially reversible and gives insight into the design of proteasome inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy.",

AMPK signaling is triggered by phosphorylation on the AMPK \u03b1 subunit activation loop Thr172 by upstream kinases. Dephosphorylated, naive AMPK is thought to be catalytically inactive and insensitive to allosteric regulation by AMP and direct AMPK-activating drugs such as A-769662.

Here, we use single nanoparticle imaging to measure the local H2O2 concentration and reveal regulation of the ROS response dynamics and organization to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling. We demonstrate that H2O2 production is controlled by PDGFR kinase activity and EGFR transactivation, requires a persistent stimulation, and is regulated by membrane receptor diffusion. This temporal filtering is impaired in cancer cells, which may determine their pathological migration.

One basic challenge is the difficulty of expressing a biosynthesis pathway for a complex natural product in a heterologous eukaryotic host. Here, we provide a proof-of concept solution to this challenge and describe how the entire penicillin biosynthesis pathway can be expressed in a heterologous host. The method takes advantage of a combination of improved yeast in\u00a0vivo cloning technology, generation of polycistronic mRNA for the gene cluster under study, and an amenable and easily manipulated fungal host, i.e., Aspergillus nidulans. We achieve expression from a single promoter of the pathway genes to yield a large polycistronic mRNA by using viral 2A peptide sequences to direct successful cotranslational cleavage of pathway enzymes.",

Lassomycin is a highly basic, ribosomally encoded cyclic peptide with an unusual structural fold\u00a0that only partially resembles that of other lasso peptides.

Chemical analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data revealed that O2 activation in the enzyme\u2019s active site is substrate-assisted, relying on single electron transfer from the bound substrate anion to O2 to form a radical pair, which recombines to a C2-peroxide intermediate. Thus, an oxygenase can function without a cofactor, if the organic substrate itself, after activation to a (carb)anion by an\u00a0active-site base, is intrinsically reactive toward molecular oxygen.",

Their partition depends on the lipid composition of a given phase, which complicates their use in cellular membranes.

We demonstrate that octanoic acid is directly incorporated into HHQ. This finding rules out the long-standing hypothesis that 3-ketofatty acids are the precursors of HAQs. We found that HAQ biosynthesis, which requires the PqsABCD enzymes, proceeds by a two-step pathway: (1) PqsD mediates the synthesis of 2-aminobenzoylacetate (2-ABA) from anthraniloyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl-CoA, then (2) the decarboxylating coupling of 2-ABA to an octanoate group linked to PqsC produces HHQ, the direct precursor of PQS. PqsB is tightly associated with PqsC and required for the second step. This finding uncovers promising targets for the development of specific antivirulence drugs to combat this opportunistic pathogen.",

In this study, we investigated the different stereoselectivities of these enzymes toward all the stereoisomers of cyclo-Trp-Ala and cyclo-Trp-Pro. The stereoselectivities of AnaPT and CdpC3PT mainly depend on the configuration of the tryptophanyl moiety in the substrates, and they usually introduce the prenyl moiety from the opposite sides. CdpNPT showed lower stereoselectivity, and the structure of the second amino acid moiety in the substrates is important for the stereospecificity in its enzyme catalysis. Moreover, we determined the crystal structure of AnaPT in complex with thiolodiphosphate and compared it with the known structures of CdpNPT.

We identified several compounds that discourage CsgA amyloid formation and several compounds that accelerate CsgA amyloid formation. The ability of inhibitor compounds to\u00a0stop growing CsgA fibers was compared to the same property of the CsgA chaperone, CsgE. CsgE blocked CsgA amyloid assembly and arrested polymerization when added to actively polymerizing fibers. Additionally, CsgE and the 2-pyridone inhibitors prevented biofilm formation by Escherichia coli at the air-liquid interface of a static culture. We demonstrate that curli amyloid assembly and curli-dependent biofilm formation can be modulated not only by protein chaperones, but also by \u201cchemical chaperones.\u201d",

We find that the cobT gene product, which activates lower ligand bases for attachment, limits the range of lower ligand bases that can be incorporated by bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the substrate specificity of CobT can be predictably altered by changing two active site residues. These results demonstrate that sequence variations in cobT homologs contribute to cobamide structural diversity.

Cobamides are cobalt-containing tetrapyrroles with upper and lower axial ligands. The structure of the lower ligand varies in cobamides produced by different bacteria. We investigated the biochemical basis of this structural variability by exploring the reactivity of homologs of CobT, the enzyme responsible for activating lower ligand bases for incorporation into cobamides. Our results show that CobT enzymes can activate a range of lower ligand substrates, and the majority of the enzymes tested preferentially attach 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of cobalamin.

Notably, the new domains in AARSs are often found to be structurally disordered or to be linked to the enzyme cores via unstructured linkers. We performed bioinformatic analysis and classified the 20 human cytoplasmic AARSs into three groups based on their propensities for structural disorder.

This assay enables quantitative analysis of PDZ domain-mediated protein clustering using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). Two nonfluorescent halves of EYFP were fused to C-terminal PDZ ligand sequences to generate probes that sense for PDZ domain binding grooves of adjacent (interacting) molecules. When these probes are brought into proximity by the PDZ domains of a multiprotein scaffold, a functional fluorescent EYFP molecule can be detected. We have used this system to examine the properties of selected PSD-95 variants and thereby delineated regions of importance for PSD-95 complex formation. Further analysis led to the finding that PSD-95 multimerization is PDZ domain-mediated and promoted by ligand binding.",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a correlation between high expression and enrichment of activating H3K9-acetylation marks under inducing conditions. We provide evidence that only four genes are sufficient for the biosynthesis. The combination of genetic engineering with nuclear magnetic resonance and mass-spectrometry-based structure elucidation allowed the discovery of the putative fusarin biosynthetic pathway. Surprisingly, we indicate that PKS/NRPS releases its product with an open ring structure, probably as an alcohol. Our data indicate that 2-pyrrolidone ring closure, oxidation at C-20, and, finally, methylation at C-20 are catalyzed by Fus2, Fus8, and Fus9, respectively.",

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that McyL belongs to a family of enzymes that inactivate antibiotics through O-acetylation.

AsuE1 and AsuE3, both single-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, catalyze the exquisite regio- and enantiospecific postpolyketide synthase (PKS) assembly oxygenations. AsuE1 installs a hydroxyl group on the 3,4-AHB ring to form a 4-hydroxyquinone moiety, which is epoxidized by AsuE3 to yield the epoxyquinone functionality.

Diketopiperazine (DKP) formation is carried out by a tRNA-dependent cyclodipeptide synthase (CDPS) showing an unknown product profile, while tailoring of the DKP-scaffold is achieved through the combined and combinatorial\u00a0action of a cyclodipeptide oxidase and two distinct\u00a0SAM-dependent O-/N-methyltransferases. Our results help to illuminate the biosynthetic logic resulting in the structural diversity of the nocazine family and set the stage for exploring the biological function of modified cyclic dipeptides as possible mediators of host-pathogen and host-parasite interactions.",

HRM biosynthetic studies have been hampered by inconsistent and low production. To enhance fermentation titers, the role of its cluster-encoded regulatory genes was investigated. Extra copies of the putative regulators hrmA and hrmB were introduced into the wild-type strain, resulting in an increase of HRM production and its analogs up to 135-fold. For the HrmB overproducer, six bioactive analogs were isolated and characterized. This study demonstrates that HrmA and HrmB are positive regulators in HRM biosynthesis. A third gene, hrmH, was identified as encoding a protein capable of shifting the metabolic profile of HRM and its derivatives. Its manipulation resulted in the generation of an additional HRM analog.",

Herein, we applied activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) that allows for the identification of differentially active enzymes in complex proteomic samples, to study the changes in activity of FASN during HCV replication. For this purpose, we used an activity-based probe based on the FASN inhibitor Orlistat, and observed an increase in the activity of FASN in the presence of a subgenomic and a genomic HCV replicon as well as in chimeric SCID/Alb-uPA mice infected with HCV genotype 1a. To study the molecular basis for this increase in FASN activity, we overexpressed individual HCV proteins in Huh7 cells and observed increased expression and activity of FASN in the presence of core and NS4B, as measured by western blots and ABPP, respectively. Triglyceride levels were also elevated in accordance with FASN expression and activity. Lastly, immunofluorescence and ABPP imaging analyses demonstrated that while the abundance and activity of FASN increases significantly in the presence of HCV, its localization does not change. Together these data suggest that the HCV-induced production of fatty acids and neutral lipids is provided by an increase in FASN abundance and activity that is sufficient to allow HCV propagation without transporting FASN to the replication complexes.",

As part of a program aimed toward the identification of inhibitors of SUMO-conjugating enzymes, we developed a microfluidic electrophoretic mobility shift assay to monitor sumoylation events in real time. We disclose herein the use of this assay to identify a cell-permeable compound capable of blocking the transfer of SUMO-1 from the E2 enzyme Ubc9 to the substrate. We screened a small collection of compounds and identified an oxygenated flavonoid derivative that inhibits sumoylation in\u00a0vitro. Next, we carried out an in-depth mechanistic analysis that ruled out many common false-positive mechanisms such as aggregation or alkylation. Furthermore, we report that this flavonoid inhibits a single step in the sumoylation cascade: the transfer of SUMO from the E2 enzyme (Ubc9) thioester conjugate to the substrate. In addition to having a unique mechanism of action, this inhibitor has a discrete structure-activity relationship uncharacteristic of a promiscuous inhibitor. Cell-based studies showed that the flavonoid inhibits the sumoylation of topoisomerase-I in response to camptothecin treatment in two different breast cancer cell lines, while isomeric analogs are inactive. Importantly, this compound blocks sumoylation while not affecting ubiquitylation in cells. This work identifies a point of entry for pharmacologic inhibition of the sumoylation cascade and may serve as the basis for continued study of additional pharmacophores that modulate SUMO-conjugating enzymes such as Ubc9.",

The attachment of cytotoxic drugs to antibodies can result in an effective therapy with better safety potential than nontargeted cytotoxics. To understand the role of conjugation site, we developed an enzymatic method for site-specific antibody drug conjugation using microbial transglutaminase. This allowed us to attach diverse compounds at multiple positions and investigate how the site influences stability, toxicity, and efficacy. We show that the conjugation site has significant impact on ADC stability and pharmacokinetics in a species-dependent manner. These differences can be directly attributed to the position of the linkage rather than the chemical instability, as was observed with a maleimide linkage.

This probe displays various AvrPphB isoforms in bacterial extracts, upon secretion and inside the host plant. We show that AvrPphB is secreted as a proprotease and that secretion requires the prodomain, but probably does not involve a pH-dependent unfolding mechanism. The prodomain removal is required for the ability of AvrPphB to trigger a hypersensitive cell death in resistant host plants, presumably since processing exposes a hidden acylation site required for subcellular targeting in the host cell. We detected two active isoforms of AvrPphB in planta, of which the major one localizes exclusively to membranes.",

Several Hsp70 isoforms, especially Hsp72 (HSPA1A), are dramatically upregulated in response to stress; however, it is unclear whether these family members have biochemical properties that are specifically adapted to these scenarios. The redox-active compound, methylene blue (MB), has been shown to inhibit the ATPase activity of Hsp72 in\u00a0vitro, and it promotes degradation of the Hsp72 substrate, tau, in cellular and animal models. Here, we report that MB irreversibly inactivates Hsp72 but not the nearly identical, constitutively expressed isoform, heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70; HSPA8). Mass spectrometry results show that MB oxidizes Cys306, which is not conserved in Hsc70. Molecular models suggested that oxidation of Cys306 exposes Cys267 to modification and that both events contribute to loss of ATP binding in response to MB. Consistent with this model, mutating Cys267 and Cys306 to serine made Hsp72 largely resistant to MB in\u00a0vitro, and overexpression of the C306S mutant blocked MB-mediated loss of tau in a cellular model. Furthermore, mutating Cys267 and Cys306 to the pseudo-oxidation mimic, aspartic acid, mirrored MB treatment: the C267D and C306D mutants had reduced ATPase activity in\u00a0vitro, and overexpression of the C267/306D double mutant significantly reduced tau levels in cells.

     "abstract": "NagZ is a glycoside hydrolase that participates in peptidoglycan (PG) recycling by removing \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine from PG fragments that are excised from the bacterial cell wall during growth. Notably, the products formed by NagZ, 1,6-anhydroMurNAc-peptides, activate \u03b2-lactam resistance in many Gram-negative bacteria, making this enzyme of interest as a potential therapeutic target. Crystal structure determinations of NagZ from Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis in complex with natural substrate, trapped as a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, and bound to product, define the reaction coordinate of the NagZ family of enzymes. The structures, combined with kinetic studies, reveal an uncommon degree of structural plasticity within the active site of a glycoside hydrolase, and unveil how NagZ drives substrate distortion using a highly mobile loop that contains a conserved histidine that has been proposed as the general acid/base.",

These effects suggest that AMPK activators might be useful for treatment and/or prevention of type 2 diabetes and cancer. Indeed, AMPK is activated by the drugs metformin and salicylate, the latter being the major breakdown product of aspirin. Metformin is widely used to treat diabetes, while there is epidemiological evidence that both metformin and aspirin provide protection against cancer.

However, in cells, the prodrug of PS210 (PS423) acts as a substrate-selective inhibitor of PDK1, inhibiting the phosphorylation and activation of S6K, which requires docking to the PIF-pocket, but not affecting PKB/Akt.

Characterization of how these compounds impact cancer cells revealed an unanticipated link between glucose and amino acid metabolism. PKM2 activation resulted in a metabolic rewiring of cancer cells manifested by a profound dependency on the nonessential amino acid serine for continued cell proliferation. Induction of serine auxotrophy by PKM2 activation was accompanied by reduced carbon flow into the serine biosynthetic pathway and increased expression of high affinity serine transporters.

In contrast, bioluminescence from injection of lucigenin (bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate) closely correlates with late phase and chronic inflammation. Lucigenin bioluminescence is independent of MPO and, instead, requires phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Phox) activity in macrophages.

Smo localizes to the primary cilium upon pathway activation, and this transition is critical for the response to Hedgehog ligands. In a high content screen directly monitoring Smo distribution in Hedgehog-responsive cells, we identified different glucocorticoids as specific modulators of Smo ciliary accumulation. One class promoted Smo accumulation, conferring cellular hypersensitivity to Hedgehog stimulation. In contrast,\u00a0a second class inhibited Smo ciliary localization and signaling activity by both wild-type Smo, and mutant forms of Smo, SmoM2, and SmoD473H, that are refractory to previously identified Smo antagonists. These findings point to the potential for developing glucocorticoid-based pharmacological modulation of Smo signaling to treat mutated drug-resistant forms of Smo, an emerging problem in long-term cancer therapy.

     "abstract": "Supercharged proteins (SCPs) can deliver functional macromolecules into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells more potently than unstructured cationic peptides. Thus far, neither the structural features of SCPs that determine their delivery effectiveness nor their intracellular fate postendocytosis, has been studied. Using a large set of supercharged GFP (scGFP) variants, we found that the level of cellular uptake is sigmoidally related to net charge and that scGFPs enter cells through multiple pathways, including clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. SCPs activate Rho and ERK1/2 and also alter the endocytosis of transferrin and EGF. Finally, we discovered that the intracellular trafficking of endosomes containing scGFPs is altered in a manner that correlates with protein delivery potency. Collectively, our findings establish basic structure-activity relationships of SCPs and implicate the modulation of endosomal trafficking as a determinant of macromolecule delivery efficiency.",

Conditional mutants that underexpress essential genes have been used to identify compounds with known mechanism of action by target-based whole-cell screening (TB-WCS). Here, the feasibility of TB-WCS in Mtb was assessed by generating mutants that conditionally express pantothenate synthetase (panC), diaminopimelate decarboxylase (lysA), and isocitrate lyase (icl1). The essentiality of panC and lysA, and conditional essentiality of icl1 for growth on fatty acids, was confirmed. Depletion of PanC and Icl1 rendered mutants hypersensitive to target-specific inhibitors. Stable reporter strains were generated for use in high-throughput screening, and their utility was demonstrated by identifying compounds that display greater potency against a PanC-depleted strain. These findings illustrate the power of TB-WCS as a tool for tuberculosis drug discovery.",

This trend is consistent with previous work that characterized the pH dependence of cell migration and may therefore be relevant to controlling the invasiveness of metastatic cancer cells.

Heparan sulfate-deficient Swiss 3T3 cells were overlaid onto an aminosilane-coated slide surface onto which heparin saccharides had been spotted and immobilized. The cells were transiently stimulated with FGF2 and immunofluorescence measured to assess downstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Activation of this signaling pathway\u00a0response was restricted to cells exposed to heparin saccharides competent to activate FGF2 signaling.

Its close structural resemblance to pantothenic acid, the vitamin precursor of coenzyme A (CoA), and its Michael acceptor moiety suggest that it irreversibly inhibits an enzyme involved in CoA biosynthesis or utilization. However, its mode of action and the basis for its specificity have not been elucidated to date. We demonstrate that CJ-15,801 is transformed by the uniquely selective S.\u00a0aureus pantothenate kinase, the first CoA biosynthetic enzyme, into a substrate for the next enzyme, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, which is inhibited through formation of a tight-binding structural mimic of its native reaction intermediate. These findings reveal CJ-15,801 as a vitamin biosynthetic pathway antimetabolite with a mechanism similar to that of the sulfonamide antibiotics and highlight CoA biosynthesis as a viable antimicrobial drug target.",

Specifically, LanV has acquired affinity for an earlier biosynthetic intermediate resulting in a switch in biosynthetic order and lack of hydroxyls at C-4a and C-12b, whereas in JadH, C-4a/C-12b dehydration has evolved into an independent secondary function replacing C-12b hydroxylation.

The study of the structure, mechanism of formation, and biological activity of protein misfolded oligomers has been challenged by the metastability, transient formation, and structural heterogeneity of such species. In spite of these difficulties, in the past few years, many experimental approaches have emerged that enable the detection and the detailed molecular study of misfolded oligomers. In this review, we describe the basic and generic knowledge achieved on protein oligomers, describing the mechanisms of oligomer formation, the methodologies used thus far for their structural determination, and the structural elements responsible for their toxicity.",

We studied the two ATs PedC and PedD involved in pederin biosynthesis in an uncultivated symbiont. PedD displayed malonyl- but not acetyltransferase activity toward various acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). In contrast, the AT2 PedC efficiently hydrolyzed acyl units bound to N-acetylcysteamine or ACP. It accepted substrates with various chain lengths and functionalizations but did not cleave malonyl-ACP.

To determine which pool of WldS accounts for its axon-protective effects, we developed a strategy to control the spatial expression of proteins within neurons. This strategy couples a chemical genetic method to control protein stability with microfluidic culturing.

A series of mutants was constructed to inactivate the thiolation (T) domain of each module and to evaluate an HHxxxDR catalytic motif in NocA and an atypical extended histidine motif in NocB. The loss of nocardicin A production in each of the T domain mutants indicates that all five modules are essential for its biosynthesis. Conversely, production of nocardicin A was not affected by mutation of the NocB histidine motif or the R828G mutation in NocA.",

     "abstract": "Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize glycolipids presented by CD1d. The first antigen described, \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide (\u03b1GalCer), is a potential anticancer agent whose activity depends upon IFN-\u03b3 secretion. We report two analogs of \u03b1GalCer based on a naturally occurring glycosphingolipid, plakoside A. These compounds induce enhanced IFN-\u03b3 that correlates with detergent-resistant binding to CD1d and an increased stability of the lipid-CD1d complexes on antigen-presenting cells. Structural analysis on one of the analogs indicates that it is more deeply bound inside the CD1d groove, suggesting tighter lipid-CD1d interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which structural information provides an explanation for the increased lipid-CD1d stability, likely responsible for the Th1 bias. We provide insights into the mechanism of IFN-\u03b3-inducing compounds, and because our compounds activate human NKT cells, they could have therapeutic utility.",

In stage 1 the oxygenase domain of NO synthase converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO (g). Owing to its short-lived nature, this molecule is converted into a different nitrogen oxide such as NO2, an organonitrosyl such as a nitrosothiol, or a metal nitrosyl such as a heme-nitrosyl, for transportation in stage 2. Each of these derivatives features unique physical characteristics, chemical reactivity, and biological activity.

Overall, we discovered 37 PDZ-PDZ interactions involving 46 PDZ domains (\u223c30% of all PDZ domains tested), revealing that dimerization is a more frequently used binding mode than was previously appreciated.

We further show that MAGL is part of a gene signature correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the stem-like properties of cancer cells, supporting a role for this enzyme in protumorigenic metabolism that, for prostate cancer, involves the dual control of endocannabinoid and fatty acid pathways.",

To understand its biosynthesis, the epilancin 15X biosynthetic gene cluster was identified. The N-terminal lactate is produced by dehydration of a serine residue in the first position of the core peptide by ElxB, followed by proteolytic removal of the leader peptide by ElxP and hydrolysis of the resulting new N-terminal dehydroalanine. The pyruvate group thus formed is reduced to lactate by an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase designated ElxO. The enzymatic activity of ElxB, ElxP, and ElxO were investigated in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo and the importance of the N-terminal modification for peptide stability against bacterial aminopeptidases was assessed.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antibacterial drugs, preferably with novel modes of action to potentially avoid cross-resistance with existing antibacterial agents. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to bacterial protein secretion as a potential antibacterial target. Among the different protein secretion pathways that are present in bacterial pathogens, the general protein secretory (Sec) pathway is widely considered as an attractive target for antibacterial therapy. One of the key components of the Sec pathway is the peripheral membrane ATPase SecA, which provides the energy for the translocation of preproteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. In this review, we will provide an overview of research efforts on the discovery and development of small-molecule SecA inhibitors.

Here, we use directed evolution and a multiplexed assay to screen a library of >14,000 members to generate three derivatives of the antibacterial compound, andrimid. Another limiting factor in reengineering these mega-enzymes of secondary metabolism has been that commonly used hosts such as Escherichia coli often give lower product titers, so our reengineering was performed in the native producer, Pantoea agglomerans. This integrated in\u00a0vivo approach can be extended to larger enzymes to create analogs of natural products for bioactivity testing.",

The proteasome has three types of active sites. Chymotrypsin-like sites are the most important for protein breakdown and have long been considered the only suitable targets for antineoplastic drugs; however, our recent work demonstrated that inhibitors of caspase-like sites sensitize malignant cells to inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like sites. Here, we describe the development of specific cell-permeable inhibitors and an activity-based probe of the trypsin-like sites. These compounds selectively sensitize multiple myeloma cells to inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like sites, including antimyeloma agents bortezomib and carfilzomib. Thus, trypsin-like sites are cotargets for anticancers drugs. Together with inhibitors of chymotrypsin- and caspase-like sites developed earlier, we provide the scientific community with a complete set of tools to separately modulate proteasome active sites in living cells.",

We demonstrate that this adenylate-forming enzyme is capable of producing most CoA-linked polyketide extender units as well as pantetheine- and N-acetylcysteamine-linked analogs useful for in\u00a0vitro PKS studies. Two ternary product complex structures, one containing malonyl-CoA and AMP and the other containing (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA and AMP, were solved to 1.45\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.43\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, respectively.

To target aerobic glycolysis, we exploited the complementary roles of OXPHOS and glycolysis in ATP synthesis as the basis for a chemical genetic screen, enabling rapid identification of novel small-molecule inhibitors of facilitative glucose transport. Blocking mitochondrial electron transport with antimycin A or leucascandrolide A had little effect on highly glycolytic A549 lung carcinoma cells, but adding known glycolytic inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose, iodoacetate or cytochalasin B, rapidly depleted intracellular ATP, displaying chemical synthetic lethality.

Interestingly, argifin is a nanomolar inhibitor of the bacterial-type subfamily of fungal chitinases that possess an extensive chitin-binding groove, but does not inhibit the much smaller, plant-type enzymes from the same family that are\u00a0involved in fungal cell division and are thought to be potential drug targets.

In particular, these enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall galactan, a polymer essential for the survival of the causative agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We describe here the synthesis of derivatives of UDP-Galf modified at C-5 and C-6 using a chemoenzymatic route. In cell-free assays, these compounds prevented the formation of mycobacterial galactan, via the production of short \u201cdead-end\u201d intermediates resulting from their incorporation into the growing oligosaccharide chain. Modified UDP-furanoses thus constitute novel probes for the study of the two classes of enzymes involved in mycobacterial galactan assembly, and studies with these compounds may ultimately facilitate the future development of new therapeutic agents against tuberculosis.",

The supersensitivity of SHR to CB1 receptor-mediated cardiovascular depression is related to increased G protein coupling of CB1 receptors.

This probe was synthesized on solid support, characterized kinetically (kinact = 0.68 min-1, KI = 79\u00a0\u03bcM), and then used to stain the aorta from rats used as a model of isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). Interestingly, TG2 activity was thus shown to increase over 4\u00a0weeks of the hypertension model, corresponding with the previously observed increase in arterial stiffness. These results clearly suggest an association between TG2 and the phenomenon of arterial rigidification.",

We studied growth inhibition with a collection of 200 antibacterial compounds when systematically combined with a panel of 14 known antibiotics of diverse mechanism and chemical class. Our work revealed a high frequency of synergistic chemical-chemical interactions where the interaction profiles were unique to the various compound pairs. Thus, the work revealed that chemical-chemical interaction data provides a fingerprint of biological activity and testable hypotheses regarding the mechanism of action of the novel bioactive molecules. In the study reported here, we determined the mode of action of an inhibitor of folate biosynthesis and a DNA gyrase inhibitor. Moreover, we identified eight membrane-active compounds, found to be promiscuously synergistic with known bioactives.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria do not exist as discrete static entities; rather, mitochondria form a network that continuously moves, divides, and fuses. The structure of this dynamic network is in part maintained by a balance of division and fusion events (Hoppins et\u00a0al., 2007). The ratio of division to fusion events that defines a proper balance is not universal but varies with developmental stage, cell type, and biological circumstances. This is evident throughout the cell cycle in higher eukaryotes, where mitochondria elongate during the G1/S transition and fragment at the onset of mitosis, and when mitochondria fragment in response to certain cellular stimuli, such as increases in cytosolic calcium levels (Breckenridge et\u00a0al., 2003, Cereghetti et\u00a0al., 2008, Han et\u00a0al., 2008, Mitra et\u00a0al., 2009, Taguchi et\u00a0al., 2007). The functional state and distribution of mitochondria are clearly influenced by its steady-state structure. When the normal balance of division and fusion is disrupted as a consequence of the inappropriate stimulation or inhibition of either process, problems arise at the cellular level that compromises the well-being of the organism as a whole. This is evident by the ever-increasing number of diseases in which abnormal mitochondrial dynamics have been etiologically implicated. In this context, the mitochondrial division and fusion machines are valuable and interesting targets of small molecule effectors, as inhibition or activation of these processes may be able to restore the proper dynamic balance and function. A small molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial division, mdivi-1, has already been identified and characterized (Cassidy-Stone et\u00a0al., 2008). This inhibitor has provided valuable insight into the mechanism of mitochondrial division and has shown great therapeutic promise in a wide array of disease models.

     "abstract": "The translational apparatus of the bacterial cell remains one of the principal targets of antibiotics for the clinical treatment of infection worldwide. Since the introduction of specific translation inhibitors into clinical practice in the late 1940s, intense efforts have been made to understand their precise mechanisms of action. Such research has often revealed significant and sometimes unexpected insights into many fundamental aspects of the translation mechanism. Central to progress in this area, high-resolution crystal structures of the bacterial ribosome identifying the sites of antibiotic binding are now available, which, together with recent developments in single-molecule and fast-kinetic approaches, provide an integrated view of the dynamic translation process. Assays employing these approaches and focusing on specific steps of the overall translation process are amenable for drug screening. Such assays, coupled with structural studies, have the potential not only to accelerate the discovery of novel and effective antimicrobial agents, but also to refine our understanding of the mechanisms of translation. Antibiotics often stabilize specific functional states of the ribosome and therefore allow distinct translation steps to be dissected in molecular detail.",

Large-scale chemical profile studies have identified a variety of scaffolds that inhibit FLuc. In some cell-based assays, these inhibitors can act in a counterintuitive way, leading to a gain in luminescent signal. Although formerly attributed to transcriptional activation, intracellular stabilization of FLuc is the primary mechanism underlying this observation. FLuc inhibition and stabilization can be complex, as illustrated by the compound PTC124, which is converted by FLuc in the presence of ATP to a high affinity multisubstrate adduct inhibitor, PTC124-AMP.

By combining chemical proteomics with biochemical and cellular pharmacology we have determined that CB30865 cytotoxicity is due to subnanomolar inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), an enzyme present in the NAD biosynthetic pathway. Cancer cells develop dependence on Nampt due to increased energy requirements and the elevated activity of NAD consuming enzymes such as sirtuins and mono and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs).

We now show that the mitochondrial ferredoxin Yah1p and the ferredoxin reductase Arh1p are required for Q6 biosynthesis, probably for the first hydroxylation of the pathway. Conditional Gal-YAH1 and Gal-ARH1 mutants accumulate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol and 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminophenol.

We report here a comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters in these strains, which reveals the mechanistic basis for this architectural diversity. Although the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide cores of the molecules are highly similar, the underlying biosynthetic machineries exhibit an unexpected degree of divergence. Furthermore, the S. cellulosum gene cluster contains a crotonyl-CoA reductase (CCR) homolog not present in C. crocatus, which likely participates in assembling the unusual hexyl side chain of the So ce895 thuggacins, whereas the distinct hydroxylation pattern may result from variable action of a conserved FMN-dependent monooxygenase. Indeed, inactivation of the monooxygenase gene in C. crocatus resulted in production of both mono- and di-deshydroxy thuggacin derivatives, providing direct evidence for the role of this enzyme in the pathway.

In an attempt to recreate features of the glycan shield semisynthetically, oligomannosides were coupled to surface lysines on the icosahedral capsids of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 and cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV). The Q\u03b2 glycoconjugates, but not CPMV, presented oligomannose clusters that bind the antibody 2G12 with high affinity. However, antibodies against these 2G12 epitopes were not detected in immunized rabbits. Rather, alternative oligomannose epitopes on the conjugates were immunodominant and elicited high titers of anti-mannose antibodies that do not crossreact with the HIV envelope. The results presented reveal important design considerations for a carbohydrate-based vaccine component for HIV.",

     "abstract": "Proteins prone to misfolding form large macroscopic deposits in many neurodegenerative diseases. Yet the in\u00a0situ aggregation kinetics remains poorly understood because of an inability to demarcate precursor oligomers from monomers. We developed a strategy for mapping the localization of soluble oligomers and monomers directly in live cells. Sensors for mutant huntingtin, which forms aggregates in Huntington's disease, were made by introducing a tetracysteine motif into huntingtin that becomes occluded from binding biarsenical fluorophores in oligomers, but not monomers. Up to 70% of the diffusely distributed huntingtin molecules appeared as submicroscopic oligomers in individual neuroblastoma cells expressing mutant huntingtin. We anticipate the sensors to enable insight into cellular mechanisms mediated by oligomers and monomers and for the approach to be adaptable more generally in the study of protein self-association.",

However, while this method is extremely efficient for affinity-based selections, its use for the selection and directed evolution of enzymes is still very restricted. Furthermore, phage display is not suited for the engineering of mammalian proteins that require posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation or membrane anchoring. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed a system in which structurally complex mammalian enzymes are displayed on the surface of retroviruses and encapsulated into droplets of a water-in-oil emulsion. These droplets are made and manipulated using microfluidic devices and each droplet serves as an independent reaction vessel. Compartmentalization of single retroviral particles in droplets allows efficient coupling of genotype and phenotype. Using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) as a model enzyme, we show that, by monitoring the enzymatic reaction in each droplet (by fluorescence), quantitative measurement of tPA activity in the presence of different concentrations of the endogenous inhibitor PAI-1 can be made on-chip. On-chip fluorescence-activated droplet sorting allowed the processing of 500 samples per second and the specific collection of retroviruses displaying active wild-type tPA from a model library with a 1000-fold excess of retroviruses displaying a non-active control enzyme. During a single selection cycle, a more than 1300-fold enrichment of the active wild-type enzyme was demonstrated.",

Here, we\u00a0use the Streptomyces aminophilus perDII perosamine synthase and perDI perosaminyltransferase genes to engineer biosynthesis of perosaminyl-amphoteronolide B in S. nodosus. Efficient production required a hybrid glycosyltransferase containing an N-terminal region of AmphDI and\u00a0a C-terminal region of PerDI. This work will assist efforts to generate glycorandomized amphoteronolides for drug discovery.",

     "abstract": "Ganglioside GD2 is a cell surface glycosphingolipid. Targeting of GD2, i.e., by anti-GD2 mAb 3F8, is used clinically for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and\u00a0therapy. Here, the conformations of free GD2, and of GD2 bound to mAb 3F8, were resolved by saturation transfer difference NMR and molecular modeling. Then, three small-molecule cyclic peptide ligands that bind to GD2 selectively were designed. Transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement of the GD2-bound conformation of the peptide ligands showed an induced-fit binding mechanism. The mAb 3F8 and the peptidic GD2 ligands mediate similar biological functions in cell-based assays of calcium fluxes and src activation. Thus, small molecules can selectively and functionally interact with a sugar head group. This work furthers the concept of rationally designing ligands for carbohydrate targets, and may be expanded to other clinically relevant gangliosides.",

     "abstract": "A number of small-molecule inhibitors have been developed that target the catalytic domains of protein kinases that are not in an active conformation. An inactive form that has been observed in several kinases is the DFG-out conformation. This conformation is characterized by an almost 180\u00b0 rotation of the conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif in the ATP-binding cleft relative to the active form. However, the sequence and structural determinants that allow a kinase to stably adopt the DFG-out conformation are not known. Here, we characterize a series of inhibitors based on a general pharmacophore for this inactive form. We demonstrate that modified versions of these inhibitors can be used to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand binding to DFG-out-adopting kinases and for enriching these kinases from complex protein mixtures.",

     "abstract": "Transcription of the Escherichia coli biotin (bio) operon is regulated by BirA, a protein that is not only the repressor that regulates bio operon expression by DNA binding but also the enzyme that covalently attaches biotin to its cognate acceptor proteins. Binding of BirA to the bio operator requires dimerization of the protein that is triggered by BirA-catalyzed synthesis of biotinoyl-adenylate (bio-AMP), the obligatory intermediate of the attachment reaction. The current model postulates that the unmodified acceptor protein binds the monomeric BirA:bio-AMP complex and thereby blocks assembly (dimerization) of the form of BirA that binds DNA. We report that expression of fusion proteins that carry synthetic biotin-accepting peptide sequences was as effective as the natural acceptor protein in derepression of bio operon transcription. These peptide sequences have sequences that are remarkably dissimilar to that of the natural acceptor protein, and our data thus argue that the regulatory switch does not require the extensive protein-protein interactions postulated in the current model.",

Here we describe its mechanisms of action. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as a specific ITZ-1\u2013binding protein. Almost all known Hsp90 inhibitors have been reported to bind to the Hsp90 N-terminal ATP-binding site and to simultaneously induce degradation and activation of its multiple client proteins. However, within the Hsp90 client proteins, ITZ-1 strongly induces heat shock factor\u20131 (HSF1) activation and causes mild Raf-1 degradation, but scarcely induces degradation of a broad range of Hsp90 client proteins by binding to the Hsp90 C terminus. These results may explain ITZ-1's inhibition of MMP-13 production, its cytoprotective effect, and its lower cytotoxicity. These results suggest that ITZ-1 is\u00a0a client-selective Hsp90 inhibitor.",

One of the steps during the biosynthesis of APPA is an unusual aldol reaction between phosphonoacetaldehyde and oxaloacetate catalyzed by an aldolase homolog RhiG. Recombinant RhiG was prepared, and the product of an in\u00a0vitro enzymatic conversion was characterized.

Elucidation of the binding mode of fragment hits by crystallography yielded a clear picture of how\u00a0a drug might dock in the cavity. Simulations that solvate the protein with isopropanol found additional sites that extend the druggable surface. Moreover, structural observations and simulation revealed the dynamic landscape of the cavity, which improves our understanding of the impact of the mutation on p53 stability. This underpins the importance of considering flexibility of the cavity in screening for optimized ligands. Our findings provide a blueprint for the design of effective drugs that rescue p53-Y220C.",

Following exposure to tBHQ for 30 min, ARE-luciferase activity measured after 24 hr was dependent on the presence of Cu2+. In contrast, tBQ-induced activity was Cu2+-independent. The metal-catalyzed oxidation of tBHQ to tBQ occured rapidly and stoichiometrically. Compounds that share para- or ortho-hydroquinone structures, such as catechol estrogens, dopamine, and l-DOPA, also induced ARE-driven luciferase in a Cu2+-dependent manner.

It was found that the MtMetAP inhibitors were active against replicating and aged nongrowing M. tuberculosis.

Moreover, knockdown of MtMetAP1a, but not MtMetAP1c, resulted in decreased viability of M. tuberculosis.
