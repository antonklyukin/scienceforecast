     "abstract": "Juvenile blunt snout bream Megalobrama amblycephala were reared under three photoperiods, 8\u202fL: 16D, 12\u202fL: 12D and 16\u202fL: 8D (L: light; D: dark) for over 8\u202fweeks. The results showed that growth performance was significantly enhanced by long photoperiod. Contrary to feed conversion ratio, final length, final weight, weight gain and feed intake increased significantly as illumination time increased from 8\u202fh daily to 16\u202fh daily. Low size heterogeneity and whole-body lipid content in fish exposed to long photoperiod were also observed. Both relative mRNA expression level of GH and IGF-I increased as illumination time increased from 8\u202fh to 16\u202fh daily. The lowest value of plasma cortisol was observed at the middle the photophase while the highest value was observed at the transition between the day and night span. Hepatic MDA content significantly increased as illumination time increased from 8\u202fh daily to 16\u202fh daily. The activities of hepatic catalase and glutathione peroxidase were lowest in fish exposed to 16\u202fL: 8D photoperiod and significantly lower than that in fish exposed to 8\u202fL: 16D. These results indicate that photoperiod manipulation may not only improve growth performance but also reduce size heterogeneity. However, prolonged photoperiod could cause chronic stress since plasma cortisol level was higher in the long photoperiod group, leading to an increasing oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Tibetan pigs, indigenous to Tibetan plateau, are well adapted to hypoxia. So far, there have been not any definitively described genes and functional sites responsible for hypoxia adaptation for the Tibetan pig. The whole genome-wide association studies in human suggested that genetic variations in TMPRSS6 was associated with hemoglobin concentration (HGB) and red cell counts (RBC). Here we conducted resequencing of the nearly entire genomic region (40.1\u202fkb) of the candidate gene TMPRSS6 in 40 domestic pigs and 40 wild boars along continuous altitudes and identified 708 SNPs, in addition to an indel (CGTG/----) in the intron 10. We conduct the CGTG indel in 838 domestic pigs, both the CGTG deletion frequency and the pairwise r2 linkage disequilibrium showed an increase with elevated altitudes, suggesting that TMPRSS6 has been under Darwinian positive selection. As the conserved core sequence of hypoxia-response elements (HREs), the deletion of CGTG in Tibetan pigs decreased the expression levels of TMPRSS6 mRNA and protein in the liver revealed by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. We compared domestic pigs and Tibetan pigs living continuous altitudes, found that the blood-related traits with the increase of altitude, however, the HGB did not increase with the elevation in Tibetan pigs. Genotype association analysis results dissected a genetic effect on reducing HGB by 13.25\u202fg/L in Gongbo'gyamda Tibetan pigs, decreasing mean corpuscular volume (MCV) by 4.79\u202ffl in Diqing Tibetan pigs. In conclusion, the CGTG deletion of TMPRSS6 resulted in lower HGB and smaller MCV, which could reflect a blunting erythropoiesis and improving blood viscosity as well as erythrocyte deformability. It remains to be determined whether a blunting of erythropoiesis for TMPRSS6 or others genetic effects are the physiological adaptations among Tibetan pigs.",

     "abstract": "Transferrin is a highly conserved multifunctional protein involved in iron metabolism, oxidative stress and immune response. However, very little is known about its context-dependent functional role in insects. The present study adopts a proteomic approach to identify an abundant hemolymph protein of silkworm (Antheraea mylitta) as transferrin. SDS-PAGE coupled to LC-MS/MS was followed to identify this protein (75.7\u202fkDa) in the advanced larvae of A. mylitta as transferrin (AmTsf). Antibody developed against this protein enabled us to determine its tissue-specific expression and functional relevance during development. Its immunodetection was optimized by western blotting, immunohisto- and cytochemistry in the larval and pupal tissues of this insect. AmTsf exhibited a considerable homology with that of other related insects. It was found to be expressed constitutively in hemolymph, fat body, midgut and silk gland of this insect during development. Abundance of transferrin in the hemolymph of this species and its upregulation in response to oxidant challenges indicated its tissue-specific role in the antioxidant protection. The present work adds to the existing knowledge of multiple roles of transferrin in insects and provides an insight into a relatively unexplored aspect of iron-associated H2O2 metabolism and redox homeostasis in the apparent absence of catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Therefore, A. mylitta can be an attractive acatalasemic model for the study of in vivo redox regulation. In addition, this study provides a novel hypothesis to explore the role of transferrin in limiting oxidative stress during larval rearing of silkworm.",

     "abstract": "Gonadal soma-derived factor (Gsdf) is critical for testicular differentiation and early germ cell development in teleosts. The spotted scat (Scatophagus argus), with a stable XX-XY sex-determination system and the candidate sex determination gene dmrt1, provides a good model for understanding the mechanism of sex determination and differentiation in teleosts. In this study, we analyzed spotted scat gsdf tissue distribution and gene expression patterns in gonads, as well as further analysis of transcriptional regulation. Tissue distribution analysis showed that gsdf was only expressed in testis and ovary. Real-time PCR showed that both gsdf and dmrt1 were expressed significantly higher in testes at different phases (phase III, IV and V) compared to ovaries at phase II, III and IV, while gsdf was expressed significantly higher in phase II ovaries than those of phase III and IV. Western blot analysis also showed that Gsdf was more highly expressed in the testis than ovary. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Gsdf was expressed in Sertoli cells surrounding spermatogonia in the testis, while it was expressed in the somatic cells surrounding the oogonia of the ovary. Approximately 2.7\u202fkb of the 5\u2032 upstream region of gsdf was cloned from the spotted scat genomic DNA and in silico promoter analysis revealed the putative transcription factor binding sites of Dmrt1 and Sf1. The luciferase reporter assay, using the human embryonic kidney cells, demonstrated that Dmrt1 activated gsdf expression in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Sf1 in spotted scat. These results suggest that Gsdf could play a role in regulating the development of spermatogonia and oogonia, and also participate in male sex differentiation by acting as a downstream gene of Dmrt1 in spotted scat.",

     "abstract": "Most animal cells rely on aerobic metabolism for survival and are damaged or die within minutes without oxygen. Embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus, however, survive months without oxygen. Determining how their cells survive without oxygen has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the cellular mechanisms supporting vertebrate anoxia tolerance and the evolution of such tolerance. Therefore, we aimed to establish and characterize an anoxia-tolerant cell line from A. limnaeus for investigating mechanisms of vertebrate anoxia tolerance. The PSU-AL-WS40NE cell line of neuroepithelial identity was established from embryonic tissue of A. limnaeus using a tissue explant. The cells can survive for at least 49 d without oxygen or replenishment of growth medium, compared to only 3 d of anoxic survival for two mammalian cell lines. PSU-AL-WS40NE cells accumulate lactate during anoxia, indicating use of common metabolic pathways for anaerobic metabolism. Additionally, they express many of the same small noncoding RNAs that are stress-responsive in whole embryos of A. limnaeus and mammalian cells, as well as anoxia-responsive small noncoding RNAs derived from the mitochondrial genome (mitosRNAs). The establishment of the cell line provides a unique tool for investigating cellular mechanisms of vertebrate anoxia tolerance, and has the potential to transform our understanding of the role of oxidative metabolism in cell biology.",

     "abstract": "Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism in animals. In this study, we examined whether any cross talk exists between glucocorticoids and AMPK in the regulation of the liver bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Dexamethasone treatment decreased the growth performance of broiler chickens. The liver mRNA levels of fatty acid transport protein (FATP-1), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), AMPK alpha 1 subunit (AMPK\u03b11), and glucocorticoid receptor were significantly upregulated in DEX-treated broilers; the gene expression of liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) was significantly downregulated. The protein level of liver CYP7A1 was significantly decreased by DEX treatment at both 24 and 72\u202fh, while the protein level of p-AMPK/ t-AMPK stayed unchanged. In the in vitro cultured hepatocytes, compound C pretreatment blocked the increase in CYP7A1 protein level by DEX and significantly suppressed FATP-1, SREBP-1c, FXR, and CYP7A1 gene expression stimulated by DEX. Compound C treatment significantly reduces the protein level of p-AMPK, and the combination of compound C and DEX significantly reduces the protein level of t-AMPK. Thus, glucocorticoids affected liver AMPK and the bile acid synthesis signal pathway, and AMPK might be involved in the glucocorticoid effect of liver bile acid synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 44 (ERp44) is a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and a member of thioredoxin family, which is involved in several functions such as oxidative folding and polymerization of molecules, carrier protein activity, regulation of the Ca2+ ion levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cellular signaling, and maintenance of lumen redox homeostasis. In this study, ERp44 from Hippocampus abdominalis, commonly known as the big belly seahorse, was characterized. ERp44 possessed three PDI-like domains and one thioredoxin fold with a CXXC conserved motif. The open reading frame consisted of 1233\u202fbp encoding 410 amino acids. Additionally, it contained a C-terminal RDEL motif, which suggests a localization of ERp44 to the endoplasmic reticulum. ShERp44 showed highest mRNA expression in the ovary, brain, and gills. Temporal expression of ShERp44 in blood showed significant upregulation against bacterial, LPS, and PolyI:C stimuli at 24 and 72\u202fh. Trunk kidney tissue exhibited upregulated ShERp44 expression at 24\u202fh in response to lipopolysaccharides and Streptococcus iniae and at 72\u202fh in response to Edwardsiella tarda and poly I:C. NADPH turnover was observed as 0.06122\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0075\u202f\u03bcmol/s protein/\u03bcg through the HED assay. Insulin aggregation assay showed a significant reduction ability of rShERp44 by precipitating insulin rapidly, beginning at 5\u202fmin. Moreover, rShERp44-treated fathead minnow cells showed significant cell survival against 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide and thus exhibited capability to resist oxidative stress. Taken together, these findings provide insight into teleost defense mechanisms and functional properties of ERp44 in controlling redox homeostasis at the molecular level.",

     "abstract": "An effect of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) on growth of previtellogenic (PV) ovaries of eel, salmon and Atlantic cod has been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 11-KT treatment (in vivo) on ovarian growth, on hormonal and biochemical changes in blood, and on ovarian mRNA levels of lipidation-related genes in captive beluga with PV oocytes. In addition, the potential involvement of lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), an important enzyme for extracellular hydrolysis of lipoprotein-associated lipids, was evaluated. Twelve beluga (4-year olds) were treated with an intraperitoneal slow-release implant of either 11-KT (2.5\u202fmg) or a compressed matrix (control). Ovarian biopsy was done to obtain pre- (day 0: T0) and post-treatment (day 21: T21) data on histology and target gene expression. Three weeks of exposure resulted in an increase in serum 11-KT levels from 2.2\u202fng/mL to 83\u202fng/mL but did not yield significant changes in serum levels of triacylglycerides and cholesterol. Furthermore, 11-KT implantation increased oocyte diameters from 259\u202f\u03bcm (T0) to 309\u202f\u03bcm by T21. Regardless of the increase in oocyte size, ovaries remained in the PV stage, mostly as late perinucleolar oocytes. Meanwhile, at the molecular level, the expression of lipidation-related transcripts [lpl, apolipoprotein E (apoe), very low density lipoprotein receptors (vldlr), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8-like (lrp8)] was significantly up-regulated after three weeks. Immunostaining for Lpl by Western blotting indicated three immunoreactive bands (70, 58 and 37\u202fkDa) in ovarian homogenates from beluga, but signal intensity was not affected by treatment. Altogether, the administration of 11-KT increased 11-KT serum levels, oocyte size, and the expression of genes associated with lipid uptake. However, this treatment did not advance ovarian development beyond the PV stage.",

Two experimental diets were designed as carbohydrate free (CF) and suitable carbohydrate (SC) supplementation, respectively. The dietary carbohydrate contents were 0.93% and 15.6%, respectively. After a 10-week feeding trial, a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed. Results showed that after the last meal in the feeding trial, the blood glucose of fish fed with diet CF peaked at 3\u202fh (4.64\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.29\u202fmM), the duration of hyperglycemia was about 5\u202fh (1\u20136\u202fh). The blood glucose in SC group peaked at 9\u202fh (3.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.66\u202fmM), and the duration of hyperglycemia was approximately 6\u202fh (6\u201312\u202fh). After GTT, blood glucose reached the first peak at 6\u202fh both in the two groups, and the duration of hyperglycemia was obvious 24\u202fh. During the 3\u201312\u202fh after injection, blood glucose level in SC group was significantly higher than that in CF group. However, blood glucose level in group SC was significantly lower than that in group CF at 24\u202fh. The blood glucose level decreased to half of the peak at 10.97\u202fh after injection of glucose in SC group and at 27.26\u202fh in CF group.

In the present study, farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT), the key enzyme responsible for final step conversion of farnesoic acid (FA) to methyl farnesoate (MF), was cloned and characterized from the nervous tissues of Penaeus indicus. Multiple sequence alignment, prediction of conserved domain regions, phosphorylation sites identification and phylogenetic analysis indicated that putative FAMeT fragment from P. indicus (PiFAMeT), shares a high degree of sequence identity to FAMeT proteins isolated from other crustaceans species. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed ubiquitous expression of PiFAMeT in all the tissues examined, with comparative higher mRNA levels in nervous tissue and ovary. Additionally, the levels of PiFAMeT also showed gradual increase of expression correlating with the advancement in ovarian maturation. Further to support their role in promoting ovarian development, serotonin treatment (5HT, 50\u202f\u03bcg/g body weight) was given to eyestalk intact and unilaterally eyestalk ablated females which resulted in significant increase in PiFAMeT transcript levels at day 7 and day 14. The relatively higher levels of PiFAMeT, reflecting higher levels of MF, suggest a role during secondary vitellogenesis thereby regulating ovarian development in P. indicus. Further research is required to understand the synergistic interaction of MF pathways with serotonergic and other regulatory pathways in regulating ovarian maturation in penaeid shrimps.",

     "abstract": "Previously, we demonstrated that the animal aspartate racemase (AspR) gene has evolved from the serine racemase (SerR) gene by acquisition of three consecutive serine residues (Ser155-Ser156-Ser157) involved in the strong AspR activity, and this event has occurred independently and frequently during animal evolution. In the present study, we cloned and characterized two mammalian SerR homologous genes from the hemichordate acorn worm (Saccoglossus kowalevskii). The enzymes have been identified as an AspR and an aspartate/glutamate racemase (Asp/GluR) on the basis of their kinetic parameters. The S. kowalevskii Asp/GluR shows comparable substrate affinity and high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for both aspartate and glutamate and is the first reported enzyme from animals that can synthesize d-glutamate. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis and site-directed mutagenesis studies have revealed that the amino acid residue at position 156, which is serine in AspR and alanine in Asp/GluR, is associated with binding and recognition of glutamate and aspartate. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the S. kowalevskii AspR gene has evolved from the SerR gene after the divergence of hemichordata and vertebrate lineages by acquisition of the three serine residues at position 155 to 157 as in the case of other animal AspR genes. Furthermore, the S. kowalevskii Asp/GluR gene is the result of AspR gene duplication and several amino acid substitutions including that of the 156th serine residue with alanine. The fact that SerR has acquired substrate specificity towards aspartate or glutamate raises the possibility that synthesis of other d-amino acids is carried out by enzymes evolved from SerR.",

As a peptide hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a critical role in regulating somatic growth. The present study focuses on the expression characteristics of IGF-1 in hybrid tilapia. The cloned complete open reading frame of IGF-1 in hybrid tilapia is 549\u202fbp in length, encoding a protein of 182 amino acids. The deduced protein is highly similar to that of Nile tilapia and blue tilapia. IGF-1 was found to be primarily expressed in the liver and muscle in the hybrid; lower expression levels were found in other tissues such as the intestine, spleen, and head-kidney. Increased mRNA expression was observed in the liver and muscle of the hybrid compared to Nile tilapia and blue tilapia, indicating a nonadditive expression pattern in the hybrid. An IGF-1 SNP site (397 site: C in Nile tilapia, G in blue tilapia) for differentiating the Nile tilapia or blue tilapia subgenome in hybrids was identified. Pyrosequencing analysis of the liver transcriptome indicated that most of the hybrids (9 of 10 individuals) predominantly expressed the G allele, demonstrating bias of the blue tilapia subgenome. The present study provides novel data indicating, for the first time, overall gene expression of IGF-1 and allele-specific expression in hybrid tilapia.",

     "abstract": "Optimizing physiological functions at different temperatures includes shifts in the lipid composition of ectothermic animals. These shifts may be associated with changes in lipid peroxidation in response to oxidative stress, because lipids differ in their susceptibility to oxidative damage. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are particular prone to peroxidation. Here, we analyzed changes in the fatty acid composition, cholesterol content and the level of oxidative damage as thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) in Daphnia magna as a function of acclimation temperature. The total fatty acid content was highest in cold-acclimated animals. The relative share of most PUFA decreased with increasing acclimation temperature. In contrast, the contribution of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (SFA and MUFA) increased with acclimation temperature, although the latter to a lower extent. Cholesterol content remained unchanged. The level of oxidative damage was lowest in animals reared at warm temperatures, most likely reflecting their lowest content of PUFA. Heat exposure (1\u202fh at 33\u202f\u00b0C) caused the highest increase in lipid peroxidation in cold-acclimated animals, containing more PUFA. Our data suggest that cold-induced adjustments in the body lipid composition increase the vulnerability of zooplankton to heat-induced oxidative stress. In particular, animals performing diel vertical migration may be highly susceptible to temperature-induced lipid damage.",

To disclose how maternal age and size affect reproductive ability of M. mutica, we first identified the full-length cDNAs from estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B), and forkhead box L2 (FOXL2). The ESR1 open reading frame (ORF) was 1, 767\u202fbp encoding 588 amino acids. For BMPR1B, the ORF was 1599\u202fbp encoding 532 amino acids, and an ORF of 906\u202fbp encoding 301 amino acids was identified in FOXL2. The effects of maternal age and size on the expression of ESR1, BMPR1B, and FOXL2 in the ovary, brain, and uterus showed that ESR1 expression in large females was significantly lower than that in small females in the brain, but body size did not affect ESR1 expression in the ovary. The expression of ESR1 was significantly different in the different age groups and size groups, and there was interaction detected between maternal age and body size. However, BMPR1B expression in the ovary, brain, and uterus was independent of maternal age and size. In addition, we found different FOXL2 expression patterns between the brain and uterus, while detected interaction of female age and size in the brain and ovary. Our results imply the complexity and diversity of maternal age and size in regulating the expression of genes related to reproduction. These results provide more information for the maternal effects on the reproduction-related gene expression.",

Toll-like receptor 14 (TLR14) has been identified in several fish species, but its function requires further study. In this study, TLR14 (designed as ToTLR14) from golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), was characterized and investigated its expression responses to three types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The full-length ToTLR14 cDNA was 3191\u202fbp, and the deduced protein consisted of 876 amino acids. The ToTLR14 protein included 5 leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains, a C-terminal LRR domain in the extracellular region, a transmembrane domain and a Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain in the cytoplasmic region, which fits with the typical TLR domain architecture. The genomic organization of ToTLR14 was also identified and consisted of four introns and five exons. The predicted promoter region of ToTLR14 contained several putative transcription factor binding sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ToTLR14 was clustered into the TLR1 subfamily clade. Quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that ToTLR14 were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with higher mRNA levels observed in the skin, kidney and intestine, while the lowest level was detected in the stomach. After injection with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], flagellin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the expression level of ToTLR14 mRNA were significantly upregulated in various tissues of golden pompano. These results indicate that ToTLR14 may play an important role in systemic as well as mucosal defence after viral and bacterial stimulation.",

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis placed the elovl close to the vertebrate Elovl1 and Elovl7 clade, which is distinct from the other remaining five Elovl families. The elongase was also clustered together with several elongases from crustaceans and insects. This elongase showed activities towards 16:1n-7, and at lower rate, linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and linolenic acid (18:3n-3). To our knowledge this is the first description of a functional enzyme involved in biosynthesis of long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acids in a crustacean species. Expression of the S. olivacea elovl7-like mRNA was prominent in stomach, intestine and gill tissues, due to the need to regulate the permeability of epithelial tissue through modification of fatty acid compositions.

Nonetheless, the toxic action of classical natural and anthropogenically-driven metals has also to be monitored, especially because they reflect real environmental situations. For that, in the present study we focused on the effects on the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis of the personal care product Triclosan (TCS) and Lead (Pb), as toxic metal, under separate and co-exposure situations at environmentally relevant concentrations: TCS (1\u202f\u03bcg/L) and Pb (50\u202f\u03bcg/L). The consideration of an additional factor such as an increase in ambient temperature was also included to provide a forecasted scenario of climate change: from the ambient temperature at actual conditions (17\u202f\u00b0C) to a predicted warming situation (22\u202f\u00b0C). Water chemical characterization and some physical properties and bioaccumulation of TCS and Pb in mussels at the end of the experiment (28\u202fdays) was considered. The parameters followed up comprise the energy related system production (electron transport system) and glycogen and protein reserves. Antioxidant enzymatic defences towards reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consequences of ROS damage over endogenous lipids (LPO) and proteins (PC). Overall the results suggested only particular responses to chemical exposures at 17\u202f\u00b0C whereas at 22\u202f\u00b0C the detoxification machinery was set up and this prevented the occurrence of LPO. Nonetheless, PC formation occurred under Pb and TCS\u202f+\u202fPb co-exposure at the highest temperature. Due to the complexity of the study: 4 chemical conditions, 2 temperatures and 10 biomarkers considered, a principal component ordination (PCO) analysis was included. The results of this integrative analysis confirmed a clear effect of the temperature, more responsiveness to drugs at 22\u202f\u00b0C and in all likelihood due to Pb presence.",

Here, the 3336-bp full-length cDNA of TH was isolated from Z.\u202ftau, a notorious horticultural pest infesting fruits and vegetables. qRT-polymerase chain reaction revealed that ZtTH transcripts were highly abundant at the time of pupal tanning and during adult emergence and were expressed in the midgut, integument and head of molting larvae. The pupation and eclosion rates gradually decreased when the 1st-instar larvae were fed diets containing higher concentrations of the TH inhibitor 3-iodo-tyrosine (3-IT). Moreover, pupal weights were significantly decreased, and abnormal uncolored phenotypes were observed after 20\u202fmg/g 3-IT was incorporated into the diet. In addition, the suppression of TH function (mediated by RNA interference) led to a decrease in TH mRNAs and eclosion rates, accompanied by less-pigmented phenotypes. There was a severe impairment of larval-pupal cuticle tanning, leading to pupae with less yellowish pigment or that were completely white and transparent, when we injected 2\u202f\u03bcL of 24.4\u202fmM or 73.27\u202fmM 3-IT into 3rd-instar larvae or prepupae.

However, it remains relatively unexplored in the reproductively unique live bearing teleosts. Therefore, this study comparatively examined the structure and content of G. holbrooki amh as well as characterised its expression. A paralogous Y-specific amh (amhy) was not detected, suggesting an unlikely role in sex determination.

The small (1.4\u202fkb) transcript, had both domains intact and clustered with members of Poeciliidae. In contrast to other vertebrates, a higher conservation between the N- rather than the C- terminus of amh in Poeciliidae was observed, suggesting an adaptation that may be unique to live bearing teleosts. The amh expression was 6 times higher in brain of both sexes and testis compared with ovaries (p\u202f=\u202f.001). Intriguingly, female splenic tissues showed 10 times higher expression (p\u202f=\u202f.006) and such female bias splenic expression has not been reported in any teleosts. Ontogenic expression was 25 times higher in male embryos at gastrulation stage (p\u202f=\u202f.001), much earlier than those reported in egg-laying teleosts.

Although some studies support a protective role, others report either no effect or pro-oxidant effects. However, the majority of research on this topic has not analyzed the oxidative status of a series of tissues in animals nor considered a range of carotenoid dosages. We investigated the effects of three levels of carotenoid supplementation on plasma, liver, adipose, heart and breast muscle oxidative damage in two congeneric species of waterfowl that exhibit marked differences in carotenoid coloration. After a 6-week depletion period, captive adult northern pintail (Anas acuta) and mallard (A. platyrhynchos) ducks of both sexes were fed either a carotenoid-depleted diet (<3\u202f\u03bcg/g xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin), a carotenoid-supplemented diet (50\u202f\u03bcg/g) within physiological range, or a carotenoid-rich diet (100\u202f\u03bcg/g) within pharmacological range for 22 to 32\u202fweeks. We hypothesized that these dosages of dietary carotenoids would differentially affect oxidative damage between species and sexes and among the tissues examined. We found that dietary xanthophyll supplementation had no significant effect on tissue pro-oxidation in males and females from both species. Moreover, sex or species differences in oxidative stress were only observed in two tissues (plasma and heart). Significant correlations in the levels of oxidative damage were not observed among the tissues examined. In conclusion, the current study does not support a consistent antioxidant role for dietary carotenoids in the tissues of these two waterfowl species. Instead, our results align with the notion that carotenoids play complex, tissue- and species-specific roles in oxidative status in birds.",

Additionally, plasma calcium was decreased in the smolt condition. This study is the first to characterize the expression pattern of calcium signaling-related genes in the liver and muscle of parr and smolt S. salar. However, further functional studies are required to obtain a wider understanding about the physiological changes that accompany the productive conditions during smoltification.",

Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipid) experimental diets were designed, with 100% fish oil (FO), 50% fish oil and 50% soybean oil (FS) and 100% soybean oil (SO), respectively. After a 12-week growth trial, the results showed that compared with FO group, contents n-6 PUFAs increased while the n-3 PUFAs decreased significantly both in liver and muscle in FS and SO groups. Concentrations of blood glucose, leptin, free fatty acid and total triglyceride reached the highest values in SO group, while blood insulin showed no significant difference among all groups. The gene expressions of insulin receptor substrate-2, glucose-6-phosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fatty acid synthetase, and lipoprotein lipase increased, and the insulin receptor substrate-1, phosphotidylinsositol-3-kinase (PI3K), hexokinase, glycogen synthetase and glucose transporter 2 in liver decreased significantly in SO group. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) also decreased significantly in this group. These results suggested that high level of dietary soybean oil depressed PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and then affected glucose and lipid metabolism by glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glucose transportation, glycogenesis and lipogenesis.",

The full-length cDNA sequences of dskiss1 and dskiss2 are 1265 and 744 base pairs (bp), encoding 130 and 146 amino acids, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that both Kiss1 and Kiss2 decapeptides were highly conserved among vertebrates.

The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of dietary Met supplementation on the lipid accumulation in tiger puffer, which have a unique lipid storage pattern. Crystalline L-Met was supplemented to a low-fishmeal control diet to obtain two experimental diets with a low (1.1% of dry weight, L-MET) or high Met level (1.6% of dry weight, H-MET). A 67-day feeding trial was conducted with juvenile tiger puffer (average initial weight, 13.83\u202fg). Each diet was fed to triplicate tanks (30 fish in each tank). The results showed that the total lipid contents in whole-body and liver significantly increased with increasing dietary Met levels. The hepatosomatic index, weight gain, and total bile acid content in serum showed similar patterns in response to dietary Met treatments, while the lipid content in muscle was not affected. The hepatic contents of 18-carbon fatty acids were elevated by dietary Met supplementation. The Hepatic mRNA expression of lipogenetic gene such as FAS, GPAT, PPAR\u03b3, ACLY, and SCD1 was down-regulated, while the gene expression of lipolytic genes ACOX1 and HSL, as well as that of ApoB100, were up-regulated by increasing dietary Met levels. The hepatic lipidomics of experimental fish was also analyzed. In conclusion, increasing dietary Met levels (0.61%, 1.10%, and 1.60%) increased the hepatic lipid accumulation in tiger puffer.

The results of mRNA expression and activity of NOSs, as well as NO metabolite levels in different tissues of the two lizards indicate that nNOS mRNA levels in cardiac and skeletal muscle were notably elevated in P. erythrurus, and iNOS expression was also increased markedly (up to 4-fold) in cardiac muscle. There was no significant difference in eNOS mRNA level in tested tissues between two species. However, the total NOS activity in skeletal muscle of P. erythrurus was slightly lower than that of P. przewalskii (p\u202f<\u202f.05) while no difference in other tissues. Similarly, lower iNOS activity (p\u202f<\u202f.01) was found in cardiac and skeletal muscle in P. erythrurus compared to P. przewalskii. In addition, the NO metabolite levels were dramatically lower in P. erythrurus in all tested tissues. We propose that higher nNOS and iNOS mRNA expression, lower iNOS activity and NO metabolite levels may represent physiological characteristics in nitric oxide system, which may contribute to high-altitude adaptation in P. erythrurus.",

No mortality was recorded during the experimental period, but there was a marked metabolic response in fish injected with high doses. Metabolites in plasma were lowest in the high bacterial dose. Cortisol levels were highest at day 7 in the high dose and then decreased from day 14 until the end of the study. Liver enzymes showed a similar pattern to plasma metabolites, with decreased enzymatic activity, mostly with the high bacteria dose. PK was the exception, with increased enzymatic activity in a dose-dependent manner over time. Liver metabolites were highly variable, except in the high bacterial dose where variability and total levels decreased significantly.Our results show that fish infection with F. noatunensis induces a clear stress response, especially with at the highest dose, shifting intermediary metabolism towards mobilization of energy and suggesting that E. maclovinus detects experimental infection of F. noatunensis as a stressor, which it is dependent on the bacterial dose.",

Full-length sequencing was performed using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE PCR) to produce a complete Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) of the gene. The CcClec gene encoded a predicted protein of 340 amino acids containing two CTLDs that may potentially bind carbohydrates, especially sucrose and cellobiose. The CcClec mRNA transcript was expressed highest in the liver, followed by head kidney, brain, heart, gills, spleen, and midgut. CcClec transcripts were upregulated in damaged liver upon exposure to A. hydrophila. Overall, these findings demonstrated that CcClec is implicated in milkfish innate immunity, and is most highly expressed in the liver, suggesting a role of the liver in the milkfish immune system.",

Expression profiling in seven tissues of unchallenged adult fish revealed predominant transcript levels in the head kidney (CASP3, 7, and 8) or brain (TPT1). Further, we analyzed the expression of a more comprehensive panel of 16 trout genes encoding pro- and anti-apoptotic factors and associated proteins during development and upon stress exposure (in vitro temperature and staurosporine treatment). Previously published transcriptome data suggested that the induction of apoptotic processes is mirrored on the transcript level, but this could not be confirmed by the present gene-profiling study. Yet on the protein level, treatment of trout cell line RT-gill-W1 with 1\u202f\u03bcM staurosporine for up to 120\u202fmin led to a significant increase of CASP3/7 activity.

Salmonid fish had an additional genome duplication, and two PPAR\u03b1 isoforms (PPAR\u03b1Ba and PPAR\u03b1Bb) were previously identified. Since a negative regulation between estrogen signaling and PPAR\u03b1 was described, a post-transcriptional gene silencing for PPAR\u03b1Bb was designed in primary brown trout hepatocytes. The aims of the study were to: (i) decipher the effects of PPAR\u03b1Bb knock-down on peroxisome morphology and on mRNA expression of potential target genes, and (ii) to assess the cross-interferences caused by an estrogenic compound (17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol \u2013 EE2) and a PPAR\u03b1 agonist (Wy-14,643 \u2013 Wy) using the established knock-down model. A knock-down efficiency of 70% was achieved for PPAR\u03b1Bb and its silencing significantly reduced the volume density of peroxisomes, but did not alter mRNA levels of the studied genes. Exposure to Wy did not change peroxisome morphology or mRNA expression, but under silencing conditions Wy rescued the volume density of peroxisomes to control levels, and increased acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1-3l (Acox1-3l) mRNA. Exposure to EE2 caused a reduction of peroxisome volume density, but under silencing conditions this effect was abolished and ApoA1 mRNA level was diminished. The morphological alterations of peroxisomes by WY and EE2 demonstrated that obtained results are PPAR\u03b1Bb dependent, and suggest the regulation of unknown downstream targets of PPAR\u03b1Bb.

Vasa is one of the most studied germ cell markers in mammals and lower vertebrates including fish. Here, we characterized a vasa homologue from the fish marbled goby (Oxyeleotris marmorata), termed omvasa. The full length of omvasa cDNA is 2344\u202fbp and encodes 658 amino acids, sharing high identities with Vasa homologues of other vertebrates. OmVasa protein contains 15 RG/RGG repeats at N-terminus, 2 ATPase motifs, as well as RNA unwinding and RNA binding domains at C-terminus. Phylogenetic tree showed that omVasa had the closest relationship with the Vasa homologue from the fish Boleophthalmus pectinirostris, the great blue-spotted mudskipper. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that omvasa was specifically transcribed in gonads, and the transcription level was gradually increased during oocyte development. The germ cell-specific distribution of omvasa mRNA was revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. In ovary, the signal of omvasa RNA displayed strong-weak-strong dynamics from oogonia over pre-vitellogenic oocytes to vitellogenic oocytes. In testis, omvasa signal was strong in spermatogonia, modest in spermatocytes but undetectable in spermatids and somatic cells. During embryogenesis, the transcription of omvasa mRNA was high at blastula stage, gradually decreased from gastrula stage and maintained at a low level in later developmental stages. Whole mount in situ hybridization indicated that omvasa mRNA was specific to primordial germ cells (PGCs). In summary, marbled goby vasa is a germ cell-specific transcript during gametogenesis, and can be used as an ideal marker for tracing PGC formation and migration, which is pivotal to germ cell manipulation in this species.",

Enzymatic activity analysis of the recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli showed that FoAK is highly stereo specific for L-arginine versus D-arginine and the apparent Michaelis constant for L-arginine (KmArg) is comparable to that of AKs from a variety of species. This research should enable further investigation of the function as well as in vitro screening for inhibitors of FoAK.",

     "abstract": "Piscirickettsiosis caused by Piscirickettsia salmonis constitutes one of the main problems in farmed salmonid and marine fishes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the modulation of genes involved in the oxidative stress in the liver and muscle of Salmo salar challenge with low dosage of P. salmonis. The treatment (in duplicate) were as follows: Control injection (culture medium) and P. salmonis injection (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f102 PFU/mL) with sampling (liver and muscle) at several time-points during the 42-days experimental period (dpi). In liver, the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) had differences with the control group only at 7\u202fdpi, compared with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) that presented increases at 7 and 21\u202fdpi. The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) mRNAs were elevated at 13 and 21\u202fdpi, respectively. While glutathione reductase (GR) and cytochrome P450 (P450) did not show variations in their expression during the experimental course. In muscle, the expression of CAT and AChE was higher than in the control condition at 2 and 42\u202fdpi, respectively. While the number of transcripts SOD, GPx, GR, GST, P450 and HSP70 showed increases at 7- and 42-days post injection. The results suggest a transcriptional activation of genes involved in oxidative stress in both liver and muscle, with expression profiles that were tissue-specific and dependent on the time. This is the first study that reveals the transcriptional participation of all these genes associated with oxidative stress in response to the injection of P. salmonis.",

     "abstract": "Myosin heavy chains (MYHs) play important roles in muscle growth and contraction. In fish, MYHs contribute to hyperplasia and hypertrophy of muscle fibers, which can continue into adult life and thus result in indeterminate growth in some species. We previously identified two MYH genes, MYH-7a and MYH-7b, that are differentially expressed in Mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) and appear to function in early growth. However, the regulatory role of their 5\u2032 flanking regions is unknown. To examine the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these regions, we used genome walking to amplify their flanking sequences and analyzed the regulatory elements and binding sites. A single SNP locus was found in the flanking sequence of each gene. These SNP loci are located in the conserved glucocorticoid receptor binding region (MYH-7a: G-614A; Allele frequency: G:A\u202f=\u202f94.9:5.1; GG (89.76) and AG (10.24) genotypes) and the LIM homeobox domain transcription factor binding sequence (MYH-7b: C-1933A; Allele frequency: C:A\u202f=\u202f54.8:45.2; AA (20.82), AC (48.81), and CC (30.37) genotypes). At the G-614A loci, the GG genotype exhibited more superior growth traits (total length, body length, body height, etc.) than the AG genotype, with the exception of caudal peduncle length. Alternatively, at the C-1933A loci, the AC and AA genotypes showed significant differences in all growth traits, except for head length, with AC exhibiting superior traits. The AA and CC genotypes showed significant differences in caudal peduncle length and height, while no differences were observed between the AC and CC genotypes. Thus, these SNPs in the 5\u2032 flanking regions of MYH-7a and MYH-7b are correlated with superior growth and can be used for selecting Mandarin fish during breeding.",

However, little is known about the functions of Pnx in teleosts. To determine the roles of Pnx in the regulation of reproduction in Scatophagus argus, the physiological characterization of the Pnx was analyzed. During ovary development, the expression of pnx in phase IV was higher than in phase II and III in the hypothalamus. In the pituitary, pnx expression was highest in phase IV, moderate in phase III, and lowest in phase II. When hypothalamus and pituitary fragments were cultured in vitro with Pnx-14 and Pnx-20 (10\u202fnM and 100\u202fnM) for 6\u202fh, the expression of GnRHR (gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor), lh (luteinizing hormone) and fsh (follicular stimulating hormone) in the pituitary increased significantly, except GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) in the hypothalamus. Similarly, the expression of GnRHR, lh and fsh in the pituitary increased significantly after injecting S. argus with Pnx-14 and Pnx-20 (10\u202fng/g and 100\u202fng/g body weight (bw)), except GnRHR and fsh treated with 10\u202fng/gbw Pnx-20 in the pituitary and GnRHs in the hypothalamus. These results indicate that Pnx may not only stimulate the reproduction of the S. argus through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, but also directly through the pituitary.",

It has also been demonstrated that vicilin, the major storage globulin found in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) seeds, is absorbed through receptor-mediated endocytosis in the insect midgut. A putative vicilin receptor has been purified and showed high homology to \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein. However, the ingestion of a variant vicilin purified from C. maculatus resistant seeds inhibits transcytosis, resulting in the accumulation of vicilins in the midgut cells and ultimately antibiosis. In the present work, we studied the cellular up-take of phaseolin in C. maculatus larvae with the aim of discovering if this protein is also capable of inhibiting endocytic traffic in the enterocytes. FITC-labelled vicilin and FITC-labelled phaseolin were incorporated into the diet of the larvae at a physiological concentration of 0.5% w/w. The fate of labelled and non-labelled globulins was monitored by confocal microscopy. Here we demonstrated that phaseolin is also endocytosed by enterocytes causing an accumulation of endocytic vesicles in the midgut when compared to the ingestion of vicilin obtained from a susceptible V. unguiculata cultivar. From the results obtained for HNE, MDA and TBARS, a pro-oxidative scenario was established in the intestinal epithelial cells of the larvae, which may explain the deleterious effect observed in larvae developing inside P. vulgaris seeds.",

Our recent DNA database searches using bioinformatics revealed an AOX sequence in several marine copepods including Tigriopus californicus. This species lives in tidepools along the west coast of North America and is subject to a wide variety of daily environmental stresses. Here we verify the presence of the AOX gene in T. californicus and the expression of AOX mRNA and AOX protein in various life stages of the animal. We demonstrate that levels of the AOX protein increase in T. californicus in response to cold and heat stress compared to normal rearing temperature. We predict that a functional AOX pathway is present in T. californicus, propose that this species will be a useful model organism for the study of AOX in animals, and discuss future directions for animal AOX research.",

The genes identified during this screen were then studied in vivo by knockdown in zebrafish using morpholino.We found that N-alpha-acetyltransferase 15 (Naa15) knockdown enhanced c2c12 myoblast fusion, suggesting that Naa15 negatively regulates myogenic cell fusion. We identified two Naa15 orthologous genes in the zebrafish genome: Naa15a and Naa15b. These two orthologs were expressed in the myogenic domain of the somite. Knockdown of zebrafish Naa15a and Naa15b genes induced a \u201cU\u201d-shaped segmentation of the myotome and alteration of myotome boundaries, resulting in the formation of abnormally long myofibres spanning adjacent somites. Taken together, these results show that Naa15 regulates myotome formation and myogenesis in fish.",

Condition indices are broadly defined as the extent to which stored nutrient reserves allow normal physiological function and growth, but can also represent more than nutrition alone. There is currently no reliable indicator to non-destructively measure shrimp physiological or nutritional condition. In this study, haemolymph and biochemical indices were benchmarked against a range of physiological status condition indicators, including haemolymph biochemistry parameters and carcass traits, in fed and unfed sub-adult black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and across the moult cycle. Results based on fluorescent marker injection and analysis of recovered amounts showed that haemolymph volume was elevated immediately after the moult, but decreased significantly within 2 days and remained stable for the remainder of the inter-moult period. Brix index (Brix) strongly correlated with haemolymph biochemical, shrimp condition and carcass composition indices. These included haemolymph volume, total protein and triglycerides, as well as gross energy, hepatosomatic index (HSI) and body weight gain per moult. Overall, results demonstrated that Brix was the simplest, fastest and most cost-effective indicator to accurately and non-destructively estimate physiological condition in P. monodon. Given the correlations with a broad range of indices, Brix may represent a more holistic estimate of condition, incorporating multifactorial aspects of shrimp condition including moult cycle and nutrition. Additionally, the baseline measurements of metabolites across the moult and under starvation conditions improves our fundamental understanding of overall condition in P. monodon.",

High quality alternative solutions were performed, crystalline amino acids, phytase, mannan oligosaccharides and some micro-nutrients were supplemented in the low fish-meal diets.

Weight gain and survival were decreased with the decreasing dietary fish meal levels. When dietary fish-meal decreased, the gene expression of TOR, Raptor and eIF4E2 in hepatopancreas were decreased with the decreasing fish meal levels, eIF4E2 in intestine was decreased while 4E-BP was increased with the decreasing fish meal levels. The mRNA level of SOD in hepatopancreas decreased, and the expression of GPx and CAT increased with the decreasing FM levels. The Toll pathway was affected by dietary FM levels, the expression of Toll2, TNFSF, MyD88, Rho and p38 in intestine were increased with the decreasing FM levels.

Despite this, the developmental dynamics of myogenesis in bivalves remains largely unknown, particularly at the early developmental stages. In the present study, we investigate the characteristics of muscle development of Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis by phalloidin staining, light, electron and confocal microscopy. Myoblasts containing chaotic myofilaments are initially found in the blastocoel of trochophore, and become more organized during the transformation from trochophore into veliger. This is followed by a well-structured musculature including an anterior adductor, velum retractors and ventral retractors at the early veliger stage. With development into late veliger, larval muscle system is composed of the branched velum retractors and ventral retractors, anterior and posterior adductors. The most striking change for pediveliger is the development of foot retractor and mantle related muscles at this stage. During metamorphosis, the retractor muscles and anterior adductor undergo the irreversible shrink until vanishing completely towards the end of larval life, which coincide with the growth of foot retractor and mantle margin. All retractor muscles are found to be composed of striated fibres, whereas the adductor muscles have both smooth and striated components. The present study provides new evidences on the dynamic pattern of myogenesis during embryonic and larval development in scallops, which will greatly improve our understanding of scallop myogenesis and provide the basis for comparative analysis of muscle development in bivalves.",

We previously pointed out a raft-like arrangement in mussel gill mitochondrial membranes, which apparently distinguishes bivalve mollusks from mammals. To explore the relationship between the microenvironmental features and the enzyme activity, the physico-chemical features of mitochondrial membranes and the F1FO-ATPase activity temperature-dependence are here explored in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). Similarly to the mussel, clam gill mitochondrial membrane lipids exhibit a high sterol content (42\u202fmg/g protein), mainly due to phytosterols (cholesterol only attains 42% of total sterols), and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (70% of total fatty acids), especially of the n-3 family. However, the F1FO\u2013ATPase activation energies above and below the break in the Arrhenius plot (22.1\u202f\u00b0C) are lower than in mussel and mammalian mitochondria. Laurdan fluorescence spectroscopy analyses carried out at 10\u202f\u00b0C, 20\u202f\u00b0C and 30\u202f\u00b0C on mitochondrial membranes and on lipid vesicles obtained from total lipid extracts of mitochondria, indicate a physical state without coexisting domains. This mitochondrial membrane constitution, allowed by lipid-lipid and lipidprotein interactions and involving PUFA-rich phospholipids, phytosterols (much more diversified in clams than in mussels) and proteins, enables the maintenance of a homogeneous physical state in the range 10\u201330\u202f\u00b0C. Consistently, this molecular interaction network would somehow extend the temperature range of the F1FO\u2013ATPase activity and may contribute to clam resilience to temperature changes.",

It has become an attractive model for developmental studies due to its metamorphic transition from a mobile planktonic larvae to a sessile adults. To determine the effect of metamorphosis on muscle development in oyster larvae, we characterized myogenesis during larval development and metamorphosis by phalloidin staining which labels filamentous actin filaments. Our data revealed a dynamic pattern of myogenesis during embryonic and larval development. It appears that simple \u201cU-shaped\u201d muscle ring first developed at the trochophore stage. This was followed by a more complex musculature including an anterior adductor, velum ventral retractors at the veliger stage, and the addition of posterior adductors and foot retractors at the veliger and pediveliger stages. During metamorphosis, muscle structures in the anterior adductor, velum retractors and ventral retractors were degenerated. At the same time, mantle and gill musculature appeared and became the primary muscle system in juveniles together with the posterior adductor. In addition, indirect immunofluorescence with the monoclonal antibody against C. gigas muscle proteins (myosin heavy chains (MYHC) and \u03b1-actinin) were used to monitor changes in the developing musculature at different larval stages. The immunofluorescence staining results of muscle proteins were consistent with phalloidin staining. The expression locations of two muscle proteins were similar and mainly located in larval velum retractor and adductor muscle. The \u03b1-actinin expression positions were located in Z-lined of velum striated retractors. Data from these studies provide a comprehensive description of myogenesis in C. gigas embryos and larvae. Moreover, our data showed that metamorphosis has a significant impact on remolding the musculature after transition from a mobile planktonic larvae to a sessile mollusk, associated with certain muscle group degradation.",

The results show that A. crassipinnis depresses aerobic metabolic under hypoxia, with a decrease in glycolysis and oxidative enzyme activities, and increases its anaerobic metabolism with an increase in LDH activity coupled with a decrease in oxygen consumption, which indicates an increase in anaerobic capacity. In addition, the animal differentially regulates hif-1\u03b1 gene in each tissue studied, with a positive relationship to its metabolic profile, suggesting that hif-1\u03b1 might be one of the most important induction factors that regulate hypoxia tolerance in this species.",

Potential differences between the two model androgens were observed in increased expression of cyp17a1 and 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2hsd), which were only altered after exposure to DHT and in expression levels of cytochrome P450 11A1 (cyp11a1), which was upregulated by MT but not altered by DHT. Results from this study show both androgens interact at the gonadal level of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and may possess some distinct gene expression impacts. These data strengthen the current research initiatives of establishing in vitro test systems that allow toxic potential of untested chemicals to be predicted from molecular perturbations.",

     "abstract": "To examine Ca2+ absorption and transportation in the freshwater pearl oyster, Hyriopsis cumingii Lea, we studied the effects of different levels of either extracellular Ca2+ or 1,25(OH)2D3 on extracellular Ca2+ flux and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in mantle cells using the non-invasive micro-test technique and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The inner and outer mantle (IM and OM) cells from mussels were cultured and then treated with different concentrations of Ca2+ and 1,25(OH)2D3. Extracellular Ca2+ flux and intracellular Ca2+ reserves were analyzed. The results showed that both extracellular Ca2+ and 1,25(OH)2D3 had significant effects on Ca2+ flux and reserves in mantle cells, especially in IM cells (P\u202f<\u202f.05). The increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentrations resulted in the conversion of extracellular Ca2+ flux into influx with an increase in flow rate (P\u202f<\u202f.05). The calcium ion fluorescence intensity of OM cells was higher than that of IM cells (P\u202f<\u202f.05). 1,25(OH)2D3 addition also significantly increased the influx rate of extracellular Ca2+, especially in IM cells, which were more sensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3 addition and had significantly higher Ca2+ influx rates than did OM cells (P\u202f<\u202f.05). Fluorescence intensities of intracellular Ca2+ first increased and then decreased with increasing 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. The study showed that IM cells play an important role in absorbing Ca2+ from the environment, while OM cells mainly function in the temporary storage and transportation of Ca2+ in the body. The current results suggested that high levels of extracellular Ca2+ (1.25\u202fmM) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (over 100\u202fIU/L) were favorable for Ca2+ uptake and maintenance in the body.",

     "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is vector of several viruses including yellow fever virus, dengue virus chikungunya virus and Zika virus. One of the major problems involving these diseases transmission is that A. aegypti embryos are resistant to desiccation at the end of embryogenesis, surviving and remaining viable for several months inside the egg. Therefore, a fine metabolism control is essential to support these organisms throughout this period of resistance. The carbohydrate metabolism has been shown to be of great importance during arthropod embryogenesis, changing dramatically in order to promote growth and differentiation and in periods of resistance. This study investigated fundamental aspects of glucose metabolism in three stages of A. aegypti egg development: pre-desiccated, desiccated, and rehydrated. The activities of regulatory enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase, hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were evaluated. We show that these activities were reduced in A. aegypti desiccated eggs, suggesting a decreased activity of glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway. In contrast, gluconeogenesis increased in desiccated eggs, which uses protein as substrate to synthesize glucose. Accordingly, protein amount decreased during this stage, while glucose levels increased. Glycogen content, a major carbohydrate reserve in mosquitoes, was evaluated and shown to be lower in desiccated and rehydrated eggs, indicating it was used to supply energy metabolism. We observed a reactivation of carbohydrate catabolism and an increased gluconeogenesis after rehydration, suggesting that controlling glucose metabolism was essential not only to survive the period of desiccation, but also for subsequent larvae hatch. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of metabolism regulation in A. aegypti eggs during desiccation periods. Such regulatory mechanisms enable higher survival rate and consequently promote virus transmission by these important disease vectors, making them interesting subjects in the search for novel control methods.",

Although the ligand spectra of classical OBPs have been extensively characterized, little is known about OBPs in the Plus-C subgroup. Here, we focus on AlinOBP14, a Plus-C OBP from the hemipteran mirid bug pest Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze). Quantitative real-time PCR experiments suggest that AlinOBP14 is ubiquitously expressed at different developmental stages but is highly expressed in the adult head, the non-chemosensory organ. Fluorescence-based competitive binding assays show that \u03b2-ionone, nerolidol, farnesol and insect juvenile hormone III (JHIII) strongly bind to AlinOBP14. No significant internal binding pocket is predicted by homology modeling. Instead, the long N-terminal and C-terminal regions and parts of several \u03b1-helixes form a cupped cavity to accommodate ligands. Molecular docking reveals that the four potential ligands have distinct binding orientations, implying different roles of the N-terminal extension in ligand recognition. This hypothesis is further confirmed via a ligand binding assay in which the recombinant N-terminal mutant AlinOBP14 displays comparable binding affinities for \u03b2-ionone and trans, trans-farnesol but decreased binding affinities for nerolidol and JHIII. Thus, our current study is the first to characterize the ligand binding spectra of a Plus-C OBP in hemipteran insect species and reveals that N-terminal extensions could be required for its recognition of putative ligands.",

In this study, the homologous gene bcl6b and its 5 alternative splicing variants, namely bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX5, were isolated from medaka fish, Oryzias latipes. Medaka bcl6b possesses conserved domains such as BTB domain, RD2 domain and four zinc fingers. Medaka bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX3 possess all three previously mentioned domains with minor differences in sequences. Medaka bcl6bX4 possesses only the BTB domain due to premature stopping, and bcl6bX5 possesses both the BTB domain and zinc fingers without the RD2 domain. Medaka bcl6b was expressed in the tissues including the brain, heart, gill, muscle, spleen, kidney, intestine, ovary and testes of adult fish. Medaka bcl6b was expressed in the embryos from very early stage, and could be detected clearly in the developing eyes by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Medaka bcl6b could respond to the stimuli of polyI:C and LPS in the kidney and spleen. Medaka bcl6bX1 to bcl6bX3 were the majority of the variants expressed in the adult tissues and the embryos, and were the major response to the stimulation of polyI:C and LPS in the spleen. These results suggested that bcl6b, including its isoforms, could function in various tissues and embryogenesis. Moreover, bcl6b might be a factor for immune response in medaka.",

In order to explore the effect of starvation on growth-related genes in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), we studied methylation of the global DNA and growth-related genes (MSTN1,MSTN2,IGF1,IGF2) and the corresponding mRNA expressions, using ELISA-based technique, bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) technique and quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) respectively. The results showed that the global DNA methylation levels were significantly different (p\u202f<0.05) between the experimental group and the control group at starvation 14d, 21d in muscle and at starvation 7d, 14d, 28d, and re-feeding 7d in liver. The CpG islands of MSTN1, MSTN2, IGF1 and IGF2 were enriched in exons rather than promoters. The proximal promoter of MSTN1 and IGF1 and the exon1 of MSTN2 had almost no methylation at all treatment stages. The methylation status in MSTN1 exon 1 and IGF2 exon 2 varied from different starvation time, and started to have significant differences on starvation 7d (p\u202f<0.05) both in liver and muscle. In the liver there was a strong positive correlation between IGF2 exon 2 methylation and global DNA methylation (r\u202f=\u202f0.7558). The mRNA expression levels of these growth-related genes were significantly different at starvation 14d (p\u202f<0.05), but did not have significant correlation with the methylation of these exons.

Diploids fed L2 showed significantly improved growth and reduced liver, hepatic steatosis, and viscerosomatic indices, while fish fed L3 showed suppressed growth rate 14\u202fweeks post feeding. In contrast, dietary NP level had no effect on triploid performance. Whole body mineral composition, with exception of copper, did not differ between diet or ploidy. Whole fish total AAs and N-metabolites showed no variation by diet or ploidy. Free circulating AAs and white muscle N-metabolites were higher in triploids than diploids, while branch-chained amino acids were higher in diploids than triploids. Diploids had higher whole body \u03b1-tocopherol and hepatic vitamins K1 and K2 than triploids. Increased tissue B-vitamins for niacin and whole-body folate with dietary NP supplementation were observed in diploids but not triploids, while whole body riboflavin was higher in diploids than triploids. Hepatic transcriptome profiles showed that diploids fed diet L2 was more similar to that observed in triploids fed diet L3. In particular, sterol biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated, whereas cytochrome P450 metabolism was up-regulated. One\u2011carbon metabolism was also affected by increasing levels of supplementation in both ploidies. Collectively, results suggested that, for optimised growth and liver function, micronutrient levels be supplemented above current National Research Council (2011) recommendations for Atlantic salmon when fed low marine ingredient diets.

In a previous study on juveniles of green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), combined exposure to hypoxia and hypercapnia during heat stress induced a lowered critical thermal maximum (CTmax), indicated by constrained oxygen consumption, muscular spams and loss of attachment. Thus, the present study investigated the cell physiology in foot muscle of H. fulgens juveniles exposed to acute warming (18\u202f\u00b0C to 32\u202f\u00b0C at +3\u202f\u00b0C\u202fday\u22121) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia (~1000 \u03bcatm PCO2), alone and in combination, to decipher the mechanisms leading to functional loss in this tissue. Under exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnia, citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased with initial warming, in line with thermal compensation, but returned to control levels at 32\u202f\u00b0C. The anaerobic enzymes lactate and tauropine dehydrogenase increased only under hypoxia at 32\u202f\u00b0C. Under the combined treatment, CS overcame thermal compensation and remained stable overall, indicating active mitochondrial regulation under these conditions. Limited accumulation of anaerobic metabolites indicates unchanged mode of energy production. In all treatments, upregulation of Hsp70 mRNA was observed already at 30\u202f\u00b0C. However, lack of evidence for Hsp70 protein accumulation provides only limited support to thermal denaturation of proteins. We conclude that under combined hypoxia and hypercapnia, metabolic depression allowed the H. fulgens musculature to retain an aerobic mode of metabolism in response to warming but may have contributed to functional loss.",

Recent studies have established that tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), an important aquaculture-produced species in Brazil, is a herbivorous fish that can fulfil its essential FA requirements with dietary provision C18 PUFA LA and ALA, although the molecular mechanisms underpinning such ability remained unclear. The present study aimed at cloning and functionally characterizing genes encoding key desaturase and elongase enzymes, namely fads2, elovl5 and elovl2, involved in the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways in tambaqui. First, a fads2-like desaturase was isolated from tambaqui. When expressed in yeast, the tambaqui Fads2 showed \u03946, \u03945 and \u03948 desaturase capacities within the same enzyme, enabling all desaturation reactions required for ARA, EPA and DHA biosynthesis. Moreover, tambaqui possesses two elongases that are bona fide orthologs of elovl5 and elovl2. Their functional characterization confirmed that they can operate towards a variety of PUFA substrates with chain lengths ranging from 18 to 22 carbons. Overall our results provide compelling evidence that demonstrates that all the desaturase and elongase activities required to convert LA and ALA into ARA, EPA and DHA are present in tambaqui within the three genes studied herein, i.e. fads2, elovl5 and elovl2.",

Marine animals have several strategies to respond to hypoxia, including the regulation of gluconeogenesis. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a key regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis. The objective of this work was to study two isoforms of PEPCK, one mitochondrial (PEPKC-M) and one cytosolic (PEPCK-C), from the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and the response to hypoxia. Both PEPCK isoforms are 72\u202fkDa proteins and have 92% identity at the amino acid level. The mitochondrial isoform has a N-terminal signal peptide for mitochondrial import. Gene expression and enzymatic activity in subcellular fractions were detected in gills, hepatopancreas and muscle in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Expression of PEPCK-C was higher than PEPCK-M in all the tissues and induced in response to hypoxia at 48\u202fh in hepatopancreas, while the enzymatic activity of PEPCK-M was higher than PEPCK-C in gills and hepatopancreas, but not in muscle and also increased in response to hypoxia in hepatopancreas but decreased in gills and muscle. During limiting oxygen conditions, shrimp tissues obtain energy by inducing anaerobic glycolysis, and although gluconeogenesis implies energy investment, due to the need to maintain glucose homeostasis, these gluconeogenic enzymes are active with contrasting behaviors in the cytosol and mitochondrial cell compartments and appear to be up-regulated in hepatopancreas indicating this tissue pivotal role in gluconeogenesis during the response to hypoxia.",

The full-length of 5-HT7 receptor gene cDNA is 2328\u202fbp and encodes a polypeptide with 590 amino acids that are highly homologous with other crustaceans 5-HT7 receptor genes. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 5-HT7, including 7 transmembrane domains and some common features of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), indicated that 5-HT7 receptor was a member of GPCRs family. A gene expression analysis of the 5-HT7 receptor by RT-PCR revealed that the 5-HT7 receptor transcripts were widely distributed in various tissues, in which high expression levels were observed in the cranial ganglia, thoracic ganglia and intestines. Further study about the effects of photoperiods on the 5-HT7 expression in the tissues showed that a significantly increasing expression of the 5-HT7 receptor was observed in the thoracic ganglia induced by constant light. In addition, in the eyestalks, the expression levels of 5-HT7 mRNA in constant darkness and constant light were lower than control treatment. Then, the expression levels of the 5-HT7 receptor in three feeding statuses displayed that there were significantly increasing expressions in the hepatopancreas and intestines after feeding, compared with before feeding and during the feeding period. Finally, the 5-HT7 mRNA expression levels in stage III and stage IV were higher than the levels in stage I of ovarian development. Our experimental results showed that the 5-HT7 receptor structurally belongs to GPCRs, and the thoracic ganglia and eyestalks are the important tissues of the 5-HT7 receptor for light adaptation. The 5-HT7 receptor may also be involved in the physiological regulation of the hepatopancreas and intestines after ingestion in E. sinensis.

Our results showed lipids as the main energy reserve in Drosophila, and their physiological level and metabolism were shown to be under the control of AKH. AKH abundance in the body resulted in lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols than in the controls, probably due to a more intensive metabolism; interestingly, there was a disproportional representation of fatty acids in triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols in Drosophila. Lower level of glycogen and its partial control by AKH suggest its lesser role as the storage substance. However, maintenance of free carbohydrate level in Drosophila seemed to be critical; when glycogen stores are exhausted, carbohydrates are synthesized from other sources. Protein levels and their alterations, under starvation, did not seem controlled by AKH. AKH-deficient flies were more resistant while AKH-abundant flies were more sensitive to starvation; females were found to be more resistant than males, regardless of the AKH level, probably due to higher body mass and higher amount of nutrients.

However, little is known about the functions of Pnx in teleost. Here, pnx was cloned and was detected in all tissues of both male and female in spotted scat (Scatophagus argus), including growth axis, hypothalamus, pituitary, and liver. Real-time PCR analysis showed that pnx in the hypothalamus increased significantly after 2\u202fd and 7\u202fd fasting, while reduced significantly after re-feeding (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). When pituitary and liver fragments were cultured in vitro with Pnx-14 and Pnx-20 (10\u202fnM and 100\u202fnM) for 6\u202fh, the expression of ghrhr (growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor) and gh (growth hormone) in the pituitary, and ghr1 (growth hormone receptor 1) in the liver increased significantly, except ghr2 (growth hormone receptor 2) incubated with 10\u202fnM and 100\u202fnM Pnx-20 and ghr1 incubated with 10\u202fnM Pnx-20. Similarly, the expression of ghrhr and gh in the pituitary, as well as ghr1 and ghr2 in the liver, increased significantly after injecting S. argus with Pnx-14 and Pnx-20 (10\u202fng/g and 100\u202fng/g body weight). These results indicate that Pnx is likely to be involved in the regulation of food intake, and also regulates the growth of S. argus by increasing ghrhr and gh expression in the pituitary, ghr1 and ghr2 in the liver, and ghr1 directly in the liver.",

In this study, a full-length cDNA of myosin Va (named as EsMyoVa) was cloned from the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, and the expression patterns were detected in different tissues and larval developmental stages. The full-length cDNA of EsMyoVa was 6037\u202fbp in length. Real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that EsMyoVa transcript has a wide tissue distribution pattern and is expressed in zoeae, megalopa, juvenile crab stages and adults. In order to further study the function of this gene, we used RNAi technology in the muscle, hepatopancreas, gill, and gonad. After double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) injection, the expression level of EsMyoVa was significantly decreased in all tissues in both sexes and the gene knockdown effects of dsRNA persisted for at least 6\u202fdays. Subsequently, the role of EsMyoVa was revealed by silencing the transcript through one month injections of Myosin Va dsRNA. Crabs with reduced levels of EsMyoVa transcripts displayed a dramatic slowing in growth rate and considerably higher mortality compared to control groups, which indicated that this gene had important role of regulating growth and development.",

To understand oogenesis and reproductive capacity, it is necessary to characterize vitellogenins (Vtgs), which are the precursors of major egg yolk proteins (Yps). Therefore, to improve our understanding of the entire process of egg yolk generation in female turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), we obtained full-length cDNAs of vtg genes, examined gene expression in the female liver and ovary, and analyzed Vtg synthesis in the ovary. Three distinct complete polypeptide sequences were identified and designated as VtgAa, VtgAb, and VtgC, which confirmed the multiplicity of the vtg gene in turbot and showed that it follows a \u201cthree vtg model\u201d. The expression of these three vtg genes in the female liver was far higher than that in other tissues, including the ovary. The expression of all three vtg genes was extremely low before vitellogenesis, and then increased and was maintained at a high level until the degradation stage, which was in accordance with changes in the concentration of estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) and the gonadosomatic index. Compared with the liver, the ovary had a higher E2 level and lower vtg expression, suggesting that some other factors limit high vtg expression in the ovary of turbot. Transcripts of vtgAb and the Yps derived from them were both detected in oogonia and primary oocytes, which showed that these might possess the ability to perform autosynthesis of yolk. These findings add to our understanding of the reproductive physiology of Vtg synthesis in turbot.",

In this study, seven dnmts genes (dnmt1, dnmt2, dnmt3aa, dnmt3ab, dnmt3ba, dnmt3bb.1, dnmt3bb.2) were identified in Nile tilapia. Comprehensive analyses of dnmts were performed using available genome databases from representative animal species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the dnmts family were highly conserved in teleosts. Based on transcriptome data from eight adult tilapia tissues, the dnmts were found to be dominantly expressed in the head kidney, testis and ovary. Analyses of the gonadal transcriptome data in different developmental stages revealed that all dnmts were expressed in both ovary and testis, and four de novo dnmts (dnmt3aa, dnmt3ab, dnmt3bb.1, dnmt3bb.2) showed higher expression in the testis than in the ovary. Furthermore, during sex reversal induced by Fadrozole, the expression of these four de novo dnmts increased significantly in treated group compared to female control group. By in situ hybridization, the seven dnmts were found to be expressed mainly in phase I and II oocytes of the ovary and spermatocytes of the testis. When gonads were incubated with a methyltransferase inhibitor (5-AzaCdR) in vitro, the expression of dnmts genes were down-regulated significantly, while the expression of cyp19a1a (a key gene in female pathway) and dmrt1 (a key gene in male pathway) increased significantly.

In this study, we analyzed the expression and DNA methylation of cyp19a from Chinese sea perch Lateolabrax maculatus (sp. cyp19a1a). The sp. cyp19a1a gene consists of 9 exons, but only 3.5\u202fkb, being smaller than the human cyp19a1a, as a result of small introns. The sp. cyp19a1a protein contains 518 amino acid residues and evolutionarily conserved domains and is clustered in the teleost subfamily on the phylogenetic tree. Amino acid alignment indicates that sp. cyp19a1a shares the highest identity (91.6%) to Epinephelus akaara and Lates calcarifer. Endogenous sp. cyp19a1a is detected mainly in stromal cells around the oocytes of stage I ovary, and the gene expression level has no difference after 40\u202fdays fresh water culture in both ovary and testis. The sp. Cyp19a1a can catalyze the production of estrogen from androgen in vitro. Seven CpG dinucleotides are found in the proximal promoter. Binding sites of the conserved predicted transcription factors include cAMP response element, steroidogenic factor-1, and SRY-Box. The deletion of this region reduces promoter activity significantly. The methylation level of the seven CpG dinucleotides in cyp19a1a promoter is higher in the testis (44.25\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.04) than in the ovary (24.71\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.05).

Furthermore, antibody staining indicated that cell types obtained in primary cultures, containing the epithelial stem-cell marker tumorprotein 63, were different from cells in long-term cell cultures, containing tight junction protein zona occludens 1 and cytokeratin 7. These observations suggest a switch of dominant cell types. Molecular analysis of gene expression profiles of caudal fin tissue and CCApin cells showed that genes relevant in epithelial cells but also in mesenchymal cells were expressed. However, during cultivation of CCApin a set of very steadily expressed, primarily mesenchymal genes like collagen 1 alpha 1, fibronectin or cadherin 2 was found. In summary, the long-term cell culture could be described as a stably growing epithelial population with some mesenchymal features.

In the present study, we investigated characteristics and functions of a CHST1 gene identified from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii (PmCHST1b) which participated in the synthesis of keratan sulfate. PmCHST1b amino acid sequence carried a typical sulfotransferase-3 domain (sulfotransfer-3 domain) and belonged to membrane-associated sulfotransferases. Homologous analysis of CHST1 from different species showed the conserved motif (5\u2032 PSB motif and 3\u2032 PB motif) which interacted with 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine-5\u2032-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Structure analysis of sulfotransferase domain indicted that PmCHST1b showed the conserved catalytic structure character and the relationships presented in the phylogenetic tree conformed to that of traditional taxonomy. Expression pattern of PmCHST1b in different tissues and development stages showed that PmCHST1b widely expressed in all the detected tissues and development stages and showed the highest expression level in the central zone of mantle (MC). PmCHST1b expressed highly in the trochophore, D-stage larvae and spat which corresponded to prodissoconch and dissoconch shell formation, respectively. RNA interference (RNAi) successfully inhibited expression level of PmCHST1b in MC (P<0.05), and sulfate polymer content in the extrapallial fluid significantly reduced (P<0.05). Crystallization of shell nacre became irregular. Results above indicated that PmCHST1b may affect nacre formation by participating in synthesis of keratan sulfate in extrapallial fluid.

Immunofluorescence analysis performed from 2-cell stage to 8-day after hatch (DAH) shows that Vasa protein is specific for PGCs. These cells were first observed in the peripheral and dorsal regions of the blastodisc at approximately the 50%-epiboly stage and migrated to both sides of embryo body during the development. Finally, at 7 DAH the PGCs of the hatching embryo reached the place where the gonad will be developed. Histology analysis of larvae showed a genital ridge with enclosed PGCs on the dorsal side of the peritoneum at 9 DAH, gonadal primordium growth was observed at 11 DAH as a result of the interaction between PGCs and somatic cells derived from the peritoneum. Results of qPCR showed that vasa expression was restricted to the embryonic and early larval development, highest values were observed in 2-cell and mid-blastula stage suggesting the maternal inheritance of vasa mRNA. These findings support the hypothesis of preformation in T. macdonaldi PGCs. The migration pattern of PGCs allow us to recommend the isolation and subsequent cryopreservation of these cells before 7 DAH when the embryonic and larval development is given at 21\u202f\u00b0C.",

Mb both at mRNA and protein levels have been reported in this study for the first time from a number of muscle and non-muscle tissues of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, a hypoxia intolerant species. Mb transcript levels were high in the heart and slow skeletal muscle, and were comparatively high in the gonad and gill among the non-muscle tissues. Western-blotting by using anti-rainbow trout Mb peptide rabbit antibody detected Mb protein in the muscles and several non-muscle tissues. By both RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, Mb was localized in the cardiomyocytes and oxidative muscle fibers. On the other hand, Mb both at mRNA and protein levels was restricted to the lamellar epithelial cells of the gill, epithelial layers of hepato-biliary duct, neurons and endothelial cells of brain, ooplasm of gonad, kidney tubules, endothelial cells, and epithelial layer of intestine. Neuroglobin isoform 1 and 2 mRNAs along with Mb mRNA were localized in the granular layer of cerebellum.

     "abstract": "The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a master regulator of melanocyte development through the direct transcriptional control of related genes, e.g., the phenoloxidase gene. In this study, an MITF gene, MpMITF2, was identified in the clam Meretrix petechialis. The full-length cDNA of MpMITF2 was 2026\u202fbp, and the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 42.6\u202fkDa. A basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain was detected in the deduced protein sequence, which can bind the E-box motif within the promoter of the downstream genes. The mRNA of MpMITF2 was more highly expressed in the mantle compared to the other four tissues. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the mRNA expression of MpMITF2 among three clam strains with different shell colors. The protein level of MpMITF2 was also different among these strains. These results implied that MpMITF2 was associated with shell color formation in the clam M. petechialis. When the mRNA expression of MpMITF2 was knocked down, the new shell showed discontinuous pigment distribution, suggesting that the reduced expression of MpMITF2 influenced pigment synthesis. A gene encoding phenoloxidase (MpPO) was identified as related to the shell color of the clam and was also a putative downstream gene of MITF. Both the mRNA and protein levels of MpPO decreased significantly at 12\u202fh post-MpMITF-suppression, suggesting that MpMITF2 is required for the expression of MpPO. Our results indicate the close relationships among MpMITF2, MpPO and shell color. This study implicates the role of MITF in shell color formation in the clam M. petechialis.",

The level of PmBys1 mRNA in ovaries was greater than that in other tissues of females and in testes of males in both juveniles and wild broodstock (P\u202f<\u202f.05). In non-ablated wild female broodstock, PmBys1 mRNA significantly and progressively increased in ovaries from stage I of development, peaking at stage IV (P\u202f<\u202f.05).

The current study examined cell signaling cascades in hibernating monito del monte, Dromiciops gliroides, a South American marsupial of the Order Microbiotheria. Responses to hibernation by members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and their roles in coordinating hibernator metabolism were examined in liver, kidney, heart and brain of control and versus hibernating (4\u00a0days continuous torpor) D. gliroides. The targets evaluated included key protein kinases in their activated phosphorylated forms (p-ERK/MAPK 1/2, p-MEK1, p-MSK1, p-p38, p-JNK) and related target proteins (p-CREB 2, p-ATF2, p-c-Jun and p-p53). Liver exhibited a strong coordinated response by MAPK members to hibernation with significant increases in protein phosphorylation levels of p-MEK1, p-ERK/MAPK1/2, p-MSK1, p-JNK and target proteins c-Jun, and p-ATF2, all combining to signify a strong activation of MAPK signaling during hibernation. Kidney also showed activation of MAPK cascades with significant increases in p-MEK1, p-ERK/MAPK1/2, p-p38, and p-c-Jun levels in hibernating animals. By contrast, responses by heart and brain indicated reduced MAPK pathway function during torpor with reduced phosphorylation of targets including p-ERK/MAPK 1/2 in both tissues as well as lower p-p38 and p-JNK content in heart. Overall, the data indicate a vital role for MAPK signaling in regulating the cell stress response during marsupial hibernation.",

     "abstract": "When faced with harsh environmental conditions, the South American marsupial, monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), reduces its body temperature and uses either daily torpor or multiday hibernation to survive. This study used ELISA and multiplex assays to characterize the responses to hibernation by three regulatory components of protein translation machinery [p-eIF2\u03b1(S51), p-eIF4E(S209), p-4EBP(Thr37/46)] and eight targets involved in upstream signaling control of translation [p-IGF-1R(Tyr1135/1136), PTEN(S380), p-Akt(S473), p-GSK-3\u03b1(S21), p-GSK-3\u03b2(S9), p-TSC2(S939), p-mTOR(S2448), and p70S6K(T412)]. Liver, brain and kidney were analyzed comparing control and hibernation (4\u00a0days continuous torpor) conditions. In the liver, increased phosphorylation of IGF-1R, Akt, GSK-3\u03b2, TSC2, mTOR, eIF2\u03b1, and 4EBP (1.60\u20131.98 fold compared to control) occurred during torpor suggesting that the regulatory phosphorylation cascade and protein synthesis remained active during torpor. However, responses by brain and kidney differed; torpor resulted in increased phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 (2.15\u20134.17 fold) and TSC2 (2.03\u20133.65 fold), but phosphorylated Akt decreased (to 34\u201362% of control levels). Torpor also led to an increase in phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (1.4 fold) content in the brain. These patterns of differential protein phosphorylation in brain and kidney were indicative of suppression of protein translation but also could suggest an increase in antioxidant and anti-apoptotic signaling during torpor. Previous studies of liver metabolism in hibernating eutherian mammals have shown that Akt kinase and its downstream signaling components play roles in facilitating hypometabolism by suppressing energy expensive anabolic processes during torpor. However, the results in this study reveal differences between eutherian and marsupial hibernators, suggesting alternative actions of liver Akt during torpor.",

     "abstract": "The South American marsupial, monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides) uses both daily torpor and multi-day hibernation to survive in its southern Chile native environment. The present study leverages multiplex technology to assess the contributions of key stress-inducible cell cycle regulators and heat shock proteins to hibernation in liver, heart, and brain of monito del monte in a comparison of control versus 4\u00a0day hibernating conditions. The data indicate that MDM2, a stress-responsive ubiquitin ligase, plays a crucial role in marsupial hibernation since all three tissues showed statistically significant increases in MDM2 levels during torpor (1.6\u20131.8 fold). MDM2 may have a cytoprotective action to deal with ischemia/reperfusion stress and is also involved in a nutrient sensing pathway where it could help regulate the metabolic switch to fatty acid oxidation during torpor. Elevated levels of stress-sensitive cell cycle regulators including ATR (2.32\u20133.91 fold), and the phosphorylated forms of p-Chk1 (Ser345) (1.92 fold), p-Chk2 (Thr68) (2.20 fold) and p21 (1.64 fold) were observed in heart and liver during hibernation suggesting that the cell cycle is likely suppressed to conserve energy while animals are in torpor. Upregulation of heat shock proteins also occurred as a cytoprotective strategy with increased levels of hsp27 (2.00 fold) and hsp60 (1.72\u20132.76 fold) during hibernation. The results suggest that cell cycle control and selective chaperone action are significant components of hibernation in D. gliroides and reveal common molecular responses to those seen in eutherian hibernators.",

     "abstract": "Mammalian hibernation is characterized by extensive adjustments to metabolism that typically include suppression of carbohydrate catabolism and a switch to triglycerides as the primary fuel during torpor. A crucial locus of control in this process is the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex that gates carbohydrate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Within the complex, the E1 enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the main regulatory site and is subject to inhibitory phosphorylation at three serine residues (S232, S293, S300). To determine if marsupial hibernators show a comparable focus on PDH to regulate fuel metabolism, the current study explored PDH control by site-specific phosphorylation in the South American marsupial, monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides). Luminex multiplex technology was used to analyze PDH responses in six tissues comparing control and hibernating (4\u00a0days continuous torpor) animals. Total PDH content did not change significantly during hibernation in any tissue but phospho-PDH content increased in all. Heart PDH showed increased phosphorylation at all three sites by 8.1-, 10.6- and 2.1-fold for S232, S293 and S300, respectively. Liver also showed elevated p-S300 (2.5-fold) and p-S293 (4.7-fold) content. Phosphorylation of S232 and S293 increased significantly in brain and lung but only S232 phosphorylation increased in kidney and skeletal muscle. The results show that PDH suppression via enzyme phosphorylation during torpor is a conserved mechanism for inhibiting carbohydrate catabolism in both marsupial and eutherian mammals, an action that would also promote the switch to fatty acid oxidation instead.",

     "abstract": "Most small rodents reduce energy demand in hypoxia via behavioural strategies. For example, animals may reduce their activity, and/or move to colder environments or alter huddling strategies to take advantage of anapyretical energy savings. Naked mole rats (NMRs) are among the most hypoxia tolerant mammals and are highly social; social interactions also have a significant impact on behaviour. Therefore, this species offers a fascinating model in which to study trade-offs between social interactions and energy conservation in hypoxia. We hypothesized that the need to conserve energy in hypoxia supersedes the impetus of sociality in this species and predicted that, in hypoxia, behaviour would not differ between individuals or groups of NMRs. To test this hypothesis, we placed awake, freely behaving NMRs, alone or in groups of 2 or 4, into a temperature-controlled apparatus and measured behavioural activity during 1\u202fh each of normoxia (21% O2), acute hypoxia (7% O2), and normoxic recovery. We found that in normoxia, groups of 4 NMRs were significantly more active in all temperatures than were groups of 1\u20132 NMRs. When exposed to hypoxia, individual NMRs were ~50% less active and their speed was reduced relative to normoxic levels. Conversely, groups of 2 or 4 NMRs exhibited minor or insignificant decreases in time spent active and speed in hypoxia and huddling behaviour was not altered. Our findings suggest that social interactions influence behavioural strategies employed by NMRs in hypoxia.",

     "abstract": "Due to the substantial photosynthetic biomass in their habitat, salmonids such as the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) can be subject to hyperoxia in addition to high temperatures associated with climate change. Both stressful conditions increase the incidence of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). The mitochondrial association of hexokinase has been shown to increase in the hearts of certain fish experiencing hypoxia in a putative cardioprotective response to oxidative stress. In this study, the mitochondrial association of hexokinase I (HKI) and markers of oxidative damage and metabolic stress were probed to elucidate the cardioprotective role of hexokinase in the rainbow trout. Results showed that the co-administration of hyperoxia and hyperthermia increased the ventricular mitochondrially-bound fraction of HKI, whereas exposure to hyperthermia in normoxia had no effect; in the combined condition there was little evidence of increased stress. A second in vitro study using ventricular strips and isolated cardiomyocytes was undertaken to reconcile the cardioprotective role of HK in the rainbow trout with findings in mammalian studies, confirming that mitochondrial association of HK maintains aerobic efficiency and inhibits apoptosis. Finally, protein sequence analysis suggested that the physiological contributions of HKI and HKII in salmonids vary from those in mammals, further explaining the dynamic nature of the traditionally-inert HKI. Together, these findings help to explain the broader functions of HKI in the salmonid heart, and illustrate the role of complex environmental conditions in defining physiological responses.",

We tested the acclimation capacity of cardiac HSP70 and HSP90 in four populations of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-adapted salmonid. We acclimated fish to four temperatures (8\u00a0\u00b0C, 11\u00a0\u00b0C, 15\u00a0\u00b0C, and 19\u00a0\u00b0C) and measured cardiac HSP70 and HSP90 levels by western blot prior to and following an acute (1\u00a0h) heat shock at 23\u00a0\u00b0C. Basal and induced cardiac HSP70 and HSP90 expression was similar among lake trout populations. Induced cardiac HSP70 was significantly lower in heat-shocked lake trout acclimated to 19\u00a0\u00b0C compared to all other temperatures. Acclimation temperature had no significant effect on cardiac HSP90 prior to heat shock (control HSP90) and a significant effect on HSP90 in heat-shocked fish, although most significant treatment comparisons were marginal. However, for warm-acclimated fish (15\u00a0\u00b0C and 19\u00a0\u00b0C), cardiac HSP90 levels were lower in heat-shocked versus control fish. Together, this suggests that the induction temperature of cardiac HSP synthesis may increase with warm acclimation in lake trout. This plasticity in the cardiac HSR could assist lake trout populations in coping with longer periods of thermal stress as predicted by climate change models. The cardiac HSR supports previous research suggesting lake trout thermal physiology may be conserved across a wide geographic range.",

     "abstract": "The ion channel arrest hypothesis has been the foundation of three decades of research into the underlying mechanisms of hypoxia/anoxia tolerance in several key species, including: painted turtles, goldfish, crucian carp, naked mole rats, and arctic and ground squirrels. The hypothesis originally stated that hypoxia/anoxia tolerant species ought to have fewer ion channels per area membrane and/or mechanisms to regulate the conductance of ion channels. Today we can add to this and include mechanisms to remove channels from membranes and the expression of low conductance isoforms. Furthermore, possible oxygen sensing mechanisms in brain include a link to mitochondrial function, changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species, and activation of protein kinase C and a phosphatase. Importantly ion channel arrest leads to a decrease in metabolic rate that is fundamental to survival without oxygen and in brain is reflected in decreased action potential frequency or spike arrest. This results not only from a decrease in excitatory glutamatergic receptor currents but also by an increase in inhibitory GABAergic receptor currents. The surprising finding that ionic conductance through some ion channels increases is novel and contrary to the ion channel arrest hypothesis. The major insight that this offers is that key regulatory events are occurring at the level of the synapse and we therefore propose the \u201csynaptic arrest hypothesis\u201d.",

To gain insight into the putative regulatory mechanisms underlying the anoxia-induced inhibition of complex V in T. scripta, we examined the effects of two weeks anoxia exposure at 4\u202f\u00b0C on the mitochondrial proteome and candidate mechanisms that have been shown to regulate complex V in other organisms. In T. scripta, we confirmed that anoxia exposure resulted in a >80% inhibition of complex V in heart, brain and liver. Incubation of mitochondria with the nitric oxide donor, s-nitrosoglutathione, did not affect complex V activity despite showing the expected inhibition in mice. Proteomics analysis showed anoxia-induced decreases in three peripheral stalk subunits of complex V, possibly pointing to a unique site of regulation. Proteomics analysis also revealed differential expression of numerous enzymes involved with the electron transport system, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism in response to anoxia exposure.",

While the relationship between hypoxia, redox balance, energy charge and resulting mitochondrial dysfunction has been examined in the context of hypoxia-linked pathologies, little is known about the direct effects of decreases in environmental oxygen on reversible lysine acetylation, and the resulting modifications to mitochondrial metabolism. To address this knowledge gap, we exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 16\u202fh of hypoxia (2.21\u202fkPa) and quantified acetylation levels of 1220 proteins using whole-cell proteomics in samples of brain taken from normoxic and hypoxic zebrafish. In addition, we examined the effects of hypoxia on cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox status, whole-cell energetics, the activity of the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT3, and electron transport chain complex activities to determine if there is an association between hypoxia-induced metabolic disturbances, protein acetylation, and mitochondrial function. Our results (1) reveal several key changes in the acetylation status of proteins in the brain, primarily within the mitochondria; (2) show significant fluctuations in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox status within the brain during hypoxia exposure; and (3) provide evidence that lysine acetylation may be related to large changes in electron transport and ATP-synthase complex activities and adenylate status in zebrafish exposed to hypoxic stress.

Metabolic suppression is achieved, primarily, via reduced protein synthesis, which is a major sink for metabolic energy. Posttranslational modifications on histone H3 suggest a condensed chromatin state and, hence, decreased transcription. Under hypoxia, p-H3S10, Ac-H3K9, Ac-H3K14 were 39, 68, and 36% of control values, respectively. We also report a net decrease in protein translation. In particular, eEF2 activity is reduced due to a ~\u00a05-fold increase in inhibitory phosphorylation and a significant decrease in protein level. Elevated heat shock proteins suggest that, despite impressive tolerance, the cellular stress response is triggered during hypoxia. We discuss the implications for pelagic ecology and biogeochemical cycles.",

Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude have evolved an enhanced aerobic capacity in hypoxia, along with increased capillarity and oxidative capacity of locomotory muscle. Here, we examined whether exposure to chronic hypoxia during development or adulthood affects muscle phenotype. Deer mice from a highland population were bred in captivity at sea level, and exposed to normoxia or one of four treatments of hypobaric hypoxia (12\u00a0kPa O2, simulating hypoxia at ~\u00a04300\u00a0m): adult hypoxia (6\u20138\u00a0weeks), post-natal hypoxia (birth to adulthood), pre-natal hypoxia (before conception to adulthood), and parental hypoxia (in which mice were conceived and raised in normoxia, but their parents were previously exposed to hypoxia). Litter size was similar across treatments, and pups survived the hypoxia exposures and grew to similar body masses at ~\u00a06\u20138\u00a0months of age. Hypoxia had no effect on the masses of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. There was a strong concordance between two distinct histological methods for staining capillaries in the gastrocnemius \u2013 alkaline phosphatase activity and binding of Griffonia simplicifolia lectin I \u2013 each of which showed that capillarity and muscle fibre size were largely unaffected by hypoxia. Maximal activities of several metabolic enzymes (cytochrome c oxidase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase) in the gastrocnemius were also largely unaffected by hypoxia. Therefore, the evolved muscle phenotype of high-altitude deer mice is relatively insensitive to hypoxia across life stages.",

     "abstract": "Sprouty2 (Spry2) acts as a central regulator of tubular growth and branch patterning in the developing mammalian lung by controlling both magnitude and duration of growth factor signalling. To determine if this protein coordinates airway and vascular growth factor signalling, we tested the hypothesis that Spry2 links the primary cue for airway outgrowth, fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10), to genomic events underpinning the expression and release of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Using primary fetal distal lung epithelial cells (FDLE) from rat, and immortalised human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-), we identified a nuclear sub-population of Spry2 which interacted with regions of the rat and human VEGF-A promoter spanning the hypoxia response element (HRE) and adjacent 3\u2032 sites. In FDLE cultured at the PO2 of the fetal lung, FGF-10 relieved the Spry2 interaction at the HRE region by promoting clearance of a 39\u202fkDa form and this was accompanied by histone-3 S10K14 phosphoacetylation, promoter de-methylation, hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 activation and VEGF-A expression. This repressive characteristic of nuclear Spry2 was relieved in 16HBE14o- by shRNA knockdown, and stable expression of mutants (C218A; C221A) that do not interact with the VEGF-A promoter HRE region. We conclude that nuclear Spry2 acts as a molecular link which co-ordinates airway and vascular growth of the cardiopulmonary system. This identifies Spry2 as a contributing determinant of design optimality in the mammalian lung.",

However, oxygen consumption may respond differently to changes in conditions than superoxide/H2O2 production does, complicating the use of respiration as a sole indicator of mitochondrial energetics. The same equipment that is valuable for fluorescent monitoring of H2O2 efflux provides a straightforward means of estimating membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8), thereby an alternative metric of mitochondrial energetics is readily added to complement studies on the link between mitochondrial energetics and electron leak. By combining multiple aspects of mitochondrial energetics a far more detailed picture emerges on why changes in superoxide/H2O2 formation arise with reduced dependence on assumptions. Here we illustrate integration of experimental methods via demonstration of linkages between mitochondrial \u0394\u03a8, oxygen consumption and superoxide/H2O2 formation (the latter estimated by H2O2 efflux).

Oxidative damage (as TBARS), free radical scavenging capacity (as ABTS+ oxidation), uric acid (UA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the protein expression levels of heat shock proteins (Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp90) were studied in digestive gland, kidney and foot. Tissue TBARS of hibernating snails (45\u00a0days) was higher than active snails. Hibernation produced an increase of ABTS+ in digestive gland, probably because of the sustained antioxidant defenses (UA and/or GSH and SOD levels). Kidney protection during the activity-hibernation cycle seemed provided by increased UA concentrations. TBARS in the foot remained high 30\u00a0min after arousal with no changes in ABTS+, but this tissue increased ABTS+ oxidation at 24\u00a0h to expenses increased UA and decreased GSH levels, and with no changes in SOD and CAT activities. The level of Hsp70 in kidney showed no changes throughout the activity-hibernation cycle but it increased in the foot after hibernation. The tissue levels of Hsp90 in snails hibernating were higher than active snails and returned to baseline 24\u00a0h after arousal. Results showed that chronic cooling produces a significant oxidative damage in three studied tissues and that these tissue damages are overcome quickly (between 30\u00a0min to 24\u00a0h) with fluctuations in different antioxidant defenses (UA, GSH, CAT) and heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90).",

Here, we measure the activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes to test if previously documented genetic and transcriptomic variation between \u2018dwarf\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 Lake Whitefish ecotypes are associated with corresponding changes in enzyme activity (measured as maximal rate, Vmax) in liver and skeletal muscle.

However, the differences in hepatic mRNA content found between ecotypes in prior studies are not associated with comparable changes in enzyme activity. For example, dwarf whitefish have lower enzyme activities, but higher transcript abundances for two glycolytic enzymes compared to normal whitefish. Overall, we find that transcriptomic studies successfully highlight evolutionary variation in enzyme activities, but not always in the direction predicted, indicating that a variety of tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms contributed to the evolution of energy metabolism in Lake Whitefish.",

This latter trait is generally accepted to be an \u2018adaptation to subterranean life\u2019, despite the fact that no data are available for more basal mole lineages that have no evolutionary history of fossoriality (i.e. the ambulatory, high-elevation shrew-like moles and the semi-aquatic desmans), and which may similarly benefit from an elevated blood O2 affinity. To test whether evolution of a low DPG sensitivity phenotype is linked to derived fossorial lifestyles or represents an ancestral trait for the family, we determined the globin gene sequences and measured the intrinsic O2 affinity and co-factor sensitivity of the major Hb component of the gracile shrew-like mole (Uropsilus gracilis) and the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus). Our results unequivocally demonstrate that the presence of \u03b24 Ser and \u03b25 Gly, together with a low DPG sensitivity Hb phenotype, predates the radiation of the family Talpidae, and hence did not evolve as a specific adaptation to fossorial life. By contrast, our comparative analyses suggest that variations in whole blood O2 affinity among members of this family predominantly arose from amino acid substitutions that increase or decrease the intrinsic O2 affinity of the protein.",

     "abstract": "Energy metabolism is determined by a suite of regulatory mechanism, and their increasing complexity over evolutionary time provides the key to understanding the emergence of different metabolic phenotypes. Energy metabolism is at the core of biological processes because all organisms must maintain energy balance against thermodynamic gradients. Energy metabolism is regulated by a bewildering array of interacting molecular mechanisms, and much of what is known about metabolic regulation comes from the medical literature. However, ecology and evolutionary research would gain considerably by incorporating regulatory mechanisms more explicitly in research on topics such as the evolution of endothermy, metabolic plasticity, and energy balance. The purpose of this brief review is to summarise the main regulatory pathways of energy metabolism in animals and their evolutionary origins to make these complex interactions more accessible to researchers from a broad range of backgrounds. Some of the principal regulators of energy balance, such as the AMP-stimulated protein kinase, have an ancient prokaryotic origin. Most regulatory pathways (e.g. thyroid hormone, insulin, adipokines), however, are eukaryotic in origin and diversified substantially in metazoans and vertebrates. Diversification in vertebrates is at least partly due to genome duplications early in this lineage. The interaction between regulatory mechanisms permitted an increasingly sophisticated fine-tuning of energy balance and metabolism. Hence, regulatory complexity increased over evolutionary time, and taxa differ in their potential range of metabolic phenotypes. Choice of model organism therefore becomes important, and bacteria or even invertebrates are not good models for more derived vertebrates. Different metabolic phenotypes and their evolution, such as endothermy and metabolic plasticity, should be interpreted against this regulatory background.",

Under normoxia, at physiological levels of extracellular glucose, RBCs and heart produce lactate although the contribution of anaerobic metabolism to ATP production is small. Sustained lactate production from extracellular glucose appears to be the primary fate of extracellular glucose. In many cases, glycogen is not mobilized and the rate of glucose metabolism\u00a0=\u00a0two times the rate of lactate production. As such, alternative metabolic sources are required to fuel oxidative metabolism. Under hypoxia, hearts from Atlantic cod and rainbow trout increase rates of both glucose metabolism and lactate production, partially supported by glycogen reserves. But in lumpfish and short-horned sculpin hearts there is no change in rates of glucose metabolism. The most likely explanation is that glucose uptake is compromised in lumpfish and short-horned sculpin hearts due to a low diffusion gradient. Under these conditions rates of lactate production are well below that of Atlantic cod or rainbow trout. Energy demand must be reduced under hypoxia in lumpfish and short-horned sculpin hearts in order to maintain ATP balance.",

The present study investigated how severe dehydration affected the transcript levels, kinetic profile, and phosphorylation state of the key glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) in the liver and skeletal muscle of X. laevis. Compared to control frogs, severely dehydrated frogs showed an increase in the transcript abundance of both liver and muscle isoforms of PK. While the kinetics of muscle PK did not differ between dehydrated and control frogs, PK from the liver of dehydrated frogs had a lower Km for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (38%), a lower Ka for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6P2) (32%), and a greater activation of PK via F1,6P2 (1.56-fold). PK from dehydrated frogs also had a lower phosphorylation-state (25%) in comparison to the enzyme from control frogs in the liver. Experimental manipulation of the phosphorylation-state of liver PK taken from control frogs by endogenous protein phosphatases resulted in decreased phosphorylation, and a similar kinetic profile as seen in dehydrated frogs. The physiological consequence of dehydration-induced PK modification appears to adjust PK function to remain active during a metabolically depressed state. This study provides evidence for the maintenance of PK activity through elevated mRNA levels and a dephosphorylation event which activates frog liver PK in the dehydrated state in order to facilitate the production of ATP via anaerobic glycolysis.",

The mechanisms underlying apparent high rates of glucose and fructose oxidation in hummingbird flight muscle remain unclear. We examined relative expression of facilitative sugar transporters (GLUTs) and enzymes of fructolysis in ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) tissues involved in energy homeostasis and flight, via qPCR and measured hexokinase activity in pectoralis in vitro. We hypothesized that expression of these genes was upregulated in hummingbird flight muscle compared to other vertebrates. We found that hummingbird pectoralis had high relative transcript abundance of GLUT1 and GLUT5 compared to expression profiles of other vertebrates. In particular, GLUT5 expression in pectoralis was similar to that of intestine. We demonstrated minimal relative densities of fructolytic enzymes in pectoralis, suggesting that the ketohexokinase pathway does not rapidly metabolize fructose in these muscles. Instead, we found that the capacity for phosphorylation of either glucose or fructose by hexokinase is very high in pectoralis in vitro. The contributions of individual hexokinase isoforms remain to be determined. Our results further characterize the strategies by which hummingbirds, and perhaps other nectarivores, accomplish rapid sugar flux.

The deduced amino acid sequences of these two genes shared highly conserved structures with those from other teleosts. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the Pf_IL-1\u03b2 mRNA had relatively high expression levels in trunk kidney and blood, and the Pf_IL-1RI mRNA was highly expressed in blood and had relatively high expression level in liver. Ontogenetic expression analyses indicate that the Pf_IL-1\u03b2 and Pf_IL-1RI genes may play important roles during the embryonic developmental stages. The mRNA expression levels of Pf_IL-1\u03b2 and Pf_IL-1RI genes were up-regulated in the trunk kidney, head kidney, blood, spleen, heart and liver after Edwardsiella ictaluri challenge. Western blot analyses showed that Pf_IL-1\u03b2 protein was highly expressed in the spleen and head kidney, but not in the fin of adult individuals. These results suggest that the Pf_IL-1\u03b2 and Pf_IL-1RI genes may play significant roles in the immune regulation and defense against E. ictaluri in the yellow catfish.",

     "abstract": "Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) undergoes metamorphosis by changing its body from the larval to the juvenile form, and this process involves muscle development. Smyd1, a histone methyltransferase, plays a role in the skeletal muscle. In the present study, the Smyd1a and Smyd1b expression patterns and their 5\u2032 UTR and exon 1 DNA methylation levels were analyzed during metamorphosis of the Japanese flounder. Sample were analyzed 21\u202fdays post-hatching (dph) (with no migration of right eye; M1stage), 28 dph (during migration of right eye; M2 stage), and 35 dph (after migration of right eye; M3 stage). The results show that Smyd1a expression was highest in the M2 stage and then decreased, whereas Smyd1b expression continued to rise during the three stages. Methylation levels of CpG sites at positions \u22122318 and \u22122217 of the Smyd1a P region (\u22122462 to \u22122181 region of the 5\u2032 UTR), and the CpG sites at positions \u2212351, \u2212330, \u2212284, \u2212190, and\u202f\u2212\u202f92 of the Smyd1b promoter, with both regions containing putative transcription factor binding sites, showed significant differences in the three stages (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Interestingly, the methylation levels of these CpG sites were negatively correlated with mRNA expression. We inferred that binding of the predicted transcription factors might be affected by methylation of the CpG sites and thus modulate gene expression. Taken together, our results suggest that DNA methylation in the Smyd1a and Smyd1b genes participates in the regulation of metamorphosis, and epigenetics may provide clues for further studies of the mechanisms of metamorphosis in the Japanese flounder.",

     "abstract": "Hibernation consists of torpor, with marked suppression of metabolism and physiological functions, alternated with arousal periods featuring their full restoration. The heart is particularly challenged, exemplified by its rate reduction from 400 to 5\u201310 beats per minute during torpor in Syrian hamsters. In addition, during arousals, the heart needs to accommodate the very rapid return to normal function, which lead to our hypothesis that cardiac function during hibernation is supported by maintenance of protein homeostasis through adaptations in the protein quality control (PQC) system. Hereto, we examined autophagy, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein (UPRER) response and the heat shock response (HSR) in Syrian hamster hearts during torpor and arousal. Transition from torpor to arousal (1.5\u202fh) was associated with stimulation of the PQC system during early arousal, demonstrated by induction of autophagosomes, as shown by an increase in LC3B-II protein abundance, likely related to the activation of the UPRER during late torpor in response to proteotoxic stress. The HSR was not activated during torpor or arousal. Our results demonstrate activation of the cardiac PQC system \u2013 particularly autophagosomal degradation \u2013 in early arousal in response to cardiac stress, to clear excess aberrant or damaged proteins, being gradually formed during the torpor bout and/or the rapid increase in heart rate during the transition from torpor to arousal. This mechanism may enable the large gain in cardiac function during the transition from torpor to arousal, which may hold promise to further understand \u2018hibernation\u2019 of cardiomyocytes in human heart disease.",

The dramatic salinity decrease caused by heavy rainfall could cause mass mortality of T. ovatus in aquaculture. It is very important to understand the osmoregulatory mechanism of T. ovatus. Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter 1a (NKCC1a) is involved in the osmoregulation of fish and plays a crucial role in cell volume homeostasis and maintenance of the electrolyte content. In this study, we characterized nkcc1a (designed as Tonkcc1a) from T. ovatus and investigated its expression responses to acute salinity changes. Tonkcc1a is approximately 70\u202fkb in length and contains 26 exons and 25 introns. The phylogenetic analysis confirmed that ToNKCC1a belonged to the NKCC1a subclade. Quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that Tonkcc1a was ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with the highest mRNA levels observed in gills, and the lowest level in liver. When T. ovatus were transferred from seawater (30\u2030) into fresh water, the expression levels of Tonkcc1a mRNA were significantly downregulated in gills and kidney, whereas its expression level was markedly upregulated in intestine. When transferred from seawater (30\u2030) to 10\u2030 sea water, the expression levels of Tonkcc1a mRNA were clearly increased in gills and kidney. When transferred from seawater (30\u2030) to 20\u2030 sea water, the expression of Tonkcc1a mRNA increased to some extent in gills, kidney, and intestine. When transferred from seawater (30\u2030) to 40\u2030 sea water, the expression levels of Tonkcc1a mRNA were dramatically upregulated in gills and intestine compared to that in the control. These results suggested that Tonkcc1a was involved in the response to acute salinity changes.",

However, larval rearing on S. robusta results in poor performance for the reasons unexplored. Oxidative burden imposed by host plants is presumed to be a determining factor for larval fitness. With this hypothesis we have analyzed the foliar constituents of the respective host plants, the levels of oxidative stress and antioxidant protection in the larval tissues in response to their altered feeding on different host plants for different durations (2 and 10\u202fdays). Results indicate that S. robusta leaves contain the highest amount of tannin and redox active metals compared to those of other host plants. Consequently, hemolymph and midgut tissues of the larvae shifted to S. robusta exhibited oxidative predominance. Increased activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase in the larval tissues indicated an adaptive response to host plant driven oxidative assault. Our in vitro study also strongly supplements the in vivo findings indicating S. robusta foliages as a strong inducer of lipid peroxidation (LPx). Copper and Iron were found to be more potent in inducing LPx in the midgut tissues of the larvae compared to Zinc and Manganese. This study for the first time demonstrates the combined implications of host plant derived allelochemicals and elements on oxidative stress and antioxidant plasticity in this insect. The overall findings also brace up the newly emerging concept on joint effects hypothesis (organic and elemental defence) for enhanced plant defence.",

It was 1158\u202fbp in length, containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 987\u202fbp corresponding to 328 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass and pI of MrCTSB protein was 36.04\u202fkDa and 4.73.

During embryogenesis, mdka mRNA is detectable after 12\u202fh post-fertilization (hpf) and mdkb mRNA can be detected after 8\u202fhpf, about 4\u202fh prior to mdka mRNA. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that two paralogs of mdk mRNA were detected in the brain and dorsal neural tube at 16\u202fhpf. At 22\u202fhpf, mdka mRNA was abundant in the brain and dorsal neural tube, whereas mdkb mRNA were transcribed in the brain and tailbud. Later, at 55\u202fhpf, both paralogs were mainly expressed in the brain. Furthermore, both the mdk genes were highly expressed in multiple adult tissues except in the skin and a low expression of mdka in the muscle. In addition, they were differentially inhibited in the liver and intestine with exogenous recombinant human growth hormone, while their mRNA levels were up-regulated in the brain. During starvation, both the mdk genes were significantly up-regulated in the intestine, brain and liver and returned to the control levels following 6\u202fdays of refeeding. Our results suggest that duplicated mdk genes may play conserved and divergent roles in embryonic development and tissue growth regulation in blunt snout bream.",

MyoD is a myogenic determinant that contributes to myoblast determination, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) interacts with MyoD to regulate muscle hypertrophy and muscle mass. In this study, we aimed to assess DNA methylation and mRNA expression patterns of MyoD and IGF-I during different developmental stages of Japanese flounder, and to examine the relationship between MyoD and IGF-I gene. DNA and RNA were extracted from muscles, and DNA methylation of MyoD and IGF-I promoter and exons was detected by bisulfite sequencing. The relative expression of MyoD and IGF-I was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. IGF-I was measured by radioimmunoassay. Interestingly, the lowest expression of MyoD and IGF-I emerged at larva stage, and the mRNA expression was negatively associated with methylation. We hypothesized that many skeletal muscle were required to complete metamorphosis; thus, the expression levels of MyoD and IGF-I genes increased from larva stage and then decreased. The relative expression levels of MyoD and IGF-I exhibited similar patterns, suggesting that MyoD and IGF-I regulated muscle growth through combined effects. Changes in the concentrations of IGF-I hormone were similar to those of IGF-I gene expression. Our results the mechanism through which MyoD and IGF-I regulate muscle development and demonstrated that MyoD interacted with IGF-I to regulate muscle growth during different developmental stages.",

Piwil1 and Piwil2 possessed an open reading frame (ORF) of 2565 and 3138\u202fbp, encoding 854 and 1045 amino acids, respectively. The tissue distribution analysis demonstrated that Piwil1 and Piwil2 were expressed at higher levels in gonad compared to other tissues (brain, liver, gill, etc.). The time-course dynamic expressions of Piwils during embryonic indicated that Piwil1 and Piwil2 were mainly enriched in the early embryonic development. In testis, the expression of Piwil1 and Piwil2 increased at first but then decreased at mRNA and protein levels. However, the expression of Piwil1 and Piwil2 in the ovary showed a downward trend from the beginning. In addition, the expression levels of Piwil1 and Piwil2 were weak in mature testes or ovaries. The immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Piwil1 and Piwil2 were abundantly expressed in cytoplasm of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, oocyte I and oocytes II, which were mainly presented in the early stages of gonadal development. Our results suggested that Piwil was related to the differentiation of germ cells, and might play an important role in embryonic development. Therefore, our findings provided valuable information of Piwils in the reproductive cycle of T. fasciatus.",

In the present study, we identified an opsin gene from the eyes of the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense using expressed sequence tag analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length transcript contained 1382 base pairs, encoding 375 amino acids. It was classified into the long-wavelength opsin group by phylogenetic analysis, and designated Mn-LW. Mn-LW expression demonstrated significant seasonal variation in somatic tissues from both male and female prawns, with the highest expression in the eyes, and expression also shown in the ovary. The expression profiles of Mn-LW in eyes and ovary were positively related to ovarian development. In situ hybridization showed that Mn-LW was present in retinular cells in the eye and oocytes in the ovary. Injection of Mn-LW dsRNA in vivo effectively down-regulated Mn-LW expression levels compared with control levels. Mn-LW dsRNA injection also significantly reduced vitellogenin (Vg) expression, indicating a close relationship between Mn-LW and Vg in ovarian development.

We determined the spatio-temporal expression patterns of each subtype in tissues as well as the cellular localization of mRNA in embryos. Results showed that deduced Nanos proteins have two main homology domains: N-terminal CCR4/NOT1 deadenylase interaction domain and highly conserved carboxy-terminal region bearing two conserved CCHC zinc-finger motifs. The expression levels of Lcnanos1 in testis were significantly higher than other tissues, followed by heart, brain, eye, and ovary. Nevertheless, both Lcnanos2 and Lcnanos3 were restrictedly expressed in testis and ovary, respectively. No signals of Lcnanos1 and Lcnanos2 expression were detected at any developmental stages during embryogenesis. On the contrary, the signals of Lcnanos3 were detected in all stages examined. Lcnanos3 transcripts were firstly localized to the distal end of cleavage furrow at the 2-cell stage. Subsequently, mounting positive signals started to appear in a small number of cells as the embryo developed to blastula stage and early-gastrula stage. As development proceeded, positive signals were found in the primitive gonadal ridge. These cells of Lcnanos3 positive signals implied the specification of the future PGCs at this stage. It also suggested that PGCs of croaker originate from four clusters of cells which inherit maternal germ plasm at blastula stage. Furthermore, we preliminarily analyzed the migration route of PGCs in embryos of L. crocea.

     "abstract": "Food quality is an important factor influencing organisms' well-being. In freshwater ecosystems, food quality has been studied extensively for the keystone herbivore genus Daphnia, as they form the critical trophic link between primary producers and higher order consumers such as fish. For Daphnia, the edible fraction of phytoplankton in lakes (consisting mostly of unicellular algae and cyanobacteria) is extraordinarily diverse. To be able to digest different food particles, Daphnia possess a set of digestive enzymes that metabolize carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Recent studies have found a connection between gene expression and activity of single digestive enzyme types of Daphnia, i.e. lipases and proteases, and transcriptome studies have shown that a variety of genes coding for gut enzymes are differentially expressed in response to different food algae. However, never before has a set of digestive enzymes been studied simultaneously both on the gene expression and the enzyme activity level in Daphnia. Here, we investigated several digestive enzymes of Daphnia pulex in a comparison between a high-quality (green algal) and a low-quality (cyanobacterial) diet. Diet significantly affected the expression of all investigated digestive enzyme genes and enzyme activity was altered between treatments. Furthermore, we found that gene expression and enzyme activity were significantly correlated in cellulase, triacylglycerol lipase and \u03b2-glucosidase when switched from high to low-quality food. We conclude that one of the factors causing the often observed low biomass and energy transfer efficiency from cyanobacteria to Daphnia is probably the switch to a cost-effective overall increase of gene expression and activity of digestive enzymes of this herbivore.",

In this study, one hundred and twenty Rugao yellow-feathered laying hens were randomly divided into two groups, and were fed basal diet with or without 0.5% betaine supplementation for 28\u202fdays. After that, all the hens were artificially inseminated and then four hundreds fertilized eggs were selected. After hatching, the newborn chicks were raised until 56\u202fdays old. Betaine fed female chicks showed significantly lower body weight and lower level of biologically active thyroid hormone in plasma compared to control group, which was associated with significantly decrease in expression of type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio1). Moreover, betaine also changed hepatic expression of betaine-homocysteine -S-methyltransferase (BHMT) and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which may contribute to hypermethylation of the Dio1 promoter. Interestingly, betaine treatments of hens caused none of these effects in male chicks except Dio1 expression. These results indicate that maternal betaine administration effects growth of offspring through differential modification of Dio1 gene methylation and expression in liver and this model of transgenerational effects may help elucidate the mechanisms of maternal effects arise in natural systems.",

Upwelling conditions are characterized by low temperature seawater and high nutrient availability, which represents an ideal opportunity to understand how habitat modulates animal performance at different levels of biological complexity. We aimed to assess intraspecific variations in weight, oxygen consumption, protein content, and key signaling pathways involved in muscle-growth (protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) under experimental trials considering high/low seawater temperatures with full/restricted food rations. For this purpose, we studied Girella laevifrons, one of the most abundant fish species inhabiting rocky intertidal zones along the Eastern South Pacific coasts. Using fish obtained from upwelling (U) and non-upwelling (NU) zones, we reported that U animals displayed higher growth performance during both contrasting trials, with a weight gain (~3\u202fg), lower oxygen consumption (~12%), and higher protein contents (~20%). Only ERK showed significant differences during the trials (~2-fold downregulation between NU and U fish). We also found that U fish increased protein ubiquitination in high water temperature and restricted food ration in contrast to NU fish. Our results help to elucidate how upwelling conditions may influence fish growth at physiological and molecular levels. Still, future analyses are necessary to improve the information regarding the impact of U and NU condition on animals, as well as the possible applications of this data in the aquaculture industry.",

The full-length cDNA of HynFST (2134\u202fbp) has an open reading fragment encoding a polypeptide of 349 amino acids. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that FSTs are conserved throughout the vertebrates and HynFST belongs to FST-1 isoform. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HynFST were identified and three of them (g.2443\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC, g.2852\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC and g.5483A\u202f>\u202fG) were significantly associated with four growth-related traits. The average body weight of those fish with the combined genotype (CC CC GG) was 12.15\u201322.63% higher than that of triplotype (TT TT AA) in two bighead carp populations. HynFST was expressed in most of the development stages and various tissues with highest level in ovary. The co-expression results for FST and MSTN in brain and muscle of divergent weight groups showed that FST may inhibit MSTN expression, thus enhancing growth in bighead carp.

     "abstract": "Toads are among several groups of organisms chemically defended with lethal concentrations of cardiotonic steroids. As a result, most predators that prey on amphibians avoid toads. However, several species of snakes have gained resistance-conferring mutations of Na+/K+-ATPase, the molecular target of cardiotonic steroids, and can feed on toads readily. Despite recent advances in our understanding of this adaptation at the genetic level, we have lacked functional evidence for how mutations of Na+/K+-ATPase account for cardiotonic steroid resistance in snake tissues. To address this issue, it is necessary to determine how the Na+/K+-ATPases of snakes react to the toxins. Some tissues might have Na+/K+-ATPases that are more susceptible than others and can thus provide clues about how the toxins influence organismal function. Here we provide a mechanistic link between observed Na+/K+-ATPase substitutions and observed resistance using actual snake Na+/K+-ATPases. We used an in vitro approach to determine the tissue-specific levels of sensitivity to cardiotonic steroids in select resistant and non-resistant snakes. We compared the sensitivities of select tissues within and between species. Our results suggest that resistant snakes contain highly resistant Na+/K+-ATPases in their heart and kidney, both of which rely heavily on the enzymes to function, whereas tissues that do not rely as heavily on Na+/K+-ATPases or might be protected from cardiotonic steroids by other means (liver, gut, and brain) contain non-resistant forms of the enzyme. This study reveals functional evidence that tissue-level target-site insensitivity to cardiotonic steroids varies not only among species but also across tissues within resistant taxa.",

Silver barb (Puntius gonionotus) is considered a promising medium carp species for freshwater aquaculture in Asia. Earlier, \u03946 fads cDNA was characterized to understand the molecular mechanism of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in this species. In the present study elovl5-like elongase full-length cDNA was cloned and characterized by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), and analyzed its basal expression in various organs/tissues by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Differential expression of elovl5 cDNA in various tissues following replacement of fish oil (FO) with linseed oil (LO) in the diet also studied. The full length cDNA sequence of silver barb elovl5-like elongase consisted of 1853\u00a0bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 876\u00a0bp encoding a precursor protein of 291 amino acids possessing the entire characteristic features of Elovl protein. The elovl5 transcript was constitutively expressed in all the tissues examined: muscle, liver, brain, kidney, skin, intestine, gill and eye. The expression of elovl5 gene was upregulated, whereas the serum biochemical constituents were either remain unchanged or lowered following replacement of FO with LO in the diets. We report for the first time, an in silico 3D structure model of elongase protein from silver barb. All these findings may contribute to a better understanding the potential regulatory mechanisms involved and may be useful for enhancing endogenous LC-PUFA production in silver barb.",

However, immediate mitochondrial response to exercise and energetic substrate utilization is still unknown. We evaluate the mitochondrial physiology of two types rat skeletal muscle fibres immediately after a single session of high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) or aerobic exercise (AER). We found AER was able to reduce the ATP synthesis dependent oxygen flux in the tibialis (TA) when stimulated by complex I and II substrates. On the other hand, there was an increase of the maximum velocity (Vmax) for glycerol-phosphate oxidation and Vmax and affinity (KM) of palmitoyl-carnitine oxidation (PC). The exercise did not affect oxygen flux coupled to ATP synthesis in red gastrocnemius (RG) but, surprisingly, reduced its affinity for PC, decreasing the apparent catalytic efficiency (Vmax/KM) of oxidation for PC. Neither exercise protocol was able to change the electron transfer system capacity of the mitochondria or markers of mitochondrial content. The AER group had increased H2O2 production compared to the SED and HIIE groups, with the mechanism being predominantly the escape of electrons through reverse flux in complex I and other sites in TA, and only through other sites in RG. There were no changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Our results show that mitochondria from different muscles submitted to distinct exercise protocols show alterations in the specific fluxes of substrate utilization and oxygen metabolism, indicating that the dynamics of mitochondria are linked to the metabolic flexibility.",

We studied the kinetic properties of purified hexokinase in T. equiperdum (specific activity\u00a0=\u00a0302\u00a0U/mg), and compare with other members of Trypanozoon. With ATP (Km\u00a0=\u00a0104.7\u00a0\u03bcM) as phosphate donor, hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose (Km\u00a0=\u00a024.9\u00a0\u03bcM) and mannose (Km\u00a0=\u00a08.8\u00a0\u03bcM). With respect to glucose, mannose and inorganic pyrophosphate respectively are a competitive, and a mixed inhibitor of hexokinase. With respect to ATP, both are mixed inhibitors of this enzyme. In T. equiperdum, hexokinase shows a high affinity for glucose. Pleomorphism\u2014transformation of trypanosomes from a multiplicative to a non-multiplicative form\u2014results in a self-limited growth stabilizing glucose consumption. It delays the death of the host, thus prolonging its exposure to tsetse flies. When glucose levels descend, top-down regulation allows trypanosomes to survive through the expression of alternative metabolic pathways. It accelerates the death of the host, but helps trypanosome density to increase enough to ensure transmission without tsetse flies. Pleomorphism, and a hexokinase with a high affinity for glucose, are two main adaptive traits of T. b. brucei. The latter trait, and a strong top-down regulation, are two main adaptive traits of T. equiperdum. For trypanosomes living in glucose-rich blood, a hexokinase with a high affinity for glucose would unnecessarily harm hosts. This may explain why the human parasites, T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense, possess hexokinases with a low affinity for glucose.",

The common carp Prx3 and Prx4 open reading frames were 753 base pairs (bp) and 783\u00a0bp in length, respectively, and contained seven exons and six introns. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the common carp Prx1\u20134 proteins share high identities and similar characteristics with other known animal Prxs. Prx3 and Prx4 mRNA were constitutively expressed in all tissues, and the highest Prx3 and Prx4 transcript abundances occurred in head kidney. Although the highest Prx4 protein and mRNA expression were also observed in head kidney, many differences were detected between Prx4 mRNA and protein expression levels in other tissues. Prx3 expression increased significantly in the head kidney 12\u00a0h after an Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The A. hydrophila challenge upregulated Prx3 mRNA expression in liver and spleen, increased Prx4 mRNA expression levels in liver and spleen excluding at 36\u00a0h in spleen, but decreased Prx4 mRNA expression level in the head kidney. The mature Prx4 peptide was recombinantly expressed and purified using Dextrin Beads 6FF and it exhibited thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidase activity. These data suggest that Prx3 and Prx4 are constitutive and inducible proteins that might play important roles in innate immune function. The Trx-dependent peroxidase activity analysis of recombinant Prx4 further verified the important role of Prxs in the redox system of fish.",

Further, Elovl4-like transcriptional levels in hepatopancreas were up-regulated in proportion to the replacement of dietary fish oil (FO) with soybean oil (SO). The result showed that Elovl4-like transcripts increased about 0.83 and 1.12-fold respectively when SO constituted 80% and 100% of total oil (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Melanin deposition levels were examined in the carapace, skin, eye and muscle of the three color-types using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Moreover, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of red-eared slider turtle melanin biosynthesis regulatory genes TYR, TYRP1, MITF and SLC24A5 were cloned, sequenced and quantitatively analyzed. Both histological view of melanin deposition and quantitative real-time PCR test of melanin-regulated gene expressions showed that there are significant differences among different tissues of red-eared slider, but no significant difference among different color-types, indicating that melanin deposition is not associated with ontogenetic color change in the carapace of red-eared slider.

Adult females from temperate and tropical eastern Australian populations were exposed to a rapid desiccation hardening (RDH) treatment, and groups without RDH to acute desiccation stress, and the transcript expression of 12 candidate desiccation genes were temporally profiled during, and in recovery from stress. We found that desiccation exposure resulted in largely transitory, stress-specific transcriptional changes in all but one gene. However linking the expression profiles to the population-level phenotypic divergence was difficult given subtle, and time-point specific population expression variation. Nonetheless, rapid desiccation hardening had the largest effect on gene expression, resulting in distinct molecular profiles. We report a hitherto uncharacterised desiccation molecular hardening response where prior exposure essentially \u2018primes\u2019 genes to respond to subsequent stress without discernible transcript changes prior to stress. This, taken together with some population gene expression variation of several bona fide desiccation candidates associated with different water balance strategies speaks of the complexity of natural desiccation resistance and plasticity and provides new avenues for understanding the molecular basis of a trait of ecological significance.",

Multiple alignments showed that FXR of large yellow croaker contained highly conserved DNA-binding domain and ligand binding domain compared with other species. The subcellular localization analysis showed that FXR-GFP fusion protein could target to the nucleus in HEK 293\u00a0t. The tissue specific results demonstrated that FXR was highly expressed in liver, intestine and kidney of large yellow croaker. In addition, dietary soybean oil decreased the expression of FXR and IL-10 and significantly increased the expression of the pro-inflammatory genes in the intestine or spleen, such as TNF\u03b1, COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, while the supplementation of CDCA could partly reverse these effects.

     "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been suggested to inhibit adipogenesis in fish; the mechanism behind this observation remains largely unknown. The present study was to investigate the effects of DHA on the adipocyte differentiation of grass carp by using transcriptomic technology. Confluent primary cultured differentiating adipocytes were co-incubated with either 0\u00a0\u03bcM or 100\u00a0\u03bcM DHA for 2\u00a0days (early phase of differentiation) and 7\u00a0days (late phase). The results showed that 100\u00a0\u03bcM DHA promoted adipogenesis at 2\u00a0days but decreased lipid accumulation at 7\u00a0days of treatment compared to that of the control. Cells treated with DHA for 2\u00a0days showed up-regulation of adipogenic genes, such as PPAR\u03b3, C/EBPs, and FAS; 7\u00a0day treatment showed down-regulation of these genes. Interestingly, \u03b2-catenin, which plays important roles in suppressing adipogenesis in mammals, was also up-regulated after 7\u00a0days of treatment. To address this, administration of \u03b2-catenin inhibitor FH535 was used and abolished the inhibition of the adipogenesis induced by DHA for 7\u00a0days. However, FH535 did not rescue the inhibition of adipogenic gene expression (including that of PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b2, and C/EBP\u03b3) in the presence of 100\u00a0\u03bcM DHA, but it attenuated the up-regulation of \u03b2-catenin downstream target genes, e.g. c-myc and cyc D1. This suggests that DHA might regulate the adipogenic junction through the \u03b2-catenin pathway. Overall, our results demonstrate that continuous DHA treatment could promote the early step of adipocyte differentiation and suppress late phase adipogenesis in grass carp. Moreover, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin might be a new potential signaling pathway by which DHA suppresses adipocyte development.",

This process is accompanied by tissue regression and body mass reduction. Previous studies have suggested that apoptosis may play a role in the tissue remodeling that occurs during aestivation, although this has not definitively been shown. To investigate this hypothesis, the present study used A. japonicus as a model organism to examine cell loss through apoptosis in intestinal degeneration during aestivation. Apostichopus japonicus individuals were collected from Yellow Sea (N 36\u00b0 05\u2032 44.87\u2033, E 120\u00b0 31\u2032 58.51\u2033), China in April 2016 and split into two groups. Aestivation was induced in the experimental group by incubation at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. This resulted in a significant decrease in body mass and increased evidence of intestinal degeneration in hematoxylin and eosin, Hoechst 33342, and in situ TUNEL analyses of tissue sections. Along with further Hoechst 33342 analysis using intestinal cell smears, these results showed that A. japonicus intestinal cell apoptosis occurred soon after the initial temperature increase, with most apoptotic events completing within 20\u00a0days. Transcriptional quantification of the Ajcaspase-8 (CASP8) and Ajcaspase-3 (CASP3) apoptotic genes demonstrated that their expression was significantly elevated at the beginning of the experiment but was decreased at later stages of aestivation. The results of this study strongly suggest that apoptosis is involved in the intestinal regression of A. japonicus during aestivation, and play important role in understanding fundamental cellular events in tissue regression under environmental stress.",

SFL preferentially agglutinated enzyme treated human A erythrocytes. The activity of lectin was strongly inhibited by monosaccharide d-galactose and glycoproteins asialo-porcine stomach mucin and asialo-fetuin. The lectin was Ca2\u00a0+ dependent, stable over a range of pH from 5 to 8, and up to 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of SFL was also determined and a blast search on amino acid sequences revealed that the protein showed similarity only with lectins from the marine sponge Spheciospongia vesparia. SFL caused agglutination of Vibrio alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus in a dose dependent manner and inhibited the growth rates of the virulent bacterial strains. Growth inhibition of V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus with SFL was not observed in the presence of d-galactose or asialo-porcine stomach mucin, suggesting that the lectin caused the agglutination through binding to the target receptor(s) on the surface of Vibrios. Thus, the marine sponge S. flexibilis could promise to be a good source of a lectin(s) that may be useful as a carbohydrate probe and an antibacterial reagent.",

Changes in those pathways elicit effects similar to those of exercise such as changes in body and muscle growth, metabolism, endurance and health. Generally, exercise effects are beneficial to fish health and aquaculture, but inducing exercise in fishes can be impractical. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential use of supplemental \u03b2-GPA to induce exercise-like effects in a rapidly growing juvenile teleost, the red porgy (Pagrus pagrus). We demonstrate for the first time that \u03b2-GPA can be transported into teleost muscle fibers and is phosphorylated, and that this perturbs the intracellular energetic state of the cells, although to a lesser degree than typically seen in mammals. \u03b2-GPA did not affect whole animal growth, nor did it influence skeletal muscle fiber size or myonuclear recruitment. There was, however, an increase in mitochondrial volume within myofibers in treated fish. GC/MS metabolomic analysis revealed shifts in amino acid composition of the musculature, putatively reflecting increases in connective tissue and decreases in protein synthesis that are associated with \u03b2-GPA treatment. These results suggest that \u03b2-GPA modestly affects fish muscle in a manner similar to that observed in mammals, and that \u03b2-GPA may have application to aquaculture by providing a more practical means of generating some of the beneficial effects of exercise in fishes.",

However, the physiological role of GnIH on the reproductive axis in fish remains inconclusive, with most studies focusing on the orders Cypriniformes and Perciformes. To gain insight into the role of GnIH in the regulation of reproduction in the order Pleuronectiformes, we first cloned the LPXRFa gene, the piscine ortholog of GnIH, in the half-smooth tongue sole. The full-length cDNA of LPXRFa was 918\u00a0bp in size with an open reading frame (ORF) of 585\u00a0bp that encoded a 194 amino acids preprohormone with a calculated molecular mass and isoelectric point of 21.73\u00a0kDa and 6.52, respectively. The LPXRFa precursor encoded two putative peptide sequences that included \u2013MPMRF or \u2013MPQRF motifs at the C-terminal. Tissue distribution analysis showed that LPXRFa transcripts could be detected at high levels in the brains of both sexes and to a lesser extent in the ovary, heart and stomach of females, while a noteworthy expression was observed in the kidney and muscle of males. Furthermore, the expression patterns of LPXRFa mRNA during ovarian maturation were also investigated. In the brain, the mRNA expression of LPXRFa increased significantly at stage III, declined at stage V and reached a maximum at stage VI. In the pituitary, the levels of LPXRFa mRNA remained stable during ovarian maturation and increased significantly to the top level at stage V and then declined back to basal levels. In contrast, the ovarian LPXRFa mRNA levels declined sharply at stage III and remained depressed over the course of ovarian maturation. Taken together, our results provide further evidence for the existence of LPXRFa in the order Pleuronectiformes and suggest its possible involvement in the regulation of reproduction in the female tongue sole.",

Hemolymph osmotic and ionic concentrations remained relatively stable and close to control levels until ~\u00a09\u00a0h of exposure, but later increased consistently (~\u00a050%). A fast reduction in NKA activity (3\u20136\u00a0h) was observed; these shrimps seem to shut off salt absorption already in the first hours. Later on, especially after 24\u00a0h, hemolymph concentrations rise but HSP70 expression is not induced, possibly because constitutive levels are already sufficient to prevent protein damage.

Juvenile growth rates were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a06) under hypoxic conditions and were not improved by prior early-life exposure to hypoxia. Growth was 1.3 times higher (p\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03) in juveniles reared at 15\u00a0\u00b0C during the larval stage than those reared at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that compensatory growth had occurred. Early-life exposure to hypoxia induced higher (p\u00a0<\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a06) glycogen stores in juveniles even though there was no apparent regulation of their carbohydrate metabolism. In the liver of juveniles exposed to chronic hypoxia, lower glycogen content combined with stimulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression and higher lactate concentration indicated a stimulation of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway. Furthermore, hypoxia only induced lower (p\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03) lipid content in the liver of juveniles that had experienced 15\u00a0\u00b0C at the larval stage. The present study provides evidence that environmental conditions experienced during early life shape the metabolic traits of D. labrax with potential consequences for juvenile physiological performance.",

The objective of this study was focused on biochemically characterizing the main enzymes involved in the digestion of O. bimaculoides. Optimum pH, temperature and thermostability were determined for amylases, lipases, trypsin and chymotrypsin; optimum pH and protease inhibitor effect were assessed for acidic and alkaline proteases, and the effect of divalent ions on trypsin and chymotrypsin activity was evaluated in enzymatic extracts from the digestive (DG) and salivary glands (SG) and crop gastric juices (GJ). High amylase activity was detected in GD and GJ whereas this activity is very low in other cephalopods. Salivary glands had the greatest activity in most of the enzyme groups, showing the importance of this organ in digestion. Optimum pH was different depending on the organ and enzyme analyzed. The optimum pH in DG was 3 showing the predominance of acidic proteases in the digestion process. All enzymes were resistant and stable at high temperatures in contrast with other marine species. Trypsin and chymotrypsin activity were highly incremented with the presence of Mg2\u00a0+, Co2\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+ and Zn2\u00a0+ in some tissues. The inhibitor assay showed the importance of serine proteases, metalloproteases and aspartic proteases in the digestive process of this species. This study is the first in assessing the main digestive enzymes of O. bimaculoides and in remarking the importance of other digestive enzyme groups besides proteases in octopuses.",

The innate immune system of insects utilizes a group of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) for the recognition of specific peptidoglycans and activating immune signaling pathways. In Drosophila melanogaster, PGRP-LC and IMD (immune deficiency) are two important signaling molecules of the IMD pathway. Here we cloned and characterized PGRP-L1 and IMD from the domesticated silkworm Bombyx mori (BmPGRP-L1 and BmIMD). BmPGRP-L1 gene consists of five exons that encodes a polypeptide of 304 amino acids with a transmembrane region and an extracellular PGRP domain. The PGRP domain lacks key residues for the amidase activity. BmIMD cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 250 amino acids with a death domain. BmPGRP-L1 and BmIMD were expressed in various tissues and induced by bacterial challenges. In addition, in vivo blocking of the PGRP domain by the antiserum or purified antibody significantly reduced the expression of some antimicrobial peptide genes. The extracellular region of BmPGRP-L1 bound to diaminopimelic acid-type and lysine-type peptidoglycans. Overexpression of full-length BmIMD in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells significantly induced three antimicrobial peptide genes. These results suggest that BmPGRP-L1 and BmIMD may be players in the IMD pathway of B. mori. This study provides a foundation for further studies on the functions of silkworm IMD pathway.",

Cathepsin D activity has been reported in the gastric fluid of clawed lobsters where it acts as an extracellular digestive enzyme. Here we investigate whether cathepsin D is unique in clawed lobsters or, instead, common in decapod crustaceans. Eleven species of decapods belonging to six infraorders were tested for cathepsin D activity in the midgut gland, the muscle tissue, the gills, and when technically possible, in the gastric fluid. Cathepsin D activity was present in the midgut gland of all 11 species and in the gastric fluid from the seven species from which samples could be taken. All sampled species showed higher activities in the midgut glands than in non-digestive organs and the activity was highest in the clawed lobster. Cathepsin D mRNA was obtained from tissue samples of midgut gland, muscle, and gills. Analyses of deduced amino acid sequence confirmed molecular features of lysosomal cathepsin D and revealed high similarity between the enzymes from Astacidea and Caridea on one side, and the enzymes from Penaeoidea, Anomura, and Brachyura on the other side. Our results support the presence of cathepsin D activity in the midgut glands and in the gastric fluids of several decapod species suggesting an extracellular function of this lysosomal enzyme. We discuss whether cathepsin D may derive from the lysosomal-like vacuoles of the midgut gland B-cells and is released into the gastric lumen upon secretion by these cells.",

In this study, GST\u03bc and GST\u03c1 paralogs of GST in the big belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis; HaGST\u03c1, HaGST\u03bc) were biochemically, molecularly, functionally characterized to determine their detoxification range and protective capacities upon different pathogenic stresses. HaGST\u03c1 and HaGST\u03bc are composed of coding sequences of 681\u00a0bp and 654\u00a0bp, which encode proteins 225 and 217 amino acids, with predicted molecular masses of 26.06\u00a0kDa and 25.74\u00a0kDa respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that both HaGSTs comprise the characteristic GSH-binding site in the thioredoxin-like N-terminal domain and substrate binding site in the C-terminal domain. The recombinant HaGST\u03c1 and HaGST\u03bc proteins catalyzed the model GST substrate 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed different Km and Vmax values for each rHaGST, suggesting that they have different conjugation rates. The optimum conditions (pH, temperature) and inhibitory assays of each protein demonstrated different optimal ranges. However, HaGST\u03bc was highly expressed in the ovary and gill, whereas HaGST\u03c1 was highly expressed in the gill and pouch. mRNA expression of HaGST\u03c1 and HaGST\u03bc was significantly elevated upon lipopolysaccharide, Poly (I:C), and Edwardsiella tarda challenges in liver and in blood cells as well as with Streptococcus iniae challenge in blood cells. From these collective experimental results, we propose that HaGST\u03c1 and HaGST\u03bc are effective in detoxifying xenobiotic toxic agents, and importantly, their mRNA expression could be stimulated by immunological stress signals in the aquatic environment.",

     "abstract": "Growth is one of the main biological processes in aquatic organisms that is affected by environmental fluctuations such as upwelling (characterized by food-rich waters). In fish, growth is directly related with skeletal muscle increase; which represents the largest tissue of body mass. However, the effects of upwelling on growth, at the physiological and molecular level, are unknown. This study used Girella laevifrons (one of the most abundant intertidal fish in Eastern South Pacific) as a biological model, considering animals from upwelling (U) and non-upwelling (NU) areas. Here, we evaluated the effect of nutritional composition and food availability on growth performance and expression of key growth-related genes (insulin-kike growth factor 1 (igf1) and myosin heavy-chain (myhc)) and atrophy-related genes (muscle ring-finger 1 (murf1), F-box only protein 32 (atrogin-1) and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19\u00a0kDa-interacting protein 3 (bnip3)). We reported that, among zones, U fish displayed higher growth performance in response to nutritional composition, specifically between protein- and fiber-rich diets (~\u00a01\u00a0g). We also found in NU fish that atrophy-related genes were upregulated with fiber-rich diet and during fasting (~\u00a02-fold at minimum respect U). In conclusion, our results suggest that the growth potential of upwelling fish may be a consequence of differential muscle gene expression. Our data provide a preliminary approach contributing on how upwelling influence fish growth at the physiological and molecular levels. Future studies are required to gain further knowledge about molecular differences between U and NU animals, as well as the possible applications of this knowledge in the aquaculture industry.",

     "abstract": "Graft rejection due to immune incompatibility is a common occurrence in pearl culture, which often cause death to the host oyster. To improve cultured pearl production, host mortality and bead rejection rates must be reduced. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in innate immunity, and may be related to allograft rejection. Here, we cloned the TLR4 cDNA from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii (PmTLR4). PmTLR4 cDNA was 3138\u00a0bp, including a 2625\u00a0bp open reading frame encoding 874 amino acids. The predicted PmTLR4 protein was structurally typical of the TLR family. PmTLR4 had relatively high sequence similarity and identity to the TLR4 of the Cyclina sinensis (48.1% and 27.6%, respectively). Multiple alignment of TLR4 sequences across species indicated that the Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain was conserved among species. PmTLR4 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested, with the most abundant mRNA expression in hepatopancreas and gill in P. fucata martensii. After being stressed by either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure or the nucleus insertion operation, PmTLR4 mRNA expression increased significantly in the hemocytes as compared to controls. Peak level of PmTLR4 mRNA was observed 6\u00a0h after the LPS injection, and 2\u00a0d after the nucleus insertion operation. These data suggest that PmTLR4 may play a vital role in the induction of innate immunity and is therefore associated with allograft immunity in the pearl oyster P. fucata martensii.",

Pfigfbp and PfILP (insulin-like peptide) mRNA levels significantly increased in the digestive gland after feeding, while levels were dramatically reduced during a week of food deprivation and increased upon refeeding. In vitro experiments indicated that Pfigfbp mRNA expression in mantle cells was affected by insulin/IGFs (IGF-I, IGF-II).

Teleost fish, in particular, have quite diversified substrate preference of these enzymes even among closely related species, implying that each species could have different LC-PUFA biosynthetic capabilities. Therefore, in the present study, we characterized Japanese flounder fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 5 (Elovl5) in order to precisely characterize the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway. Fads2 has \u03946 and \u03948 desaturase activity and Elovl5 has elongase activity toward C18 and C20 PUFA, suggesting that Japanese flounder is capable of synthesizing 20:4n\u20133 and 20:3n\u20136 from 18:3n\u20133 and 18:2n\u20136, respectively.

In glycogen synthesis, glycogen synthase (GS) is a rate-limiting enzyme catalysing the addition of \u03b1-1,4-linked glucose units from (UDP)3-glucose to a nascent glycogen chain using glycogenin (GN) as a primer. While studies on mammalian liver GS (GYS2) are numerous, enzymes from crustaceans, which also use glycogen and glucose as their main energy source, have received less attention. In the present study, we amplified full-length GS cDNA from Eriocheir sinensis. Tissue expression profiling revealed the highest expression of GS in the hepatopancreas. During moulting, GS expression and activity declined, and glycogen levels in the hepatopancreas were reduced. Recombinant GS was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3), and induction at 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 16\u00a0\u00b0C yielded EsGS in insoluble inclusion bodies (EsGS-I) or in soluble form (EsGS-S), respectively. Enzyme activity was measured in a cell-free system containing glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and both forms possessed glycosyltransferase activity, but refolded EsGS-I was more active. Enzyme activity of both GS and EsGS-I in the hepatopancreas was optimum at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, which is coincident with the optimum growth temperature of Chinese mitten crab, and higher (37\u00a0\u00b0C) or lower (16\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures resulted in lower enzyme activity.

     "abstract": "Schistosomes are responsible for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, an acute and chronic parasitic ailment that affects >\u00a0240 million people in 70 countries worldwide. It is the second most devastating parasitic disease after malaria. At least 200,000 deaths per year are associated with the disease. In the absence of the availability of vaccines, chemotherapy is the main stay for combating schistosomiasis. The antischistosomal arsenal is currently limited to a single drug, Praziquantel, which is quite effective with a single-day treatment and virtually no host-toxicity. Recently, however, the question of reduced activity of Praziquantel has been raised. Therefore, the search for alternative antischistosomal drugs merits the study of new approaches of chemotherapy.The rational design of a drug is usually based on biochemical and physiological differences between pathogens and host. Pyrimidine metabolism is an excellent target for such studies. Schistosomes, unlike most of the host tissues, require a very active pyrimidine metabolism for the synthesis of DNA and RNA. This is essential for the production of the enormous numbers of eggs deposited daily by the parasite to which the granulomas response precipitates the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis. Furthermore, there are sufficient differences between corresponding enzymes of pyrimidine metabolism from the host and the parasite that can be exploited to design specific inhibitors or \u201csubversive substrates\u201d for the parasitic enzymes. Specificities of pyrimidine transport also diverge significantly between parasites and their mammalian host. This review deals with studies on pyrimidine metabolism in schistosomes and highlights the unique characteristic of this metabolism that could constitute excellent potential targets for the design of safe and effective antischistosomal drugs. In addition, pyrimidine metabolism in schistosomes is compared with that in other parasites where studies on pyrimidine metabolism have been more elaborate, in the hope of providing leads on how to identify likely chemotherapeutic targets which have not been looked at in schistosomes.",

The results showed that the full length of C. gigas MELC (CgMELC) cDNA was 659\u00a0bp, containing a 5\u2032-untranslated region of 73 bp, a 3\u2032-untranslated region of 112\u00a0bp. The open reading frame encoded a 157 amino acid peptide. The protein sequence of CgMELC contained a conserved EF-hand calcium binding motif, and showed a high sequence identity (68.4\u2013100%) with other bivalves. Quantitative analysis of CgMELC mRNA in tissues indicated that CgMELC was expressed at the highest level in the striated adductor muscle, followed by the smooth adductor muscle and mantle. During the development of embryos and larvae, quantitative analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that CgMELC was expressed starting from the blastula stage and abundantly expressed in trochophore and D-shaped larvae, indicating that CgMELC might also be involved in regulation of larval muscle system development. Our data provided valuable information for further researches on the function of MELC and regulation of muscle contraction in oysters.",

     "abstract": "To explore the functions of small heat shock proteins (sHsps) in relation to thermal stress and development in Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), one of the most economically important pest species attacking a wide range of fruits and vegetables, six full-length cDNAs of sHsp genes (BdHsp17.7, 18.4, 20.4, 20.6, 21.6 and 23.8) were cloned, and the expression patterns in different developmental stages and tissues, as well as in response to both thermal and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) exposures, were examined using real time quantitative PCR. The open reading frames (ORFs) of six sHsps are 453, 489, 537, 543, 567 and 630\u00a0bp in length, encoding proteins with molecular weights of 17.7, 18.4, 20.4, 20.6, 21.6 and 23.8\u00a0kDa, respectively. BdHsp18.4 and BdHsp20.4 maintained lower expression levels in both eggs and larvae, whereas remarkably up-regulated after the larval-pupal transformation, suggesting that these two sHsps may be involved in metamorphosis. Significant tissue specificity exists among sHsps: the highest expression of BdHsp20.6 and BdHsp23.8 in the Malpighian tubules and ovary, respectively, versus a peak in the fat body for others. BdHsp20.4 and BdHsp20.6 were significantly up-regulated by thermal stress. In contrast, BdHsp18.4 and BdHsp23.8 reacted only to heat stress. BdHsp17.7 and BdHsp21.6 were insensitive to both heat and cold stresses. The degree of sHsps response depends on intensity of 20E treatment, i.e., dose and time. These results strongly suggest functional differentiation within the sHsp subfamily in B. dorsalis. The physiological function of sHsp members under thermal stress and normal growth remains the subjects of further investigation.",

The turtles were fed by two diets including a control fat diet (the CON treatment, 7.98% lipid) and a high fat diet (the HFD treatment, 13.86% lipid) for six weeks and administrated by the photophase regimen of 24\u00a0h light/dark (12L:12D) cycle. After the feeding trial experiment, we measured the daily expression levels of 17 core clock genes (Clock, Bmal1/2, NPAS2, Tim, Cry1/2, Per1/2, DBP, AANAT, NIFL3, BHLHE40, NR1D2, RORA, RORB, RORC) and 12 muscle functional genes (FBXO32, MBNL1, MSTN, Myf5, Myf6, MyoD, MyoG, MyoM1, PPARa, PDK4, Trim63, UCP3) in the skeletal muscle of the two treatments. The results showed that except for Bmal1, NPAS2, Per2 and RORB, the expression of the other 13 core clock genes exhibited circadian oscillation in the CON treatment. Among the 12 muscle functional genes, MBNL1, PDK4 and MyoM1 did not exhibit circadian oscillation in the CON treatment. In the HFD treatment, the circadian rhythms expressional patterns of the 8 core clock genes (Clock, Bmal2, Cry2, Per1, DBP, NFIL3, BHLHE40 and RORA) and 6 muscle functional genes (MSTN, Myf5, MyoD, MyoG, PPARa and Trim63) were disrupted. In addition, compared with the CON treatment, the circadian expression of the 5 core clock genes (Tim, Cry1, AANAT, NR1D2, RORC) and the 3 muscle functional genes (FBXO32, Myf6, UCP3) showed the advanced or delayed expression peaks in the HFD treatment. In CON treatment, the circadian expression of the MyoG, MyoD, Myf6, FBXO32 and PPARa showed positive or negative correlation with the transcription pattern of Clock, Bmal2, Cry1/2, Per1/2. However, only the FBXO32 and Myf6 presented positive or negative correlation with the circadian expression of Cry1, RORB, AANAT and Tim in HFD treatment. In summary, these results demonstrate that the disruption of the circadian rhythm of the core clock genes and muscle functional genes in the skeletal muscle is closely associated with feeding high fat diet to Chinese soft-shelled turtle.",

A 105\u00a0kDa protein, NF\u03baB1 exhibits complex post-translational processing, multiple mechanisms of activation, and acts as precursor for a p50, a Rel homology transcription factor which influences the expression of key genes for developmental processes, apoptosis, and immune function. The aa sequences of the crocodylian proteins share very high identity with each other (97.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%), birds (81.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a06), mammals (75.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6%, n\u00a0=\u00a04), reptiles (80.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a02), and less identity with fish (55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5%, n\u00a0=\u00a04) and one amphibian (66.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8%). The crocodylian protein has a well-conserved Rel homology domain, a nuclear localization signal, and a glycine-rich region which facilitates proteasome-mediated generation of p50. The Rel homology domain contains sequences responsible for dimerization, DNA-binding, and nuclear translocation. In addition, seven ankyrin repeats were located, which putatively allow for inhibition of transcriptional regulation by mediating interaction with Inhibitor kappa B. Other features include a death domain, and conserved serine residues, near the C-terminal end, which act as potential phosphorylation sites for activation of the proteolytic generation of p50. Western blot analysis showed both the 105\u00a0kDa precursor and the 50\u00a0kDa mature NF\u03baB were expressed in the alligator liver. Nuclear factor \u03baB exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic distribution in alligator hepatocytes, and almost no cytoplasmic localization in infected animals.

     "abstract": "The interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in the regulation of gene expression has been extensively studied in mammals but little is known in other vertebrates so far. Most non-mammalian vertebrates are faced with environmental cues and stressors distinct from those experienced by mammals and thus it is likely that the gene expression strategies differ from those of mammals. Here we performed experiments to study in vitro the various levels of gene expression regulation in nucleated fish red blood cells. Three critical environmental cues frequently experienced by fish were chosen: exposure to hypoxia (2.5%), ambient water temperature increase by 10\u00a0\u00b0C (from 10\u00a0\u00b0C to 20\u00a0\u00b0C), and exposure to stress hormones (represented by the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol). We found that \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation increases the stability of the \u03b23b-adrenergic receptor (\u03b23b-ar) mRNA, suggesting that mRNA stability can play a role in the regulation of hormonal stress responses in fish. The \u03b23b-ar gene encodes a unique \u03b2-adrenergic receptor subtype in fish red blood cells which controls the \u03b2-Na+/H+ exchanger activity \u2013 an important component of responses to oxygen limitations. Our results furthermore show a yet undescribed link between the Hif1a signaling pathway and the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor response. After \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, the transcription of hif1a was activated significantly after 4 hours of exposure. So far, such a response has only been described from mammalian species. This indicates that the \u03b2-AR is fundamental to the molecular and physiological responses to hypoxia and that Hif1a might have additional functions than those already known.",

     "abstract": "The protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum is a causative agent of the disease visceral leishmaniasis, which can be fatal if not properly treated. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) biosynthesis pathways are attractive targets for new antileishmanial compounds since these Leishmania cell membrane phospholipids are important for parasite morphology and physiology. In this work we observed Leishmania synthesize PC and PE from extracellular choline and ethanolamine, respectively, suggesting the presence of CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine pathways. In addition, Leishmania converted PE to PC, indicating the parasite possesses phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) activity. The first step in the biosynthesis of PC or PE requires the phosphorylation of choline or ethanolamine by a kinase. We cloned the gene encoding a putative choline/ethanolamine kinase from Leishmania infantum and expressed and purified the encoded recombinant protein. The enzyme possesses choline kinase activity with a Vmax of 3.52\u00a0\u03bcmol/min/mg and an apparent Km value of 0.089\u00a0mM with respect to choline. The enzyme can also phosphorylate ethanolamine in vitro, but the apparent Km for ethanolamine is 850-fold greater than for choline. In an effort to probe requirements for small molecule inhibition of Leishmania choline kinase, the recombinant enzyme was evaluated for the ability to be inhibited by novel quaternary ammonium salts. The most effective inhibitor was N-iodomethyl-N,N,-dimethyl-N-(6,6-diphenyl hex-5-en-1-yle) ammonium iodide, denoted compound C6. In the presence of 4\u00a0mM compound C6, the Vmax/Km decreased to approximately 1% of the wild-type catalytic efficiency. In addition, in Leishmania cells treated with compound C6 choline transport was inhibited.",

These processes occur by loss or gain of regulatory elements in gene promoters. Fatty acid-binding proteins (Fabp) belong to a multigene family composed of orthologous proteins that are highly conserved in sequence and function, but differ in their gene regulation. We previously reported that the zebrafish fabp1a, fabp1b.1, and fabp1b.2 promoters underwent subfunctionalization of PPAR responsiveness. Here, we describe the regulation at the duplicated zebrafish fabp7a/fabp7b, fabp10a/fabp10b and fabp11a/fabp11b gene promoters. Differential control at the duplicated fabp promoters was assessed by DNA sequence analysis, responsiveness to PPAR-isoform specific agonists and NF-\u03baB p50 antagonists in zebrafish liver and intestine explant tissue, and in HEK293A cells transfected with fabp promoter-reporter constructs. Each zebrafish fabp gene displayed unique transcriptional regulation compared to its paralogous duplicate. This work provides a framework to account for the evolutionary trajectories that led to the high retention (57%) of duplicated fabp genes in the zebrafish genome compared to only ~\u00a03% of all duplicated genes in the zebrafish genome.",

At the end of the experiment, weight gain (WG), condition factor (CF), and feed efficiency (FE) were significantly affected by diet\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0temperature interaction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Specific growth rate (SGR) was significantly affected by increasing temperature (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The plant protein-based diets led to a higher CF than the mixed fishmeal/plant protein-based diets. The protein productive value (PPV), protein efficiency ratio (PER), lipid efficiency ratio, (LER) and lipid productive value (LPV) were all significantly affected by diet\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0temperature interaction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The diet\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0temperature interaction also had significant effects on mitochondrial enzyme complexes II, V and citrate synthase in the liver, complexes II and IV in the intestine, and complex IV in the muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Temperature had a significant main effect on the activity of the enzymatic complexes I and III in the liver, complex III and citrate synthase in the intestine, and complexes I, II, III, V and citrate synthase in the muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Diet had a significant main effect on complexes I and III in the liver, complexes II and III for the intestine and complexes I and II in the muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The significant temperature x diet interaction observed has practical ecological implications explicitly demonstrating how changes in temperature regimens as anticipated in the rising global temperature can influence organismal performance in relation to changes in dietary formulations (replacing fishmeal based diet with plant protein based ingredients). To illustrate the practical application of the observations from this study, the most economical and cost effective way to produce rainbow trout would be to use 40/10PP diet at 14\u00a0\u00b0C because fish fed this treatment had a weight gain comparable to that of the fish fed the more expensive experimental diets (40/10 FM/PP, 40/20 FM/PP, and 40/20 PP).",

In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques against ECM components to reveal changes of ECM during intestine regeneration of Apostichopus japonicus. The expression of collagen I and laminin reduced apparently from the eviscerated intestine, while fibronectin exhibited continuous expression in all regeneration stages observed. Meanwhile, we cloned two MMP genes from A. japonicus by RACE PCR. The full-length cDNA of ajMMP-2 like is 2733\u00a0bp and contains a predicted open reading frame (ORF) of 1716\u00a0bp encoding 572 amino acids. The full-length cDNA of ajMMP-16 like is 2705\u00a0bp and contains an ORF of 1452\u00a0bp encoding 484 amino acids. The predicted protein sequences of each MMP contain two conserved domains, ZnMc_MMP and HX. Homology and phylogenetic analysis revealed that ajMMP-2 like and ajMMP-16 like share high sequence similarity with MMP-2 and MMP-16 from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, respectively. Then we investigated spatio-temporal expression of ajMMP-2 like and ajMMP-16 like during different regeneration stages by qRT-PCR and IHC. The expression pattern of them showed a roughly opposite trend from that of ECM components. According to our results, a fibronectin-dominate temporary matrix is created in intestine regeneration, and it might provide structural integrity for matrix and promote cell movement. We also hypothesize that ajMMP-2 like and ajMMP-16 like could accelerate cell migration and regulate interaction between ECM components and growth factors.

A 2000\u00a0bp-long 5\u2032-flanking region (translation initiation site designated as +\u00a01) of the Po-prdm1 gene was isolated and characterized.

     "abstract": "Ovotransferrin (OTf), the major protein constituent of egg white, is of great interest due to its pivotal role in biological iron transport and storage processes and its spontaneous autocleavage into peptidic fragments with alternative biological properties, such as antibacterial and antioxidant activities. However, despite being well-investigated in avian, a detailed elucidation of the structure-function relationship of ovotransferrins in the closely related order of Crocodilia has not been reported to date. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirmed the presence of two spectroscopically distinct ferric iron binding sites in Crocodylus siamensis OTf (cOTf), but implied a five-fold lower quantity of bound iron than in hen OTf (hOTf). In addition, quantitative estimation of free sulfhydryl groups revealed slight differences to hOTf. To gain a better structural understanding of cOTf, we found a cOTf gene consisting of an open reading frame of 2040\u00a0bp and encoding a protein of 679 amino acids. In silico prediction of the three-dimensional structure of cOTf and comparison with hOTf revealed four evolutionarily conserved iron-binding sites in both N- and C-lobes, as well as the presence of only 13 of the 15 disulfide bonds in hOTf. This evolutionary loss of disulfide linkages in conjunction with the lack of hydrogen bonding from a dilysine trigger in the C-lobe are presumed to affect the iron binding and autocleavage character of cOTf. As a result, cOTf may be capable of exerting a more diverse array of functions compared to its avian counterparts; for instance, ion buffering, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.",

The results demonstrated that glyceroneogenesis is an active pathway in N. granulata hepatopancreas, and is regulated by seasonal variations, diet composition and starvation. This study showed that in summer the increase in the hepatopancreas glyceroneogenesis activity is among the strategies used by N. granulata fed an HP diet, to maintain the triglyceride/fatty acid cycle during starvation, a normal condition in the biological cycle of this crab. However, the administration of an HC diet reduced the glyceroneogenesis capacity in response to starvation in summer. In winter, the decrease in the glyceroneogenesis capacity in both fed (HP and HC diets) and starved crabs seems to be a strategy to reduce energy consumption and/or requirement. In contrast to the summer results, the incorporation of [2-14C]-pyruvate into 14CO2 was markedly higher in both diet (HC and HP) groups and in starved crabs during the winter. Four decades after the first study describing the glyceroneogenesis pathway in rat white adipose tissue, this pathway is evidenced for the first time in a crustacean.",

The pH values in blood were significantly lower in the DEB 700 group 2\u00a0h after feeding when compared to DEB 200, indicating that acid-base balance in meagre was affected by electrolyte balance in diet. Osmolality, and Na+ and K+ concentrations in plasma did not vary with the dietary treatment. Gastric chyme in the DEB 700 group had higher pH values, dry matter, protein and energy contents, but lower lipid content than in the DEB 200 group. Twenty-four hours after feeding, amylase activity was higher in the gastrointestinal tract of DEB 700 group when compared to the DEB 200 group.

The simultaneous elevation of MyHC, Myf5, MSTN-1a, and MSTN-1b was found in trout yearlings. In smolts, expression levels of MSTN paralogs, MyHC, Myf5, MyoD1a was lower than in parr. But in contrast, the MyoD1c and myogenin mRNA levels was higher in smolts. The study revealed that there are definite patterns in simultaneous muscle-specific genes expression in age groups of parr and smolts.

Cathepsin B, cathepsin D, proteasome, and calpain activities in the skeletal muscles of salmon were assessed to investigate their relative contribution to the total protein degradation as well as to young fish growth process. It was confirmed that calpain activity dominates in salmon muscles while proteasome plays a minor role, in contrast to terrestrial vertebrates. Calpain and proteasome activities were maximal at the early post-larval stage (in parrs 0\u00a0+) and declined with age (parrs 1\u00a0+ through 2\u00a0+) dropping to the lowest level in salmon smolts. Annual growth increments and proteolytic activities of calpains and proteasome in the muscles of salmon juveniles changed with age in an orchestrated manner, while lysosomal cathepsin activities increased with age. Comparing protease activities and growth increments in salmon parr and smolts we suggested that the partial suppression of the protein degradation could be a mechanism stimulating efficient growth in smoltifying salmon. Growth and smoltification-related dynamics of protease activities was quite similar in salmon populations from studied spawning rivers, such as Varzuga and Indera; however, some habitat-related differences were observed. Growth increments and protease activities varied in salmon parr 0\u00a0+ (but not on later ages) inhabiting either main rivers or small tributaries apparently due to habitat difference on the resources for fish growth.",

Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the genomic structure and synteny relationship of gsdf in teleosts were conserved. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that gsdf expressed before sex gonadal differentiation, and the expression level increased rapidly after initiation of sex differentiation in males. In adult individuals, the expression of gsdf was higher in testis than that in ovary (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In situ hybridization (ISH) indicated that gsdf mRNA was detected in the somatic cells of both males and females, and also in the cytoplasm of oocytes.

After feeding or fasting, the fishes were subjected to an acute handling. Fasting resulted in decrease of plasma glucose level and liver glycogen content of gibel carp and largemouth bass. After handling stress, plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate of gibel carp and largemouth bass increased, regardless the fasted fish or fed fish.

     "abstract": "Birds are an anomaly among vertebrates as they are remarkably long-lived despite having naturally high blood glucose and metabolic rates. For mammals, hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress and protein glycation. In contrast, many studies have shown that domestic and wild birds are relatively resistant to these glucose-mediated pathologies. Surprisingly very little research has examined protein glycation in birds of prey, which by nature consume a diet high in protein and fat that promotes gluconeogenesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate protein glycation and antioxidant concentrations in serum samples from several birds of prey (bald eagle (BAEA), red-tailed hawk (RTHA), barred owl (BAOW), great horned owl (GHOW)) as protein glycation can accelerate oxidative stress and vice versa. Serum glucose was measured using a commercially available assay, native albumin glycation was measured by mass spectrometry and various antioxidants (uric acid, vitamin E, retinol and several carotenoids) were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Although glucose concentrations were not significantly different between species (p\u00a0=\u00a00.340), albumin glycation was significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) in BAEA (23.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.90%) and BAOW (24.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.43%) compared to RTHA (14.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63%). Of the antioxidants examined, lutein was significantly higher in BAOW (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). BAEA had the highest beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene concentrations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). The high concentrations of antioxidants in these birds of prey relative to other birds likely helps protect from complications that may otherwise arise from having high glucose and protein glycation.",

Igf-I mRNA expression in liver increased with the increment of water salinity, while it decreased in the muscle of S15 and S30 groups. \u03946-desaturase expression increased in S2.5 group compared to S15 in both liver and muscle. S30 caused a decrease in the \u03946-desaturase expression in liver compared to S15. The S30 treatment produced an increase in nucb2/nesfatin-1 mRNA expression in the brain and liver compared to S2.5 and S15.

There is evidence that vicilin, a major storage protein of cowpea seeds (Vigna unguiculata), is internalized in larvae of the seed-beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. It has been reported that this vicilin interacts with proteins present in the microvillar membranes of columnar cells along the digestive tract of the larvae. In the present work, we studied the cellular pathway involved in endocytosis of vicilin in larval C. maculatus by employing ex vivo experiments. In the ex vivo approach, we incubated FITC-labelled vicilin with isolated midgut wholemounts in the absence or in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors. The fate of labelled or non-labelled globulins was monitored by confocal microscopy and fluorescence measurement. Our results suggest that the internalization of vicilins is due to receptor-mediated endocytosis. Here we report the identity of a microvillar vicilin-binding protein that was purified using affinity chromatography on a vicilin-sepharose column. The putative vicilin receptor showed high homology to proteins with the CRAL-TRIO domain, specifically the Sec14 superfamily member \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein. The precise mechanism involved in vicilin internalization was defined through the use of specific inhibitors of the endocytosis pathway. The inhibitors filipin III and nystatin significantly inhibited the endocytosis of vicilin, while chlorpromazine and phenylarsine oxide had a much lower effect on endocytosis, suggesting that the endocytic pathway is predominantly mediated by caveolin.",

The full length cDNA of HdRHEB was 1044\u00a0bp encoding a peptide of 182 amino acid residues. Expression of HdRHEB gene was detected in all of the 7 tissues and showed the highest in mantle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Under hypoxia, expression of HdRHEB in gill increased significantly at 4\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and that in haemocyte increased significantly at 24\u00a0h, 96\u00a0h and 192\u00a0h (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Under thermal stress, expression of HdRHEB gene in gill decreased significantly at 4\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h, while expression in haemocyte decreased significantly all the time. Under thermal and hypoxia stresses, expression of HdRHEB gene in gill and haemocyte was up-regulated significantly at 24\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The results in this study demonstrated for the first time that RHEB gene in abalones is able to response to stress stimuli of hypoxia or/and thermal.",

At present, although the regeneration mechanism in Apostichopus japonicus has been studied, there is a little research on the Wnt signaling pathway in A. japonicus. To understand the potential role of the Wnt signaling pathway in A. japonicus, we cloned and sequenced the WntA gene in A. japonicus. Protein localization analysis showed that WntA protein was ubiquitously expressed in epidermal cells, the muscle and submucosa of the intestinal tissue. After stimulation and evisceration, the dynamic changes in expression of the WntA gene and protein showed that WntA was constitutively expressed during different stages of intestine regeneration in A. japonicus, with higher levels during the early wound healing stage and late lumen formation in the residual and nascent intestinal tissues, indicating its response to intestinal regeneration. Simultaneously, cell proliferation and apoptosis analysis showed that the patterns of cell proliferation were similar to the patterns of WntA protein expression during different intestinal regeneration stages in this organism. Taken together, these results suggested that WntA might participate in intestinal regeneration and may be connected with cell proliferation, apoptosis in different intestinal layers. This research could establish a basis for further examination of WntA functions in A. japonicus and Wnt genes in other echinoderms.",

These data were used to assess the health of birds in the area while taking into consideration life history (migratory or sedentary), locale, seasonality, sex, and age. We attributed increased values of pO2 and hematocrit, in addition to hemoglobin and glucose concentrations of migratory birds compared to sedentary birds as the increased need of oxygen carrying capacity and energy for long duration flights. Increased glucose and lower ionized calcium concentrations were observed in migratory birds likely based on breakdown of fat deposits in the body to fuel the muscular endurance of migration. During the hotter months of the year, birds' responses to handling were exhibited by relative respiratory acidosis. When sedentary birds sampled from South Texas were compared to a previous study from Central Texas, venous blood analytes differed by locale but were within the ranges of healthy populations. These findings lead us to conclude that sedentary avian communities can be used as ecosystem bioindicators.",

Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of conservation among insects for this gene. SnCYC consists of 667 amino acids and structural analysis showed that it contains a BCTR domain in its C-terminal in addition to the common domains found in Drosophila CYC, i.e. bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B domains. The results revealed that the sequence of Sncyc showed a similarity to that of its mammalian orthologue, Bmal1. We also investigated the expression patterns of Sncyc in the brain of larvae growing under long-day 16L: 8D (LD), constant darkness (DD) and short-day 10L: 14D (SD) conditions using qRT-PCR assays. The mRNAs of Sncyc expression was rhythmic in LD, DD and SD cycles. Also, it is remarkable that the photoperiodic conditions affect the expression patterns and/or amplitudes of circadian clock gene Sncyc. This gene is associated with diapause in S. nonagrioides, because under SD (diapause conditions) the photoperiodic signal altered mRNA accumulation. Sequence and expression analysis of cyc in S. nonagrioides shows interesting differences compared to Drosophila where this gene does not oscillate or change in expression patterns in response to photoperiod, suggesting that this species is an interesting new model to study the molecular control of insect circadian and photoperiodic clocks.",

Ovarian and muscle lipids fatty acid concentrations were significantly affected by treatment during all three stages of development. Stable 13C isotope analyses confirmed that dietary lipids were incorporated into both ovarian and muscle lipids during all three stages and revealed that ovarian lipids were more affected than muscle lipids during vitellogenesis. Arachidonic acid (ARA) was incorporated into ovarian lipids at the highest rate of all fatty acids examined with the greatest uptake observed during the cortical alveolus and lipid droplet stages of development. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was incorporated into ovarian lipids at the next highest rate with the greatest uptake observed during the lipid droplet stage of development. The presence of an ovary specific, fatty acid transfer mechanism is proposed.

Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced peptide sequence possessed the typical features of the microsomal Fads, including N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain containing the heme-binding motif (H-P-G-G), three histidine-rich boxes and three membrane-spanning regions. Sequence comparison revealed that the predicted protein had a high percentage identity (>\u00a053%) with \u03946 Fads from other crustacean species. The tissue distribution of mud crab \u03946 Fad-like mRNA was found predominantly in hepatopancreas, with lower expression levels in all other tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the \u03946 Fad-like transcriptional levels in hepatopancreas gradually increased with the increased replacement of dietary fish oil (FO) by soybean oil (SO).

An efficient, original three-step isolation procedure for TF consisting in hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel filtration and preparative electrophoresis was developed. Rainbow trout TF was found to be N-glycosylated (not O-glycosylated) and phosphorylated at all serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The protein consists of several proteoforms with an average molecular weight of 76.9\u00a0kDa and isoelectric point ranging from 5.2 to 5.7. Rainbow trout TF has two functional iron-binding sites and appears to be quite distinct from carp TF regarding glycosylation and iron-binding properties. The highest gene expression of TF was detected in liver and testis, the lowest was detected in head kidney, spleen and efferent ducts. For the first time TF was identified in the semen of several salmonid species. TF was localized within testis, mainly in spermatozoa, Sertoli, Leydig cells, as well as in both columnar secretory and basal cells within the efferent duct. This work contributes to the existing knowledge information indicating significant variations in TF structure within teleost fish. The results obtained in this study provide valuable data on the TF from trout seminal plasma and the physiological role of this protein in the reproductive tract of salmonids. The results are important for our understanding of the role of TF in the antioxidant protection and resistance to pathogenic infections of reproductive cells. The protective role of TF against environmental pollution with heavy metals, especially during prolonged storage of spermatozoa in the spermatic duct, as well as regulation of spermatogenesis and providing Fe for developing germ cells is also postulated.",

In the present study, a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) dnd homologue (Ecdnd) was identified and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis revealed a dynamic and sexually dimorphic expression pattern in PGCs and germ cells of gonads.

Visualization of zebrafish PGCs by injecting with RFP-Ecdnd-3\u2032UTR RNA and GFP-zfnanos3-3\u2032UTR RNA confirmed importance of Ecdnd 3\u2032UTR for the PGC distribution. In addition, knockdown of EcDnd by using antisense morpholinos (MO) caused the ablation of PGCs in orange-spotted grouper.

All of these proteins biochemically qualify as gelsolins since they sever actin filaments in a calcium dependent manner. P1, P2 and P3 are present in the Lumbricus body wall muscle whereas in the gizzard muscle P3 and P4 were found. P1\u2013P4 are encoded by four paralog genes and are differentially expressed in various muscle cell tissues. While the genes for P1 and P2 contain one intron, there was no intron in both P3 and P4 genes. The coding sequences consist of 1104\u00a0bp (368 amino acids) for P1/P4 and 1101\u00a0bp (367 amino acids) for P2/P3. Corresponding genes were confirmed by northern blot analysis which revealed three (calculated lengths: 3100, 2300 and 2100 nucleotides) and two (calculated lengths: 2300 and 1700 nucleotides) mRNA transcripts in the body wall and the gizzard, respectively. EWAM mRNA was localized by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the body wall and the gizzard muscle. P1 mRNA was detected in the inner proximal layers of both the circular and longitudinal muscle of the body wall whereas in the gizzard no significant staining was observed for P1. P2\u2013P4 mRNAs were abundant in the outer distal layers of both the circular and the longitudinal muscles of both body wall and gizzard.

In this study, kiss1 cDNA was cloned from the hypothalamus of Brandt's voles and kiss1 mRNA levels were investigated in different tissues, and at different developmental stages, using high-throughput real-time PCR. The full-length kiss1 cDNA was 682\u00a0bp, containing an ORF of 405\u00a0bp, encoding 134 amino acids with a conserved kisspeptin-10 region. Kiss1 mRNA was specifically expressed in ovary, testicle, small intestine, kidney, liver and hypothalamus tissues, and was undetectable in other tissues, including pituitary, heart, adrenal gland, bladder and uterus. Sexual organs of both male and female voles enter a period of rapid development in the postnatal 4\u00a0weeks and reach or approach sexual maturity by 8\u00a0weeks after birth. Kiss1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus did not show a significant difference between week 2 and week 4, indicating kiss1 mRNA levels may not be related to the rapid growth of the sexual organs in early developmental stages. Kiss1 transcripts significantly increased in both sexes 8\u00a0weeks after birth, and then were maintained at high levels in adults, indicating its possible role in the onset of puberty and maintaining of reproductive activity.

     "abstract": "The fruitless (fru) gene plays an important role in the sex determination pathway and courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study, two fru isoforms (Esfru1 and Esfru2) were identified from the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis. Sequence analysis showed that Esfru1 and Esfru2 were encoded by the same genomic locus and generated by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Esfru1 had all introns completely spliced out, while Esfru2 had a longer exon1 with an additional 78\u00a0bp sequence. They both contained a conserved BTB domain which was also found in D. melanogaster Fru isoforms. Analysis on temporal expression profiles of Esfru1-2 (a common region of Esfru1 and Esfru2) and Esfru2 (a specific region of Esfru2) showed that they expressed in similar patterns during embryonic development but in different patterns during larval development. The expression of Esfru1-2 decreased gradually from zoea III stage, however, Esfru2 increased from zoea IV stage and reached the peak at megalopa stage. Expression distribution in tissues and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that they showed sexually dimorphic expression in gonads, hepatopancreas and brains. Esfru1-2 showed significantly higher expression in female gonads and hepatopancreas than in males, but highly expressed in male brains than that in females. Interestingly, Esfru2 was displayed in a male-specific manner in each tissue, especially in gonads and hepatopancreas. Our results indicate that Esfru1 might be involved in both sexual brain neuronal structure development and related to female-specific character development. Esfru2 may participate in male-specific character development. This is the first report that characterizes two spliced variants of fru in crustaceans and provides basic information for further functional studies of the crab sex-determination mechanism.",

Sequence comparison, genomic structure and phylogenetic analyses showed that Smpiwil2 is homologous to that of teleosts and tetrapods. The Smpiwil2 transcript showed higher expression in the ovary than in the testis, demonstrating a sexually dimorphic gene expression pattern. In situ hybridization (ISH) showed that Smpiwil2 was expressed in the oogonia and all the stages of oocytes in the ovary as well as in spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testis. Embryonic expression profile revealed that Smpiwil2 was maternally inherited, and its level was higher from the zygote to the blastula stage and subsequently decreased until hatching. Moreover, a CpG island was predicted to locate in the 5\u2032-flanking region of Smpiwil2 gene, and its methylation levels detected by sodium bisulfite sequencing showed significant disparity between females and males, implying that the sexually dimorphic expression of Smpiwil2 might be regulated by methylation. These results indicated that Smpiwil2 had potentially vital functions in embryonic and gonadal development in this species. In addition, the temporal and sex differences in Smpiwil2 expression indicated that this gene may play different roles in gonadal development of different sexes.",

PPAR\u03b1, a member of the PPAR nuclear receptor gene subfamily (NR1C1), is involved in fatty acid metabolism, namely in peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation. Two gene paralogues, ppar\u03b1A and ppar\u03b1B, were described in several teleost species with their origin dating back to the teleost-specific genome duplication (3R). Given the additional salmonid-specific genome duplication (4R), four genes could be theoretically anticipated for this gene subfamily. In this work, we examined the ppar\u03b1 gene repertoire in brown trout, Salmo trutta f. fario. Data disclosed two ppar\u03b1-like sequences in brown trout. Phylogenetic analyses further revealed that the isolated genes are most likely genome ppar\u03b1B duplicates, ppar\u03b1Ba and ppar\u03b1Bb, while ppar\u03b1A is apparently absent in salmonids. Both genes showed a ubiquitous mRNA expression across a panel of 11 different organs. In vitro exposed primary brown trout hepatocytes strongly suggest that ppar\u03b1 gene paralogues are differently regulated by ethinylestradiol (EE2). Ppar\u03b1Bb mRNA expression significantly decreased with dosage, reaching significance after exposure to 50\u00a0\u03bcM EE2, while ppar\u03b1Ba mRNA increased, significant at 1\u00a0\u03bcM EE2.

Endosymbiosis is common in deep-sea hydrothermal vent fauna, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of interactions between host and symbionts. In this study we focused on a group of pattern recognition receptors (PRR), called PGRPs that are able to recognize the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell wall. We first characterised the different PGRPs isoforms in B. azoricus gills and identified five paralogs. Among them two displayed a signal peptide. Then, specific probes designed for each paralog were used to perform real-time PCR quantification in gills of individuals showing various bacterial content as a result of in situ experimental procedures. Overall we found a decrease of PGRPs expression when symbionts amount decreases, suggesting an implication of PGRPs in the regulation of symbionts in B. azoricus gills.

Samples were taken in the field at pre-hibernation (17\u00a0\u00b0C, Mud temperature (MT)), hibernation (5.8\u00a0\u00b0C, MT) and arousal (20.1\u00a0\u00b0C, MT).

Hepatic total GSH increased after arousal and pushed the ratio of GSH/GSSG to a more reduced status. Cerebral glutathione reductase (GR) mRNA and activity were depressed during hibernation then recovered after arousal. However, hepatic GR mRNA elevated during hibernation but its activity did not change. Tissue-specific changes of GR activity and mRNA may promote these tissue-specific changes of GSH redox. Hibernation caused little effect on mRNA level of glutathione synthetase (GS) while arousal induced them in the brain and liver. Most Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) isoform mRNAs did not change in both brain and liver during hibernation, then induced after arousal.

     "abstract": "Estrogen receptors (ERs) are the primary mediators of estrogen signaling, and play crucial roles in the reproduction and development of vertebrates. The full-length cDNA of Perinereis aibuhitensis estrogen receptor (paER) was cloned and characterized for the first time. The positions of the cysteine residues and the residues around them, which constitute two zinc finger motifs and a P-box, are conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that paER is an orthologue of ER in the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. A tissue distribution analysis of paER mRNA showed that it is expressed in various tissues, including the body wall, head, esophageal gland, esophagus, stomach, and most strongly in the intestines. Its expression was also measured in P. aibuhitensis after exposure to 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) for 48\u00a0h. The paER mRNA levels in the body wall were measured after 6, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0h in E2-exposed and control animals. However, no significant differences in paER expression were observed between them at any time point. This report describes the first molecular characterization of full-length paER and its tissue-specific expression in P. aibuhitensis.",

In this study, we cloned the cDNAs of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), cecropin-2 (BdCec-2) and defensin (BdDef) from Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), a serious pest causing great economic losses to fruits and vegetables. The BdCec-2 sequence of 192\u00a0bp encodes a protein of 63 amino acids residues with a predicted molecular weight of 6.78\u00a0kD. The 282\u00a0bp cDNA of BdDef encodes a protein of 93 residues with a predicted molecular weight of 9.81\u00a0kD. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that BdCec-2 and BdDef had similar expression profiles among development stages, the highest mRNA levels of these two AMP genes were observed in the adult stage. Among different adult body segments and tissues, both genes had similar transcriptional profiles, the highest mRNA levels appeared in abdomen and fat body, which was consistent with the reported fact that fat body was the main organ synthesizing AMPs in insects. The expression of BdCec-2 and BdDef were up-regulated after challenge with peptidoglycans from Escherichia coli (PGN-EB) and Staphylococcus aureus (PGN-SA), respectively, suggesting their antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms. These results describe for the first time the basic properties of the cecropin-2 and defensin genes from B. dorsalis that probably play an important role in the defense response against invading microbes.",

It has been reported that enzymes involved in phenol oxidation, such as tyrosinase and phenoloxidases, participate in the formation of the periostracum. In the present study, we cloned a tyrosinase gene from Crassostrea angulata named Ca-tyrA1, and its potential function in early larval shell biogenesis was investigated. The Ca-tyrA1 gene has a full-length cDNA of 2430\u00a0bp in size, with an open reading frame of 1896\u00a0bp in size, which encodes a 631-amino acid protein that includes a 24-amino acid putative signal peptide. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that Ca-tyrA1 transcription mainly occurs at the trochophore stage, and the Ca-tyrA1 mRNA levels in the 3000\u00a0ppm treatment group were significantly upregulated in the early D-veliger larvae. WMISH and electron scanning microscopy analyses showed that the expression of Ca-tyrA1 occurs at the gastrula stage, thereby sustaining the early D-veliger larvae, and the shape of its signal is saddle-like, similar to that observed under an electron scanning microscope. Furthermore, the RNA interference has shown that the treatment group has a higher deformity rate than that of the control, thereby indicating that Ca-tyrA1 participates in the biogenesis of the primary shell. In conclusion, and our results indicate that Ca-tyrA1 plays a vital role in the formation of the larval shell and participates in the response to larval shell damages in Crassostrea angulata that were induced by ocean acidification.",

Our results showed that SlAce1 and SlAce2 cDNA contains 2085\u00a0bp and 1917\u00a0bp nucleotides and encoding proteins of 694 and 638 amino acid residues, respectively. Phylogenic analysis indicated that the lineage of SlAce genes and SlAce1 was completely different from SlAce2. Although both genes were expressed in all developmental stages and majorly in the brain. The expression levels of the both genes were suppressed by inserting their related dsRNA in the 6th instar larvae, which led to 47.3% (SlAce1) and 37.9% (SlAce2) mortality. Interestingly, the suppression of the SlAce2 transcripts also led to significant reductions in the fecundity, hatching, and offspring in the parental generation of S. litura. It is concluded that SlAce2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and also plays role in female breeding, embryo progress, and the development of progeny. Considerable larval mortality was observed after both AChE genes (i.e. Ace1 and Ace2) were silenced in S. litura confirms its insecticidal effectiveness, which provided a molecular basis in biological pest control approach.",

In the present study, StAR and 3\u03b2HSD1 were cloned and characterized from protogynous orange-spotted grouper. StAR cDNA contains an 861\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted protein of 286 amino acids, and the ORF of 3\u03b2HSD1 was 1125\u00a0bp, encoding a predicted protein of 374 amino acids. The transcript of StAR was mainly expressed in gonad, while 3\u03b2HSD1 mRNA was predominantly detected in brain and gonad. In the previous study, we found the expression of GnIH mRNA level in male, as well as in 17 alpha-methyltestosterone (MT)-induced male fish was significantly higher than in female fish, this indicating that GnIH/GnIHR signaling might be involved in the regulation of sex reversal and male maintenance. In order to figure out the function of GnIH in steroidogenesis, the expression of StAR and 3\u03b2HSD1 regulated by GnIH was examined. In vitro study showed that treatment of cultured ovary fragments with gGnIH peptides significantly stimulated the expression of StAR and 3\u03b2HSD1. In addition, the mRNA levels of StAR and 3\u03b2HSD1 were significantly increased after intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with gGnIH peptides.

The results showed that the insects from Tongliang population had a relatively higher tolerance to malathion and propuxor than insects from other field populations. The insecticide sensitivities of different populations detected in psocids may be due to the different control practices. Through sequence mining and phylogenetic analyses, we identified 15 delta class GST genes that contained the conserved motifs of the GSTs. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis indicated that the 15 GST genes were expressed at all tested developmental stages, and 12 GST genes had significantly higher expression levels in adulthood than in egg stage. The expression levels of 15 GST genes in different field populations showed that 9 GST genes were significantly higher in Tongliang population compared to other populations. Furthermore, Q-PCR confirmed that the expression of several delta class GSTs was upregulated at different times after malathion, propuxor and deltamethrine exposure with the LC50 concentration of insecticide. Taken together, these findings showed that delta class GST genes have various expression levels in different developmental stages and different field populations, and they were up-regulated in response to insecticide exposure, which suggested that these GSTs may be associated with insecticide metabolism in psocids.",

Thus, to assess the effects of periodic starvation and refeeding schedule on the physiological and immunological perturbations in Edwardsiella tarda infected red sea bream, we conducted a 20\u00a0day experiment using 4 treatment groups, namely, pre-fed placebo (PFP); pre-starved placebo (PSP); pre-fed infected (PFI); and pre-starved infected (PSI), wherein a 5\u00a0h E. tarda infection was done on the 11th day. In the present investigation, the pre-starved groups showed significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) alterations in the liver Hexokinase and Glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The pre-starved fish also exhibited significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increment in the hepatosomatic index, along with increased hepatic glycogen content, in a time dependent fashion. The PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors)\u03b1 transcription in the pre-starved group decreased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by 10dai, while the PPAR\u03b3 showcased a reverse pattern. The transcription of Hepcidin1 and Transferrin (iron homeostasis related genes), and Cathepsin D and Ubiquitin (programmed cell death related genes) portrayed a time responsive decrease and increase in PSI and PFI groups, respectively. Additionally, in comparison to the PFI group, the PSI fish demonstrated substantially reduced oxidative stress level. Fluorescent Immunohistochemistry showed significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in p63 positive cells in the 10dai PFI fish in relation to the PSI group. Therefore, these findings provide new insight into the beneficial role of alternating starvation and refeeding schedule, preferably short-term starvation prior to an infection, in order to obtain better capability to battle against E. tarda infection in red sea bream.",

To investigate the possible roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), critical transcription factors involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish, the PPAR genes were cloned and their expression characterization with PPAR agonists, dietary lipid resource, and ambient salinity were examined. Three cDNA sequences respectively encoding 477, 516 and 519 amino acids of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 isoforms were obtained. PPAR\u03b1 exhibited a wide tissue expression with its highest levels in the heart and brain; PPAR\u03b2 was predominantly expressed in the gills, while PPAR\u03b3 was highly expressed in the intestine and gills. In rabbitfish primary hepatocytes, both the PPAR agonists 2-bromopalmitate (2-Bro) and fenofibrate (FF) increased the expression of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1c and Elovl5, whereas FF depressed the expression of \u03946/\u03945 Fad.

An apparent sexual dimorphism in transcript level of gmkiss1 and gmkiss1r in brain and gonads was evident during the reproductive cycle. Overall, in brain, testis and ovary, the gmkiss1 and gmkiss1r mRNA expression level was comparatively higher during the initial stages of gonadal development, than that of spermiation or ovulation stage.

Although the synthetic pathway of MF is well-documented, little is known about its degradation and recycling in crustaceans. Juvenile hormone esterase-like (JHE-like) carboxylesterase (CXE) is a key enzyme in MF degradation, thus playing a significant role in regulating the MF titer. We identified and characterized two cDNAs, Es-CXE1 and Es-CXE2, encoding JHE-like CXEs in Chinese mitten crab. Full-length cDNAs of Es-CXE1 and Es-CXE2 encode proteins composed of 584 and 597 amino acids, respectively, both of which contain a typical carboxylesterase domain. Alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Es-CXEs are highly similar to those of other crustaceans. To further validate their functions, we evaluated the mRNA expression patterns of the Es-CXEs in various tissues and in different physiological conditions. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that the two Es-CXEs were predominantly expressed in the hepatopancreas and ovaries, which are the major tissues for MF metabolism. Es-CXE2 expression levels in the hepatopancreas and ovaries were about 100 and 25-fold higher, than the respective Es-CXE1 expressions. During ovarian rapid development stage, the global expressions of Es-CXEs were up-regulated in the hepatopancreas and down-regulated in the ovaries. After eyestalk ablation (ESA), the mRNA expressions of the two Es-CXEs were up-regulated in the hepatopancreas, further indicating their potential in degrading MF. Taken together, our results suggest that Es-CXEs, the key component of the juvenile hormone degradation pathway, may play vital roles in the development and reproduction of the Chinese mitten crab.",

HcTyr and HcTyp-1 mRNAs were mainly expressed in the mantle, but the expression of HcTyr was higher in the purple mussel than in the white mussel while the expression of HcTyp-1 was higher in the white mussel. Strong and specific mRNA signals for HcTyp-1 were detected in the dorsal epithelial cells of the mantle pallial and some signals were detected in the epithelial cells of the periostracal groove, so HcTyp-1 may be involved in periostracum and nacreous layer formation. Strong and specific mRNA signals were also detected in the dorsal epithelial cells of the mantle pallial, so HcTyr may be involved in nacre formation. Further, the tyrosinase activity of the mantle in the purple mussel was higher than that in the white mussel. These findings indicate that HcTyr and HcTyp-1 may be involved in the formation of nacre color in H. cumingii.",

     "abstract": "Hearts of Antarctic icefishes (suborder Notothenioidei, family Channichthyidae) have higher densities of mitochondria, and mitochondria have higher densities of phospholipids, compared to red-blooded notothenioids. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycerolipid biosynthesis. There are four isoforms of GPAT in vertebrates; GPAT1 and GPAT2 are localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas GPAT3 and GPAT4 are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We hypothesized that transcript levels of GPAT1 and/or GPAT2 would mirror densities of mitochondrial phospholipids and be higher in the icefish Chaenocephalus aceratus compared to the red-blooded species Notothenia coriiceps. Transcript levels of GPAT1 were quantified in heart ventricles and liver using qRT-PCR. Additionally, GPAT1 cDNA was sequenced in the Antarctic notothenioids, C. aceratus and N. coriiceps, and in the sub-Antarctic notothenioid, Eleginops maclovinus, to identify amino acid substitutions that may maintain GPAT1 function at cold temperature. Transcript levels of GPAT1 were higher in liver compared to heart ventricles but were not significantly different between the two species. In contrast, transcripts of GPAT2 were only detected in ventricle where they were 6.6-fold higher in C. aceratus compared to N. coriiceps. These data suggest GPAT1 may be more important for synthesizing triacylglycerol, whereas GPAT2 may regulate synthesis of phospholipids. GPAT1 amino acid sequences are highly conserved among the three notothenioids with 97.9\u201398.7% identity. Four amino acid substitutions within the cytosolic region of Antarctic notothenioid GPAT1 may maintain conformational changes necessary for binding and catalysis at cold temperature.",

The Japanese seabass fabps showed high identity to their orthologs in other fish species and mammals. However, a specific fabp of Japanese seabass showed much lower identity to other Japanese seabass fabps. fabp1 has high expressions in liver and intestine, whereas fabp2 is mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The highest expression level of fabp3, fabp4, and fabp7 was observed in muscle, eye, and liver respectively. Different tissue expression patterns of fabp2, fabp4, and fabp7 between Japanese seabass and other teleost may indicate specific evolutionary Fabp functions in Japanese seabass. Moderate levels of dietary ARA (0.37\u20130.60%) enhanced the gene expressions of fabp1 in liver and intestine, fabp2 in intestine, and fabp3 in intestine, whereas excess dietary ARA levels (1.38\u20132.323%) were ineffective. The highest level of dietary ARA (2.32%) increased only the expression of fabp3 in muscle compared to the control diet.

Here we characterize the molecular expression of 5 mRNAs encoding Kir channel subunits in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti: Kir1, Kir2A-c, Kir2B, Kir2B\u2019, and Kir3. We demonstrate that 1) Kir mRNA expression is dynamic in whole mosquitoes, Malpighian tubules, and the midgut during development from 4th instar larvae to adult females, 2) Kir2B and Kir3 mRNA levels are reduced in 4th instar larvae when reared in water containing an elevated concentration (50\u00a0mM) of KCl, but not NaCl, and 3) Kir mRNAs are differentially expressed in the Malpighian tubules, midgut, and ovaries within 24\u00a0h after blood feeding. Furthermore, we provide the first characterization of Kir mRNA expression in the anal papillae of 4th instar larval mosquitoes, which indicates that Kir2A-c is the most abundant. Altogether, the data provide the first comprehensive characterization of Kir mRNA expression in Ae. aegypti and offer insights into the putative physiological roles of Kir subunits in this important disease vector.",

On returning to protein ingestion, these insects start using cathepsin (lysosomal) peptidases as digestive enzymes, from which the less known is cathepsin D. Nine of the ten cathepsin D transcribing genes found in Dysdercus peruvianus midgut are expressed exclusively in this tissue and only DpCatD10 is also expressed in other tissues. The main action of cathepsins D is in the first (V1) (from three, V1-3) midgut regions, where 40% of the total proteolytic activity was assigned to aspartic peptidases with an optimum pH of 3.5. The most expressed cathepsins D were identified in the midgut luminal contents by proteomics. The data indicate that D. peruvianus have kept a lysosomal gene expressed in all tissues and evolved another set of genes with a digestive function restricted to midgut. Digestive cathepsins D apparently complement the action of digestive cathepsin L and they are arguably responsible for the hydrolysis of cysteine peptidase inhibitors known to be present in the cotton seeds eaten by the insect, before they meet cathepsin L.",

Compared to metanauplii, zoeae contained twice the content of polar lipids (PL) and eight-fold the content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Artemia sp. metanauplii showed increased short chain fatty acid de novo synthesis from beta-oxidation of [1-14C]LC-PUFA, preferentially DHA. Of the LC-PUFA, DHA showed the highest esterification rate into Artemia sp. triacylglycerols. In contrast, in Grapsus zoeae [1-14C]DHA displayed the highest transformation rate into longer chain-length FAs and was preferentially esterified into PL. EPA and ARA, tended to be more easily incorporated and/or retained than DHA in Artemia sp. Moreover, both EPA and ARA were preferentially esterified into Artemia PL, which theoretically would favour their bioavailability to the larvae. In addition to the inherent better nutritional value of Grapsus zoeae due to their intrinsic lipid composition, the changes taking place after the lipid incorporation, point at two distinct models of lipid metabolism that indicate zoeae as a more suitable prey than Artemia sp. for the feeding of marine animals.",

Comparative expression profiling of the receptor gene at various reproductive and growth stages supports to its role in promoting oocyte maturation, spermatogenesis and skeletal muscle development via interaction with multiple ligands of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) family.

Resistance to pyrethroids is a complex genetic phenomenon attributed by polygenetic inheritance. We previously have sequenced and analyzed the miRNA profiles of Culex pipiens pallens. MiR-92a was found to be overexpressed in a deltamethrin-resistant (DR) strain. The association of miR-92a with pyrethroid-resistance was investigated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Expression levels of miR-92a were 2.72-fold higher in the DR strain than in the deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) strain. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that CpCPR4, a mosquito cuticle gene, is the target of miR-92a. Dual luciferase reporter assays further confirmed that CpCPR4 is modulated by miR-92a through binding to a specific target site in the 3\u02b9 untranslated region (3\u02b9 UTR). Microinjection of the miR-92a inhibitor upregulated CpCPR4 expression levels, leading to an increase in the susceptibility of the DR strain in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassay (a surveillance tool for detecting resistance to insecticides in vector populations).

For this purpose, pre-metamorphic larvae were treated with a low concentration of DEAB, an inhibitor of RALDH enzyme, until the end of metamorphosis. No differences in growth, eye migration or survival were observed. Nevertheless, gene expression analysis revealed a total of 20 transcripts differentially expressed during larval development and only six related with DEAB treatments directly involved in RA metabolism and actions (rdh10a, aldh1a2, crbp1, igf2r, rarg and cyp26a1) to adapt to a low-RA environment. In a second experiment, post-metamorphic larvae were exposed to the all-trans RA (atRA) observing an opposite regulation for those genes involved in RA synthesis and degradation (rdh10a, aldh1a2, crbp1 and cyp26a1) as well as other related with thyroid- (dio2) and IGF-axes (igfbp1, igf2r and igfbp5) to balance RA levels. In a third experiment, DEAB-pretreated post-metamorphic larvae were exposed to atRA and TTNPB (a specific RAR agonist). Both drugs down-regulated rdh10a and aldh1a2 and up-regulated cyp26a1 expression demonstrating their important role in RA homeostasis. Moreover, five retinoic receptors that mediate RA actions, the thyroid receptor thrb, and five IGF binding proteins changed differentially their expression. Overall, this study demonstrates that exogenous RA modulates the expression of some genes involved in the RA synthesis, degradation and cellular transport through RAR-mediated regulatory pathways establishing a negative feedback regulatory mechanism necessary to balance endogenous RA levels and gradients.",

Both gelsolin proteins lack a C-terminal latch-helix indicating a more rapid activation in the submicromolar Ca2+ range.We suggest that a gelsolin with three segments was present in the last common ancestor of the ecdysozoan clade Panarthropoda (Onychophora, Tardigrada, Arthropoda), primarily because the gelsolin of all non-Ecdysozoa studied so far (except Chordata) reveals this number of segments.Mapping of our molecular data onto a well-established phylogeny revealed that the number of gelsolin segments does not correlate with the phylogenetic lineage but rather with particular functional demands to alter the kinetics of actin polymerization.",

Furthermore, the UPR also participates in a number of physiological and pathological processes, such as nutrient sensing, lipid synthesis, and inflammatory response. In this study, four UPR-related genes (GRP78/BiP, ATF6\u03b1, XBP1 and CHO) were isolated characterized from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), and their expression in response to dietary lipid sources (various fatty acids) such as fish oil (FO), palmic acid (PA), olive oil (OO), sunflower oil (SO), and perilla oil (PO), were examined following feeding. The results showed that the four UPR-related proteins contained highly conserved functional domains and had the closest phylogenetic relationships with other fishes. Additionally, these genes were ubiquitously expressed in large yellow croaker, as in zebrafish and medaka. Moreover, GRP78, ATF6\u03b1 and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA levels in the liver, not in adipose tissue, were significantly increased in the SO group compared to the other groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results indicated that dietary SO activated UPR, and the activation of UPR might provide a mechanism to improve ER function, but probably stimulated lipid synthesis and caused inflammatory response in the liver of large yellow croaker.",

In the present study, we have identified and characterized three selenoprotein T paralogs (designated as gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2) in goldfish, Carassius auratus. The SECIS element was found in the 3\u2032-UTRs of gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 mRNA. Sequence analysis showed that they all possess the CxxU motif (where U represents Sec) in the N-terminal. Constitutive expressions of gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 were observed in all tissues studied. In liver, gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 mRNA expression levels significantly decreased when fasting and increased after re-feeding. The expressions of gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 were all inducible by cadmium exposure and H2O2-mediated oxidative stress, except the transcripts of gfSelT1b decreasing with H2O2 stimulation in brain. Furthermore, the expressions of gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 consistently increased in spleen but decreased in brain in response to heat stress. However, in liver only gfSelT1a mRNA expression significantly increased. In a word, this is the first report of the presence of three SelT genes in goldfish and their distinct expression patterns in response to environmental stressors. Our results suggest a potential involvement of gfSelT1a, gfSelT1b and gfSelT2 in host protection against environmental stressors including heavy mental, oxidative stress and heat stress in goldfish.",

The slc15a1a was predominantly expressed in the absorptive epithelia of the anterior part of the intestine, suggesting that digested oligopeptides are primarily absorbed in the anterior intestine. The response of slc15a1a to fasting was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14\u00a0days after the last feeding. Fasting revealed a biphasic effect, where short-term fasting significantly upregulated slc15a1a expression and long-term fasting resulted in downregulation. The expression level continued to decrease and fell below the pre-fasted level from day 4 to 14. Proximal (the hepatic loop, HL) and distal parts (the proximal major coil, PMC) of the anterior intestine showed different magnitudes of responses to fasting; slc15a1a expression in the PMC showed greater upregulation and downregulation than that in the HL. Refeeding significantly stimulated slc15a1a expression at day 3, although the expression did not exceed the pre-fasted level. Observed responses of slc15a1a to fasting and refeeding suggest that the expression level of this gene can serve as a sensitive indicator of the changes that may occur in altering nutritional conditions. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of PepT1 in nutrition and of the complex mechanisms underlying the absorption of oligopeptides and amino acids in the intestine, and may lead to development of possible means to manipulate the absorption processes for the improvement of growth and other metabolic and physiological conditions in fish.",

In recent years a significant effort has been put into the farming of arapaima to mitigate overfishing threats. However, little is known regarding the nutritional requirements of A. gigas in particular those for essential fatty acids including the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The ability to biosynthesize LC-PUFA is dependent upon the gene repertoire of fatty acyl desaturases (Fads) and elongases (Elovl), as well as their fatty acid specificities. In the present study we characterized both molecularly and functionally an orthologue of the desaturase fatty acid desaturase 2 (fads2) from A. gigas. The isolated sequence displayed the typical desaturase features, a cytochrome b5-domain with the heme-binding motif, two transmembrane domains and three histidine-rich regions. Functional characterization of A. gigas fads2 showed that, similar to other teleosts, the A. gigas fads2 exhibited a predominant \u03946 activity complemented with some capacity for \u03948 desaturation. Given that A. gigas belongs to one of the oldest teleostei lineages, the Osteoglossomorpha, these findings offer a significant insight into the evolution LC-PUFA biosynthesis in teleosts.",

Degradation of MF is similar to that of JH which occurs through ester hydrolysis by specific carboxylesterases (CXEs). In this study, the full-length cDNAs of two JH esterase-like CXEs were cloned from the swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two PtCXEs contain the conserved motifs including catalytic triad and oxyanion hole, which are the hallmark of the CXE family proteins. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the two PtCXEs may belong to the hormone/semiochemical processing group of CXE family, indicating their possible roles on metabolism of hormones. Transcripts of both PtCXEs were most abundant in hepatopancreas and the PtCXE2 was also highly expressed in ovary. The mRNA levels of two PtCXEs in hepatopancreas were induced by in vivo MF treatment and eyestalk ablation, further indicating their potential in degrading MF. However, during the ovarian maturation, expression of the two PtCXEs increased significantly in the early-vitellogenic stage, prior to the remarkable rise in hemolymph MF titer reported by our previous studies. Taken together, our results suggest that the two PtCXEs can potentially serve as the MF esterases, but their catalytic activity may not be restricted to MF.",

The objective of the present study was to compare the glycation of avian and human serum albumin to elucidate the mechanisms by which protein glycation in birds is prevented in the presence of naturally high plasma glucose concentrations. Solutions of purified chicken and human serum albumin (CSA and HSA) were prepared with four different glucose concentrations (0, 5.56, 11.1, and 22.2\u00a0mM) and incubated at three temperatures (37.0, 39.8, and 41.4\u00a0\u00b0C) for seven days. The solutions were sampled on Days 0, 3, and 7 and analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry for the presence of glycated albumin. Four-way repeated measures ANOVA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) indicate that all independent variables (albumin type, glucose concentration, temperature and time) interacted to affect the degree of glycation. With increasing glucose concentration, the glycation of both HSA and CSA increased with time at all temperatures. In addition, HSA was glycated to a greater extent than CSA at the two higher glucose concentrations for all temperature conditions. Glycation was elevated with increasing temperatures for HSA but not CSA. The results suggest an inherent difference between human and chicken albumin that contributes to the observed differences in glycation. Further research is needed to characterize this inherent difference in an effort to elucidate mechanisms by which avian plasma protein is glycated to a lesser degree than that of mammals (humans).",

PAHs can induce CYP1 protein expression and enzyme activity, the latter being usually quantified as 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD). The aim of this study was to characterize EROD activity in the bivalve mollusk Crassostrea brasiliana. EROD activity was evaluated in cytosolic and microsomal fractions of gills, digestive gland and mantle of C. brasiliana. No EROD activity was detected in mantle, but it was present in microsomal fraction of gills and digestive gland with NADPH as coenzyme. Optima temperature and pH for EROD assay were 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 7.4, respectively. EROD apparent Km (Kmapp) was 4.32\u00a0\u03bcM for gills and 5.56\u00a0\u03bcM for digestive gland. EROD Vmax was 337.3\u00a0fmol\u00b7min\u2212\u00a01\u00b7mg of protein\u2212\u00a01 in gills and 297.7\u00a0fmol\u00b7min\u2212\u00a01\u00b7mg of protein\u2212\u00a01 in digestive gland. Compared to other bivalves, a higher Kmapp and a lower Vmax was found in oyster which may suggest that oyster CYP1-like enzyme has lower affinity for substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin (7-ER) than those species. CYP1 inhibitor ellipticine (ELP) inhibited EROD activity in all tested concentrations in both tissues. The higher ELP concentration, 100\u00a0\u03bcM, inhibited 78% of EROD activity in gills and 47% in digestive gland. The CYP1 inhibitors \u03b1-naphthoflavone and furafylline did not inhibited EROD activity in microsomes of both tissues. In conclusion, EROD activity can be used to determine CYP1-like activity in oysters and possibly a CYP1A1/A2-like enzyme is responsible for this catalysis.",

In this study, we identified and characterized five JAK members of Synechogobius hasta. Compared to mammals, more members of the JAK family were found in S. hasta, which provided evidence that the JAK family members had arisen by the whole genome duplications during vertebrate evolution. For protein structure, all of these members possessed similar domains compared with those of mammals. Their mRNAs were expressed in a wide range of tissues, but at the different levels. Incubation in vitro of freshly isolated hepatocytes of S. hasta with different concentrations of recombinant human leptin decreased the intracellular triglyceride content and lipogenic genes expression, and increased mRNA expression of several JAK and lipolytic genes. AG490, a specific inhibitor of JAK, reversed leptin-induced effects on TG content and JAK2a, JAK2b, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL2) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCa), indicating that the JAK2a/b may have mediated the actions of leptin on lipid metabolism at transcriptional level.",

The purified F. merguiensis lectin (called FmL) consisted of two distinct 30.9 and 32\u00a0kDa subunits with identical N-terminal amino acid sequences of ten residues. FmL was also composed of sugar moieties; glucosamine, glucose, mannose and N-acetyl neuraminic acid but not N-glycolyl neuraminic acid. It was postulated to be a glycoprotein as it was positively stained by glycoprotein staining kit and detected by some bionylated plant lectins. Deglycosylation by either peptide N-glycosidase F or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid turned both types of FmL subunits to 28\u00a0kDa peptides. The internal peptide sequence of FmL was similar to a fibrinogen-related domain of human ficolin and the horseshoe crab lectin. Determination of the lectin concentrations in the hemolymph was performed by ELISA while its hemaglutinating activity (HA) was tested by hemagglutination. Both specific lectin concentrations and HA increased as shrimp developed ovarian maturation stages 2 to 4. Their constitutive levels were found in pre-vitellogenic females and higher than those of males. Both specific lectin concentrations and HA of FmL were inducible to the highest levels at 12\u00a0h after F. merguiensis was challenged by pathogenic Vibrio harveyi. The FmL-induced agglutination of V. harveyi was specifically abolished by sialic acid, fetuin and bacterial cell wall components.

However, the function of chitinase in the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata is yet to be determined. In this study, a chitinase gene (named PfChi1) was cloned from P. fucata and its expression profiles were investigated. The full-length cDNA of PfChi1 was 2743\u00a0bp and consisted of a 2187-bp open reading frame encoding 728 amino acid residues, a 47-bp 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), and a 509-bp 3\u2032-UTR. Similar to other known chitinases, the PfChi1 protein is composed of an N-terminal leading signal peptide, a catalytic domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain. The results of qRT-PCR showed that PfChi1 was expressed in a wide range of tissues with relatively high levels in the mantle, muscle, gill, and gonad, and relatively low levels in hemocytes, the intestine, and the digestive gland (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In situ hybridization showed that PfChi1 was mainly expressed in the mantle edge, particularly in the outer epithelial cells of the inner fold, whereas few hybridization signals were detected in the inner epithelial cells of the middle fold. A shell damage experiment indicated that PfChi1 transcript levels were up-regulated significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 24\u00a0h after shell damage and decreased gradually thereafter, followed by shell regeneration, indicating that PfChi1 is involved in shell formation. In addition, PfChi1 expression was higher in trochophore larvae than in other developmental stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating a possible association with the formation of prodissoconch shells.

Herewith, we aim to provide evidence for the conservation of heterodimeric Navs in aphids and investigate whether they have unique splicing patterns. We found that the only identifiable Nav from Toxoptera citricida consisted of two subunits, forming a heterodimeric Nav, which carried an atypical \u201cDENS\u201d ion selectivity filter and a conventional \u201cMFM\u201d inactivation gate, confirming the heterodimeric Navs' conservation within aphids. These unique heterodimeric channels may form a new Nav subfamily, specific to aphids. A more ancient member of four-domain Nav homolog was well preserved in T. citricida, carrying a typical \u201cDEEA\u201d and \u201cMFL\u201d motif. The presence of \u201cDENS\u201d in mammalian Naxs and \u201cDEKT\u201d in a fungus Nav suggested that the heterodimeric Navs may still preserve Na+ permeability. Sequencing 46 clones from nymphs and adults exposed unique splicing patterns for this heterodimeric Nav from T. citricida, revealing 7 alternatively spliced exons, evidencing that exon 5 was no longer unique to Bombyx mori, and exon k/l was semi-mutually exclusive. Two previously undescribed optional exons and a SNP site seemingly unique to aphids were identified. In conclusion, the dimeric Navs might form a new aphids-specific heterodimeric Nav subfamily. This dimeric Nav from T. citricida was characterized with distinguishable alternative splicing modes, exemplified by the discovery of two novel alternative exons and unique usage patterns of alternative exons.",

     "abstract": "The present experiment was conducted to determine the effect and mechanism of dietary choline levels on growth performance and lipid deposition of yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. Dietary choline was included at three levels of 239.2 (control (without extra choline addition), 1156.4 and 2273.6\u00a0mg choline per kg diet, respectively) and fed to yellow catfish (mean initial weight: 3.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0g mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard errors of mean (SEM)) for 8\u00a0weeks. Fish fed the diet containing 1156.4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 choline showed the higher weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed intake (FI), but the lower feed conversion rate (FCR), than those in control and highest choline group. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) and hepatic lipid content declined with increasing dietary choline levels. Muscle lipid content was the lowest for fish fed adequate choline diets and showed no significant difference between other two groups. Choline contents in liver and muscle increased with increasing dietary choline levels. Dietary choline levels significantly influenced mRNA levels of genes involved in lipid homeostasis in muscle and liver, such as CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase a (CCTa), phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyl-transferase (PEMT), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), apolipoprotein b (APOBb), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and effects of dietary choline levels on lipid deposition and metabolism were tissue-specific. Different responses of these genes at the mRNA levels partially explained the profiles of lipid deposition in liver and muscle for fish fed different choline diets. To our knowledge, this is the first to explore the effect of dietary choline level on mRNA expression of these genes, which provides new insights into choline nutrition in fish.",

     "abstract": "The Ca2+ affinity of cardiac troponin C (cTnC) from rainbow trout is significantly greater than that of cTnC from mammalian species. This high affinity is thought to enable cardiac function in trout at low physiological temperatures and is due to residues Asn2, Ile28, Gln29, and Asp30 (Gillis et al., 2005, Physiol Genomics, 22, 1\u20137). Interestingly, the cTnC of the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis (frog cTnC) contains Gln29 and Asp30 but the residues at positions 2 and 28 are those found in all mammalian cTnC isoforms (Asp2 and Val28). The purpose of this study was to determine the Ca2+ affinity of frog cTnC, and to determine how these three protein orthologs influence the function of complete troponin complexes. Measurements of Ca2+ affinity and the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the cTnC isoforms and cTn complexes were made by monitoring the fluorescence of anilinonapthalenesulfote iodoacetamide (IAANS) engineered into the cTnC isoforms to report changes in protein conformation. The results demonstrate that the Ca2+ affinity of frog cTnC is greater than that of trout cTnC and human cTnC. We also found that replacing human cTnC with frog cTnC in a mammalian cTn complex increased the Ca2+ affinity of the complex by 5-fold, which is also greater than complexes containing trout cTnC. Together these results suggest that frog cTnC has the potential to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation by the mammalian heart.",

     "abstract": "The discovery of miRNAs has brought the focus of physiologists to post-transcriptional regulation of the skeletal muscle. However, the field of how miRNAs are involved in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis of the skeletal muscle following endurance training is still in its infancy. Twelve male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to either control group (Group C) or voluntary wheel running group (Group E). The Group C was housed in cages mounted with fixed wheels, while mice of Group E were allowed to run on wheels freely for 8\u00a0weeks. It was found that miR-494 and miR-696 were significantly decreased in the gastrocnemius muscle after 8\u00a0week voluntary wheel exercise, accompanied with an increase in the mRNA expression of NRF1, BIM and Bcl-XL, an increase in the protein content of PGC-1\u03b1, and a decrease in the protein content BIM. The lack of correlation between miR-494 and TFAM and BIM, as well as between miR-696 and PGC-1\u03b1 suggests that even though miR-494 and miR-696 are sensitive miRNAs in response to exercise training, other factors or miRNAs might also be important during the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Euryhaline teleosts can survive in a broad range of salinity via alteration of the molecular mechanisms in certain osmoregulatory organs, including in the gill and kidney. Among these mechanisms, Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) plays a crucial role in triggering ion-transporting systems. The switch of NKA isoforms in euryhaline fish gills substantially contributes to salinity adaptation. However, there is little information about switches in the kidneys of euryhaline teleosts. Therefore, the responses of the renal NKA \u03b1-isoform protein switch to salinity challenge in euryhaline tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and milkfish (Chanos chanos) with different salinity preferences were examined and compared in this study. Immunohistochemical staining in tilapia kidneys revealed the localization of NKA in renal tubules rather than in the glomeruli, similar to our previous findings in milkfish kidneys. Protein abundance in the renal NKA pan \u03b1-subunit-like, \u03b11-, and \u03b13-isoform-like proteins in seawater-acclimated tilapia was significantly higher than in the freshwater group, whereas the \u03b12-isoform-like protein exhibited the opposite pattern of expression. In the milkfish, higher protein abundance in the renal NKA pan \u03b1-subunit-like and \u03b11-isoform-like proteins was found in freshwater-acclimated fish, whereas no difference was found in the protein abundance of \u03b12- and \u03b13-isoform-like proteins between groups. These findings suggested that switches for renal NKA \u03b1-isoforms, especially the \u03b11-isoform, were involved in renal osmoregulatory mechanisms of euryhaline teleosts. Moreover, differences in regulatory responses of the renal NKA \u03b1-subunit to salinity acclimation between tilapia and milkfish revealed that divergent mechanisms for maintaining osmotic balance might be employed by euryhaline teleosts with different salinity preferences.",

     "publication date": "12-2016",
     "abstract": "It has been suggested that kisspeptin influences reproduction and onset of puberty in fishes. Unlike mammals, which produce only one kisspeptin (Kiss1), some teleosts have two, Kiss1 and Kiss2, both thought to be involved in the stimulation of gonadotropin (GTH) secretion. In Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), however, only Kiss2 has been identified so far. The effect of Kiss2 on GTH release varies significantly depending on species and reproductive stage. Furthermore, its physiological function in this species is not clearly defined. In this study, kiss2 gene expression profiles were examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the brain, pituitary, and gonads of Nile tilapia at different reproductive stages (male: immature, pre-spermiation, post-spermiation; female: immature, pre-spawning, post-spawning). The kiss2 mRNA expression profiles of the brain, pituitary, and gonads of both sexes shared a similar pattern their expression was significantly higher at the immature stage than at the mature or post-spawning stages, implying it is involved in early gonadal maturation in this species. To investigate the effect of kisspeptin on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis in vivo, synthetic kisspeptin2 (FNYNPLSLRF) was injected into immature male and female tilapia intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 200\u00a0pmol/g body weight. The results showed that synthetic Kiss2 administration increased the expression of GnRH I, fsh\u03b2 and lh\u03b2 mRNA in the brain and increased 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels in the plasma. These results suggest that Kiss2 stimulates the expression of GnRH and GTH genes in immature Nile tilapia.",

In this study, the full-length cDNAs encoding VEGFAa and VEGFAb from pond loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, were isolated. The VEGFAa is constituted by an open reading frame (ORF) of 570\u00a0bp encoding for a peptide of 189 amino acid residues, a 639\u00a0bp 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) and a 2383\u00a0bp 3\u2032 UTR.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the VEGFAa and VEGFAb of pond loach were conserved in vertebrates. Expression levels of VEGFAa and VEGFAb were detected by RT-qPCR at different development stages of pond loach and in different tissues of 6-month-old, 12-month-old and 24-month-old pond loach. Moreover, eight predicted miRNAs (miR-200, miR-29, miR-218, miR-338, miR-103, miR-15, miR-17 and miR-223) targeting VEGFAa and VEGFAb were validated by an intestinal air-breathing inhibition experiment.

We investigated the dynamic nature of G3PDH by purifying the enzyme from the liver of Richardson's ground squirrel (Urocitellus richardsonii), a hibernating species, and analyzing its structural and functional changes during hibernation. Kinetic parameters of purified G3PDH from ground squirrel liver were characterized at 37, 22 and 5\u00a0\u00b0C and compared between euthermic and hibernating states. Relative to euthermic liver G3PDH, hibernator liver G3PDH had a decreased affinity for its substrate, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 22\u00a0\u00b0C. However, at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, there was a significant increase in the affinity for G3P in the hibernating form of the enzyme, relative to the euthermic form. Furthermore, the structure of G3PDH in the species' hibernating state showed greater thermal stability compared to its structure in the euthermic state. Western blot analysis revealed greater tyrosine phosphorylation in hibernator G3PDH as compared to euthermic G3PDH. In addition, using the protein sequence of the hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and bioinformatics tools, a three-dimensional model of G3PDH was built to identify the potential phosphorylation site (83Tyr) responsible for the differential phosphorylation between euthermic and hibernator G3PDH. The structural and functional changes in G3PDH support the enzyme's function at a low core body temperature experienced during the species hibernating season.",

We previously characterized a lamprey arginine vasotocin (AVT) receptor gene (Pm807) possessing characteristics of both arginine vasopressin (AVP) V1A and oxytocin (OXT) receptor genes of jawed vertebrates. Lamprey Pm807 mRNA is highly expressed in adult heart and larval liver but not expressed in adult liver. Using high-resolution melt (HRM) PCR on bisulfite-converted DNA, we pinpointed a region with tissue-specific differences in DNA melt characteristics, indicating differences in methylation level. Sequencing revealed a pattern of methylation at specific CpGs at consistently higher levels in adult heart and larval liver than adult liver. These CpGs are associated with putative transcription factor binding sequences organized similarly to functional OXTR promoters in mammals, suggesting functional similarity in lamprey gene transcription regulation.",

The present study examined the effects of prolonged (20\u00a0h) anoxic submergence on LDH from the tail muscle of an anoxia-tolerant crayfish (Orconectes virilis). LDH was purified to homogeneity from tail muscle of both aerobic control and anoxic crayfish in a three step process. Analysis of the kinetic parameters and the stability of LDH showed that the Vmax in the pyruvate-reducing direction was significantly higher for the enzyme from anoxic crayfish whereas in the lactate-oxidizing direction the Vmax was significantly higher for the control enzyme. Differential scanning fluorimetry was used to assess thermal unfolding of crayfish LDH. The results showed that the enzyme from control muscle had a significantly higher melting temperature (greater thermal stability) than the anoxic enzyme form, suggesting that there was a structural difference between the two enzyme forms. Immunoblotting of purified LDH implicated post-translational modification as the reason for this difference; purified LDH from aerobic control crayfish showed significantly higher amounts of serine/threonine phosphorylation than did the anoxic enzyme form. This study provides evidence for anoxia-induced modifications of crayfish muscle LDH that may contribute significantly to modulating enzyme function under anoxic conditions.",

In this study, UBC9 and UBS27 genes have been characterised in the tiger beetle Cicindela campestris for the first time. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the Cc-UBC9 gene encoded a 159 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 18.18\u00a0kDa, and the Cc-UBS27 gene encoded a 156 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 17.71\u00a0kDa. Selection analyses carried out in several cicindelid species revealed that both genes were affected by purifying selection. Real time quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that Cc-UBC9 and Cc-UBS27 were expressed in different tissues. The highest expression on both genes was found in the ovary and testis, and there were differential expression levels between immature and mature stages of testis development.The expression patterns of Cc-UBC9 and Cc-UBS27 suggest that these genes play important roles in gametogenesis in C. campestris.

     "abstract": "Carboxyl terminus of heat shock cognate 70-interacting protein (CHIP) is an evolutionarily conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase across different eukaryotic species and is known to play a key role in protein quality control. CHIP has two distinct functional domains, an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) and a C-terminal U-box domain, which are required for the ubiquitination of numerous labile client proteins that are chaperoned by heat shock proteins (HSPs) and heat shock cognate proteins (HSCs). During our screen for CHIP-like proteins in the Bombyx mori databases, we found a novel silkworm gene, Bombyx mori CHIP. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmCHIP belongs to Lepidopteran lineages. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that BmCHIP was relatively highly expressed in the gonad and fat body. A pull-down experiment and auto-ubiquitination assay showed that BmCHIP interacted with BmHSC70 and had E3 ligase activity. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BmCHIP was partially co-localized with ubiquitin in BmN4 cells. These data support that BmCHIP plays an important role in the ubiquitin proteasome system as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in B. mori.",

     "abstract": "Caspases are a group of cysteine-aspartate proteases involved in apoptosis and a variety of non-apoptotic processes. In this study, a novel caspase gene was cloned and its potential role in apoptosis was investigated. The caspase gene (CgCasp 3/7) has an open reading frame of 1626\u00a0bp encoding 541 amino acids containing the conserved functional domains and motifs of effector caspases. Its amino acid sequence shows low identity with the other effector caspases of Crassostrea gigas and contains a unique long intersubunit linker (IL). The CgCasp 3/7 mRNA was expressed highly in oocytes and then decreased gradually after fertilization, indicating CgCasp 3/7 could function in oocyte apoptosis. In adult tissues, it is located primarily in the gills and hepatopancreas. We examined the mRNA expression of CgCasp 3/7 in gills of oysters immersed in ambient (17\u00a0\u00b0C) or heated (27\u00a0\u00b0C) seawater. The thermal stress stimulated mRNA expression of CgCasp 3/7 by 2.5- and 4.1-fold at 2\u00a0h and 6\u00a0h post-treatment, respectively, indicating CgCasp3/7 was involved in the early response to thermal stress. To examine the function of the IL, CgCasp 3/7 and CgCasp 3/7-T (with a truncated IL) were expressed using an in vitro translation system and their DEVDase activity was measured. Both proteins showed a significantly higher level of DEVDase activity than control, but CgCasp3/7-T had lower DEVDase activity than CgCasp3/7, indicating CgCasp3/7 had DEVDase activity and the IL was required for maximal DEVDase activity. Our study adds to the complexity of caspases in C. gigas.",

The mechanisms involved remain unclear and were explored from the perspective of fatty acids delivery, uptake, synthesis and oxidation in the present study. Besides, this study was also designed to investigate the effect of dietary PL on antioxidant capacity in large yellow croaker larvae (Larimichthys crocea). Triplicate groups of larvae (initial body weight: 3.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0mg) were fed three isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets with increasing levels of PL (2.53%, 6.32% and 12.7%) eight times daily for 30\u00a0days. Results showed that the specific activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were significantly higher in 12.7% PL group compared to those in 2.53% PL group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while an opposite trend was observed for MDA content (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The specific activity of lipase and the mRNA abundance of fatty acids delivery and uptake-related genes, including lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase and fatty acids translocase (cluster of differentiation) were significantly higher in 12.7% PL group than those in 2.52% group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared to 2.53% PL group, the transcript levels of fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase I were significantly lower in 6.32% PL group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I and acyl CoA oxidase mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in 12.7% PL group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results indicated that dietary PL could enhance antioxidant capacity of larvae. Dietary PL might regulate lipid metabolism in large yellow croaker larvae by modulating fatty acids delivery, uptake, synthesis and oxidation at transcriptional level and improved fatty acids delivery and uptake might be responsible for higher body lipid content in 6.32% and 12.7% groups.",

Recently, a new type of calponin has been found in shellfish; the present study aimed to determine if this gene in shellfish functions in bio-mineralization, one of the most important processes in a mollusk's growth. We chose Chlamys farreri, a seashell species with great economic value, as the object of the study and obtained its full-length cDNA to study the function of calponin by gene expression analysis, shell notching experiment and RNA interference assays. Calponin in C. farreri is a basic protein that is highly conserved among mollusk species. Except for high expression in the adductor muscle and foot, which correlated with its function of regulating muscle contraction, the calponin gene was expressed more in the mantle than in other tissues. The expression of the gene was induced by shell notching and an RNA interference assay showed that inhibition of calponin expression caused the growth of irregular mineral crystals on the shell. Further analysis indicated that calponin might function by regulating the expression of other mineralization-related genes. Calponin is a mineralization-related protein in C. farreri that might influence mineral crystal growth by affecting the expressions of other proteins, such as matrix proteins and mineralization-regulating proteins.",

T output was stimulated by chicken ghrelin but not by human ghrelin. No effect of either human or chicken ghrelin on P release was observed. Human ghrelin promoted but chicken ghrelin suppressed AVT release by chicken ovarian fragments. In cultured ovarian granulosa cells, human ghrelin inhibited while chicken ghrelin stimulated T release.

     "abstract": "The wood frog, Rana sylvatica, survives sub-zero winter temperatures by undergoing full body freezing for weeks at a time, during which it displays no measurable brain activity, no breathing, and a flat-lined heart. Freezing is a hypometabolic state characterized by a global suppression of gene expression that is elicited in part by transcription factors that coordinate the activation of vital pro-survival pathways. Smad transcription factors respond to TGF-\u03b2 signalling and are involved in numerous cellular functions from development to stress. Given the identity of genes they regulate, we hypothesized that they may be involved in coordinating gene expression during freezing. Protein expression of Smad1/2/3/4/5 in response to freezing was examined in 24\u00a0h frozen and 8\u00a0h thawed wood frog tissues using western immunoblotting, with the determination of subcellular localization in muscle and liver tissues. Transcript levels of smad2, smad4 and downstream genes (serpine1, myostatin, and tsc22d3) were measured by RT-PCR. Tissue-specific responses were observed during freezing where brain, heart, and liver had elevated levels of pSmad3, and skeletal muscle and kidneys had increased levels of pSmad1/5 and pSmad2 during freeze/thaw cycle, while protein and transcript levels remained constant. There were increases in nuclear levels of pSmad2 in muscle and pSmad3 in liver. Transcript levels of serpine1 were induced in heart, muscle, and liver, myostatin in muscle, and tsc22d3 in heart, and liver during freezing. These results suggest a novel freeze-responsive activation of Smad proteins that may play an important role in coordinating pro-survival gene networks necessary for freeze tolerance.",

The objective of this experiment was to measure fatty acid esterification patterns of the non-EFA palmitic (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1), and the EFA linoleic (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3) in small intestine, liver, and muscle tissue of cows and pigs to identify tissues participating in sequestration of these FA in less metabolically active lipid classes in ruminants. Bovine and porcine small intestine, liver, and muscle explants were prepared and incubated in media containing radiolabeled 16:0, 18:1, 18:2, or 18:3 to measure esterification of fatty acids into PL and TG. Neither bovine nor porcine small intestine explants preferentially incorporated non-EFA compared to EFA into PL vs TG. Bovine liver explants esterified a larger proportion of EFA than non-EFA into PL compared to TG, while incorporation was similar among the FA tested in porcine liver explants. Bovine muscle explants showed preferential incorporation of EFA into PL rather than TG. Results show that bovine and porcine liver and muscle esterify EFA and non-EFA differently and that the conservation of EFA in ruminants is a result of preferential incorporation of EFA into PL mediated by bovine liver and muscle, but not the small intestine.",

Little is known about the mechanism of growth- and reproduction-related hormones gene expression in Chinese alligator. Estrogens play important roles in regulating multiple reproduction- and non-reproduction-related functions by binding to their corresponding receptors. Here, the full-length cDNA of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1/ESR1) was cloned and sequenced from Chinese alligator for the first time, which comprises 1764\u00a0bp nucleotides and encodes a predicted protein of 587 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of ESR1 showed that crocodilians and turtles were the sister-group of birds. The results of real-time quantitative PCR indicated that the ESR1 mRNA was widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues. In the brain and pituitary gland, ESR1 was most highly transcribed in the cerebellum. But in other peripheral tissues, ESR1 mRNA expression level was the highest in the ovary. Compared with hibernation period, ESR1 mRNA expression levels were increased significantly in the reproductive period (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in cerebellum, pituitary gland, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and ovary, while no significant change in other examined tissues (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The ESR1 mRNA expression levels changes during the two periods of different tissues suggested that ESR1 might play an important role in mediation of estrogenic multiple reproductive effects in Chinese alligator. Furthermore, it was the first time to quantify ESR1 mRNA level in the brain of crocodilians, and the distribution and expression of ESR1 mRNA in the midbrain, cerebellum and medulla oblongata was also reported for the first time in reptiles.",

Kisspeptins control the onset of reproductive functions during puberty by directly stimulating the neuronal activity and release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The function of kisspeptins has been investigated in vivo and in vitro. In our study, three kinds of recombinant kisspeptin proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Kisspeptin fragments Kp54, Kp44, and Kp10 translated from Paralichthys olivaceus kiss2 gene were then obtained. Kp44 contained 44 amide acids (aa) which are the same as the N-terminal of Kp54; Kp10 shares the same 10 aa with the C-terminal of Kp54 but Kp10 also contains some other amide acids. In the dose course of treatments with prokaryotically expressed peptides, Kp54 and Kp10 could induce the expression of kissr2 and gnrh1; by contrast, Kp44 could not induce a similar expression. These results provided direct evidence that the core decapeptide of kisspeptin is necessary to ensure its biological functions. In the time course of the Kp54 treatments on two kinds of cultured brain cells, different patterns of kissr2 and gnrh1 mRNA suggested that the responses of these cells to kisspeptins depends on cell type and treatment duration. Thus, our research provided alternative methods to investigate the functions of kisspeptin in vitro and to detect biological activities; this research also established basis for kisspeptin applications in production processes.",

This is partly due to a reduction in the permeability of excitatory glutamatergic ion channels, initiated by mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mK+ATP) channel activation. The aim of this study was to determine if: 1) PKC\u03b5, a kinase associated with hypoxic stress tolerance, is more highly expressed in turtle brain than the anoxia-intolerant rat brain; 2) PKC\u03b5 translocates to the mitochondrial membrane during anoxia; 3) PKC\u03b5 modulates mK+ATP channels at the Thr-224 phosphorylation site on the Kir6.2 subunit; and 4) Thr-224 phosphorylation sensitises mK+ATP channels to anoxia. Soluble and mitochondrial-rich particulate fractions of turtle and rat cerebral cortex were isolated and PKC\u03b5 expression was determined by Western blot, which revealed that turtle cortical PKC\u03b5 expression was half that of the rat. Following the transition to anoxia, no changes in PKC\u03b5 expression in either the soluble or particulate fraction of the turtle cortex were observed. Furthermore, incubation of tissue with tat-conjugated activator or inhibitor peptides had no effect on the amount of PKC\u03b5 in either fraction. However, we observed a 2-fold increase in Thr-224 phosphorylation following 1\u00a0h of anoxia. The increased Thr-224 phosphorylation was blocked by the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine but this did not affect the latency or magnitude of mK+ATP channel-mediated mitochondrial depolarization following anoxia, as indicated by rhodamine-123. We conclude that PKC\u03b5 does not play a role in the onset of mitochondrial depolarization and therefore glutamatergic channel arrest in turtle cerebral cortex.",

Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing of kidney tissue of the golden mahseer (Tor putitora) using Illumina platform to identify the solute carrier families and characterized 24 putative functional genes under 15 solute carrier families. Out of 24 putative functional genes, 11 genes were differentially expressed in different tissues (head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen, liver, gill, muscle, intestine and brain) using qRT-PCR assay. The slc5a1, slc5a12, slc12a3, slc13a3, slc22a13 and slc26a6 were highly expressed in kidney.

The unrooted phylogenetic trees of slc2, slc5, slc13 and slc33 were constructed using amino acid sequences of Homo sapiens, Salmo salar, Danio rerio, Cyprinus carpio and Tor putitora.

PtE75 exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns in these four tissues, which may depend on the distinct action of 20E on different tissues. The expression of PtE75 in Y-organ and epidermis were induced by eyestalk ablation (ESA), indicating its responsiveness to the increasing hemolymph 20E titer. To identify potential targets for ecdysteroid control the in Y-organ, epidermis, and eyestalk, the expression change of an ecdysteroid synthesis gene PtSad in Y-organ, a chitin degradation gene PtChi1 in epidermis, and the molt-inhibiting hormone gene PtMIH in eyestalk were investigated after silencing of PtE75 mRNA. The double stranded RNA (dsRNA) of PtE75 caused a loss in PtChi and PtMIH expression, while an increase in PtSad expression. The results suggested that the ecdysteroids may act through E75, and play a stimulatory role on chitin degradation in epidermis and MIH synthesis in eyestalk, and an negative feedback effect on ecdysteroid synthesis in Y-organ.",

     "abstract": "Remodeling the muscle metabolic machinery in mammals in response to energetic challenges depends on the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its ability to phosphorylate PPAR \u03b3 coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1), which in turn coactivates metabolic genes through direct and indirect association with DNA-binding proteins such as the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) (Wu et al., 1999). The integrity of this axis in fish is uncertain because PGC1\u03b1 i) lacks the critical Thr177 targeted by AMPK and ii) has mutations that may preclude binding NRF1. In this study we found no evidence that AMPK regulates mitochondrial gene expression through PGC1\u03b1 in zebrafish and goldfish. AICAR treatment of zebrafish blastula cells increased phosphorylation of AMPK and led to changes in transcript levels of the AMPK targets mTOR and hexokinase 2. However, we saw no increases in mRNA levels for genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, including PGC1\u03b1, NRF1, and COX7C, a cytochrome c oxidase subunit. Further, AMPK phosphorylated mammalian peptides of PGC1\u03b1 but not the corresponding region of zebrafish or goldfish in vitro. In vivo cold acclimation of goldfish caused an increase in mitochondrial enzymes, AMP and ADP levels, however AMPK phosphorylation decreased. In fish, the NRF1-PGC1\u03b1 axis may be disrupted due to insertions in fish PGC1\u03b1 orthologs within the region that serves as NRF1 binding domain in mammals. Immunocopurification showed that recombinant NRF1 protein binds mammalian but not fish PGC1\u03b1. Collectively, our studies suggest that fish have a disruption in the AMPK-PGC1\u03b1-NRF1 pathway due to structural differences between fish and mammalian PGC1\u03b1.",

For many years, comparative enzymology was primarily concerned with analyzing enzyme functional properties (e.g. substrate affinities, allosteric effectors, responses to temperature or pH, stabilizers, denaturants, etc.) in order to determine how enzyme properties were optimized to function under changing conditions. More recently it became apparent that posttranslational modifications of enzymes play a huge role in metabolic regulation. At first, such modifications appeared to target just crucial regulatory enzymes but recent work is showing that many dehydrogenases are also targets of posttranslational modification leading to substantial changes in enzyme properties. The present article focuses in particular on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) showing that stress-induced changes in enzyme properties can be linked with reversible posttranslational modifications; e.g. changes in the phosphorylation state of LDH occur in response to dehydration stress in frogs and anoxia exposure of turtles and snails. Furthermore, these studies show that LDH is also a target of other posttranslational modifications including acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination that change in response to anoxia or dehydration stress. Selected new methods for exploring posttranslational modifications of dehydrogenases are discussed and new challenges for the future of comparative enzymology are presented that will help to achieve a deeper understanding of biochemical adaptation through enzyme regulation.",

In the present study on the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) we tested the hypothesis that muscle and bone differ in their responsiveness to stimuli eliciting fast growth, providing a potential mechanism for generating the skeletal deformities observed in aquaculture. To investigate transcription regulation in skeletal muscle and bone we stimulated protein synthesis using a flooding dose of the branched chain amino acid leucine and compared the results with saline-injected controls. To increase the amount of available sequence information for gene expression analysis a de novo transcriptome was assembled using publicly available Next Generation Sequencing libraries from embryo, fast skeletal muscle, bone and cartilage. The resulting 5 million reads were assembled into 125,646 isotigs representing around 16,000 unique genes, including most components of the Pi3k/Akt/mTor signalling pathway. Principal components analysis was able to distinguish the transcriptional responses between leucine and saline injected controls in skeletal muscle, but not in the bone. General Linear Modelling revealed significant temporal changes in gene expression following leucine injection including the tissue-specific markers sparc, bglap (bone), mlc2 and myod2 (muscle) and gene transcripts associated with Pi3k/Akt/mTor signalling, p70sk6, akt2, ampka and mtor. Skeletal muscle showed more pronounced and rapid changes in transcript abundance than the bone to the same pro-growth signal. The observed differences in transcriptional response are consistent with the idea that fast growth results in a miss-match between muscle and bone development and may contribute to a higher incidence of skeletal deformities.",

Copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) express two independent genes coding for distinct proglucagon sequences (PG I, PG II), with PG II lacking the GLP-2 sequence. These genes are differentially transcribed in the endocrine pancreas, the brain, and the gastrointestinal tract. Alternative splicing identified in rockfish is only one part of this complex regulation of the PG transcripts: the system has the potential to produce two glucagons, four GLP-1s and a single GLP-2, or any combination of these peptides. Mass spectrometric analysis of partially purified PG-derived peptides in endocrine pancreas confirms translation of both PG transcripts and differential processing of the resulting peptides. The complex differential regulation of the two PG genes and their continued presence in this extant teleostean fish strongly suggests unique and, as yet largely unidentified, roles for the peptide products encoded in each gene.",

We followed the research on cultured skeletal muscle cells through the collaboration with INRA focused on the characterization of IGF-I receptors and its signaling pathways through in vitro development. Later on, we showed the important metabolic role of IGFs, although these studies were only the first stage of a prolific area of work that has offered a useful tool to advance in our knowledge of the endocrine and nutritional regulation of fish growth and metabolism. Obviously, the findings obtained in vitro serve the purpose to propose the scenario that will need confirmation in vivo, but this technique has made possible many different, easy, fast and better controlled studies. In this review, we have summarized the main advances that the use of cultured muscle cells has permitted, focusing mainly in the role of IGFs regulating fish metabolism and growth.

The absence of reliable and specific pharmacological agents led investigators to define the fish hepatic AR system as relying solely on a \u03b22-AR, cAMP-dependent signaling transduction pathway. The use of calcium-radiometric imaging, purified membranes for ligand-binding studies, and perifused rather than static cultured fish hepatocytes, unequivocally demonstrated that both \u03b11- and \u03b22-AR signaling systems existed in the fish liver consistent with studies in mammals. Additionally, the use of molecular tools and phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrated the existence of multiple AR-types and -subtypes in hepatic and other tissues of a number of fish species. This review also examines the use of \u03b2-blockers as pharmaceuticals and how these drugs that are now in the aquatic environment may be impacting aquatic species including fish and some invertebrates. Clearly there is a large conservation of structure and function within the AR system of vertebrates but there remain a number of key questions that need to be addressed before a clear understanding of these systems can be resolved.",

The exposure led to changes in several biochemical parameters, including reduction in cholesterol, triglycerides, cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol. Changes in cholesterol and triglycerides were also associated with changes in transcript levels of key genes involved with cholesterol and lipid regulation, including SREBP2, HMGCR1, PPAR\u03b1, and SREBP1. We also noted higher CYP3A65 and atrogin1 mRNA levels in drug-treated male fish. Sex differences were apparent in some of the examined parameters at both biochemical and molecular levels. This study supports these drugs affecting cholesterol metabolism and steroid production in adult zebrafish. We conclude that the reduction in cortisol may impair the ability of these fish to mount a suitable stress response, whereas the reduction of sex steroids may negatively affect reproduction.",

PCB-126 (3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) accumulates in lipids and can subsequently be released into the bloodstream during periods of high activity that involve the mobilization of stored fuels to meet with increasing energy demands. The goal of this study was to determine if a sublethal exposure to PCB-126 altered the content of tissue energy supplies (carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, triglycerides) and impaired swimming performance as well as oxygen consumption in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout were injected intraperitoneally with a single Low (100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) or High (400\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) dose of PCB-126 then swimming performance and metabolic rates from 1 to 9\u00a0days post-injection were compared to Control (non-dosed) fish. Liver ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity was assessed as an indication of PCB-126 intoxication while plasma and white muscle tissue metabolites were analyzed as an index of physiological disturbance. Swimming performance, assessed using two successive modified critical swimming speed (Ucrit) tests, was highest for fish in the High PCB-126 treatment; however, their initial condition factor (K) was also higher, largely due to their greater body mass. Trout in the High and Low PCB-126 treatments exhibited impaired recovery following intense exercise as they swam comparatively poorly when provided a second challenge. PCB-exposed fish exhibited reduced spleen somatic indices as well as muscle glucose and glycogen contents; whereas plasma cortisol and glucose levels were elevated, indicating higher metabolic costs during recovery and muscle restoration. Overall, this research provides insights into the sublethal effects of a toxic organic compound on swimming performance in trout.",

Cortisol is the main circulating glucocorticoid in fish and its action is mediated through its cytosolic receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and regulates the expression of genes involved in growth, metabolism and immune function. When taken together, the data suggests that cortisol may be playing a key role in the energy substrate re-partitioning in hepatocytes to cope with stress. The proposed model is that cortisol upregulates pathways involved in energy substrate mobilization, including gluconeogenesis, while downregulating energy demanding pathways, including growth and immune function. Recent work also points to a role for cortisol in mediating rapid action that is non-genomic and includes modulation of secondary signalling cascades; however, the physiological relevance of these studies remains to be determined. Altogether, studies carried out in hepatocytes are bringing to fore the complex nature of the cortisol signalling pathways in the organismal stress response. The mode of actions and their physiological implications for stress coping awaits further study.",

We found that an accumulation of trehalose could be observed at 5\u00a0\u00b0C, 0\u00a0\u00b0C and \u2212\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C and trehalase was suppressed in these temperature points during a gradually cooling environment. Then, in a gradually warming environment, trehalose levels increased slightly from \u2212\u00a05\u00a0\u00b0C to 15\u00a0\u00b0C and then decreased at 25\u00a0\u00b0C; however, no significant negative association was observed between trehalase and trehalose. Additionally, we found that glycogen could be converted into trehalose to help the individual resist the low temperature. Analysis of the expression of soluble trehalase showed that HaTreh1\u20131, HaTreh1\u20132, HaTreh1\u20133 and HaTreh1\u20134 were involved in trehalose metabolism; but the gene HaTreh1\u20134 plays the most important role in the cooling process, and HaTreh1\u20132 and HaTreh1\u20134 play the most important role in the warming process. Finally, we found that 5\u00a0\u00b0C might be a temperature signal for H. axyridis; prior to this temperature, individuals must make enough physical preparations to resist cold stress during the winter.",

In this study, the full-length coding sequence of tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) GATA6 was identified. The sequence consisted of 1494 nucleotides encoding a peptide of 497 amino acids, which included two conserved zinc finger domains. Phylogenetic, gene structure, and synteny analysis showed that C. semilaevis GATA6 was homologous to teleost and tetrapod GATA6. C. semilaevis GATA6 mRNA exhibited high expression in heart, intestine, liver, kidney, and gonad. Embryonic development expression profiles revealed that GATA6 is involved in morphogenesis because its expression increased at the blastula stage. The in situ hybridization results showed strong GATA6 signals in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and Sertoli cells of the testis. The signals were also detected in the oogonia and oocytes of the ovary. The expression of C. semilaevis GATA6 was sexually dimorphic, and the methylation pattern in the promoter region varied among males, females, and pseudomales. These results suggested that GATA6 might influence the gonad development and reproduction of C. semilaevis. This study provides the groundwork for further development of breeding techniques in C. semilaevis.",

The S. argus has a \u25b36 Fad, while the rabbitfish has \u25b34 and \u25b36/\u25b35 Fads, which were the first report in vertebrate and marine teleost, respectively. In order to compare the characteristics of elongases of very long-chain fatty acids (Elovl) between them, two Elovl cDNAs were cloned from S. argus in the present study. One has 885\u00a0bp of open read fragment (ORF) encoding a protein with 294 amino acid (aa) showing Elovl5 activity functionally characterized by heterologous expression in yeast, which was primarily active for the elongation of C18 and C20 PUFAs. The other has 915\u00a0bp of ORF coding for a 305 aa protein showing Elovl4 activity, which was more efficient in the elongation of C20 and C22 PUFAs. Tissue distribution analyses by RT-PCR showed that elovl5 was highly expressed in the liver compared to other tissues determined, whereas elovl4 transcripts were only detected in the eye. The expression of elovl5 and elovl4 were significantly affected by dietary fatty acid composition, with highest expression of mRNA in the liver and eye of fish fed a diet with an 18:3n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03/18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 ratio of 1.7:1. These results indicated that the S. argus has a similar Elovl system in the LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway to that of rabbitfish although their Fad system was different, suggesting that the diversification of fish LC-PUFA biosynthesis specificities is more associated with its Fad system.

We characterized two ferritin homologues and their expression patterns in association with early development, growth rate and immune response in the scallop Argopecten purpuratus, a species of economic importance for Chile and Peru. Two ferritin subunits (Apfer1 and Apfer2) were cloned. Apfer1 cDNA is a 792\u00a0bp clone containing a 516\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) that corresponds to a novel ferritin subunit in A. purpuratus. Apfer2 cDNA is a 681\u00a0bp clone containing a 522\u00a0bp ORF that corresponds to a previously sequenced EST. A putative iron responsive element (IRE) was identified in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of both genes. The deduced protein sequences of both cDNAs possessed the motifs and domains characteristic of functional ferritin subunits. Both genes showed differential expression patterns at tissue-specific and early development stage levels. Apfer1 expression level increased 40-fold along larval developmental stages, decreasing markedly after larval settlement. Apfer1 expression in mantle tissue was 2.8-fold higher in fast-growing than in slow-growing scallops. Apfer1 increased 8-fold in haemocytes 24\u00a0h post-challenge with the bacterium Vibrio splendidus. Apfer2 expression did not differ between fast- and slow-growing scallops or in response to bacterial challenge. These results suggest that Apfer1 and Apfer2 may be involved in iron storage, larval development and shell formation. Apfer1 expression may additionally be involved in immune response against bacterial infections and also in growth; and thus would be a potential marker for immune capacity and for fast growth in A. purpuratus.",

Total lipid and wax ester contents of younger N. cristatus stages increased during the development, being higher in May than in March and December. Major fatty acids of younger N. cristatus were 16:0, 20:5(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03), and 22:6(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) and the dominant alcohols were 16:0, 16:1(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a07), 20:1(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a09)/(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a011) and 22:1(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a011). The energy-rich 20:1 and 22:1 moieties increased from the younger to the adult stages showing the importance of lipid biosynthesis which may be advantageous for successful overwintering and reproduction at depth. The 16:4(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) fatty acid, characteristic of a diatom diet increased in May, particularly in the younger stages. Our results suggest that the diatom-dominated feeding mode of younger N. cristatus during the spring bloom is important for an effective accumulation of wax esters. In contrast to N. cristatus, E. bungii accumulated substantial amounts of triacylglycerols. The total lipid and triacylglycerol content increased slightly toward the older developmental stages. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 16:1(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a07), 18:1(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a09) and (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a07), and 20:5(n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03). There was no evidence of developmental or seasonal changes in the fatty acid composition. The differences in the lipid storage modes of both copepods via wax esters or triacylglycerols are species-specific but their fatty acid compositions varied according to diet and developmental stage, especially in N. cristatus. These lipid characteristics are discussed in relation to reproduction, feeding modes, diapause and overwintering strategies.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional regions of nanos3 3\u2032UTR in olive flounder using truncated and mutated nanos3 3\u2032UTRs fused to chimeric RNAs and microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs. The results indicated that a 68-bp functional element in the nanos3 3\u2032UTR of olive flounder played important roles in the protection and degradation of RNA. Within this element, a U-rich region was identified to be responsible for the protection of RNA in PGCs and two GCAC sites for the degradation of RNA in somatic cells. The first GCAC was located adjacently to the U-rich region and the second GCAC within the U-rich region. Overall, we concluded that the two GCACs were the binding sites of miR-430, a microRNA that suppresses translation, whereas the U-rich region was the binding site of Dnd, a protein that antagonizes the miR-430-mediated silencing of mRNA.",

However, information on AMPK genes in aquatic animals is limited. In this study, three subunits of AMPK were cloned from the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The full-length cDNAs of the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits were 1617, 1243 and 3467\u00a0bp long, respectively, with open reading frames of 1566, 873 and 2988\u00a0bp encoding for 521, 290 and 996 amino acids, respectively. Amino acid sequence alignments of the three subunits showed that the functional domains in the L. vannamei proteins retained the highest similarity with those of other animals, at 89%, 58%, and 75%, respectively. The expression levels of the three subunits were higher in the muscle and gills than in the eyestalk and hepatopancreas. The mRNA levels of AMPK-\u03b1 and AMPK-\u03b2 were up-regulated in the hepatopancreas and muscle after acute low-salinity stress at 3\u00a0psu for 6\u00a0h compared with control salinity at 20\u00a0psu. After 8-week salinity stress at 3\u00a0psu, AMPK-\u03b1 and AMPK-\u03b2 mRNA levels in the hepatopancreas were significantly higher than those of the control at 30\u00a0psu. However, in the muscle only AMPK-\u03b3 mRNA was significantly up-regulated at low salinity relative to controls. Muscle and hepatopancreas showed increases in AMPK protein after 6\u00a0h exposure to low salinity, but there were no differences seen after long term acclimation. The change patterns of protein were slightly differing from the mRNA patterns due to the distinguishing function of individual subunits of AMPK. These findings confirm that three AMPK subunits are present in L. vannamei and that all encode proteins with conserved functional domains. The three AMPK subunits are all regulated at the transcriptional and protein levels to manage excess energy expenditure during salinity stress.",

Methionine is an essential amino acid for rainbow trout, and works as a signalling factor in different metabolic pathways. The study investigated the effect of increasing dietary methionine intake on the intermediary metabolism in the liver of juvenile rainbow trout. For this purpose, five diets were formulated with increasing methionine levels from 0.60 to 1.29% dry matter. The diets were fed in excess for six weeks before three sampling campaigns carried out successively to elucidate (i) the hepatic expression of selected genes involved in lipid, glucose and amino acid metabolism; (ii) the postprandial ammonia excretion; and (iii) the postprandial plasma methionine concentrations. The transcript levels of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 a), gluconeogenesis (fructose-1,6-biphosphatase) and amino acid catabolism (alanine amino transferase and glutamate dehydrogenase) were significantly affected by the increase in dietary methionine. Changes in gene expression reflected to some extent the decrease in ammonia excretion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and in the hepatosomatic index (HSI; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when dietary methionine increased. Postprandial plasma methionine concentrations correlated positively with the dietary level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at the different sampling points. The study shows that the expression of several genes related to the hepatic intermediary metabolism in rainbow trout responded in a dose-dependent manner to increasing levels of dietary methionine.",

The combining results that granulocytes and plasmatocytes could phagocytize bacteria from 2 to 48\u00a0h and granulocytes, plasmatocytes and oenocytoids were prophenoloxidase/phenoloxidase positive hemocytes indicated that granulocytes, plasmatocytes and oenocytoids were the main immunocompetent hemocytes in O. nipae pupae. Parasitism by T. brontispae resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of hemocytes viability and spreading at 96\u00a0h, growing percentage of granulocytes at 24\u00a0h but no effects on the total hemocyte counts, and an enhanced phenoloxidase activity only at 12 and 72\u00a0h while a significantly longer melanization time of the hemolymph at 96\u00a0h following parasitism.

Three enzymes are known to participate in TAGs hydrolysis, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoglyceride lipase (MGL), and each is present in mammals as only one isoform. Here we show that the genome of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and other teleosts codes for one ATGL, two HSLs, and one MGL isoforms. Two isoforms of HSL gene, HSLa and HSLb, derived from paralogous genes that could be originated from teleost-specific genome duplication (TSGD) event. The genes encoding for fish ATGL and MGL were conserved and contained nine and seven coding exons, respectively. However, two isoforms of HSL gene had a remarkable variation in gene structure, such as HSLa gene contained ten and HSLb contained thirteen exons. All three enzymes, including two isoforms of HSL, were expressed in a wide range of tissues, but the abundance of each gene mRNA showed the tissue-dependent expression patterns. During fasting, only ATGL and HSLa showed a significant increase in adipose tissue and adipocyte, indicating that ATGL and HSLa may be the main rate-limiting enzymes controlling the hydrolysis of TAGs in fasting-induced lipolysis. Different expression of HSLa and HSLb suggests that they might serve different roles in fasting-induced lipolysis. These results provide evidence about the conservation and divergence of genes of fish lipolytic enzymes.",

The diet for animals in the experimental group was supplemented with 3% dietary tannic acid for 5\u00a0weeks. The control group received a commercial lab chow. No significant differences were detected in body weight, organ (heart, kidney, and liver) weights, and organ parameters between animals from two groups. However, voles in the experimental group had significantly higher daily food intake, increased contents of proline and histidine in saliva and feces after protein hydrolysis, and elevated hepatic expression of transferrin than the control. Our results suggested the existence of adaptive strategies developed in Brandt's voles to overcome the adverse effects of dietary tannic acid. (1) Food consumption was increased to satisfy their nutritional demands. (2) The secretion of tannic-acid-binding salivary proteins was promoted. (3) The absorption of iron was enhanced. These alterations contributed to neutralize the negative effects of tannic acid and maintain body mass in animals supplemented with tannic acid. As the result of the consumption of tannic acid, hepatic expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was significantly decreased, while the overall potential of the antioxidant system, characterized by increased hepatic enzymatic activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase, was enhanced. Our results also implied the involvement of tannic acid in the regulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress in voles.",

     "abstract": "The role of the main ion transporting enzyme Na\u00a0+/K\u00a0+-ATPase in osmoregulation processes was investigated in Litopenaeus stylirostris. The development and localization of the osmoregulation sites were studied during ontogenesis by immunodetection of Na+\u00a0K+-ATPase using monoclonal antibodies and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Osmoregulation sites were identified as the pleurae and branchiostegites in the zoeae and mysis stages. In the subsequent post-metamorphic stages the osmoregulatory function was mainly located in the epipodites and branchiostegites and osmotic regulation was later detected in the gills. The presence of ionocytes and microvilli in these tissues confirmed their role in ionic processes. The complete open reading frame of the mRNA coding for the \u03b1-subunit of Na\u00a0+\u00a0K\u00a0+-ATPase was characterized in L. stylirostris. The resulting 3092-bp cDNA (LsNKA) encodes a putative 1011-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 112.3\u00a0kDa. The inferred amino acid sequence revealed that the putative protein possesses the main structural characteristics of the Na\u00a0+\u00a0K\u00a0+-ATPase \u03b1-subunits.Quantitative RT-PCR analyses indicated that LsNKA transcripts did not significantly vary between the different developmental stages. The number of transcripts was about 2.5-fold higher in the epipodites and gills than in any other tissues tested in juveniles. A reverse genetic approach was finally implemented to study the role of LsNKA in vivo. Knockdown of LsNKA expression by gene-specific dsRNA injection led to an increase of shrimp mortality following an abrupt salinity change compared to control animals. These data strongly suggest that LsNKA plays an important role in osmoregulation when the shrimp are challenged by changing salinities.",

     "abstract": "Bears undergo annual cycles in body mass: rapid fattening in autumn (i.e., hyperphagia), and mass loss in winter (i.e., hibernation). To investigate how Japanese black bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus) adapt to such extreme physiological conditions, we analyzed changes in the mRNA expression of energy metabolism-related genes in white adipose tissues and skeletal muscle throughout three physiological stages: normal activity (June), hyperphagia (November), and hibernation (March). During hyperphagia, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the upregulation of de novo lipogenesis-related genes (e.g., fatty acid synthase and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2) in white adipose tissue, although the bears had been maintained with a constant amount of food. In contrast, during the hibernation period, we observed a downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis (e.g., glucose transporter 4) and lipogenesis (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1) and an upregulation of genes in fatty acid catabolism (e.g., carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) in both tissue types. In white adipose tissues, we observed upregulation of genes involved in glyceroneogenesis, including pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, suggesting that white adipose tissue plays a role in the recycling of circulating free fatty acids via re-esterification. In addition, the downregulation of genes involved in amino acid catabolism (e.g., alanine aminotransferase) and the TCA cycle (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase) indicated a role of skeletal muscle in muscle protein sparing and pyruvate recycling via the Cori cycle. These examples of coordinated transcriptional regulation would contribute to rapid mass gain during the pre-hibernation period and to energy preservation and efficient energy production during the hibernation period.",

In this study, HIFs-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), -1\u03b2 (HIF-1\u03b2) and HIF 1-alpha inhibitor (FIH-1) from M. nipponense were cloned.

MnHIF-1 and MnFIH-1 homologs exhibit significant sequence similarity and share key functional domains with previously described vertebrate and invertebrate isoforms. Phylogenetic analysis identifies that genetic diversification of HIF-1 and FIH-1 occurred within the invertebrate lineage, indicating functional specialization of the oxygen sensing pathways in this group. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that MnHIF-1 and MnFIH-1 mRNA are expressed in different tissues and exhibit transcriptional responses to severe hypoxia in gill and muscle tissue, consistent with their putative role in oxygen sensing and the adaptive response to hypoxia. The role of HIF-1\u03b1 in response to hypoxia was further investigated in the gills and muscles of prawns using in situ hybridization.

In this study, we identified 55 phosphorylated proteins in Apostichopus japonicus coelomocytes by iTRAQ analysis, and sixteen proteins displayed differently expressed profiles between thermal stressed and control groups. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade was further characterized by Western blot. Spatial expression analysis revealed that phospho-p44/42MAPK levels were mainly detected in coelomocytes and muscle, and no signal in intestine and respiratory trees, although the protein were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues. Time-course expression analysis shown that the amount of phospho-p44/42MAPK decreased by 57\u201360% in coelomocytes and 29\u201340% in muscle in acute exposure stage of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively.

Similarly, 2.5-fold and 2.7-fold increases were detected in muscle at corresponding exposure temperature. In contrast, the p44/42MAPK in muscle showed depressed expression profiles. As time progressed, phospho-p44/42MAPK levels were all decreased significantly both in coelomocytes and in muscles. A reduction in phosphorylation levels was detected at 84\u00a0h in 20\u00a0\u00b0C exposed coelomocytes with 0.42-fold decrease, and at 36\u00a0h in 25\u00a0\u00b0C challenged muscle by 0.80-fold decrease.

We compared the effects of acute and chronic ingestion of soybean peptidase inhibitors (SPIs) on Spodoptera frugiperda and Diatraea saccharalis, two Lepidoptera species with different sensitivities to SPI ingestion. We analyzed the trypsin and chymotrypsin gene expression profiles in both species. Acute exposure of S. frugiperda to the inhibitors activated seven genes (SfChy5, SfChy9, SfChy19, SfChy22, SfTry6, SfTry8, and SfTry10), whereas chronic exposure activated 16 genes (SfChy2, SfChy4, SfChy5, SfChy8, SfChy9, SfChy11, SfChy12, SfChy15, SfChy17, SfChy21, SfChy22, SfTry6, SfTry8, SfTry9, SfTry10, and SfTry12). By contrast, the challenge of D. saccharalis with SPIs did not differentially induce the expression of trypsin- or chymotrypsin-encoding genes, with the exception of DsChy7. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of S. frugiperda trypsin protein sequences revealed two gene clades: one composed of genes responsive to the SPIs and a second composed of the unresponsive genes. D. saccharalis trypsin proteins were clustered nearest to the S. frugiperda unresponsive genes. Overall, our findings support a hypothesized mechanism of resistance of Noctuidae moths to SPIs, involving gene number expansion of trypsin and chymotrypsin families and regulation of gene expression, which could also explain the variable susceptibility between S. frugiperda and D. saccharalis to these plant inhibitors.",

In this study we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding an AhR homologue (designated CfAhR, Accession number: FJ588640) from scallop Chlamys farreri. The CfAhR sequence was constituted by an open reading frame (ORF) of 2466\u00a0bp encoding 821 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight was 93.0\u00a0kDa. The CfAhR showed a high conservation of the residues and domains essential to the function of AhR, including basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) and Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that it was clustered within the invertebrate AhR branch. CfAhR expression was detected in gill, digestive gland, ovary, spermary, mantle and adductor, and the highest transcription level was observed in gill. Recombinant plasmid CfAhR-pET32a (designated rCfAhR) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21.

Sequence analyses showed that the spexin gene structure is composed of six exons and five introns, and the amino acids of mature peptide (spexin-14) in grouper are identical to that of other fish. Tissue expression analysis found that grouper spexin is highly expressed in the brain, liver and ovary. Real time-PCR analysis demonstrated that the hypothalamic expression of spexin declined gradually during the ovarian development, and was up-regulated by food deprivation. Intraperitoneal administration of spexin-14 peptides to grouper significantly elevated the mRNA levels of proopiomelanocortin (pomc) and suppressed the orexin expression in the hypothalamus, but could not change the hypothalamic expression of gonadotropin releasing hormone 1 (gnrh1). Both in vivo and in vitro administration of spexin could not significantly influence the expression of follicle-stimulating hormone \u03b2 (fsh\u03b2) and luteinizing hormone \u03b2 (lh\u03b2) in the pituitary with the exception of an inhibition of gh expression.

At present, although the biomineralization mechanism in pearl oyster (Pinctada fucata) has been extensively studied, there is little research on the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster. To understand the potential role of the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster, we cloned and sequenced three genes from the Wnt signaling pathway in pearl oyster that encode the following proteins: \u03b2-catenin, Dishevelled (Dvl) and T-cell factor (TCF). Genomic structure analysis revealed that Pf-\u03b2-catenin genomic DNA contained 15 exons, Pf-Dvl genomic DNA contained 16 exons, and Pf-TCF genomic DNA contained 7 exons. Their deduced amino acid sequences all showed the highest identity with homologs in Crassostrea gigas. Yeast two-hybrid analysis verified that Pf-\u03b2-catenin interacted with Pf-TCF. These three genes were ubiquitously expressed in seven pearl oyster tissues analyzed with the highest expression in the gill and a certain amount of expression in the mantle, a tissue related to shell formation. After shell notching, the dynamic changes in expression of these three genes showed that they reached a maximum at 4\u00a0days, indicating their response to shell regeneration. All three genes were constitutively expressed during five developmental stages of the pearl oyster, with high levels at the early embryonic development stage. Taken together, these results suggested that Pf-\u03b2-catenin, Pf-Dvl and Pf-TCF might participate in shell formation and early embryonic and larval development in the pearl oyster.",

We evaluated three different anthocyanidin concentrations (1\u00a0\u00d7, 2.5\u00a0\u00d7 and 10\u00a0\u00d7) at two sampling times (24 and 36\u00a0h). To test for treatment effects, we analyzed the expression of myoD and pax7 as well as two target genes of the Notch signaling pathway, hey2 and her6. In induced myogenic cells, the lowest and middle anthocyanidin doses caused significantly greater expression of myoD after 24\u00a0h of treatment compared to control. A significantly higher expression of pax7 in cells exposed to either anthocyanidin treatment during 36\u00a0h compared was observed. Similarly, the pax7/myoD ratio was significantly lower in cells exposed to the lowest anthocyanidin doses during 24\u00a0h compared to control. No significant effect of anthocyanidin treatments on the expression of hey2 and her6 at either sampling point was detected. In non-induced cells, we observed no effect of anthocyanidins on myoD expression and significant down-regulation on pax7 expression in cells exposed to either anthocyanidin mixture concentrations after 24 and 36\u00a0h of treatment compared to control. Further, the pax7/myoD ratio was significantly lower in cells exposed to either anthocyanidin doses at both sampling time. In non-induced cells, the highest anthocyanidin dose provoked significantly greater expression of hey2 after 24\u00a0h of treatment compared to control. We detected no such effect in non-induced cells exposed to the lowest and middle anthocyanidin doses during 24\u00a0h of treatment. The expression of her6 was unaffected by anthocyanidin treatments at either sampling time or doses compared to control. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that anthocyanidins modulate specific components of the myogenic programming in fish, thereby potentially affecting somatic growth in fish fed plant-derived extracts rich in this type of polyphenols. Moreover, in early differentiating myogenic cells, the anthocyanidin effect on myogenic programming appears to differ based upon the exposure time and the differentiation stage of the myogenic cells by boosting myogenic differentiation signaling after 24\u00a0h treatment while pausing differentiation, potentially favoring cell survival after 36\u00a0h treatment. Further research to determine whether plant-derived secondary metabolites including alkaloids, terpenoids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, flavonoids, phenolics, steroids and essential oils can modulate myogenic programming in myogenic cells isolated from finfish species is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Elevated temperatures considerably challenge aquatic invertebrates, and enhanced energy metabolism and protein turnover require adjustments of digestion. In Daphnia, the serine proteases chymotrypsin and trypsin represent the major proteolytic enzymes. Daphnia pulex acclimated to different temperature conditions or subjected to acute heat stress showed increased expression level of serine proteases with rising temperatures. Transcripts of trypsin isoforms were always present in higher amounts than observed for chymotrypsin. Additionally, trypsin isoform transcripts were induced by elevated temperatures to a larger extent. Correspondingly, trypsin activity dominated in cold-acclimated animals. However, the enzymatic activity of chymotrypsin increased at elevated temperatures, whereas trypsin activity slightly decreased, resulting in a shift to dominating chymotrypsin activity in warm-acclimated animals.Zymograms revealed eight bands with proteolytic activity in the range of 20 to 86\u00a0kDa. The single bands were assigned to trypsin or chymotrypsin activity applying specific inhibitors or from casein cleavage products identified by mass spectrometric analysis. The total amount of proteolytic activity was elevated with acclimation temperature increase and showed a transient decrease under acute heat stress. The contribution of the different isoforms to protein digestion indicated induction of chymotrypsin with increasing acclimation temperature. For trypsin, the share of one isoform decreased with elevated temperature, while another isoform was enhanced. Thus differential expression of serine proteases was observed in response to chronic and acute temperature changes.The observed phenotypic plasticity adjusts the set of active proteases to the altered needs of protein metabolism optimizing protein digestion for the temperature conditions experienced in the habitat.",

In this study, the full-length cDNA sequences of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were cloned from Chinese perch, and their molecular structure and expression profile in response to nutrition supply and in vivo IGF treatments were also analyzed. The cDNA sequence of Smyd1a and Smyd1b consists of 1862 and 1802 base pairs (bp), encoding 479 and 476 amino acids, respectively. The SET domains of the two proteins were split into two segments by the MYND domain.

The two genes apparently exhibited temporal and spatial differential expression status. In adults, the two genes showed the higher expression level in the muscle and heart than in other testing tissues.

The mRNA levels of Smyd1a and Smyd1b were sharply up-regulated within one day after refeeding in the Chinese perch juveniles following fasting for a week. Moreover, IGF-1 treatments in vivo significantly stimulated their expression in the skeletal muscle. Together, these data provide us with further understanding of the molecular characterization and expression regulation of the two genes upon internal and external stimuli.",

     "abstract": "Fat accumulation in the liver is a natural process in goose, which prepares goose for long-distance migration. In contrast to mammalian fatty liver that usually progresses into an irreversible status, steatohepatitis, goose fatty liver can return to normal without obvious pathological damage, suggesting a protective system exists in goose liver. This study was to identify the components of this system. We first focused on goose adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 (Adipor1/2) as they have ceramidase activity, and can cleave ceramide, a group of proinflammatory signaling lipid species. Quantitative analysis indicated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf\u03b1), a key proinflammatory cytokine, was down-regulated in goose fatty liver by overfeeding. This inhibition of Tnf\u03b1 was accompanied with reduced adiponectin and increased Adipor1/2 in the adipose tissues and in the livers of the overfed geese, respectively. To investigate the regulation of goose Adipor2 in the context of fatty liver, we treated goose primary hepatocytes with fatty liver associated factors. Data indicated that Adipor2 was upregulated by glucose and oleate but not palmitate. Its expression was even suppressed by high level of insulin. The regulation of Adipor1 by these factors was quite similar to that of Adipor2 except that glucose did not induce Adipor1. Together, these findings suggest the upregulation of Adipor1/2 may, at least partially, contribute to the inhibition of inflammation in goose fatty liver, and the expression of Adipor1/2 can be regulated by fatty liver-associated factors.",

     "abstract": "Polyamines are a family of low molecular weight organic cations produced in part by the coordinated actions of arginase II (Arg II) and ornithine decarboxylase (Odc). Although gill polyamine homeostasis is affected by acute transfer to fresh water, little is known of its function in fish osmoregulation. The current study investigated the role of polyamines in the compensatory response of hypoosmotic challenge in the euryhaline fish, Fundulus grandis. Adult F. grandis were acclimated to 5\u00a0ppt water, transferred abruptly to 5, 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.1\u00a0ppt water, and assessed for osmoregulatory function, gill morphology, and polyamine homeostasis. The plasma osmolality, Na+ concentration, and Cl\u2212 concentration were only significantly reduced during exposure to salinities at or below 0.5\u00a0ppt, although these effects were transient except in the 0.1\u00a0ppt treatment. The phenotype of mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) shifted from a seawater-type to a freshwater-type only at salinities that also produced a plasma osmotic disturbance. Hypoosmotic exposure increased the concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in the gill over the entire 7\u00a0day period. Exposure to 0.1\u00a0ppt water also transiently increased gill caspase-3 activity and gill mRNA levels of the immediate-early response genes, c-fos and c-myc, thus tightly associating polyamines with gill remodeling during freshwater acclimation. Furthermore, arginase II and ornithine decarboxylase mRNA levels were most highly expressed in MRCs, and these levels were further increased only in the 0.1\u00a0ppt treatment. Reduction of gill polyamine levels following administration of the Odc inhibitor, alpha-dl-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), inhibited gill caspase-3 activity, but surprisingly reduced the magnitude of the plasma osmotic imbalance elicited by exposure to 0.1\u00a0ppt water. We used isolated opercular epithelia mounted on Ussing chambers to assess the influence of polyamines on the attenuating response of hypotonic shock on active Cl\u2212 secretion. Spermidine partially reduced the decrease of short-circuit current (Isc) and membrane conductance (Gt) produced by hypotonic exposure. These data suggest polyamines blunt the hypotonic inhibition of NaCl secretion and may lead to early apoptosis of seawater ionocytes and their replacement by FW-type ionocytes.",

Both of insra and insrb in grass carp showed high amino acid identities with other fish. Insra and insrb genes were widely expressed in all tested tissues with an overlapping but distinct expressions. The high levels of insra mRNA were distributed in hindgut and heart tissues. The insrb gene showed the highest expression levels in liver and hindgut. We also proved that two forms of grass carp insulin receptors participate in the regulation of blood glucose and might act differently. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that different isoforms of fish insulin receptors are derived from two distinct genes, which was inconsistent with the generation of mammalian insulin receptors. Synteny analyses of insulin receptor genes showed that genes surrounding the insulin receptor genes were conserved in fish.

Spectrofluorimetric analysis further confirmed riboflavin release from the hexamerin fraction. Quantitative RT-PCR studies demonstrated hormonal regulation of RbHex 82. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20HE) had a stimulatory effect on its transcription whereas JH alone did not show any effect. However, JH in the presence of 20HE maintains the RbHex 82 expression which indicates the JH's role as a status quo factor. This study is the first to report the characterization of riboflavin-binding hexamerin in a lepidopteran pest. Further, the possibility of RbHex 82 as a pest control target is discussed.",

The current study examined which region of flatfish (Paralichthys olivaceus) MSTN-1 propeptide (MSTN1pro) is critical for MSTN inhibition. Six different truncated forms of MSTN1pro containing N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) as a fusion partner were expressed in Escherichia coli, and partially purified by an affinity chromatography for MSTN-inhibitory activity examination. Peptides covering different regions of flatfish MSTN1pro were also synthesized for MSTN-inhibitory activity examination. A MBP-fused MSTN1pro region consisting of residues 45\u2013100 had the same MSTN-inhibitory potency as the full sequence flatfish MSTN1pro (residues 23\u2013265), indicating that the region of flatfish MSTN1pro consisting of residues 45\u2013100 is sufficient to maintain the full MSTN-inhibitory capacity. A MBP-fused MSTN1pro region consisting of residues 45\u201380 (Pro45\u201380) also showed MSTN-inhibitory activity with a lower potency, and the Pro45\u201380 demonstrated its MSTN binding capacity in a pull-down assay, indicating that the MSTN-inhibitory capacity of Pro45\u201380 is due to its binding to MSTN. Flatfish MSTN1pro synthetic peptides covering residues 45\u201365, 45\u201370, and 45\u201380 demonstrated MSTN-inhibitory activities, but not the synthetic peptide covering residues 45\u201354, indicating that residues 45\u201365 of flatfish MSTN1pro are essential for MSTN inhibition.

Label free quantitative mass spectrometry verified the presence of the three sea bass Vtgs or their product yolk proteins (YPs) in liver, plasma and ovary of postvitellogenic females. As evidenced by normalized spectral counts, VtgAb-derived protein was 2- to 5-fold more abundant, depending on sample type, than for VtgAa, while VtgC-derived protein was less abundant, albeit only 3-fold lower than for VtgAb in the ovary. Western blotting with Vtg type-specific antisera raised against corresponding gray mullet (Mugil cephalus) lipovitellins (Lvs) detected all three types of sea bass Vtg in the blood plasma of gravid females and/or estrogenized males and showed that all three forms of sea bass Lv undergo limited partial degradation during oocyte maturation. The comparatively high levels of VtgC-derived YPs in fully-grown oocytes and the maturational proteolysis of all three types of Lv differ from what has been reported for other teleosts spawning pelagic eggs in seawater but are similar to recent findings for two species of North American Moronidae, the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and white perch (Morone americana), which spawn pelagic and demersal eggs, respectively in fresh water. Together with the high Vtg sequence homologies and virtually identical structural features of each type of Vtg between species, these findings indicate that the moronid multiple Vtg systems do not substantially vary with reproductive environment.",

GATA4 is a highly conserved transcription factor that regulates embryonic morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. GATA4 in vertebrates regulates its target genes to influence genital ridge differentiation. In this study, the GATA4 from tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) was characterized to understand the function of this transcription factor in sex differentiation. The full-length cDNA of C. semilaevis GATA4 comprised 2031\u00a0bp, encoding a predicted polypeptide consisting of 402 amino acids with two conserved zinc finger domains. Phylogenetic, gene structure, and synteny analyses showed that C. semilaevis GATA4 was homologous to tetrapod GATA4. The mRNA transcript of C. semilaevis GATA4 exhibited high expression in the heart, liver, and gonad. GATA4 expression is dimorphic in the male and female gonads. Embryonic development expression profiles revealed the possible involvement of C. semilaevis GATA4 in morphogenesis. In situ hybridization results showed strong GATA4 signals in the spermatogonia and spermatocytes of the testis and in the oogonia, primary oocytes, and secondary oocytes of the ovary. The expression of C. semilaevis GATA4 in the male, pseudomale, and female gonads showed significantly different methylation levels of the two CpG sites (\u2212\u00a02738 and \u2212\u00a02647) among the three genders. Basing on these results, we speculated that GATA4 plays a potential role in sex differentiation. This study lays the groundwork for further sex control breeding techniques in C. semilaevis.",

     "abstract": "When integumentary tissue pigments are contained in chromatophores, tissue color might not depend exclusively on the amount of pigment. Whether coloration does or does not reflect pigment concentration may be very significant for intraspecific communication, for example when pigment concentration provides fitness-related information. We studied the pigment responsible for the orange/red ventral tail coloring in a lacertid lizard species (Acanthodactylus erythrurus), and whether the color was related to skin pigment concentration. The pigment was identified as a pterin, a higher concentration of which resulted in darker, more red-saturated, redder (less orange) ventral tail skin color. The dorsal tail integument, even though it appears mostly gray to the naked eye, also contained pterins, and furthermore, the dorsal and ventral pterin concentrations were positively correlated. A possible explanation for these results is that pterins accumulate in the skin of the whole tail, even if only needed in the ventral part, but are concealed in the dorsal part. In this way, ventral orange/red coloration would accurately reflect pterin concentration, which provides the basis for a signaling function, while dorsal coloration would become less conspicuous as an anti-predatory mechanism.",

Gene expression of most branchial ion transporters revealed temperature- and dose-dependent responses to elevated PCO2. Transcriptional regulation resulted in stable protein expression at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, whereas expression of most transport proteins increased at medium PCO2 and 18\u00a0\u00b0C. mRNA and protein expression of distinct ion transport proteins were closely co-regulated, substantiating cellular functional relationships. Na+/K+ ATPase capacities were PCO2 independent, but increased with acclimation temperature, whereas H+ ATPase capacities were thermally compensated but decreased at medium PCO2 and 10\u00a0\u00b0C. When functional capacities of branchial ATPases were compared with mitochondrial F1Fo ATP-synthase strong correlations of F1Fo ATP-synthase and ATPase capacities generally indicate close coordination of branchial aerobic ATP demand and supply.

In particular, we were interested whether whitefish bcl-2 3\u2032UTR contains an active target site for miR-34a. Using a computational approach followed by luciferase reporter assay, we confirmed the direct interaction of miR-34a with the whitefish bcl-2 3\u2032UTR. Therefore, we further investigated whether bcl-2 silencing via miR-34a occurs in liver samples of whitefish exposed for 48\u00a0h to microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a known hepatotoxin and tumor promoter. We noticed a statistically unsignificant up-regulation of miR-34a expression, which was accompanied by a marginally significant increase of bcl-2 mRNA level and the significant increase of bax (pro-apoptotic) mRNA level. However, we found no significant correlation between bcl-2 and miR-34a expression in vivo, which suggests that their involvement in hepatocyte cell responses to MC-LR in whitefish is still questionable.",

Ofserpin1 contains a putative signal peptide followed by a conserved domain including a reactive center loop (RCL) with a hinge region (E344 to S353) and a predicted P1\u2013P1\u2032 cleavage site (Leu360\u2013Ser361). Ofserpin1 mRNA and protein were detected in all the tested tissues, particularly in hemocytes and integument. The recombinant protein inhibited chymotrypsin and trypsin in a dose-dependent manner, and were significantly cleaved by the enzyme trypsin and chymotrypsin. Ofserpin1 impeded the prophenoloxidase activation cascade by 45.6% at 16.5\u00a0\u03bcg, and affected activity of prophenoloxidase activating protease. Levels of Ofserpin1 transcripts in the integument were higher than those in hemocytes, fat body and midgut. After an immune challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, the relative mRNA levels of Ofserpin1 decreased in 2\u201310\u00a0h post-infection (hpi) in integument and hemocytes compared to the untreated control. Our results suggested that Ofserpin1 has serine protease inhibitory activity and is likely involved in the regulation of prophenoloxidase activation system in O. furnacalis.",

     "abstract": "We cloned the full length cyp19a of Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus, determined its distribution in tissues and developing gonads, and analyzed the CpG methylation pattern of the cyp19a promoter. The results revealed isoforms of 1706\u00a0bp (G arom) and 1698\u00a0bp (B arom) in length, differing in the 5\u2032 flanking region, both encoding 502 amino acids. The G arom gene was observed mainly in the ovary and kidney, with little in other investigated tissues, while B arom expression was high in the brain, ovary, testis, and pituitary, with low or undetected expression in other examined tissues. Total aromatase expression was high in the ovary; moderate in the kidney, brain, testis, and pituitary; and low in the remaining tissues. G arom expression was significantly higher in the ovary than in the testis and gradually decreased with maturation of the salamander. A single injection of methyltestosterone or letrozole resulted in ovarian G arom expression decreasing over a 12\u201396\u00a0h period. A 1366\u00a0bp sequence of the cyp19a promoter was cloned and shown to be conserved in selected species. CpG methylation level was negatively correlated with cyp19a expression in the examined tissues and developing ovaries. Five and three CpG methylation sites positively correlated with DNA methylation levels in tissues and developing ovary, suggesting that they play an important role in regulating cyp19a expression. The aromatase gene showed two isoforms with distinct expression patterns, and the promoter methylation level at specific CpG sites was associated with variation in expression profiles of tissues and developing ovaries.",

Previous studies indicate that mitochondrial mass loss and dysfunction are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in human and mouse. However, it is unclear whether mitochondrial genes are involved in the development of goose fatty liver. To address this, we determined the response of goose mitochondrial genes to overfeeding and other fatty liver-related factors (e.g., hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia). We first employed RNA-seq technology to determine the differentially expressed genes in the livers from normally-fed vs. overfed geese, followed by bioinformatics analysis and quantitative PCR validation. Data indicated that a majority of mitochondrial genes in the liver were induced by overfeeding. To understand how these genes are regulated in the context of fatty liver, we treated goose primary hepatocytes with high levels of glucose, fatty acids and insulin. The results indicated that these factors had an influence on the expression of some mitochondria related genes. Together, these findings suggest that the induction of mitochondrial gene expression by overfeeding is required for the development of goose fatty liver, and this induction is partially attributable to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia.",

Structural and transcriptional analyses revealed homology with two vitellogenin-like proteins, Tik-Vg1 and Tik-Vg2, which were 1855 and 1795 amino acids in length, respectively, along with a third protein, Tik-MEP, which produced a 1517-residue protein with similarity to a melanin engaging protein (MEP) in insects Phylogenetic analysis showed that Vgs in Maxillopods including two Tik-Vgs belong to the arthropod vitellogenin-like clade, which includes clottable proteins (CPs) in decapod crustaceans and vitellogenins in insects. Tik-MEP clustered together with insect MEPs, which appear to have evolved before the apoB-like and arthropod Vg-like clades. Interestingly, no genes orthologous to those found in the apoB clade were identified in Maxillopoda, suggesting that functions of large lipid transfer proteins (LLTPs) in reproduction and lipid metabolism may be different from those in insect and decapod crustaceans. As suggested by phylogenetic analyses, the two Tik-Vgs belonging to the arthropod Vg-like clade appear to play major roles in oocyte maturation, while Vgs belonging to the apoB clade function primarily in the reproduction of decapod crustaceans. Transcriptional analysis of Tik-Vg expression revealed a 24-fold increase in mature and ovigerous females compared with immature female, whereas expression of Tik-MEP remained low through all reproductive stages. Acute temperature changes did not affect the transcription of Tik-Vg genes, whereas Tik-MEP appeared to be affected by temperature change. Among the three hormones thought to be involved in molting and reproduction in arthropods, only farnesoic acid (FA) induced transcription of the two Tik-Vg genes. Regardless of developmental stage and hormone treatment, Tik-Vg1 and Tik-Vg2 exhibited a strong positive correlation in expression, suggesting that expression of these genes may be regulated by the same transcriptional machinery.",

Molecular evolutionary analyses show that vertebrate pepsinogens are classified into seven monophyletic groups, i.e. pepsinogens A, F, Y (prochymosins), C, B, and fish pepsinogens A and C. Regarding the primary structures, extensive deletion was obvious in S\u20321 loop residues in fish pepsin A as well as tetrapod pepsin Y. This deletion resulted in a decrease in hydrophobic residues in the S\u20321 site. Hydrolytic specificities of bass pepsins A1 and A2 were investigated with a pepsin substrate and its variants. Bass pepsins preferred both hydrophobic/aromatic residues and charged residues at the P\u20321 sites of substrates, showing the dual character of S\u20321 sites. Thermodynamic analyses of bass pepsin A2 showed that its activation Gibbs energy change (\u2206G\u2021) was lower than that of porcine pepsin A. Several sites of bass pepsin A2 moiety were found to be under positive selection, and most of them are located on the surface of the molecule, where they are involved in conformational flexibility. The broad S\u20321 specificity and flexible structure of bass pepsin A2 are thought to cause its high proteolytic activity.",

However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved have remained unclear. Here, we examined the regulation of spatio-temporal expression patterns of myhz1 (myhz1.1, myhz1.2 and myhz1.3) and myhz2 during their development by using transient gene and stable transgenic techniques. Embryos microinjected with different length 5\u2019-flanking sequences of myhz1 conjugated with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene showed EGFP expression in the anterior and medial subsections of somites, but not in the tail somite region. In contrast, embryos microinjected with different length 5\u2019-flanking sequences of myhz2 showed EGFP expression exclusively at the posterior tail somite domain. Promoter deletion analyses demonstrated that reduced EGFP fluorescence typically is correlated with smaller 5\u2019-flanking sequences. The immunohistochemical observation revealed that zebrafish larvae provided with the transient gene and those from stable transgenic lines consistently expressed EGFP in the fast muscle fibers. r-VISTA plot identified one common conserved region of about 140\u00a0\u00b0bp among myhz1.1, myhz1.2 and myhz1.3. Deletion of this conserved region from the 5\u2019-flanking sequence of each myhz1 markedly reduced EGFP expression in its unique spatial somite region. Deletion mutation analysis demonstrated that myhz2 expression in the tail somite region might be mediated by Tbx (family\u00a0of\u00a0transcription\u00a0factors\u00a0having\u00a0a\u00a0common\u00a0DNA-binding\u00a0sequence\u00a0known as\u00a0T-box) binding elements.

The expression of lxr\u03b11 was the highest in testis, then in liver, and the lowest in other tissues. lxr\u03b12 expression was the highest in liver, then in testis, and the lowest in ovary.

This cDNA obtained covered 2499\u00a0bp with an open reading frame of 2181\u00a0bp encoding 726 amino acids. This CPT I mRNA predominantly expressed in heart and white muscle, while little in eye and spleen.

In order to investigate the characterization of CPT IA mRNA expression, post-prandial experiment and feeding trial were conducted. The results showed that CPT IA mRNA expression was unchanged from 2 to 12\u00a0h, and then significantly increased at 24\u00a0h post-feeding in liver and heart. Berberine, an alkaloid, was identified as a promising lipid-lowering drug. In order to elucidate the effect of berberine on CPT I expression, fish were fed for 8 weeks with three diets (low-fat diet (LFD, 5% fat), high-fat diet (HFD, 15% fat), and berberine-supplemented diet (BSD, 15% fat).

Cloning a partial PACAP cDNA, we demonstrated for the first time in elasmobranches that PACAP shows a highly conserved sequence, compared with the PACAP of other chordates (tunicates and vertebrates). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that PACAP has been well preserved during evolution and that a negative selection acts on PACAP sequence, leading to the conservation of the coding sites. The phylogenetic consensus tree showed also that Torpedo PACAP is more related with the amphibian PACAP than with the teleost one.Finally, we demonstrated that in T. marmorata PACAP and its PAC1 receptor are synthesized directly in the testis, where they show a wider localization than mammals, suggesting that this neuropeptide is involved in the control of Torpedo spermatogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Bats exhibit higher paracellular absorption of glucose-sized molecules than non-flying mammals, a phenomenon that may be driven by higher permeability of the intestinal tight junctions. The various claudins, occludin, and other proteins making up the tight junctions are thought to determine their permeability properties. Here we show that absorption of the paracellular probe l-arabinose is higher in a bat (Eptesicus fuscus) than in a vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) or a hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). Furthermore, histological measurements demonstrated that hedgehogs have many more enterocytes in their intestines, suggesting that bats cannot have higher absorption of arabinose simply by having more tight junctions. We therefore investigated the mRNA levels of several claudins and occludin, because these proteins may affect permeability of tight junctions to macronutrients. To assess the expression levels of claudins per tight junction, we normalized the mRNA levels of the claudins to the constitutively expressed tight junction protein ZO-1, and combined these with measurements previously made in a bat and a rodent to determine if there were among-species differences. Although expression ratios of several genes varied among species, there was not a consistent difference between bats and non-flyers in the expression ratio of any particular gene. Protein expression patterns may differ from mRNA expression patterns, and might better explain differences among species in arabinose absorption.",

The molecular mechanism of leptin-induced regulation of GH gene transcription is unclear. The current study investigated the effects of leptin on the chicken GH (cGH) promoter and the molecular mechanism underlying leptin-induced cGH gene expression in vitro. Leptin activated the cGH promoter in the presence of chPit-1\u03b1 in CHO cells stably expressing the chicken leptin receptor. Promoter activation did not require STAT-binding elements in the cGH promoter or STAT3 activity. However, JAK2 activation was required for leptin-dependent activity. JAK2-dependent pathways include p42/44 MAPK and PI3K, and inhibition of these pathways partially blocked leptin-induced cGH gene transcription. Although CK2 directly activates JAK2, a CK2 inhibitor blocked leptin-dependent activation of the cGH gene without affecting JAK2 phosphorylation. The CK2 inhibitor suppressed Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. Additional data implicate Src family kinases in leptin-dependent cGH gene activation. These results suggest that leptin activates the cGH gene in the presence of chPit-1\u03b1 via several leptin-activated kinases. Although further study is required, we suggest that the leptin-induced JAK2/p42/44 MAPK and JAK2/PI3K cascades are activated by Src-meditated CK2, leading to CBP phosphorylation and interaction with chPit-1\u03b1, resulting in transactivation of the cGH promoter.",

Expression of all enzyme precursors was detected before the mouth opening. Expression of try and ctrb increased during the first days of development and then maintained high values with some fluctuations during the whole larval stage. The prolipases pla2 and cel1b increased from first-feeding with irregular fluctuation until the end of the experiment. Contrarily, cel1a maintained low expression values during most of the larval stage increasing at the end of the period. Nevertheless, cel1a expression was negligible as compared with cel1b.

The physical state of mussel gills and swine heart was investigated by Laurdan steady state fluorescence. Quite surprisingly, the similar temperature dependence of the F1FO complex, illustrated as Arrhenius plot which in both mitochondria exhibits the same discontinuity at approximately 21\u00a0\u00b0C and overlapping activation energies above and below the discontinuity, is apparently compatible with a different composition and physical state of mitochondrial membranes. Accordingly, mussel membranes contain highly unsaturated fatty acids, abundant sterols, including phytosterols, while mammalian membranes only contain cholesterol and in prevalence shorter and less unsaturated fatty acids, leading to a lower membrane unsaturation with respect to mussel mitochondria. As suggested by fluorescence data, the likely formation of peculiar microdomains interacting with the membrane-bound enzyme complex in mussel mitochondria could produce an environment which somehow approaches the physical state of mammalian mitochondrial membranes. Thus, as an adaptive strategy, the interaction between sterols, highly unsaturated phospholipids and proteins in mussel gill mitochondria could allow the F1FO\u2013ATPase activity to maintain the same activation energy as the mammalian enzyme.",

Interestingly, fish prepro-NMS is predicted to generate a short 34-residue peptide, designated as NMS-related peptide (NMSRP).

Zebrafish NMS mRNA was detected by RT-PCR revealing a tissue-specific distribution with high levels of expression in the brain, spleen, ovary, pituitary, and muscle. Furthermore, the locations of NMS-expressing cells in the zebrafish brain were detected by in situ hybridization in the parvocellular preoptic nucleus (PPa), the ventral zone of the periventricular hypothalamus (Hv), and lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LH). The levels of NMS mRNA in the hypothalamus were significantly increased after three days of food deprivation. Administration of zebrafish NMSRP by intraperitoneal injection significantly promoted the expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin, suggesting an orexigenic role for NMSRP in zebrafish.

Sequence analysis revealed conserved structural features including the common 33-codon block and nine repeated motifs. Gene structure analysis identified four exons and three introns except for apoA-IVAa1 (with only 3 exons). Synteny analysis showed that the four paralogs were structured into two clusters (cluster A containing apoA-IVAa1 and apoA-IVAa2 and cluster B with apoA-IVBa3 and apoA-IVBa4) linked to an apolipoprotein E. Phylogenetic analysis clearly separated the paralogs according to their cluster organization as well as revealed four subclades highly conserved in Acanthopterygii. Whole-mount analyses (WISH) in early larvae (0 and 1\u00a0day post-hatch (dph)) showed that the four paralogs were mainly expressed in yolk syncytial layer surrounding the oil globules. Later, at 3 and 5\u00a0dph, the four paralogs were mainly expressed in liver and intestine although with differences in their relative abundance and temporal expression patterns. Diet supply triggered the intensity of WISH signals in the intestine of the four paralogs. Quantification of mRNA abundance by qPCR using whole larvae only detected the induction by diet at 5\u00a0dph. Moreover, transcript levels increased progressively with age except for apoA-IVAa2, which appeared as a low-expressed isoform.

     "abstract": "Acute heat challenge is known to induce cell-level oxidative stress in fishes. Mitochondria are well known for the capacity to make reactive oxygen species (ROS) and as such are often implicated as a source of the oxidants associated with this thermally-induced oxidative stress. This implication is often asserted, despite little direct data for mitochondrial ROS metabolism in fishes. Here we characterize mitochondrial ROS metabolism in three Actinopterygian fish species at two levels, the capacity for superoxide/H2O2 production and the antioxidant thiol-reductase enzyme activities. We find that red muscle mitochondria from all three species have measurable ROS production and respond to different assay conditions consistent with what might be anticipated; assuming similar relative contributions from difference ROS producing sites as found in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria. Although there are species and assay specific exceptions, fish mitochondria may have a greater capacity to produce ROS than that found in the rat when either normalized to respiratory capacity or determined at a common assay temperature. The interspecific differences in ROS production are not correlated with thiol-based antioxidant reductase activities. Moreover, mimicking an acute in vivo heat stress by comparing the impact of increasing assay temperature on these processes in vitro, we find evidence supporting a preferential activation of mitochondrial H2O2 production relative to the increase in the capacity of reductase enzymes to supply electrons to the mitochondrial matrix peroxidases. This supports the contention that mitochondria may be, at least in part, responsible for the ROS that lead to oxidative stress in fish tissues exposed to acute heat challenge.",

However, little is known about its ability to bioconvert polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from plant oils into long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). In this study, special attention has been given to the fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) which is commonly described to be a rate-limiting enzyme of the LC-PUFA biosynthesis. This work reports on the cloning, tissue expression and functional characterization of the Eurasian perch fads2, but also on the cloning of two alternative splicing transcripts named fads2-AS1 and fads2-AS2. The fads2 cDNA cloned is composed of an open reading frame (ORF) of 1338 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a protein of 445 amino acids. This deduced amino acid sequence displays the typical structure of microsomal FADS2 including two transmembrane domains and an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain with the \u201cHPGG\u201d motif. Quantitative real-time PCR assay of fads2, fads2-AS1 and fads2-AS2 expressions revealed that the fads2 transcript was mainly expressed in the liver and intestine and exhibited a typical gene expression pattern of freshwater species while fads2-AS1 and fads2-AS2 genes were highly expressed in the brain, followed by the liver and intestine. Functional characterization of Eurasian perch FADS2 in transgenic yeast showed a fully functional \u03946 desaturation activity toward C18 PUFA substrates, without residual \u03945 and \u03948 desaturase activities.",

This movement is necessary for a cell to maintain basic metabolic functions, and disruption of motility often results in cell death. Miro is a mitochondrial outer membrane Rho GTPase essential for mitochondrial movement and distribution in diverse systems, including yeast, animals, and plants. We sought to study the previously uncharacterized Miro protein family in zebrafish. We confirmed that, like human Miro, the zebrafish Miro proteins (Rhot1a, Rhot1b, and Rhot2) localize to mitochondria in mammalian tissue culture cells by both biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescent colocalization. In addition, using whole mount in situ hybridization, we observed ubiquitous expression of all three mRNAs throughout development. By microinjecting three antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeted to each of the rhot genes, we knocked down all three proteins simultaneously in developing zebrafish embryos. The triple morphants demonstrated a dose-dependent defect in posterior body-axis elongation, while a single knockdown of each protein at the same dose produced no effect. This phenotype could be rescued with human Miro1 mRNA and is most likely due to increased cell death. Taken altogether, this research demonstrates the importance of the Rhot proteins during vertebrate development.",

To address this, we cloned and characterized kiss1 and kiss2 full-length cDNA by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), and analyzed their expressions in brain\u2013pituitary\u2013gonad (BPG) axis by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay at various gonadal developmental stages of the annual reproductive cycle.

In male, kiss1 mRNA in brain and testis showed the highest level of expression during meiosis division of the gonad. The kiss2 mRNA revealed the highest expression during recrudescence stages in the brain, spermiation stages in pituitary and post-spawning stages in testes. In females, significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) a higher level of kiss1 transcript was expressed in brain and ovary, in the full grown oocyte stages, whereas during pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic stages in pituitary. The kiss2 gene expression was almost similar at various gonadal developmental stages in the brain and ovary, but, highest expression was detected in full grown oocyte stages in the pituitary.

It remains unclear if AMPK is involved in muscular energy metabolism in broiler chickens. Hence, in the present study, seven-day-old male broilers were equally divided into three groups: fed ad libitum (control); feed-deprived for 24\u00a0h (S24); feed-deprived for 24\u00a0h and then refed for 24\u00a0h (S24R24). Compared to the control group, the plasma levels of glucose, insulin, T3 and triglycerides in the S24 group were significantly lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the uric acid levels were significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Except for glucose, refeeding for 24\u00a0h reversed the fasting-induced alterations in plasma metabolite. Fasting decreased the liver kinase B1 (LKB1), AMPK alpha 2 subunit (AMPK\u03b12), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in M. pectoralis major (PM). Feed deprivation did not affect the phosphorylated AKT, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in PM (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), but upregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) gene expression and increased phosphorylated LKB1 (0.05\u00a0<\u00a0P\u00a0<\u00a00.1) and AMPK\u03b1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) levels. AMPK\u03b12, FAS, and CPT1 mRNA levels and the protein levels of phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1 of the PM muscle returned to control group levels after 24\u00a0h refeeding. In M. biceps femoris (BF), the AMPK\u03b12 and FAS mRNA levels were decreased by fasting compared to control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas CPT1 mRNA and phosphorylated LKB1 and AMPK protein levels were increased. Refeeding for 24\u00a0h reversed the changes in AMPK\u03b12 and CPT1 gene expression and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b12 subunit. Fasting did not affect the AKT, mTOR and p70S6K in both PM and BF muscles (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, refeeding after 24\u00a0h of fasting increased the phosphorylated mTOR level in BF muscle which was in parallel with increased plasma insulin concentration. It was likely that increased phospho-mTOR level in the BF muscle was due to the higher sensitivity of BF to insulin. Together, the results suggested that the AMPK signaling pathway might be involved in the energy metabolism alterations in the skeletal muscles of broiler chickens and was also dependent upon the muscle fiber type. Furthermore, the regulatory effects of AMPK on energy metabolism in muscles of broiler chickens might be mediated by the AMPK/FAS pathway.",

Bioinformatics analysis showed that Cdc42 was a putative target of miR-17. Cdc42 is a gene related to cell adhesion, migration, polarity, cytokinesis, growth, actin cytoskeleton, microtubule dynamics and transcription factor activity; thus, Cdc42 may contribute to metamorphic development. In our study, overexpression of miR-17 in FEC cells suppressed Cdc42 expression. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Cdc42 was the target of miR-17. The Cdc42 cDNA from the Japanese flounder was cloned and characterized for the first time. The expression of miR-17 was found to be negatively correlated with Cdc42 mRNA expression during temporal development and in the tissues of adult Japanese flounders. These results indicated that the decrease in miR-17 contributed to the up-regulation of Cdc42 during Japanese flounder metamorphosis. Cdc42 gene expression was down-regulated by thyroid hormone during Japanese flounder metamorphosis, whereas miR-17 was significantly up-regulated by thyroid hormone during these stages. These results indicated that miR-17 was a negative regulator of Cdc42.",

However, their release into the aquatic environments through various anthropogenic activities will lead to toxic effect in aquatic organisms. Although several investigations have been reported on the effect of ZnONPs in aquatic organisms using traditional end points such as survival, growth, and reproduction, the molecular level end points are faster and sensitive. In this study, the expression of different genes involved in oxidative stress response, detoxification, and cellular defense was studied in an ecotoxicologically important bio-monitoring organism Chironomus riparius in order to understand the subcellular effects of ZnONPs. The fourth instar larvae were exposed to 0, 0.2, 2, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/L of ZnONPs and Zn ions (in the form of ZnSO4.7H2O) for 24 and 48\u00a0h period.

Gene expression results showed that the expression of genes related to oxidative stress response was more pronounced as a result of ZnONPs exposure as compared to Zn ions. The mRNA expression of genes involved in detoxification and cellular protection was also modulated. Significantly higher expression levels of oxidative stress-related genes shows that oxidative stress is an important mechanism of toxicity as a result of ZnONPs exposure in C. riparius.",

No significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were found for the two rotifer diets in the overall gene expression level of cod larvae, their growth and survival, and their DHA levels in total lipid and PL fraction.

There appeared to be no major effect of development on the expression of key genes of PL biosynthesis suggesting no genetic constrain in early developmental stages. Our overall data suggested that besides the possible limited de novo PC synthesis ability in the intestine, other metabolic constraints should also be considered, especially the possible low input of bile PC as a result of immature liver.

In the present study we characterize and compare lipids and fatty acids present in three species of scorpion: Timogenes elegans, Timogenes dorbignyi, and Brachistosternus ferrugineus, focusing the study on the main organs/tissues involved in the dynamics of lipids. As found in the fat body of insects, hepatopancreas of crustaceans and midgut diverticula of spiders, the hepatopancreas of the three species studied here turned out to be the organ of lipid storage (great quantity of triacylglycerides). With relation to the hemolymph and muscles, a great quantity of phospholipids was observed, which is possibly involved in membrane formation. It is important to highlight that unlike what happens in insects, in scorpions the main circulating energetic lipid is the triacylglyceride. This lipid is found in greater proportion in the hepatopancreas of females, surely for reproduction. The fatty acid of the different organs/tissues analyzed remained constant in the three species studied with certain characteristic patterns, thus observing saturated and unsaturated most abundant fatty acids of C16 and C18. Finally, it could be observed that in T. elegans, T. dorbignyi and B. ferrugineus scorpions, there is a lack of 20:4 that generates a special condition within fatty acids of arthropods.",

However, the adjustments of the semiaquatic animals as modern analogs of evolutionary intermediates between ancestral terrestrial mammals and their fully aquatic descendants are still not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze the total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity (in the lactate to pyruvate direction), the LDH patterns and the antioxidant defense in the tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen) of semiaquatic rodents such as Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) and nutria (Myocastor coypus). Samples from Wistar rat were used for comparison. Semiaquatic rodents had higher catalase activity compared to rats. The superoxide dismutase activity was higher and the catalase activity was lower in almost all tissues of muskrat than of both beaver and nutria. Comparing beaver and nutria, no significant differences in the antioxidant enzyme activities were found for the heart, kidney and liver. In beaver, most of the examined tissues (heart, kidney, lung and spleen) use lactate as preference to glucose as a substrate but in muskrat the heart, liver and skeletal muscle showed the increased LDH activity. Nutria had the unusual LDH properties that are needed to be further investigated. Our results suggest that beaver, nutria and muskrat have distinct mechanisms of adaptation to diving hypoxia/reoxygenation and support the hypothesis that semiaquatic mammals are the intermediate animals that help to define which potential selection factors and mechanical constraints may have directed the evolution of the aquatic forms.",

Silencing of GmUSP could significantly down-regulate the transcriptional level of ecdysone-inducible genes and result in increased mortality during metamorphosis and a prolonged prepupal duration. In RNAi experiments, ecdysone-inducible genes were significantly down-regulated following GmUSP silencing, suggesting that they were under the control of GmUSP. In addition, the GmUSP knockdown resulted in increased mortality during metamorphosis and prolonged the prepupal period. Taken together, the present results indicate that GmUSP may directly or indirectly affect the development of G. molesta.",

     "abstract": "The regulatory mechanisms of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are known to differ among skeletal muscle types in mammals. For example, glycolytic muscles prefer glucose as an energy source, whereas oxidative muscles prefer fatty acids (FA). We herein demonstrated differences in the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the pectoralis major (a glycolytic twitch muscle), adductor superficialis (an oxidative twitch muscle), and adductor profound (a tonic muscle) of 14-day-old chicks. Under ad libitum feeding conditions, the mRNA levels of muscle type phosphofructokinase-1 were markedly lower in the adductor superficialis muscle, suggesting that basal glycolytic activity is very low in this type of muscle. In contrast, high mRNA levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and fatty acid translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (FAT/CD36) in the adductor superficialis muscle suggest that FA uptake is high in this type of muscle. The mRNA levels of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b (CPT1b) were significantly higher in the adductor profound muscle than in other muscles, suggesting that basal lipolytic activity is high in this type of muscle. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b4 and CPT1b were significantly increased in the adductor superficialis muscle, but not in other muscles, after 24\u00a0h of fasting. Therefore, the availability of FA in the oxidative twitch muscles in growing chickens appears to be upregulated by fasting. Our results suggest that lipid metabolism-related genes are upregulated under both basal and fasting conditions in the adductor superficialis in growing chickens.",

     "abstract": "The FEM-1 protein of Caenorhabditis elegans plays a crucial role in the nematode sex-determination pathway. Here, we reported the characterization of three members of Fem-1 gene family in Eriocheir sinensis (designated EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and EsFem-1c), which were homologs of the nematode FEM-1 protein. The amino acid sequences of EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and EsFem-1c contained eight, nine, and eight ankyrin repeats, respectively. None of the ankyrin repeats had its own specific signature, and the evolution of ankyrin repeat was not completely independent. The predicted three-dimensional structure of EsFem-1 proteins exhibited highly similar superhelical conformation, especially the N-terminal six contiguous ankyrin repeats, which provided a binding surface for the protein\u2013protein interaction. Phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid sequences revealed that EsFem-1a, EsFem-1b, and EsFem-1c were divided into three obvious separated clades. EsFem-1 genes were highly expressed in fertilized egg, 2\u20134 cell and blastula stage comparing with larval stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), which suggested they might be maternal genes. They also showed a certain degree of sexually dimorphic expression in some tissues. Notably, the highest expression of EsFem-1a was in the hepatopancreas, with EsFem-1b in testes and EsFem-1c in muscle (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which indicated their potential role in a broad array of tissues. In addition, the genes initially involved in sex differentiation were not limited to those specifically expressed in the developing gonad. Taken together, these results suggested that EsFem-1 might function in crab early sex determination and late gonad development. The identification of Fem-1 gene family in E. sinensis provides a new insight into crab sex-determination mechanism.",

     "abstract": "We identified cDNA encoding a functional ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue-receptor 1a (GHS-R1a)) in a urodele amphibian, the Japanese fire belly newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster). Two functional receptor proteins, composed of 378- and 362-amino acids, were deduced from the identified cDNA because two candidate initiation methionine sites were found. The long-chain receptor protein shared 80%, 69%, and 59% identities with the bullfrog GHS-R1a, human GHS-R1a and tilapia GHS-R1a-like receptor, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the newt receptor is grouped to the clade of the tetrapod homologs, and very closed to anuran amphibians. In functional analyses, homologous newt ghrelin, heterologous bullfrog and rat ghrelin, and a GHS-R1a agonist, GHRP-6 increased intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ concentration in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressed newt GHS-R1a. The responsiveness was much greater in the short-chain receptor than in the long-chain receptor. Both receptors preferred to bind Ser3-ghrelin including newt and rat ghrelin than Thr3-ghrelin with bullfrog ghrelin. GHRP-6 has a similar affinity to bullfrog ghrelin. GHS-R1a mRNA was expressed in the brain, pituitary, intestine, pancreas, testis and fat body with high level, and eyes, heart, stomach, liver, gall bladder, kidney and dorsal skin with low level. In a fasting experiment, gene expression of GHS-R1a in the brain and pituitary increased 4\u00a0days after fasting, and the increased level decreased to the initial level 2\u00a0weeks after fasting. These changes are consistent with the change in ghrelin mRNA. In contrast, expression of ghrelin and GHS-R1a mRNA in the stomach decreased on day 4 after fasting, and increased 2\u00a0weeks after fasting. These results indicate that ghrelin and its receptor system are present and altered by energy states in this newt.",

After the feeding trial, a graded tissue-specific expression pattern of MTTP was observed and high expression abundance in the liver and intestine indicated its major function in lipid transport in this fish species. In addition, expression of genes encoding MTTP as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which are transcription factors and serve as key regulators in lipid homoeostasis, was all affected by dietary lipid and choline supplementations. Elevated dietary lipid levels significantly increased the liver, intestinal and muscle MTTP mRNA abundance. Additionally, the down-regulation of MTTP expression in the liver and muscle was observed when fish were fed with inadequate choline supplementation in high-fat diet, yet up-regulated as supplementing extra choline in diet. Expressions of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b2 in the liver and muscle showed similar trend of MTTP expression. The results suggested the potential connection of MTTP and PPAR in response to different dietary nutritional factors. Furthermore, extra choline supplementations could promote lipid transfer and enhance fatty acid oxidation, which indicated a molecular mechanism of choline on diminishing fat accumulation in blunt snout bream.",

Folate and cobalamin are B-vitamin cofactors with overlapping roles in transferring various single-carbon units. In mammals, one or both is needed for nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, amino acid conversions and other reactions. However, there has been little investigation of the response to folate or cobalamin in insects. Here, we manipulated folate intake and potentially cobalamin levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with chemically-defined diets, an antibiotic to reduce bacterially-derived vitamins, and the folate-interfering pharmaceutical methotrexate, to see if single-carbon metabolites and DNA synthesis rates would be affected. We found that similar to mammals with low folate intake, fruit fly larvae had significantly slower growth and DNA synthesis rates. But changes to single carbon-metabolites did not mirror that of mammals with abnormal folate or given MTX. Five of the nine metabolites measured were not significantly affected (methionine, serine, glycine, methylglycine, and dimethylglycine) and three (cystathionine, methylgycine, and methylmalonic acid) were only decreased in larvae consuming methotrexate. Metabolites expected to be elevated if flies used cobalamin from microbial symbionts were not affected by dietary sulfaquinoxaline. Our data support the role of folate in nucleotide synthesis in D. melanogaster and that microbial symbionts provide functioning folates. We could not confirm how folate intake affects single carbon pathway metabolites, nor whether Drososphila use microbially-derived cobalamin. Further work should explore which cofactors are used in fruit flies in these important and potentially novel pathways.",

A partial BADH cDNA sequence from the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei was obtained and its organ-specific expression during osmotic stress (low and high salinity) was evaluated. The partial BADH cDNA sequence (LvBADH) is 1103\u00a0bp long and encodes an open reading frame for 217 protein residues. The amino acid sequence of LvBADH is related to that of other BADHs, TMABA-DH and ALDH9 from invertebrate and vertebrate homologues, and includes the essential domains of their function and regulation.

The aim of this study was to quantify SCs and total myonuclei in hibernator muscle during different phases of the torpor-arousal cycle. Skeletal muscle was collected from thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, at five timepoints during hibernation: control euthermic [CON, stable body temperature (Tb)], early torpor (ET, within 24\u00a0h), late torpor (LT, 5+ consecutive days), early arousal (EA, increased respiratory rate >\u00a060 breaths/min, Tb 9\u201312\u00a0\u00b0C) and interbout arousal (IA, euthermic Tb). Protein levels of p21, Myf5, Wnt4, and \u03b2-catenin were determined by western blotting. SCs (Pax7+) and myonuclei were identified using immunohistochemistry. Over the torpor\u2013arousal cycle, myonuclei/fiber remained unchanged. However, the percentage of SCs increased significantly during ET (7.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04% vs. control: 4.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and returned to control levels during LT. This coincided with a 224% increase in p21 protein during ET. Protein levels of Wnt4 did not change throughout, whereas Myf5 was lower during EA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.08) and IA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared to torpor, \u03b2-catenin increased by 247% and 279% during EA and IA, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, SCs were not dormant during hibernation and increased numbers of SC during ET corresponded with elevated amounts of p21 suggesting that cell cycle control may explain the SC return to baseline levels during late torpor.

Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a suppressor of learning and long-term memory (LTM) in mammals. In the present study, the relationship between PP1 and the individual difference in acceptance of artificial diets in mandarin fish was investigated. The complete CDS (coding sequence) of four PP1 isoforms (PP1caa, PP1cab, PP1cb and PP1cc) were cloned in mandarin fish. The amino acid sequences of these PP1 isoforms are highly conserved in different species. The mRNA expressions of PP1caa and PP1cb in brain of artificial diet feeders were significantly higher than those in nonfeeders, suggesting the deficiency in the maintenance of long-term memory of its natural food habit (live prey fish). The SNP loci in PP1caa and PP1cb were also found to be associated with the individual difference in acceptance of artificial diets in mandarin fish. These SNPs of PP1caa and PP1cb genes could be useful markers for gene-associated breeding of mandarin fish, which could accept artificial diets. In conclusion, different mRNA expression and SNPs of PP1caa and PP1cb genes in feeders and nonfeeders of artificial diets might contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of individual difference in acceptance of artificial diets in mandarin fish.",

Changes were assessed through differences in gene expression, enzymatic activity, proteomic and swimming activity. Our data demonstrate that complex IV activity was significantly higher in cybrids compared to wild type. This difference could result from one variable amino acid on the COX3 mitochondrial subunit and/or from a tremendous change in the proteome. We also show that cybrids present a higher swimming performance than wild type. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that the absence of coevolution for a period of almost ten million years between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes does not appear to be necessarily deleterious but could even have beneficial effects.

     "abstract": "Coral bleaching is the consequence of disruption of the mutualistic Cnidaria-dinoflagellate association. Elevated seawater temperatures have been proposed as the most likely cause of coral bleaching whose severity is enhanced by a limitation in the bioavailability of iron. Iron is required by numerous organisms including the zooxanthellae residing inside the symbiosome of cnidarian cells. However, the knowledge of how symbiotic zooxanthellae obtain iron from the host cells and how elevated water temperature affects the association is very limited. Since cellular iron acquisition is known to be mediated through transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis, a vesicular trafficking pathway specifically regulated by Rab4 and Rab5, we set out to examine the roles of these key proteins in the iron acquisition by the symbiotic Symbiodinium. Thus, we hypothesized that the iron recruitments into symbiotic zooxanthellae-housed symbiosomes may be dependent on rab4/rab5-mediated fusion with vesicles containing iron-bound transferrins and will be retarded under elevated temperature. In this study, we cloned a novel monolobal transferrin (ApTF) gene from the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and confirmed that the association of ApTF with A. pulchella Rab4 (ApRab4) or A. pulchella Rab5 (ApRab5) vesicles is inhibited by elevated temperature through immunofluorescence analysis. We confirmed the iron-deficient phenomenon by demonstrating the induced overexpression of iron-deficiency-responsive genes, flavodoxin and high-affinity iron permease 1, and reduced intracellular iron concentration in zooxanthellae under desferrioxamine B (iron chelator) and high temperature treatment. In conclusion, our data are consistent with algal iron deficiency being a contributing factor for the thermal stress-induced bleaching of symbiotic cnidarians.",

This study aimed to assess the elicitation of sweetness using recombinant mammalian lysozymes expressed in Pichia pastoris. Recombinant human lysozyme (h-LZ) and other mammalian lysozymes of mouse, dog, cat and bovine milk elicited similar sweetness as determined using a sensory test, whereas bovine stomach lysozyme (bs-LZ) did not. Assays of cell cultures showed that h-LZ activated the human sweet taste receptor hT1R2/hT1R3, whereas bs-LZ did not. Point mutations confirmed that the sweetness of h-LZ was independent of enzyme activity and substrate-binding sites, although acidic amino acid residues of bs-LZ played a significant role in diminishing sweetness. Therefore, we conclude that elicitation of sweetness is a ubiquitous function among all lysozymes including mammalian lysozymes. These findings may provide novel insights into the biological implications of T1R2/T1R3-activation by mammalian lysozyme in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract.

In this study, three LITAF genes were identified in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. In silico analyses of B. koreanus LITAF genes of conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships supported gene annotations that indicated that LITAF is involved in innate immunity in primitive rotifers. To examine transcriptional sensitivity of B. koreanus LITAF genes, the rotifers were exposed to different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transcriptional levels of LITAF1 and LITAF2 gene were significantly upregulated dose- and time-dependently in response to LPS exposure for 24\u00a0h.

To investigate the characters of myoglobin of this unique species, another low altitude lizard Phrynocephalus przewalskii (Lacertilia: Agamidae) was selected as a reference. The open reading frame (ORF) of myoglobin in two lizards was 465\u00a0bp which encodes a polypeptide of 154 amino acids with different theoretical molecular weight and isoelectric point. The amino acid substitutions of myoglobin between two species were found at Thr13Ile, Lys87Thr and His118Asn. Homology modeling results indicated that P. erythrurus myoglobin has a greater heme pocket, which may be more favorable to oxygen binding and unloading. On the other hand, the mRNA levels of myoglobin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle in P. erythrurus were significantly larger than those in low altitude P. przewalskii. At protein level, myoglobin concentration in skeletal muscle in P. erythrurus was notably increased, but no significant difference was observed in cardiac muscle.",

     "abstract": "To reduce the requirement for fish oil in marine aquaculture, it would be advantageous to endow marine fish species with the capability for the endogenous biosynthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). For this purpose, we have previously produced transgenic Nibe croaker (Nibea mitsukurii) carrying an elongase of very-long-chain fatty acids 2 (elovl2) gene isolated from Masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). However, fatty acid analysis revealed that 24:5n-3 accumulated in the liver of the transgenic fish, whereas the DHA level did not differ between non-transgenic and transgenic fish. Therefore, to select more effective enzymes for successful transgenic synthesis of DHA, understanding the endogenous DHA biosynthetic pathway in the Nibe croaker is considered to be important. The present study aimed to investigate the biochemical functions of the Elovl5, Elovl4 and Fads2 enzymes involved in the DHA biosynthetic pathway in the Nibe croaker. The results showed that both Elovl5 and Elovl4 were able to elongate C18 fatty acids to C22 fatty acids and that Fads2 had \u03946 desaturase activity toward C18 fatty acids and weak \u03948 desaturase activity toward C20 fatty acids. On the other hand, Fads2 was found to lack the ability to convert 24:5n-3 to 24:6n-3, a fatty acid that can directly be converted to DHA via \u03b2-oxidation.",

The common carp genome has experienced a very recent whole genome duplication (WGD) event. Among a large number of highly similar duplicated genes, a pair of Ras-associated binding-GTPase 1a (Rab1a) genes were found fast diverging. Four analogous Rab1a genes were identified in the common carp genome. Comparisons of gene structures and sequences indicated Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 was a pair of fast diverging duplicates, while Rab1a-3 and Rab1a-4 was a pair of less diverged duplicates. All putative Rab1a proteins shared conserved GTPase domain, which enabled the proteins serve as molecular switches for vesicular trafficking. Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 proteins varied in their C-terminal sequences, which were generally considered to encode the membrane localization signals. Differential expression patterns were observed between Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 genes. In blood, muscle, spleen, and heart, the mRNA level of Rab1a-1 was higher than that of Rab1a-2. In liver and intestine, the mRNA level of Rab1a-2 was higher. Expression of Rab1a-1 and Rab1a-2 showed distinct hypoxia responses. Under severe hypoxia, Rab1a-1 expression was down-regulated in blood, while Rab1a-2 expression was up-regulated in liver. Compared with the less diverged Rab1a-3/4 gene pair, common carp Rab1a-1/2 gene pair exhibited strong characteristics of sub-functionalization, which might contribute to a sophisticated and efficient Ras-dependent regulating network for the hypoxia-tolerant fish.",

Ado exhibited substrate inhibition suggesting the presence of more than one binding site for Ado on the enzyme. ATP relieved substrate inhibition by Ado. Thus, Ado also binds to the ATP binding site. AMP was competitive with ATP, inferring that AMP binds to the same site as ATP. AMP, ADP and ATP were non-competitive with Ado, therefore, none of these nucleotides binds to the Ado binding site. Combining ATP with ADP was additive. Therefore, the binding of either ATP or ADP does not interfere with the binding of the other. It is concluded that for every ATP consumed, TgAK generates three new AMPs. These findings along with the fact that a wide range of nucleoside 5\u2032-mono, di, and triphosphates could substitute for ATP as phosphate donors in this reaction may explain the efficient and central role played by TgAK in the utilization of Ado as the major source from which all other purines can be synthesized in T. gondii.",

The ORF (573 bp) of RbPrx5 encoded a protein of 190 amino acids (20\u00a0kDa) containing a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 1\u201320) and a thioredoxin-2 motif (residues 31\u2013190) and three conserved Cys residues. Homology assessment and phylogenetic analysis clearly disclosed relatively higher amino acid sequence similarities and a closer evolutionary position of RbPrx5 with those of other teleost homologs. The ORF of RbPrx5 was distributed among six exons as found in other vertebrates, but it possessed an additional exon in its 5'-UTR. In silico examination of RbPrx5 gene\u2019s putative promoter region revealed the presence of several cis-elements which may be important in its transcriptional regulation. Constitutive expression of RbPrx5 was detected in eleven tissues with the highest level in the heart. Modulation of RbPrx5 transcription was evidenced from varying mRNA levels in head kidney post in vivo LPS-, poly I:C-, Edwardsiella tarda bacterial- and rock bream iridoviral-challenges. The antioxidant function of RbPrx5 was investigated using recombinant RbPrx5 protein. Results of an in vitro mixed-function oxidase assay demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA damage by rRbPrx5. A H2O2 tolerance assay showed that in vivo overexpression of rRbPrx5 increased the bacterial survival under H2O2-mediated oxidative stress condition.

In this study, we tested whether documented effects of 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) on previtellogenic eel ovaries are mediated through affecting the expression of key ovarian TGFb genes. Furthermore, we investigated whether 11KT effects interacted with temperature. Accordingly, three thermal regimes were compared and their interaction with 11KT-mediated actions on expression of TGFb superfamily genes (chiefly inhibin subunits) evaluated in the eel (Anguilla australis). Inhibin subunit mRNA levels were also measured in ovarian explants cultured in vitro with 11KT and in ovaries from eels collected from the wild. In wild eels, inhibin-bA mRNA levels were higher in early than in previtellogenic eels; inhibin-a expression did not differ between stages, whereas that of inhibin-bB first decreased, then recovered with advanced developmental stage. Temperature was ineffective in modulating any of the end points, at least as long as a Q10 adjustment was made to correct for \u2018metabolic dose\u2019. However, 11KT affected the expression of inhibin-a compared to control fish, while those of inhibin-b subunit genes remained unaffected. In contrast, 11KT dramatically reduced mRNA levels of inhibin-b subunits in vitro, but had inconsistent effects on inhibin-a transcript abundance. We conclude that 11KT affects ovarian inhibin subunit gene expression, but effects are not in keeping with the changes seen during early oogenesis in eels from the wild. We further contend that in vivo temperature experiments are easily biased and that Q10 corrections may be required to identify \u2018true\u2019 temperature effects.",

     "abstract": "Fundamental studies characterizing transcript variability in teleost tissues are needed if molecular endpoints are to be useful for regulatory ecotoxicology. The objectives of this study were to (1) measure transcript variability of steroidogenic enzymes and steroid receptors in the fathead minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas) ovary to better determine normal variability and the sample sizes needed to detect specific effect sizes and to (2) determine how expression patterns related to higher level endpoints used in some regulatory ecotoxicology programs (e.g. relative gonad size). Estrogen receptor 2b (esr2b) and 5\u03b1-reductase a3 (srd5a3) showed high variability in the ovary (CV\u00a0>\u00a01.0) while progesterone receptor (pgr), androgen receptor (ar), and esr2a showed comparatively low variability (CV\u00a0=\u00a0~\u00a00.5\u2013\u22120.7). Using these estimates, a power analysis revealed that sample sizes for real-time PCR experiments would need to be\u00a0>20 to detect a 2-fold change for 7 of the transcripts examined; thus many molecular studies conducted in the fish ovary may have insufficient power to detect smaller effects. Two transcripts were correlated to steroid production in the ovary; cyp19a1 levels were positively correlated to in vitro E2 production, while ar levels were negatively correlated to in vitro T production. Thus, these transcripts may be informative molecular surrogates for ovarian steroid production. No transcript investigated showed any correlation to GSI, condition, or body weight/length. Molecular approaches in fish are increasingly used to assess biological impacts of chemical stressors; however additional studies are required that determine how molecular variability relates to higher level biological endpoints.",

In this study, we report the identification of two fgfrl1 genes in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) that share 56% amino acid sequence identity. Both fgfrl1a and 1b were transcribed throughout embryogenesis, and mRNA levels were particularly high during somitogenesis. Using in situ hybridization, fgfrl1a transcripts were detected in notochord, somites, brain and eye at 14, 24 and 36\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf). In contrast, fgfrl1b was transcribed mainly in the endoderm at 14\u00a0hpf, in the gut and proctodeum at 24\u00a0hpf, and in the lens, pharyngeal arch and proctodeum at 36\u00a0hpf. In adult fish, fgfrl1a was abundantly expressed in heart, brain and muscle, while fgfrl1b was expressed strongly in eye, muscle and gill. Furthermore, both genes were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up-regulated in muscle and brain during starvation and returned to normal levels rapidly after re-feeding. Exogenous treatment with different doses of human growth hormone down-regulated the expression of both genes in brain and muscle (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results suggest that Fgfrl1a and 1b play divergent roles in regulating growth and development in grass carp.",

We report the gene and promoter sequences for two aqp10b paralogs (aqp10ba, aqp10bb) that are 82% identical at the predicted amino acid level, and aqp9b. Aqp10bb and aqp9b have the 6 exon structure common to vertebrate GLPs. Aqp10ba has 8 exons; there are two additional exons at the 5\u2032 end, and the promoter sequence is different from aqp10bb. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the aqp10b paralogs arose from a gene duplication event specific to the smelt lineage. Smelt GLP transcripts are ubiquitously expressed; however, aqp10ba transcripts were highest in kidney, aqp10bb transcripts were highest in kidney, intestine, pyloric caeca and brain, and aqp9b transcripts were highest in spleen, liver, red blood cells and kidney. In cold-temperature challenge experiments, plasma glycerol and urea levels were significantly higher in cold- compared to warm-acclimated smelt; however, GLP transcript levels were generally either significantly lower or remained constant. The exception was significantly higher aqp10ba transcript levels in kidney. High aqp10ba transcripts in smelt kidney that increase significantly in response to cold temperature in congruence with plasma urea suggest that this gene duplicate may have evolved to allow the re-absorption of urea to concomitantly conserve nitrogen and prevent freezing.",

The current study sought to characterize the erythrocyte isoforms from two squamate species, Python molurus and Nerodia rhombifer, which was combined with information from recent genome projects to address this important phylogenetic gap. Obtained sequences grouped closely with CA XIII in phylogenetic analyses. CA II mRNA transcripts were also found in erythrocytes, but found at less than half the levels of CA XIII. Structural analysis suggested similar biochemical activity as the respective mammalian isoforms, with CA XIII being a low activity isoform. Biochemical characterization verified that the majority of CA activity in the erythrocytes was due to a high activity CA II-like isoform; however, titration with copper supported the presence of two CA pools. The CA II-like pool accounted for 90 % of the total activity. To assess potential disparate roles of these isoforms a feeding stress was used to up-regulate CO2 excretion pathways. Significant up-regulation of CA II and the anion exchanger was observed; CA XIII was strongly down-regulated. While these results do not provide insight into the role of CA XIII in the erythrocytes, they do suggest that the presence of two isoforms is not simply a case of physiological redundancy.",

Little is known about the composition or structure of glow-worm snares, or the extent of possible convergence between glow-worm and arachnid capture silks. We characterised Arachnocampa richardsae silk and mucus using X-ray scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Silk but not mucus contained crystallites of the cross-\u03b2-sheet type, which occur in unrelated insect silks but have not been reported previously in fibres used for prey capture. Mucus proteins were rich in Gly (28.5%) and existed in predominantly a random coil structure, typical of many adhesive proteins. In contrast, the silk fibres were unusually rich in charged and polar residues, particularly Lys (18.1%), which we propose is related to their use in a highly hydrated state. Comparison of X-ray scattering, infrared spectroscopy and amino acid analysis data suggests that silk fibres contain a high fraction of disordered protein. We suggest that in the native hydrated state, silk fibres are capable of extension via deformation of both disordered regions and cross-\u03b2-sheet crystallites, and that high extensibility is an adaptation promoting successful prey capture. This study illustrates the rich variety of protein motifs that are available for recruitment into biopolymers, and how convergently evolved materials can nevertheless be based on fundamentally different protein structures.",

The sequencing of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and availability of sophisticated genetic tools within that system affords the opportunity to conduct a detailed physiological analysis of the PKs from a well known invertebrate for comparison with the extensive work conducted on vertebrate systems. As a first step in this effort we have carried out a detailed molecular genetic and biochemical characterization of the PKs in C. elegans. Our results reveal that C. elegans has five PK genes encoding arginine kinases that range in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KMArg) from (3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 to (9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01.

In this study, we cloned and characterized ALDH9 (designated LjALDH9) from Arctic lamprey Lampetra japonica. The open reading frame of LjALDH9 was 1566\u00a0bp, encoding 521 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55.68\u00a0kDa. LjALDH9 protein had a signal peptide and Aldedh domain with the active site Cys315. In addition, LjALDH9 shares high sequence homology with ALDH9 of jawed vertebrates. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that LjALDH9 was highly expressed in the buccal gland. A reactive LjALDH9 protein was obtained by prokaryotic expression, two-step-denaturing and refolding and affinity purification. During enzyme activity analysis of recombinant LjALDH9, we found that the most suitable reaction conditions were pH\u00a07.0, 16\u201323\u00a0\u00b0C and Mn2\u00a0+ as the activator. Our study provides theoretical proof that LjALDH9 plays an important role in the parasitic life phase of lamprey.",

     "abstract": "Chitinases are crucial enzymes required for chitin degradation in crustaceans. Five chitinase genes, namely, EsCht1, EsCht2, EsCht3, EsCht4, and EsCht6, were identified in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis. The open reading frames (ORF) of EsCht1, EsCht2, EsCht3, EsCht4 and EsCht6 ranged from 1182\u00a0bp to 1926\u00a0bp with encoding proteins between 393 and 641 amino acid residues. Domain analysis of the chitinase proteins showed that most EsChts contained the catalytic domain and the chitin-binding domain (CBD) connected with the serine/threonine (S/T)-rich linker region. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that EsChts with orthologs in crustaceans were divided into six groups. The tissue-dependent, developmental stage-related and molting stage-related differential expression patterns of chitinase genes were determined using end-point polymerase chain reaction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. During the molting cycle, EsCht2 mRNA expression in the cuticle and EsCht4 and EsCht6 mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas were 108-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 19-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 12-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher in the premolt (D0\u20131) than in the intermolt stage, respectively. The results indicated that EsCht1 from group 1 might play a role in the digestion of chitin-containing food; EsCht2 from group 2 likely played a role in the degradation of chitinous cuticle during molting for growth and during the post-embryonic development; EsCh3 from group 3 potentially had a dual role in the digestion of chitin-containing food and defense against chitin-bearing pathogens. EsCht3, EsCht4, and EsCht6 were highly expressed in the reproductive system, indicating their potential roles in reproductive molting. Differential expression patterns of the chitinase genes suggested that they might have distinct biological functions in developmental stage- and physiological growth-related and reproductive molting processes, which are essential for metamorphosis, growth, and reproduction. The findings of this study might form a basis for further studies on the functions of chitinases in E. sinensis and other crustaceans.",

In order to explore diapause-linked stress tolerance processes, the expression of selected genes coding for stress-related proteins\u2014glutathione S-transferase (Gst), thioredoxin (Trx), glutaredoxin (Grx), ferritin (Fer), metallothionein (Mtn), and heat shock proteins Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp20.4, and Hsp20.1\u2014was assessed in the fat body of diapause-destined, warm (22\u00a0\u00b0C) and cold (5\u00a0\u00b0C) acclimated diapausing larvae using the quantitative real-time PCR. Gene expression was normalised to mRNA transcripts for Actin and Rps03, and relative expression was calculated using non-diapausing larvae as a control group. During the initiation phase of diapause, the abundance of mRNA transcripts of Grx, Hsp90, Hsc70, and Hsp20.1 was significantly upregulated, Trx, Fer, Mtn, and Hsp20.1 were unchanged, while only Gst was clearly downregulated in comparison to non-diapause control. Later, in the early phase of diapause, the expression of most genes (except Trx and Hsp20.1) was upregulated in warm-acclimated larvae, while only Trx and Hsp90 were upregulated in cold-acclimated larvae. Furthermore, the relative expression of all genes (except Trx) increased gradually throughout the diapause in cold-acclimated larvae. This result indicates that the half-life of mRNAs is prolonged during diapause at low temperature, which may lead to a gradual accumulation of mRNA transcripts. Our results show that both diapause programming and temperatures affect the expression of stress-related genes in Ostrinia nubilalis.",

Though most studies focus on the cellular and molecular bases of the stress response mechanisms, the ecological and evolutionary aspects of stress responses gain more and more interest. Here, we use species and parthenogenetic strains of the genus Artemia, an extremophile model organism, to study, for the first time, a protein well known for its chaperone activity and its involvement in stress responses. More specifically, transcription and protein accumulation of an FK506-Binding Protein (FKBP) homologue were investigated under heat and salt stresses. Additionally, the mRNA levels of ubiquitin, a heat-inducible protein related to the proteasomal pathway, were quantitated under these conditions. Biochemical and phylogenetic analyses showed that the studied FKBP orthologue is a typical representative of the family that clusters with other crustacean sequences. The expression was increased in both fkbp and ubiquitin genes after salt and heat stresses. However, our results in combination with the fact that Artemia species and parthenogenetic strains, selected for this study, exhibit different heat or salt tolerance provide useful hints about the evolutionary significance of FKBP and ubiquitin. Regarding FKBP, mRNA expression and protein accumulation seem to depend on the environmental conditions and the evolutionary history of each Artemia population while ubiquitin has a clear and more conserved role under heat shock.",

BH4 deficiency is associated with numerous metabolic syndromes and neuropsychological disorders. BH4 concentration in mammals is maintained through a de novo synthesis pathway and a regeneration pathway. Previous studies showed that the de novo pathway of BH4 is similar between insects and mammals. However, knowledge about the regeneration pathway of BH4 (RPB) is very limited in insects. Several mutants in the silkworm Bombyx mori have been approved to be associated with BH4 deficiency, which are good models to research on the RPB in insects. In this study, homologous genes encoding two enzymes, pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD) and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) involving in RPB have been cloned and identified from B. mori. Enzymatic activity of DHPR was found in the fat body of wild type silkworm larvae. Together with the transcription profiles, it was indicated that BmPcd and BmDhpr might normally act in the RPB of B. mori and the expression of BmDhpr was activated in the brain and sexual glands while BmPcd was expressed in a wider special pattern when the de novo pathway of BH4 was lacked in lemon. Biochemical analyses showed that the recombinant BmDHPR exhibited high enzymatic activity and more suitable parameters to the coenzyme of NADH in vitro. The results in this report give new information about the RPB in B. mori and help in better understanding insect BH4 biosynthetic networks.",

The mRNA levels of ubiquitin ligases such as atrogin-1 and muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF-1) as well as transcription factor forkhead box class O (FOXO) 1 were significantly increased by fasting in broiler and layer chicks, suggesting that the FOXO1-induced ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system, a major proteolytic system in skeletal muscles, was activated by fasting in both chicks.

Furthermore, the mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 were significantly decreased by fasting in layer chicks, but not in broiler chicks. The mRNA levels of FOXO3 were significantly increased by fasting in layer chicks, but not in broiler chicks. Therefore, the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system did not appear to have been fully upregulated in broiler chicks.

Similar to the classical receptors FGFR1-FGFR4, it contains three extracellular Ig-like domains and a single transmembrane domain. However, it lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that would be required for signal transduction, but instead contains a short intracellular tail with a peculiar histidine-rich motif. This motif has been conserved during evolution from mollusks to echinoderms and vertebrates. Only the sequences of FgfrL1 from a few rodents diverge at the C-terminal region from the canonical sequence, as they appear to have suffered a frameshift mutation within the histidine-rich motif. This mutation is observed in mouse, rat and hamster, but not in the closely related rodents mole rat (Nannospalax) and jerboa (Jaculus), suggesting that it has occurred after branching of the Muridae and Cricetidae from the Dipodidae and Spalacidae. The consequence of the frameshift is a deletion of a few histidine residues and an extension of the C-terminus by about 40 unrelated amino acids. A similar frameshift mutation has also been observed in a human patient with a craniosynostosis syndrome as well as in several patients with colorectal cancer and bladder tumors, suggesting that the histidine-rich motif is prone to mutation. The reason why this motif was conserved during evolution in most species, but not in mice, is not clear.",

Here we report the first complete genomic structure of the p53 family orthologue in the mollusc Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and confirm its similarity to vertebrate p63 gene. Our searches within the available molluscan genomes (Aplysia californica, Lottia gigantea, Crassostrea gigas and Biomphalaria glabrata), found only one p53 family member present in a single copy per haploid genome. Comparative analysis of those orthologues, additionally confirmed the conserved p63 gene structure.

Knowledge of the correct gene structure will enable better prediction of possible protein isoforms and their functions.

The expression of BmChAT was detected 3\u00a0days after oviposition.

     "abstract": "Creatine kinases (CKs) constitute a large family of isoenzymes that are involved in intracellular energy homeostasis. In cells with high and fluctuating energy requirements ATP level is maintained via phosphocreatine hydrolysis catalyzed by creatine kinase. In contrast to invertebrates and higher vertebrates, in poikilothermic vertebrates the adaptations for the regulation of energy metabolism by changes in the oligomeric state of CK isoforms are not well known. The present study aimed at identification of herring eye CK isoforms and focuses on factors affecting the CK-octamer stability. In addition to the CK octamer, three different dimeric isoforms of CK were detected by cellulose acetate native electrophoresis. Destabilization of octamer was studied in the presence of TSAC substrates and about 50% of octamers dissociated into dimers within 24\u00a0h. Moreover, we found that the increase of temperature from 4\u00a0\u00b0C to 30\u00a0\u00b0C caused rapid inactivation of dimers in TSAC-treated samples but did not affect octameric structures. In a thermostability assay we demonstrated that octamers retain their activity even at 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Our results indicate that destabilization of the octameric structure can lead to loss of enzyme activity at higher temperatures (above 30\u00a0\u00b0C). Furthermore, our results based on N-terminal sequence analysis suggest that probably the mitochondrial s-type CK, rather than u-type, is predominantly expressed in herring eye. In conclusion the existence of four various CK isoforms in one organ may reflect complex regulation of energy metabolism in the phototransduction process in teleost fishes.",

Although the roles of UCPs are well understood in mammals, little is known in fish. To investigate the thermogenesis roles in Chinese perch (Siniperca chuatsi), we cloned the UCP1, 2 and 3. The UCP1 consisted of six exons and five introns, and the UCP2 consisted of eight exons and seven introns. The UCP1 was primarily expressed in liver, UCP2 was ubiquitously expressed, and UCP3 was primarily expressed in muscle. The mRNA levels of UCP1 and UCP2 in liver, and UCP3 in muscle were significantly increased after prolonged cold exposure, but did not change after prolonged heat exposure, suggesting that Chinese perch might have a mechanism of response to cold environment, but not to hot environment. The intestinal UCP1 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated after prolonged heat exposure, while the UCP2 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated after prolonged cold exposure, suggesting that the two paralogs might play different roles in intestine of Chinese perch. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis could shed new light on the evolutionary diversification of UCP gene family.",

     "abstract": "Lampreys represent one of the most ancient vertebrate lineages enclosing a special interest for genetic and epigenetic studies. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is an anadromous species that experiences metamorphosis all the way up to the adult stage. Although representing a gradual process, metamorphosis in this species involves dramatic conversions with regard to physiological together with structural body changes preparing individuals for a marine and parasitic life; in consequence, multiple gene expression modifications are expected. The implications of thyroid hormones and HOX gene expression changes have previously been reported in this species and also in other vertebrate species. Nonetheless, information lacks on how these genes are regulated in lampreys. We here report about the existence of methylation pattern differences between the adult and the larvae sea lamprey life cycle stages making use of the Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique. Differentially methylated fragment sequencing allowed to establish homologous identities with HOX genes involved in morphogenesis, along with genes related to the water balance and to the osmotic homoeostasis, all associated to a marine environment adaptation. These results provide evidences revealing that DNA methylation plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of the P. marinus post-natal development representing a starting point for future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which detects DNA methylation changes associated with metamorphosis in lampreys.",

In our in silico attempt to identify cis-regulatory transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) conserved among the xpd promoter sequences from five available fish species, we verified that in some cases the spatial disposition of the putative TFBSs was not maintained, but they were present in all the sequences, allowing the prediction of conserved regulatory elements within the promoter sequences analysed. We also investigated the transcriptional regulation of the zebrafish xpd gene. Our in vitro transient transfection-reporter analysis identified a region in the zebrafish xpd gene responsible for xpd regulation, along with regulatory regions that inhibit the activity of this promoter in somatic cells. Moreover, we found two p53 binding sites in the xpd promoter and upon co-transfection assays we observed a repression due to p53. This provides the first identification and characterization of promoter regions that regulate the transcription of the zebrafish xpd gene, and offers insights into the regulation of this gene by p53.Together, these studies further support the utility of comparative genomics to uncover gene regulatory sequences based on evolutionary conservation and provide the basic information to explore and better understand the regulation and expression of XPD.",

We examined the insect Propsilocerus akamusi larvae to elucidate the metHb reduction system in an organism that inhabits an oxygen-deficient environment. NADH-dependent reduction of metHb in coelomic fluid suggested the coexistence of cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) and cytochrome b5 with hemoglobin in the fluid and that these proteins were involved in physiological metHb reduction in the larvae. The presence of b5R was revealed by purifying b5R to homogeneity from the midge larvae. Using purified components, we showed that larval metHb was reduced via the NADH\u2013b5R (FAD)\u2013cytochrome b5\u2013metHb pathway, a finding consistent with that in aerobic vertebrates, specifically humans and rabbits, and b5R function between mammal and insect was conserved. b5R was identified as a monomeric FAD-containing enzyme; it had a molecular mass of 33.2\u00a0kDa in gel-filtration chromatography and approximately 37\u00a0kDa in SDS-PAGE analysis.

Our results indicate that BPA and E2-treated alligators hatched approximately 1.4\u00a0days earlier than vehicle-treated (control) alligators, suggesting that estrogenic chemicals hasten hatching in these animals. We assessed growth rates, growth allometry, and body condition for 21\u00a0weeks after hatching and found that BPA-treated alligators grew more quickly shortly after hatching but more slowly thereafter compared to control alligators. Conversely, E2-treated alligators grew more slowly shortly after hatching but more quickly thereafter compared to control alligators.

We found that chicken miR-122 was highly expressed in the liver and that its expression in the liver was up-regulated during the early posthatch life. By bioinformatics and reporter gene analyses, we identified PKM2, TGFB3, FABP5 and ARCN1 as miR-122 target genes in the chicken liver. miR-122 knockdown in primary chicken hepatocytes and expression analysis of miR-122 and predicted target mRNAs in the chicken liver suggested that the expression of PKM2 and FABP5 in the chicken liver is regulated by miR-122. Knockdown of miR-122 affected the expression of 123 genes in cultured chicken hepatocytes. Among these genes, the largest cluster, which consisted of 21 genes, was involved in liver metabolism.

(Lepidoptera: Crambidae) were determined to evaluate the role of these lipids in diapause. Substantial changes in the FA composition of triacylglycerols and phospholipids were triggered by diapause development. This led to a significant increase in the overall FA unsaturation (UFAs/SFAs ratio), attributable to an increase in the relative proportion of MUFAs and the concomitant decrease in PUFAs and SFAs. In triacylglycerols, the significant changes in the FAs composition are the result of an increase in the relative proportions of MUFAs, palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) and oleic acid (18:1n-9), and a concomitant reduction in the composition of SFAs and PUFAs, mainly palmitic acid (16:0) and linoleic acid (18:2n-6), respectively. Changes in the composition of phospholipids were more subtle with FAs contributing to the overall increase of FA unsaturation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed that the melt transition temperatures of total lipids prepared from whole larvae, primarily attributable to the triacylglycerol component, were significantly lower during the time course of diapause compared with non-diapause. These observations were correlated to the FA composition of triacylglycerols, most likely enabling them to remain functional during colder winter conditions. We conclude that O. nubilalis undergoes remodeling of FA profiles of both energy storage triacylglycerols and membrane phospholipids as an element of its overwintering physiology which may improve the ability to cold harden during diapause.",

     "abstract": "Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a central enzyme of milk fat synthesis in the ruminant mammary gland. However, the mechanisms regulating goat FASN transcription remain elusive. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which liver X receptor \u03b1 (LXR\u03b1) regulates the FASN promoter in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). In this study, T0901317 (T09), an agonist for LXR\u03b1, significantly enhanced the mRNA expression and promoter activity of FASN. Cloning of the dairy goat FASN promoter revealed the presence of one LXR response element (LXRE) and two sterol regulatory elements (SREs). Deletion or mutation of the FASN promoter LXRE reduced, but did not eliminate the transcriptional response of FASN to T09. While the LXRE and the SREs were both disrupted, basal transcription was severely reduced and there was no response to T09 treatment. This suggested that a complete response required one LXRE and two SREs. Knockdown of LXR\u03b1 by siRNA did not alter the basal or T09-induced transcriptional activity of FASN. However, when sterol regulatory binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was knocked down, T09 significantly increased FASN transcription by wild-type GMECs, but had no effect on cells with LXRE-mutant promoters. The results suggested that LXR regulates FASN promoter activity through direct interaction with the LXRE as well as through increasing SREBP1 abundance. The present study provides insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis in GMECs.",

Currently, limited information about the innate immune system of this animal is known. In this study, the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), designated CgsTLR7, was cloned from Chinese giant salamander, A. davidianus. The full-length cDNA of CgsTLR7 is 3747\u00a0bp, with an open reading frame of 3150\u00a0bp, encoding 1049 amino acids. The TLR family motifs, including the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain are conserved in CgsTLR7, which includes 19 LRRs and a TIR domain. The predicted amino acid sequence of CgsTLR7 has 71%, 65%, 63% and 55% identity with turtle, chicken, human and fugu TLR7 homologues, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CgsTLR7 is closest to that of frog TLR7 among the examined species. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed broad expression of CgsTLR7 in tissues from apparently healthy Chinese giant salamanders with the highest expression in the liver and the lowest expression in the intestine. The mRNA expression was up-regulated and reached a peak level in the kidney, liver and spleen at 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h after infecting the animals with the giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV), respectively.

     "abstract": "Elucidating the processes that create species differences is a central goal of evolutionary biology. The Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) exists as two well-differentiated subspecies groups in North America, the Yellow-shafted (auratus group) and Red-shafted Flickers (cafer group), which differ strikingly in the color of the underside and rachises of flight feathers, and of malar and nuchal patches. We investigated the physiological basis of these conspicuous phenotypic differences by identifying and quantifying the pigments involved. The yellow feathers of auratus contained carotenoids commonly found in nature (lutein, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin and \u03b2-carotene). The orange to red shafts/vanes of cafer and hybrids contained these carotenoids as well as mono- and diketo-carotenoids (notably adonirubin, \u03b1-doradexanthin, canthaxanthin, astaxanthin), representing oxygenated products at carbon C4(4\u2032) of the carotenoids present in auratus. Oxygenation of feather carotenoids at C4(4\u2032) correlated closely with shaft/vane redness. Carotenoid hydroxylation at C3(3\u2032) and the proportion of carotenoids with \u03b5 end-rings also varied with color and belie differences in the activity of several carotenoid-modifying enzymes between the two subspecies groups. Curiously, occasional yellow feathers in red-shafted individuals had the carotenoids of auratus, hence the differences are not constitutive in cafer, underscoring regulatory differences. The red malar stripe of cafer, the black malar stripe and red nuchal patch of auratus all contained similar types and amounts of carotenoids, mostly 3-hydroxy-4-keto-carotenoids. The biochemical differences between two strongly differentiated forms we uncovered shed light on how plumage coloration can change over evolutionary time and point to further avenues of research.",

Moreover, the expression patterns of some innexins were life stage and/or tissue specific, suggestive of potential functional specializations. Cloning of the four full-length cDNAs expressed in the Malpighian tubules of adult females (AeInx1, AeInx2, AeInx3, and AeInx7) revealed evidence for 1) alternative splicing of AeInx1 and AeInx3 transcripts, and 2) putative N-glycosylation of AeInx3 and AeInx7. Finally, immunohistochemistry of AeInx3 in the alimentary canal of larval and adult female mosquitoes confirmed localization of this innexin to the intercellular regions of Malpighian tubule and hindgut epithelial cells, suggesting that it is an important component of GJ in these tissues.",

     "abstract": "We characterized the physiological effects of exposure to pH\u00a09.5 on one domesticated and four wild strains of diploid and triploid juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) over two consecutive years. In the first year, 35\u201370% of the individuals from the wild strains showed a loss of equilibrium (LOE) at 12\u00a0h exposure to pH\u00a09.5, with all fish from wild strains experiencing a LOE by 48\u00a0h. In contrast, <\u00a020% of the domesticated strain showed LOE over the 48\u00a0h exposure to pH\u00a09.5. In our second experiment, similar strain effects were observed, but far fewer fish showed LOE (\u2264\u00a050% in all strains) over 72\u00a0h at pH\u00a09.5. In both experiments, there was no effect of ploidy on time to LOE. In the fish that did not show LOE, high pH exposure resulted in significant increases in plasma, brain and muscle ammonia, with no effect of strain or ploidy on the extent of ammonia accumulation. Glutamine accumulated in the brain during high pH exposure, with a stoichiometric decrease in glutamate, but no differences were noted among strains or ploidies. Lactate also accumulated in the plasma to a similar extent in all trout strains and ploidies. Plasma chloride decreased at 24\u00a0h exposure in all trout strains and ploidies, but recovered by 72\u00a0h. No change was observed in plasma sodium. Overall, our data suggest that the domesticated strain of trout is more tolerant of pH\u00a09.5 than the wild strains, but these differences in tolerance cannot be explained by our sub-lethal assessment of ammonia balance or ion regulation.",

This study aimed to determine homocysteine concentrations, and mRNA expression levels and protein abundances of bhmt1/Bhmt1 in the liver, kidney and muscle of the African lungfish, Protopterus annectens, during the induction (6\u00a0days), maintenance (6\u00a0months) or arousal (3\u00a0days after arousal) phase of aestivation. The homocysteine concentration decreased significantly in the liver of P. annectens after 6\u00a0days or 6\u00a0months of aestivation, but it returned to the control level upon arousal. By contrast, homocysteine concentrations in the kidney and muscle remained unchanged during the three phases of aestivation. The complete coding cDNA sequence of bhmt1 from P. annectens consisted of 1236\u00a0bp, coding for 412 amino acids. The Bhmt1 from P. annectens had a close phylogenetic relationship with those from tetrapods and Callorhinchus milii. The expression of bhmt1 was detected in multiple organs/tissues of P. annectens, and this is the first report on the expression of bhmt1/Bhmt1 in animal skeletal muscle. The mRNA and protein expression levels of bhmt1/Bhmt1 were up-regulated in the liver of P. annectens during the induction and maintenance phases of aestivation, possibly to regulate the hepatic homocysteine concentration. The significant increase in hepatic Bhmt1 protein abundance during the arousal phase could be a response to increased cellular methylation for the purpose of tissue reconstruction. Unlike the liver, Bhmt1 expression in the kidney and muscle of P. annectens was regulated translationally, and its up-regulation could be crucial to prevent homocysteine accumulation.",

The potential specific activities of two major pepsinogens, PG1-1 and PG2-2, against hemoglobin were 51 and 118\u00a0units/mg protein, respectively. The activity of pepsin 2-2 was the highest among the pepsins reported to date; this might be linked to the strongly carnivorous diet of the largemouth bass. The molecular masses of PG1-1 and PG2-2 were 39.0 and 41.0\u00a0kDa, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of PG1-1 and PG2-2 were LVQVPLEVGQTAREYLE- and LVRLPLIVGKTARQALLE-, respectively, showing similarities with those of fish type-A pepsinogens. The optimal pHs for hemoglobin-digestive activity of pepsins 1-1 and 2-2 were around 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, though both pepsins retained considerable activity at pHs over 3.5. They showed maximal activity around 50 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. They were inhibited by pepstatin similarly to porcine pepsin A. The cleavage specificities clarified with oxidized insulin B chain were shown to be restricted to a few bonds consisting of hydrophobic/aromatic residues, such as the Leu15-Tyr16, Phe24-Phe25 and Phe25-Tyr26 bonds. When hemoglobin was used as a substrate, the kcat/Km value of bass pepsin 2-2 was 4.6- to 36.8-fold larger than those of other fish pepsins. In the case of substance P, an ideal pepsin substrate mimic, the kcat/Km values were about 200-fold larger than those of porcine pepsin A, supporting the high activity of the bass pepsin.",

Up to date, little is known about the regulation of its female reproductive cycle. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a glycoprotein hormone, plays a key role in stimulating and regulating ovarian follicular development and egg production. In this study, the complete FSH\u03b2 cDNA from the ovary of the Chinese alligator was obtained for the first time, it consists of 843-bp nucleotides, including 120-bp nucleotides of the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), 396-bp of the open reading frame, and 3\u2032-UTR of 327-bp nucleotides. It encodes a 131-amino acid precursor molecule of FSH\u03b2 with a signal peptide of 18 amino acids followed by a mature protein of 113 amino acids. Its deduced amino acid sequence shares high identities with the American alligator (100%) and birds (89\u201392%). Phylogenetic tree analysis of the FSH\u03b2 amino acid sequence indicated that alligators cluster into the bird branch. Tissue distribution analyses indicated that FSH\u03b2 mRNA is expressed in ovary, intestine and liver with the highest level in the ovary, while not in stomach, pancreas, heart, thymus and thyroid. Expression of FSH\u03b2 in ovary increases in May (breeding prophase) and peaks in July (breeding period), it is maintained at high levels through September, then decreases significantly in November (post-reproductive period) and remains relatively low from January to March (hibernating period). These temporal changes of FSH\u03b2 expression implicated that it might play an important role in promoting ovarian development during the female reproductive cycle.",

PPAR\u03b11 mRNA covered 1879\u00a0bp, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1410\u00a0bp encoding 469 amino acid residues, a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of 49\u00a0bp, and a 3\u2032-UTR of 421\u00a0bp.

The predicted tertiary structure of yellow catfish PPAR\u03b11 showed an increased size of the main cavity that was made up of side chains from helices 3, 5, 10, 11, and 12. Changes of PPAR\u03b11 structure might affect binding of mammalian PPAR\u03b11-specific ligand and cofactor in yellow catfish and may endow yellow catfish PPAR\u03b11 with new ligand-independent or -dependent transactivation activity. PPAR\u03b11 was differentially expressed in various tissues during development. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection in vivo and incubation in vitro of insulin reduced the mRNA expression of PPAR\u03b11 in the liver and hepatocytes of yellow catfish. Based on the observation above, the present study provides evidence that PPAR\u03b11 is differentially expressed within and among tissues during three developmental stages and also regulated by insulin both in vivo and in vitro, which warrants further investigation of PPAR\u03b11 physiological function in fish.",

Temporal expression profiles of both wnt4 genes during embryonic and ovarian development were examined. The expressions of wnt4a and wnt4b genes were first detected at the embryonic morula stage, but the gens showed different expression patterns. During ovarian development, high expression of wnt4a was observed in the ovarian lumen formation and gonium proliferation stage, while wnt4b exhibited strong expression in the early developmental stage of oocytes.

Sequence analysis of the predicted polypeptides revealed a high degree of conservation with those of other vertebrate species and maintenance of important motifs involved in structure and function. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the seven genes into four main clades: \u03b21 (atp1b1a and atp1b1b), \u03b22 (atp1b2a and atp1b2b), \u03b23 (atp1b3a and atp1b3b) and \u03b24 (atp1b4). In juveniles, all paralogous transcripts were detected in the nine tissues examined albeit with different expression patterns. The most ubiquitous expressed gene was atp1b1a whereas atp1b1b was mainly detected in osmoregulatory organs (gill, kidney and intestine), and atp1b2a, atp1b2b, atp1b3a, atp1b3b and atp1b4 in brain. An expression analysis in three brain regions and pituitary revealed that \u03b21-type transcripts were more abundant in pituitary than the other \u03b2 paralogs with slight differences between brain regions. Quantification of mRNA abundance in gills after a salinity challenge showed an activation of atp1b1a and atp1b1b at high salinity water (60\u00a0ppt) and atp1b3a and atp1b3b in response to low salinity (5\u00a0ppt). Transcriptional analysis during larval development showed specific expression patterns for each paralog. Moreover, no differences in the expression profiles between larvae cultivated at 10 and 35\u00a0ppt were observed except for atp1b4 with higher mRNA levels at 10 than 35\u00a0ppt at 18\u00a0days post hatch. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that atp1b1b was mainly localized in gut, pronephric tubule, gill, otic vesicle, and chordacentrum of newly hatched larvae. All these data suggest distinct roles of NKA \u03b2 subunits in tissues, during development and osmoregulation with \u03b21 subunits involved in the adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions and \u03b23 subunits to hypoosmotic environments.",

Surprisingly, 70% of the proteins were recovered in the hydrophobic fraction of membranes solubilized with Triton X-114, while 20% were present in the soluble fraction obtained upon treatment with Na2CO3. 14 major polypeptides, ranging in molecular weight from 65 to 16\u00a0kDa, were found to be associated with the membrane, nine of them behaving as integral membrane proteins. Assessment of their topology in the membrane indicated that the polypeptides of 56, 50, 46 and 32\u00a0kDa have no domains exposed to the cytosol. The 50\u00a0kDa protein is the most abundant one of the glycosomal membrane, where it is peripherically located at the matrix face.

The aim of this work was to study the gene expression response of the ZFL cell line after incubation with different prototypical immune stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), zymosan, and with a special focus on the dsRNA Poly (I:C). Using PCR, microarrays, and confocal microscopy we have explored the response of the ZFL cells against Poly (I:C).

Timing of expression is critical, and characterization of sensitive windows is needed to determine how environmental stressors may perturb sex differentiation. The objectives of this study were to determine whether genes related to steroid biosynthesis, steroid receptor signaling, and those related to sex differentiation were expressed in pre-differentiated fathead minnow (FHM) embryos, an ecotoxicological model. Transcripts were measured over two weeks (1\u00a0day post fertilization (dpf) to 14\u00a0days), prior to sex differentiation. The first three time points investigated (1, 3, and 5\u00a0dpf) corresponded to the neurula stage, dorsal swim bladder pigmentation, and pre-hatch. The fourth time point (6\u00a0dpf) was collected immediately post-hatch and the fifth time point investigated was after 8\u00a0days of larval growth (14\u00a0dpf). The majority of transcripts investigated, for example estrogen, androgen, and thyroid receptors as well as steroid biosynthesis transcripts, were expressed within the first 72\u00a0hours of development; exceptions were star (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein) and cyp19a, which did not have detectable expression until 5\u00a0dpf (pre-hatch). Transcripts that increased in relative mRNA abundance over the first two weeks of development included ar, dax1, hsd11b2, hsd17b, cyp19a and thra. This study demonstrates that there is early expression of transcripts related to steroid biosynthesis, steroid receptor signaling, and sex differentiation in pre-hatch FHM embryos.

However, our knowledge of Schizothorax prenanti GSK-3 is very limited. In this study, we cloned and characterized the S. prenanti GSK3\u03b2 gene. Using qPCR, we found that the GSK3\u03b2 gene was widely expressed in eleven tissues of S. prenanti and had especially high expression levels in the liver and brain. Moreover, we screened and sequenced more than 100 positive clones to identify the alternative transcripts of GSK3\u03b2. Five novel isoforms of GSK3\u03b2 were identified in different S. prenanti tissues; these were different from the GSK3\u03b2 isoforms previously reported in the other species. We named the five transcripts as GSK3\u03b21, GSK3\u03b22, GSK3\u03b23, GSK3\u03b24 and GSK3\u03b25. These consisted of 1266, 1153, 902, 836 and 654 base pairs, respectively.

     "abstract": "The aim of this 14-month feeding study was to investigate the effects of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on tissue fatty acid composition, DHA retention, and DHA content per biomass accrual in muscle tissues of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). A control feed, formulated with a relatively high DHA inclusion level (F1), was compared with feeds containing gradually reduced amounts of DHA (Feeds F2, F3, and F4). Arctic charr were randomly distributed among 12 tanks and fed one of the feeds in triplicate. The DHA content within muscle tissues of fish fed diets F1 and F2 was generally higher compared to fish fed diets F3 and F4. However, there was an interaction between dietary DHA treatment and season, which resulted in fish muscle tissues having similar DHA contents irrespective of dietary supply during specific sampling periods. Although diets F3 and F4 contained ~\u00a04-fold less DHA compared to diets F1 and F2, the retention of DHA in dorsal and ventral muscle tissue was up to 5-fold higher relative to the diet content in fish fed diets F3 and F4. However, the difference among treatments was dependent on the month sampled. In addition, younger fish retained DHA more efficiently compared to older fish. DHA (\u03bcg DHA/g/day) accrual in muscle tissue was independent of somatic growth, and there was no difference among treatments. The results suggested that dietary DHA may be essential throughout the life cycle of Arctic charr and that the DHA content of muscle tissues was influenced by diet and metabolic/physiological factors, such as specific DHA retention during the entire growth cycle . Finally, this long-term feeding study in Arctic charr indicated a non-linear function in DHA retention in dorsal and ventral muscle tissues throughout the life cycle, which varied in its relationship to dietary DHA.",

In the present study, DNA methylation levels of tissues of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus were analyzed by the fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP) technique over three stages of the aestivation cycle. Overall, a total of 26,963 fragments were amplified including 9112 methylated fragments among four sea cucumber tissues using 18 pairs of selective primers. Results indicated an average DNA methylation level of 33.79% for A. japonicus. The incidence of DNA methylation was different across tissue types in the non-aestivation stage: intestine (30.16%), respiratory tree (27.61%), muscle (27.94%) and body wall (56.25%). Our results show that hypermethylation accompanied deep-aestivation in A. japonicus, which suggests that DNA methylation may have an important role in regulating global transcriptional suppression during aestivation.

The blunt snout bream Ctgfa and Ctgfb were found to be highly divergent, sharing a relatively low sequence identity of 57%. During embryogenesis, Ctgfa mRNA expression levels were low, gradually decreased from zygotes to 12\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf), markedly increased from 16\u00a0hpf, and then stabilized from 32 to 40\u00a0hpf. Ctgfb expression levels were constant but low from zygotes to 20\u00a0hpf, then gradually increased from 24 to 40\u00a0hpf. Ctgfa mRNA was expressed in the adaxial cells of the somites, floor plate, and tailbud at 24\u00a0hpf, and in the notochord and ethmoid plate at 36\u00a0hpf, whereas Ctgfb mRNA was weakly expressed in the adaxial cells and floor plate at 24\u00a0hpf, and in the notochord at 36\u00a0hpf. In adult fish, Ctgfa mRNA was strongly expressed in the kidney, brain, intestine, muscles, and skin, while Ctgfb mRNA was detected in all examined tissues. During hypoxic treatment, the mRNA levels of both Ctgfa and -b were significantly upregulated in the gill and liver, whereas Ctgfa mRNAs in the brain and kidney and Ctgfb mRNAs in the kidney significantly decreased.

We have, in the past, characterized ChEs in two acraniate deuterostomes: amphioxus (a cephalochordate) and Ciona intestinalis (a urochordate). Here we present results on an AChE from a basal deuterostome, a model hemichordate, the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii. Of the eight genes coding for putative ChE-like proteins possessing Trp84, a characteristic of the choline-binding catalytic subsite of ChEs, we cloned a full length cDNA with a coding sequence typical of an acraniate AChE possessing a C-terminal exon coding for a typical T-peptide. We then used in vitro expression of the cDNA in COS-7 cells to characterize the AChE kinetically, pharmacologically, and biochemically. The cDNA codes for an AChE (AChE1), which is found in monomeric (G1), dimeric (G2), and tetrameric (G4) forms; and interacts with poly-L-proline, PRiMA, and ColQ, characteristic of an AChE possessing a T-peptide. The expression of the AChE is temperature dependent, with greater expression at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. We discuss the implications of these data for the evolution of the ChEs in the deuterostomes.",

Water salinity in the Lake Hinuma is low and stable due to the long distance from the Pacific Ocean, whereas that in the downstream of the river varies daily due to a strong effect of tidal waters. In the present study, we dissected the gill and foot muscle of brackish water clam collected from these areas, and subjected them to metabolome analysis by capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. More than 200 metabolites including free amino acids, peptides and organic acids were identified, and their amounts from the foot muscle tend to be higher than those from the gill. The principal component analysis revealed that the amount of each metabolite was different among sampling areas and between the gill and foot muscle, whereas no apparent differences were observed between male and female specimens. When the metabolites in the female clam at high salinity were compared with those at low salinity, concentrations of \u03b2-alanine, choline, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, ornithine and glycine betaine were found to be changed in association with salinity. We also compared various metabolites in relation to metabolic pathways, suggesting that many enzymes were involved in their changes depending on salinity.",

Both of flounder Pax3a-1 and Pax3b-1 contain the conserved paired domain (PD), an octapeptide motif (OP), and a paired type homeodomain (HD). But the PD domain in Pax3a-2 and Pax3b-3 is not intact and there is no HD in Pax3b-2 and Pax3b-3. Pax3a and Pax3b show distinct temporal expression patterns during embryogenesis. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrates that Pax3a and Pax3b are expressed in overlapping patterns in the dorsal central nervous system, with some subtle regional differences between the two genes. In addition, Pax3a is scattered in the somites while Pax3b is specifically expressed in the newly forming somites. RT-PCR results have shown that there were different expression patterns between the different isoforms. These results indicate subfunction partitioning of the duplicated Pax3 genes.

The family Holothuriidae has been increasingly studied in search for these compounds. With many species awaiting recognition and formal description this family currently consists of five genera and the systematics at the species-level taxonomy is, however, not yet fully understood. We provide a bibliographic review of the triterpene glycosides that has been reported within the Holothuriidae and analyzed the relationship of certain compounds with the presence of Cuvierian tubules. We found 40 species belonging to four genera and 121 compounds. Holothurin A and B are the most common saponins for Actinopyga, Holothuria, and Pearsonothuria. The genus Bohadschia presents mainly bivittoside C and D. Actinopyga has only sulfated saponins mainly oxidized, Bohadschia non-sulfated ones mainly non-oxidized, Holothuria and Pearsonothuria contain both types of compounds, mainly oxidized. Within the genus Holothuria, the subgenus Panningothuria only has non-sulfated saponins. The presence of sulfated and non-sulfated compounds seemingly relates to the expellability or the absence of Cuvierian tubules and the temporal or permanent concealing habits of the species. Our study concludes that better insights into the systematic distribution of saponins in Holothuriidae will only be possible if the identifications of the investigated species are confirmed by a taxonomist, especially in this group wherein cryptic species and variation between life-history stages are common and yet poorly understood. Understanding of saponin distribution within the Holothuriidae would also benefit from a stabilization of triterpene glycoside nomenclature.",

In this study we have examined these two enzymes further and show differences in their in vivo function during X. laevis embyrogenesis as evidenced by in situ hybridization and overexpression experiments. In terms of enzymatic activity, both enzymes were found to be active towards the EA2 peptide, but display differential activity towards a peptide based on the sequence of ActR-IIB, a receptor relevant to TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling.

Furthermore, changes in their mRNA expressions were assessed by real time PCR in specimens maintained under the different feeding patterns. Results showed a negative growth in starved and re-feeding groups. Starvation induced a significant increase in plasma triglycerides as well as a decrease in liver glucose and glycogen. Re-feeding increased plasma glucose, lactate and protein, as well as liver glucose and glycogen. In addition, starvation significantly increased pituitary GH expression, while re-feeding down-regulated it. No significant changes were observed in hepatic IGF-I expression in any dietary treatment. Digestive enzyme activities were not significantly affected either by starvation or by re-feeding.

In the present study, we cloned and sequenced c-type lysozyme cDNAs, constructed the recombinant protein over-expression of c-type lysozyme and analyzed the expression of transcription level in various tissues. The c-type lysozyme cDNA contained an open reading frame of 759\u00a0bp encoding a polypeptide of 252 amino acids. The molecular weight of the deduced amino acid of AjcLYZ is 26.7\u00a0kDa with an estimated pI of 4.66. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that AjcLYZ had two highly conserved active sites (Glu147 and Asp159) and eight typical Cys residues. The tertiary structure and modeled AjcLYZ showed structural similarity to Meretrix lusoria LYZ. The results of mRNA transcripts showed that the highest expression was found in the tube foot, followed by the muscle, body wall, and coelomic fluid. In contrast, the intestine, tentacle and respiratory tree exhibited very low expression levels. Under salinity stress, significant down-regulation of AjcLYZ was observed in response to salinity stress in the intestine and coelomic fluid. Significant up-regulation and down-regulation of AjcLYZ were observed in response to salinity stress in body wall and respiratory tree. The purified recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and a single band with a molecular mass of 45.09\u00a0kDa, which was in agreement with the theoretical size (26.7\u00a0kDa for AjcLYZ and 18.39\u00a0kDa Trx-His-S tags) of the recombinant protein. Radial diffusion assay was employed to determine the antimicrobial spectrum of recombinant AjcLYZ against three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and three sea cucumber pathogenic Vibrio species. From the radius of the antimicrobial zone, it was found that recombinant AjcLYZ harbored remarkable in vitro inhibitive effect on tested Gram-positive bacteria, while lytic activity against Gram-negative bacteria was relatively weak. The results will provide new clues about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the salinity adaption system.",

In our study, we obtained the full-length HDAC4 cDNA, which included the coding region of 3171\u00a0bp, a 180\u00a0bp 5\u2032untranslated region (UTR) and a 760\u00a0bp 3\u2032UTR. The deduced HDAC4 protein contained all known functional domains identified in other organisms. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that Paralichthys olivaceus HDAC4 had the highest identity with the Takifugu rubripes. Tissue distribution analysis indicated that HDAC4 is abundantly expressed in muscle, and its levels are significantly higher in muscle than in other tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). HDAC4 mRNA levels at 3\u00a0dph (days post hatching) and 36\u00a0dph were higher than that in other stages. Exogenous thyroid hormones either directly or indirectly promoted the expression of HDAC4 mRNA during metamorphosis, indicating that HDAC4 might directly or indirectly be regulated by thyroid hormone during muscle development in metamorphosis. To identify the miRNAs targeting HDAC4, we performed a luciferase reporter assay and verified that HDAC4 is a common target gene of miR-1 and miR-133a indicating that HDAC4 might be involved in a signal pathway of microRNA regulating muscle development.",

     "abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN), also known as GDF8, is a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily and plays an important role in muscle growth, development, and differentiation. Recently, Lv-MSTN/GDF11, the primitive isoform of MSTN and GDF11, was identified from the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The major production site for Lv-MSTN/GDF11 is in the heart, not the tail muscle, which differs from MSTNs in mammals. Among the three injected RNAs, long dsRNA was the most effective for Lv-MSTN/GDF11 knockdown and transcripts of Lv-MSTN/GDF11 decreased in both the heart (88.85%) and skeletal muscles (43.36%) 72\u00a0h after injection of 10\u00a0pmol of long dsRNA. We also found that higher doses of dsRNA did not lead to greater decreases in Lv-MSTN/GDF11 transcripts for amounts between 1\u00a0pmol and 100\u00a0pmol. Injection of Lv-MSTN/GDF11 dsRNA did not affect the upregulation of the skeletal actin gene (Lv-ACTINSK) in the tail muscle, but the expression of cytoplasmic and cardiac actins were upregulated in both the heart and tail muscle. Over the course of 8\u00a0weeks of dsRNA injection, considerably higher mortality (~\u00a071%) was seen in the dsRNA-injected group compared to the control group (40%). Surviving shrimp in the dsRNA injected group had a lower growth rate due to the adverse effects of Lv-MSTN/GDF11 knockdown. Lv-MSTN/GDF11 appears to be involved in muscular or neuronal development, but not in doubling muscle fibers, as is the case with mammalian MSTN.",

     "abstract": "In many cultured fish species, such as salmonids, gonadal development occurs at the expense of stored energy and nutrients, including lipids. However, mechanisms regulating nutrient repartitioning during sexual maturation are not well understood. This study compared sexually maturing diploid (2\u00a0N) and sterile triploid (3\u00a0N) female rainbow trout to investigate effects of sexual maturation on expression of 35 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, including genes within fatty acid synthesis, \u03b2-oxidation, and cofactors of the mTOR and PPAR signaling pathways, in liver, white muscle, and visceral adipose tissue. Diploid fish were fed at different rations (0.25% and 0.50% tank biomass, and satiation) to determine effects of ration on gene expression. Gene expression was affected by ration level only in white muscle; erk and acat2 had higher expression in fish fed higher rations. On the other hand, sexual maturation affected gene expression across all three tissue types. Data indicate 2\u00a0N fish have higher expression of \u03b2-oxidation genes within white muscle and within visceral adipose tissue. These findings support enhanced fatty acid mobilization within these tissues during sexual maturation. Higher expression of fatty acid synthesis genes in 3\u00a0N female liver is associated with higher expression of mTOR cofactors and ppar\u03b3, which reflects continued deposition of lipids in these fish. Furthermore, greater expression of genes involved in \u03b2-oxidation pathways across ration levels in 2\u00a0N females suggests that sexual maturation and the associated maturation-related signals are stronger regulators of lipid metabolism-related genes rather the rations applied in the current study.",

We demonstrate the presence of endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase, \u03b2-glucosidase and total cellulase activities in the digestive juice of this crab. The highest total cellulase activity was observed at mildly acidic pH (5 to 6) and temperature between 30 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. A 1752\u00a0bp cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1386\u00a0bp encoding a putative endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase (EG) of 461 amino acids was identified in the crab's hepatopancreas using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloning and sequencing techniques. P. erythodactyla endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase (PeEG) contains a glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GHF9) catalytic domain with all catalytically important residues conserved, and shows high sequence identity to GHF9 EGs reported from other arthropods. The endogenous origin of PeEG was confirmed by PCR amplification of a ~\u00a01.5\u00a0kb DNA fragment, containing a phase 1 intron flanked by two exon sequences identical to the cDNA, from genomic DNA isolated from the crab's muscle tissue. PeEG encoding cDNA is the first endogenous EG sequence reported from the brachyuran crabs.

     "abstract": "Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1) has been implicated as an important regulator in mammalian muscle development. Our previous studies showed that different alternative splicing isoforms have distinct functions in the regulation of myogenesis in mice. Unlike most mammals, including mice, pigs, cattle, and sheep, DLK1 mRNA for avian species has a single form without alternative splicing. In the current study, we have used QM7 cells, a quail myoblast, to study the role of DLK1 in the regulation of avian myogenesis. Overexpression of DLK1 inhibited myogenesis with a lower fusion rate and thinner myotube compared to the control QM7 cells. Comparison of relative levels of protein and mRNA showed down-regulation of PAX7, MYOG, and MHC, and up-regulation of MYOD by DLK1, suggesting that quail DLK1 inhibits myogenesis at later stages of myogenic differentiation and myotube formation. DLK1 reduced the QM7 cell growth rate which is accompanied by a lower percentage of bromodeoxyuridine positive cells, indicating an inhibitory role of DLK1 in proliferation. During the early post-hatch ages, the relatively slower increase in the amount of total DNA mass in breast muscle of the heavy weight quail line, that has been selected for over 40 generations, could be partially explained by the higher expression of DLK1 compared to the control quail. Taken together, DLK1 inhibits myogenic differentiation and proliferation by regulating the expression levels of myogenic factors in quail. In addition, the regulation of expression level and cleavage of full-length DLK1 may be important factors for regulating myogenesis in quail having no splicing variants of DLK1.",

Next, we examined the relationship of these pituitary POMC genes to camouflage color change, blind-side hypermelanosis, and appetite by quantifying mRNA expression. Olive flounder (of)-POMC1, 2, and 3 cDNAs consisted of 648-bp, 582-bp, and 693-bp open reading frames (ORF) encoding 216 aa, 194 aa, and 231 aa residues, respectively. Structurally, the three of-POMC cDNAs consisted of seven peptides (signal peptide, N-POMC, \u03b1-MSH, CLIP, N-\u03b2-LPH, \u03b2-MSH and \u03b2-END [or END-like peptide]) that are similar to those of other fish POMC cDNAs. \u03b1-MSH encoded a protein composed of 13 aa and \u03b2-MSH encoded a protein composed of 17 aa. The three POMC genes were predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland, but they were also expressed in a variety of tissues, including brain, eye, kidney, heart, testis, and skin. of-POMC2 exhibited the highest expression, while of-POMC3 displayed the lowest expression. The relative levels of of-POMC1 and 3 mRNAs were not influenced by background color and feeding (or fasting), but the relative level of of-POMC2 mRNA significantly increased in response to a dark background and fasting. The relative levels of of-POMC1 and 2 mRNAs were significantly higher in hypermelanic fish; however, we did not determine a direct anorexigenic or orexigenic relationship for the three POMC genes. These results indicate that pituitary POMC genes are related to darkening color change and the differentiation of pigment cells, but they are not directly related to appetite.",

In previous work, we identified three splice variants of Procambarus clarkii SCP (pcSCP1a, pcSCP1b, and pcSCP1c) that differ in a 37 amino acid region that lies mainly between the 2nd and 3ed EF-hand calcium binding domain. To evaluate the function of the proteins encoded by the pcSCP1 transcripts, we produced recombinant pcSCP1 and used tryptophan fluorescence to characterize calcium binding. Tryptophan fluorescence of pcSCP1a decreased in response to increased calcium, while tryptophan fluorescence of the pcSCP1b and pcSCP1c variants increased. We estimated calcium binding constants and Hill coefficients with two different equations: the standard Hill equation and a modified Hill equation that accounts for contributions from two different tryptophans. The approaches gave similar results. Steady-state calcium binding constants (Kd) ranged from 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a08\u00a0M to 5.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M, consistent with previous work. Variants displayed significantly different apparent calcium affinities, which were decreased in the presence of magnesium. Calcium Kd was lowest for pcSCP1a and highest for pcSCP1c. Site-directed mutagenesis of pcSCP1c residues to the amino acids of pcSCP1b decreased the calcium Kd, identifying residues outside the EF-hand domains that contribute to calcium binding in crayfish SCP.",

It is known that environmental characteristics, such as salinity, affect immune and physiological parameters of bivalves. Nevertheless, scarce information is available concerning the biochemical alterations associated with salinity changes. For this reason, the present work aimed to evaluate the biochemical responses of three venerid clam species (Venerupis decussata, Venerupis corrugata, Venerupis philippinarum) submitted to salinity changes. The effects on the native (V. decussata and V. corrugata) and invasive (V. philippinarum) species collected from the same sampling site and submitted to the same salinity gradient (0 to 42\u00a0g/L) were compared. The results obtained demonstrated that V. corrugata is the most sensitive species to salinity changes and V. decussata is the species that can tolerate a wider range of salinities. Furthermore, our work showed that clams under salinity associated stress can alter their biochemical mechanisms, such as increasing their antioxidant defenses, to cope with the higher oxidative stress resulting from hypo and hypersaline conditions. Among the physiological and biochemical parameters analyzed (glycogen and protein content; lipid peroxidation levels, antioxidant enzymes activity; total, reduced and oxidized glutathione) Catalase (CAT) and especially superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed to be useful biomarkers to assess salinity impacts in clams.",

Triglyceride (TG) content, activity and expression of several key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, as well as mRNA levels of key transcription factors related to lipid metabolism, were assessed at 0\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h, respectively. Insulin incubation tended to increase the activities and expression of several lipogenic enzymes (such as FAS, G6PD, 6PGD). However, reduced CPT I gene expression was observed in hepatocytes following incubation treatment. Insulin administration also tended to up-regulate SREBP-1 expression but down-regulate PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels. Insulin incubation enhanced lipogenesis and reduced lipolysis of freshly isolated hepatocytes of yellow catfish, in coincidence with increased TG content. Pearson correlations between expression of SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b1, and expression and activity of several enzymes were also observed, especially at 48-h insulin incubation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to study the effects of insulin on lipogenesis and lipolysis at both transcriptional and enzymatic levels using primary hepatocytes culture model in fish, which will help to understand the regulation of lipid metabolism by insulin in vivo, and will give us new insight into the insulin role in nutrient metabolism in fish.",

In this study, a systematic differential expression analysis of genes involved in high temperature-induced sex differentiation was done in the Nile tilapia gonad and brain.

The expressions of GTH\u03b1, LH\u03b2 and ER\u03b1 were also significantly down-regulated in the brain of both sexes in the induction and recovery groups. On the contrary, the expression of CYP11B2 was significantly up-regulated in the ovary, but not in the testis in both groups. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that there are significant correlations between the expressions of CYP19A1A, FOXL2, or DMRT1 in the gonads and the expression of some genes in the brain. Another result in this study showed that high temperature up-regulated the expression level of DNMT1 in the testis of the induction group, and DNMT1 and DNMT3A in the female brain of both groups. The expression and correlation analysis of HSPs showed that high temperature action on tilapia HSPs might indirectly induce the expression changes of sex differentiation genes in the gonads.

Various studies have clearly demonstrated the key roles of specific TGF-\u03b2 members in muscle growth, including myostatin and inhibin as well as genes, such as follistatin. By binding to TGF-\u03b2 members, follistatin prevents TGF-\u03b2 from binding to its receptors and thus neutralizes its activity. Here, we report the identification of the gene sequences of four TGF-\u03b2 isoforms and three paralogs of TGF-\u03b21, which we called TGF-\u03b21a, TGF-\u03b21b and TGF-\u03b21c, four sequences of inhibin \u03b2A paralogs; and two sequences of follistatin paralogs from rainbow trout. A phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated the existence of four monophyletic clades, corresponding to TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22, -\u03b23 and -\u03b26. Based on their sequence identity TGF-\u03b21a and -\u03b21c are grouped together, whereas TGF-\u03b21b appears more divergent even though it is grouped within the TGF-\u03b21 clade. Alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that the protein sequences of TGF-\u03b2, inhibin \u03b2A and follistatin are extremely well conserved (>\u00a090%) relative to each other; however, their regulation and expression patterns are different. TGF-\u03b22 and -\u03b23 showed the most abundant expression in muscle and were the main TGF-\u03b2 members expressed in this tissue. Follistatin and inhibin \u03b2A paralogs were expressed in all tissues examined but with different patterns. Our identification of multiple copies of TGF-\u03b2, inhibin \u03b2A and follistatin with different expression patterns suggests non-redundant functions for these paralogs in rainbow trout.",

In this study, two Gadd45g genes were isolated from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). Using chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 were located on the W and Z chromosomes, respectively. The full-length cDNA sequences of Gadd45g1 (1270\u00a0bp) and Gadd45g2 (1181\u00a0bp) were predicted to contain a 480-bp coding sequence that could encode a protein of 159 amino acids residues. A phylogenetic tree showed that the predicted Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 amino acid sequences clustered closely in one branch. It is proposed that Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 are paralogous genes derived from the divergence of the sex chromosome. Ka/Ks ratios indicated that Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 may have undergone a high number of mutations and have a divergence time of only about 68,000\u00a0years, although Gadd45g homologs are highly conserved. The qRT-PCR demonstrated that Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 were highly expressed in ovary, and negligibly expressed in testis of male and neo-male. During development of the ovary (from 80 to 150\u00a0days), the expression levels of both genes reached high levels. Gadd45g1 was also highly expressed at 50\u00a0days, the stage just before gonad differentiation in C. semilaevis. All these findings imply functional divergence of the two Gadd45g homologs; Gadd45g1 may be necessary for sex differentiation in the early stage of gonad development, and then Gadd45g1 and Gadd45g2 maintain ovary development and the female character of half-smooth tongue sole.",

Additionally, the effects of pH (3.0\u201311.0) and temperature (30\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C) on enzyme activities were evaluated. All enzymes investigated were detected in the gut extracts of worker and soldier termites. Endoglucanase and \u03b2-xylanase were the main cellulase and hemicellulase, respectively. Zymography for proteases of worker extracts revealed polypeptides of 22, 30, and 43\u00a0kDa that hydrolyzed casein, and assays using protease inhibitors showed that serine proteases were the main proteases in worker and soldier guts. The determined enzyme activities and their response to different pH and temperature values revealed that workers and soldiers contained a distinct digestive apparatus. The ability of these termites to efficiently digest the main components of lignocellulosic materials stimulates the purification of gut enzymes. Further investigation into their biotechnological potential as well as whether the enzymes detected are produced by the termites or by their symbionts is needed.",

     "abstract": "The goal of this study was to identify and analyze the lipid metabolic pathways involved in energy production and ecdysteroid synthesis in the ectoparasite copepod Caligus rogercresseyi. Massive transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed during the infectious copepodid larval stage, during the attached chalimus larval stage, and also in female and male adults. Thirty genes were selected for describing the pathways, and these were annotated for proteins or enzymes involved in lipid digestion, absorption, and transport; fatty acid degradation; the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies; and steroid and ecdysteroid syntheses. Differential expression of these genes was analyzed by ontogenic stage and discussed considering each stage's feeding habits and energetic needs. Copepodids showed a low expression of fatty acid digestion genes, reflected by a non-feeding behavior, and the upregulation of genes involved in steroid biosynthesis, which was consistent with a pathway for cholesterol synthesis during ecdysis. The chalimus stage showed an upregulation of genes related to fatty acid digestion, absorption, and transport, as well as to fatty acid degradation and the synthesis of ketone bodies, therefore suggesting that lipids ingested from the mucus and skin of the host fish are metabolized as important sources of energy. Adult females also showed a pattern of high lipid metabolism for energy supply and mobilization in relation to reproduction and vitellogenesis. Adult females and males revealed different lipid metabolism patterns that reflected different energetic needs. This study reports for the first time the probable lipid metabolic pathways involved in the energy production and ecdysteroid synthesis of C. rogercresseyi.",

In this study, we describe a cytosolic Cu/ZnSOD, the second SOD member from rock bream Oplegnathus fasciatus (Of-cCu/ZnSOD) at molecular, genomic structural-, transcriptional- and functional-levels. The determination of genomic arrangement of Of-cCu/ZnSOD by means of a BAC library revealed that its primary transcript is represented by five exons and encoded a peptide of 154 amino acids. In silico investigation of Of-cCu/ZnSOD indicated the presence of several family characteristics including two Cu/ZnSOD signatures, seven metal liganding residues and eight \u03b2-sheets forming a \u03b2-barrel topology. Alignment and modeling studies confirmed the conservation of Cu/ZnSOD at primary and tertiary levels. While invertebrate Cu/ZnSOD members mainly demonstrate a tetraexonic structure, the vertebrate members have acquired an additional intron in the third exon resulting in a quinquepartite arrangement with class-specific exon lengths. Although, teleost Cu/ZnSOD members resembled the mammalian orthologs in their genomic organization, they shared a proximal position with molluscan members in the phylogeny. The antioxidant (AO) activity of Of-cCu/ZnSOD was affirmed by a recombinant protein which was also used to examine the biophysical and biochemical properties. The pronounced activity was detected when the rOf-cCu/ZnSOD was expressed with the Cu2\u00a0+ and Zn2\u00a0+ supplementation. The optimum activities were observed at pH\u00a010 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and KCN strongly inhibited the activity of the rOf-cCu/ZnSOD. Furthermore, a constitutive mRNA expression of Of-cCu/ZnSOD with higher levels in blood\u00a0>\u00a0liver\u00a0>\u00a0heart and brain was observed, which was consistent with the transcriptional profile of Of-mMnSOD, suggesting important physiological role(s). This idea was further strengthened by the temporal assessment of Of-cCu/ZnSOD transcripts in animals under pathological (bacteria- or viral-induced) and physiological (H2O2-induced oxidative) stress conditions using qPCR, in which it exhibited significantly up-regulated levels. Screening of Of-cCu/ZnSOD 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of several important transcription factor binding sites that potentially govern the Cu/ZnSOD expression. These findings conjointly contribute to expand our understanding regarding the piscine Cu/ZnSODs and; in particular, the AO enzyme network of rock bream.",

In this study, we cloned the full length cDNA of a QRFP precursor in a teleost fish, the orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). Sequence analysis has shown that the functional regions of QRFP in other vertebrates (QRFP-25 and QRFP-7) are conserved in orange-spotted grouper. RT-PCR demonstrated that the pre-processed mRNA of QRFP is widely expressed in orange-spotted grouper. Three days of food deprivation did not change the hypothalamic pre-processed QRFP expression. However, QRFP expression significantly increased when the fish were reefed after three days of fasting. Intraperitoneal injection of QRFP-25 peptide to orange-spotted grouper suppressed expression of orexin, but elevated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus. We also investigated the effects of QRFP-25 on the expression of reproductive genes. The peptide suppressed the expression of seabream-type gonadotropin-releasing hormones (sbGnRH), luteinizing hormone beta subunit (LH\u03b2) and follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit (FSH\u03b2) in vivo, as well as inhibited the expression of LH\u03b2 and FSH\u03b2 in pituitary cells in primary culture.

Early stages of steroidogenesis specifically cholesterol to pregnenolone conversion by Cyp11a1 is crucial for estradiol and testosterone biosynthesis. Based on this, in this study, full length cDNA of cyp11a1 (2581\u00a0bp) was cloned from catfish testis to investigate the importance of Cyp11a1 by analyzing the expression of cyp11a1 during gonadal development, seasonal reproductive cycle, after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induction and sex steroid analog treatment. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Cyp11a1 is more conserved across teleosts. Tissue distribution analysis showed that the cyp11a1 expression was higher in the testis followed by the brain, head kidney, muscle and ovary compared to other tissues analyzed. High expression of cyp11a1 in the head kidney and muscle revealed that Cyp11a1 could potentially regulate the extra-gonadal and/or circulating steroid levels in teleosts. Developing and mature testes showed higher expression of cyp11a1 than the ovary of corresponding age group. Further, cyp11a1 expression was found to be higher during pre-spawning and spawning phases of testicular cycle and was upregulated by hCG, in vivo and in vitro, which indicates the possible regulation by gonadotropin. Exposure of methyltestosterone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and ethinylestradiol (1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) for 21\u00a0days during catfish testicular development showed lower cyp11a1 expression levels in the testis and brain indicating a certain feedback intervention.

     "abstract": "One of the most fundamental biological processes in living organisms that are affected by environmental fluctuations is growth. In fish, skeletal muscle accounts for the largest proportion of body mass, and the growth of this tissue is mainly controlled by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. By using the carp (Cyprinus carpio), a fish that inhabits extreme conditions during winter and summer, we assessed the skeletal muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization and the relation of IGF signaling with protein synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis. The expression of igf1 in muscle decreased during winter in comparison with summer, whereas the expression for both paralogues of igf2 did not change significantly between seasons. The expression of igf1 receptor a (igf1ra), but not of igf1rb, was down-regulated in muscle during the winter as compared to the summer. A decrease in protein contents and protein phosphorylation for IGF signaling molecules in muscle was observed in winter-acclimatized carp. This was related with a decreased expression in muscle for markers of myogenesis (myoblast determination factor (myod), myogenic factor 5 (myf5), and myogenin (myog)); protein synthesis (myosin heavy chain (mhc) and myosin light chain (mlc3 and mlc1b)); and ribosomal biogenesis (pre-rRNA and ribosomal proteins). IGF signaling, and key markers of ribosomal biogenesis, protein synthesis, and myogenesis were affected by seasonal acclimatization, with differential regulation in gene expression and signaling pathway activation observed in muscle between both seasons. This suggests that these molecules are responsible for the muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization in carp.",

The LC-PUFA are essential components in fish diets for maintaining optimal health, physiology and growth. However, most marine fish including Atlantic cod are inefficient at producing LC-PUFA from shorter chain precursors. Since elovl genes encode enzymes that play key roles in fatty acid biosynthesis, we hypothesized that they may be involved in Atlantic cod responses to diets rich in 18:3\u03c93 and 18:2\u03c96. Ten members of the cod elovl gene family were characterized at the mRNA level. RT-PCR was used to study constitutive expression of elovl transcripts in fifteen tissues. Some transcripts (e.g. elovl5) were ubiquitously expressed, while others had tissue-specific expression (e.g. elovl4a in brain and eye). Cod fed a CO-containing diet (100% CO replacement of FO and including solvent-extracted fish meal) had significantly lower weight gain, with significant up-regulation of elovl5 and fadsd6 transcripts in the liver as shown by QPCR analysis, compared with cod on a FO control diet after a 13-week trial. Multivariate statistical analyses (SIMPER and PCA) indicated that high 18:3\u03c93 and/or low \u03c93 LC-PUFA levels in the liver were associated with the up-regulation of elovl5 and fadsd6, which are involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis in cod.",

Phylogenetic analysis clustered the five genes into three main clades: \u03b11 (designated atp1a1a and atp1a1b), \u03b12 (designated atp1a2) and \u03b13 (designated atp1a3a and atp1a3b) isoforms.

Quantification of mRNA abundance after a salinity challenge showed that atp1a1a transcript levels increased significantly in the gill of soles transferred to high salinity water (60\u00a0ppt). In contrast, atp1a3a transcripts increased at low salinity (5\u00a0ppt). In situ hybridization (ISH) analysis revealed that the number of ionocytes expressing atp1a1a transcripts in the primary gill filaments was higher at 35 and 60\u00a0ppt than at 5\u00a0ppt and remained undetectable or at very low levels in the lamellae at 5 and 35\u00a0ppt but increased at 60\u00a0ppt. Immunohistochemistry showed a higher number of positive cells in the lamellae. Whole-mount analysis of atp1a1a mRNA in young sole larvae revealed that it was localized in gut, pronephric tubule, gill, otic vesicle, yolk sac ionocytes and chordacentrum.

We discovered 12 important chemosensory genes, termed odorant binding protein (OBP) fragments. Subsequently, the entire open reading frames of these putative OBPs were obtained by RACE.

Results revealed that purified recombinant SfurOBP2 and SfurOBP11 bound several rice plant volatiles.

Fxyd11 mRNA was predominantly expressed in gills, whereas fxyd12 mRNA was mainly distributed in kidneys and intestines. Acute hyposaline stress altered the activity of NKA and the expression of fxyd11 and fxyd12 in gills, kidneys, and intestines. Branchial fxyd11 mRNA expression remained at a low level during freshwater acclimation, whereas NKA activity increased, showing a negative correlation that differed from previous reports. Similarly, renal expression of fxyd11 and fxyd12 mRNA was negatively correlated with NKA activity. Unlike in gills and kidneys, intestinal NKA activity and mRNA expression of fxyd11 and fxyd12 were comparably suppressed. Taken together, the salinity-dependent expression of fxyd11 and fxyd12, and correlation with NKA activity suggested that both fxyd11 and fxyd12 were involved in the response to acute hyposaline challenge in the spotted scat.",

At embryonic day (D) D16, D18, D19, and D20 of incubation, the expression of HO-1 in the lungs of chicken embryos (Tibet and Shouguang chickens) incubated in normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (13% O2) conditions was measured. SNPs were screened within 5\u2032-flanking region and coding regions with PCR-sequencing and the genotype of the SNPs was determined with PCR-RFLP in Tibet, Chahua and Shouguang chicken populations. In conclusion, the Tibet chicken had higher HO-1 expression on D19 under hypoxic incubation and had two SNPs with different frequency distributions from other chicken breeds, which might be a way that the Tibet chicken had hereditary adaptation to hypoxia during embryonic development.",

     "abstract": "Endogenous opioids are derived from four related polypeptide precursors: proenkephalin (PENK), prodynorphin (PDYN), pronociceptin (PNOC) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC). In mammals PENK encodes for four copy of Met-enkephalin, one octapeptide Met-enkephalin-Arg-Gly-Leu, one heptapeptide Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe and a single copy of Leu-enkephalin. Our detailed bioinformatic search on the existing PENK sequences revealed several atypical hexapeptide Met-enkephalins in different vertebrate animals. They are located either in the second enkephalin unit or in the seventh enkephalin core position at the C-terminus. Altogether four different hexapeptide sequences were obtained representing eleven animal species: Met-enkephalin-Arg6 (YGGFM R ) in the bird zebra finch, Met-enkephalin-Asp6 (YGGFM D ), Met-enkephalin-Ile6 (YGGFM I ) in zebrafish; and Met-enkephalin-Ser6 (YGGFM S ) in two pufferfish species. All novel peptides were chemically synthesized and studied in receptor binding and G-protein activation assays performed on rat brain membranes. The four novel enkephalins were equipotent in stimulating G-proteins. Affinities of the peptides determined by equilibrium competition assays in receptor binding experiments were statistically different. At the MOP receptors the highest affinity (Ki 4\u00a0nM) was obtained with the zebra finch peptide Met-enkephalin-Arg6. The pufferfish Met-enkephalin-Ser6 exhibited the highest affinity (Ki 6.7\u00a0nM) at the DOP receptor. Phylogenetic neuropeptide libraries, defined here as a collection of mutationally different species variants of orthologous and paralogous peptide sequences, represent the natural molecular diversity of the neuropeptides. Such libraries can provide a wide range of structural information establishing comparative functional analyses. Since DNA sequencing data are rapidly increasing, more development in the natural peptide library concept is expected.",

DMdomains of the proteins encoded by the B.koreanus Dmrt (Bk-Dmrt) genes had high similarities to DM domains of other invertebrate species. To understand the potential effects of environmental stressors on the transcriptional expression of Dmrt genes in rotifers, we exposed B.koreanus to a wide range of UV-B radiation and different concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) over different time courses. Transcript levels of all Bk-Dmrt genes decreased significantly in response to relatively high doses of UV-B irradiation, and were also downregulated in response to exposure to UV-B radiation over time. Transcript levels of all Bk-Dmrt genes were downregulated in response to B[a]P exposure for 24\u00a0h. This decrease in expression of all Bk-Dmrt genes was concomitant with the growth retardation induced by UV-B and B[a]P exposure. We concluded that both environmental stressors have detrimental effects on transcriptional regulation of all Bk-Dmrt genes, especially relatively high doses of these stressors, leading to growth retardation. However, further studies are required to better understand the potential role of Dmrt genes in environmental stressor-triggered growth retardation in the rotifer B.koreanus.",

In teleost fish, effects of estrogens and xenoestrogens have been reported extensively, but the available information on targeted tissues and cells is still scarce. Moreover, a better knowledge of the distinct ER subtypes is required to find out the mechanistic pathways by which estrogen compounds are able to disrupt endogenous estrogen signaling in fish immunity. The present study aimed at characterizing, in male rainbow trout juveniles, multi-tissue gene expression pattern of one isoform of estrogen receptor (ER), ER\u03b11, at the mRNA and protein levels. The mRNA levels for ER\u03b11 were measured in various lymphoid organs by real-time RT-PCR and ER\u03b11 protein level by Western blot. Furthermore, this protein was located by immunohistochemistry in the same organs. The transcripts were ubiquitously expressed, but at a higher level in testis and liver, while the protein was more abundant in testis and skin. Moreover, the ER\u03b11 was detected in endothelial, Kupffer, mucous and chloride cells, hematopoietic tissues, proximal tubule, epithelia of the skin and intestine, in the lamina propria and in the stratum granulosum. This distribution backs the idea that, in male rainbow trout, estrogeno-mimetic compounds could be involved in different immune mechanisms such as inflammatory response, transport of Ig, mucus production, regulation of cellular immunity and development and maturation of lymphoid and myeloid cells.",

     "publication date": "07-2014",
     "abstract": "While many recent studies focus on the functions of carotenoids in visual signaling, they seldom address the phylogenetic origins of plumage coloration and its mechanisms. Here, we used the New World orioles (Icterus) as a model clade to study the history of orange carotenoid-based coloration and pigmentation, sampling 47 museum specimens from 12 species. We examined the identity and concentration of carotenoids in oriole feathers using high-performance liquid chromatography, and used phylogenetic comparative methods to compare these observations to reflectance measurements of plumage. Each of the seven yellow oriole species we sampled used only lutein to color their feathers. Ancestral state reconstruction of this trait suggests that the oriole common ancestor had yellow feathers pigmented with lutein. We found keto-carotenoids in small concentrations in the plumage of each of the five species scored as orange. This correlation suggests that discrete gains and losses of keto-carotenoids are behind independent gains of orange coloration in orioles. In contrast, total carotenoid concentration was not associated with hue, and total concentration of keto-carotenoids poorly explained variation in hue among species where they were present. These findings suggest that orioles most likely evolved orange plumage coloration at least twice, each time by gaining the ability to metabolize dietary carotenoids by C4-oxygenation. Given that red coloration is generated by this same oxygenation process in a wide range of bird species, it raises the question of why, if orioles possess this metabolic capability, no red oriole species exist.",

We report the following findings: (i) comparisons among protein sequences revealed a high sequence identity for each TFIIH subunit analysed; (ii) among transcription factors identified as putative regulators, OCT1 and AP1 have the highest binding-site frequencies in the promoters of TFIIH genes, and (iii) TFIIH genes have alternatively spliced isoforms.

In the present study, we compared developmental profiles of fat body specific activity, kinetic constants of homogeneously purified and unpurified enzyme, and fat body enzyme concentration of the pentose-shunt enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH, E.C.1.1.1.44) between the dispersing [long-winged, LW(f)] and flightless [short-winged, SW] genotypes of the cricket Gryllus firmus. Neither kcat nor the Michaelis constant for 6-phosphogluconate differed between 6PGDH from LW(f) versus SW morphs for either homogeneously purified or unpurified enzyme. Purified enzyme from the LW(f) morph exhibited reduced KM for NADP+, but this was not observed for multiple KM(NADP\u00a0+) estimates for unpurified enzyme. A polyclonal antibody was generated against 6PGDH which was used to develop a chemiluminescence assay to quantify 6PGDH concentration in fat body homogenates. Elevated enzyme concentration accounted for all of the elevated 6PGDH specific activity in the LW(f) morph during the juvenile and adult stages. Finally, activity of another pentose-shunt enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, strongly covaried with 6PGDH activity suggesting that variation in 6PGDH activity gives rise to variation in pentose shunt flux. This is one of the first life-history studies and one of the few studies of intraspecific enzyme adaptation to identify the relative importance of evolutionary change in enzyme concentration vs. kinetic constants to adaptive variation in enzyme activity in an outbred population.",

Moreover, the transcription level of SpL14-3-3\u03b6 could be induced by Nomuraea rileyi infection, up-regulated in hemocytes, followed by head, fat body and midgut. Knocking down SpL14-3-3\u03b6 transcripts by RNAi significantly increased S. litura sensitivity to fungal infection, and resulted in higher mortality of S. litura during the larval development.

Considering that epigenetic mechanisms allow an organism to respond to environmental changes, the expression in muscle of several molecules that regulate epigenetic rRNA synthesis, as well as rDNA transcription, were evaluated during the seasonal acclimatization of the carp. First, the nucleotide sequences encoding the components forming the NoRC (ttf-I, tip5) and eNoSC (sirt1, nml, suv39h1), two chromatin remodeling complexes that silence rRNA synthesis, as well as the sequence of ubf1, a key regulator of rDNA transcription, were obtained.

The carp sequences for TTF-I, TIP5, SIRT1, NML, SUV39H1, and UBF1 showed a high conservation of domains and key amino acids in comparison with other fish and higher vertebrates. The mRNA contents in muscle for ttf-I, tip5, sirt1, nml, suv39h1, mh2a1, mh2a.z, and nuc were up-regulated during winter in comparison with summer, whereas the mRNA levels of mh2a2, ubf1, and p80 were down-regulated. Also, the contents of molecules involved in processing the rRNA (snoRNAs) and pRNA, a stabilizer of NoRC complex, were analyzed, finding that these non-coding RNAs were not affected by seasonal acclimatization. These results suggest that variations in the expression of rRNA and the molecules that epigenetically regulate its synthesis are contributing to the muscle plasticity induced by seasonal acclimatization in carp.",

     "abstract": "Reproductively arrested gonadal development has been previously described in the teleost pearl mullet (Chalcalburnus tarichi, Cyprinidae) from Van Edremit Gulf of Lake Van, Turkey. Oocyte development in some females was arrested at the previtellogenic stage, while gonadosomatic index (GSI) and plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) level were low. A subset of the females was found to have normal ovaries and relatively higher plasma E2 and GSI. These two groups were termed reproductively arrested (RA) and reproductively non-arrested (RN) females. In this study, we cloned estrogen receptor (ER) isoforms (ER\u03b1, ER\u03b21 and ER\u03b22) and vitellogenin (Vtg), and their mRNA levels were measured in RA and RN fish tissues. C. tarichi ERs fell in the same clade with other fish ERs and ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b21 had 97% and 98% identity with the roach (Rutilus rutilus) ERs, respectively. Both Vtg and ER isoforms' mRNA abundance were higher in the liver than in the ovary and hypothalamus (liver\u00a0>\u00a0ovary\u00a0>\u00a0hypothalamus). The level of ER\u03b1 mRNA was significantly lower in the liver, ovary and brain of RA fish than in the RN fish tissues. ER\u03b21 mRNA levels were not different in the liver and ovary from RA and RN fish while ER\u03b22 expression significantly increased in the liver and ovary from RA fish. All ER subtype expression was found to be lower in the brain from RA fish than RN fish. The level of Vtg mRNA was significantly lower in the liver and ovary from RA fish than RN fish tissue. These results suggest that ER subtypes are differentially regulated by E2, and their functions are also different in vitellogenesis. Analysis of organic contaminants in sediments revealed that C. tarichi living in Van Edremit Gulf of Lake Van are exposed to the contaminants bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and 4,4\u2032 DDT.

Additional diets included 10\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 DHA in combination with 10\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 of either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) or arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06), and a diet containing 5\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 each of DHA and EPA. The liver, brain, head kidney and gill were collected at the conclusion of the trial, and lipid and fatty acid compositions were determined as well as expression of genes of LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Total lipid content and class composition were largely unaffected by changes in dietary LC-PUFA. However, phospholipid (PL) fatty acid compositions generally reflected that of the diet, although the response varied between tissues. The liver most strongly reflected diet, followed by the head kidney. In both tissues increasing dietary DHA led to significantly increased DHA in PL and inclusion of EPA or ARA led to higher levels of these fatty acids. The brain showed the most conserved composition and gene expression profile, with increased dietary LC-PUFA resulting in only minor changes in PL fatty acids. Dietary LC-PUFA significantly affected the expression of \u03946 and \u03945 desaturases, Elovl 2, 4 and 5, and SREBPs although this varied between tissues with greatest effects observed in the liver followed by the head kidney, similar to PL fatty acid compositions.",

Samples recovered from the midgut gland tissues, stomach contents, three different portions of the midgut and feces were used for quantitative and qualitative analyses of the composition and distribution of the digestive proteinases. Animals were divided into three different groups: (1) animals (controls) fed with a commercial 35% protein diet, (2) animals fed with a commercial diet supplemented with ovalbumin to a final protein concentration of 60%; (3) animals fed with an 80% protein diet. Quantitative determinations using different substrates and zymograms showed that increasing protein concentration in the diet alters the distribution of proteinases along the digestive tract. Composition of proteinases in the midgut gland, stomach contents, midgut sections and feces were similar, but not identical. Chymotrypsin and trypsin paralogues were identified in all enzyme sources in a concentration gradient along the midgut in the control shrimp, the expected distribution supporting the existence of a recycling mechanism. The occurrence of a peritrophic membrane in other Decapoda suggests that endo-ectoperitrophic circulation of digestive enzymes and nutrients may also occur in other crustaceans and also extends beyond the Insecta.",

     "abstract": "The immune system of cephalopods remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the specific activity of immune enzymes in epithelial barriers, circulatory and digestive systems of the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. Three enzyme groups with putative functions in immunity were investigated: phenoloxidases (POs), lysozymes and protease inhibitors (PIs). Consistent with a role in immunity, highest PO activities were found in the integument as well as the respiratory and circulatory organs under zymogenic (proPO) and active form. Surprisingly, high PO activities were also found in the digestive gland and its appendages. Similarly, high lysozyme activities were detected in the integument and circulatory organs, but also in the posterior salivary glands, highlighting the implication of this antibacterial enzyme group in most tissues exposed to the environment but also within the circulatory system. Albeit highest in digestive organs, the ubiquitous detection of PI activity in assayed compartments suggests immune function(s) in a wide range of tissues. Our study reports proPO/PO, lysozyme and PI distributions in S. officinalis body compartments for the first time, and thus provides the fundamental basis for a better understanding of the humoral immune system in cephalopods as well as invertebrates.",

The FA profile of seston, mussels' mantle, digestive gland and feces was analyzed during five seasons. Due to the proximity of a fish farm to the bivalve aquaculture site, we also tested if mussels and seston situated 170\u00a0m distant from the fish cages incorporated fish feed FA markers compared with samples obtained 550\u00a0m away. The principal FA in the mussels' organs were 16:0, 16:1\u03c97, EPA (20:5\u03c93) and DHA (22:6\u03c93), while 16:0 predominated in the feces. Seasonal fluctuations in the seston composition were mirrored in the FA signature of mussels' organs and feces, although the digestive gland had the closest resemblance to the seston FA profile. In general, diatom and bacteria derived-biomarkers predominated in mussels' organs and feces during the upwelling period (spring\u2013summer), while dinoflagellates were the dominant dietary source during downwelling (autumn\u2013winter). The higher concentration of EPA and DHA in both organs and the feces compared with the seston suggested a preferential accumulation of these \u03c93 FA in the mussels' tissues. The results showed a lack of assimilation of fish feed FA biomarkers in the seston and mussel samples. This might be due to the dispersion of uneaten feed particles by high current velocity, substantial distance between the fish and mussel culture, the limited amount of nutrient waste released by the fish farm and dilution of feed particles in the large mussel standing stock.",

     "abstract": "The sunn pest, Eurygaster spp., is one of the most destructive pests of grains in Asia, Europe and Africa. The nymphs and adults feed voraciously in the field by late-spring, followed by migration of adults into mountains for diapause, which includes estivation by late summer and hibernation during winter. Adults migrate back to the field by the end of diapause in mid-spring, where they mate and lay eggs. To understand how sunn pest survives and maintains basic metabolic functions without feeding for 7\u00a0months during diapause, this study focused on lipid metabolism as the major source of energy production, and the primary organ of lipid metabolism, the fat body. Studies on lipid metabolism revealed two major factors referred to perilipin protein family, Lipid Storage Droplet Protein 1 (LSD1) and Lipid Storage Droplet Protein 2 (LSD2), which are involved in hydrolysis and accumulation of lipids, respectively. In this study, two LSD (EmLSD1-2) orthologues in the hemimetabolous Eurygaster maura were identified. EmLSD1 and EmLSD2 genes were expressed in multiple tissues, but primarily in fat body. Both genes were continuously expressed throughout the insect's life cycle but peaked in the 4th nymphal stage. Their expression patterns were in accordance with the biological roles of LSDs. EmLSD1 expression peaked in non-feeding stages supporting its lipolytic role, while the highest level of EmLSD2 expression was in feeding stages supporting its lipogenetic role. Expression patterns of both genes differed in females and males. Overall, expression patterns of EmLSDs provide clues to understanding the interesting life cycle of sunn pest.",

The cDNA is 2121\u00a0bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1983\u00a0bp encoding a polypeptide of 660 amino acids with three HSP70 family signatures. DjGRP78 contains signal peptides at the N-terminus and a KTEL peptide motif at the C-terminus, which suggests that it localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Fluorescent real time RT-PCR was employed to detect the expression pattern of Djgrp78 in response to different stressors. Our results show that heat shock and heavy metals (Hg2\u00a0+ and Pb2\u00a0+) induce Djgrp78 expression, but starvation does not. Interestingly, we found that Djgrp78 was up-regulated in planarians with septic tissues, and also verified that it was up-regulated in response to bacterial challenge. Our data indicate that Djgrp78 may be a multifunctional gene, and play important roles in physiological and pathological stress in planarians.",

Sequence analysis showed that aGPR103-va and -vd are less likely to undergo nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting that they may be translated into truncated proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the five variants are widely distributed in the brain and peripheral tissues of geese and show specific expression patterns.

     "abstract": "The pathways and regulatory mechanisms of glycogenolysis remain relatively unexplored in non-mammalian vertebrates, especially poikilotherms. We studied the temperature sensitivity and inhibition of glycogenolytic enzymes in liver, ventricle, and white muscle of rainbow trout acclimated to 14\u00a0\u00b0C. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and acid \u03b1-glucosidase (GAA) activities were measured in homogenates of tissues at physiological temperatures (4, 14, and 24\u00a0\u00b0C), and in the presence of allosteric inhibitor, glucose. Higher GP versus GAA activity in all three tissues suggested a predominance of phosphorolytic glycogenolysis over the lysosomal glucosidic pathway. GP activities at 14\u00a0\u00b0C were ~\u00a02-fold higher in the ventricle and white muscle versus the liver and selectively increased by AMP in striated muscle. Conversely, the activities of GAA and lysosomal marker acid phosphatase were 8- to 10-fold higher in the liver compared with the ventricle and white muscle. Thermal sensitivity (Q10) was increased for GP in all tissues below 14\u00a0\u00b0C and decreased in striated muscle in the absence of AMP above 14\u00a0\u00b0C. GAA had lower Q10 values than GP below 14\u00a0\u00b0C, and, unlike GP, Q10s for GAA were not different between tissues or affected by temperature. Both GP (in the absence of AMP) and GAA were inhibited by glucose in a dose-dependent manner, with the lowest IC50 values observed in the white muscle (1.4 and 6.3\u00a0mM, respectively). In conclusion, despite comparatively low kinetic potential, lysosomal GAA might facilitate glycogenolysis at colder body temperatures in striated muscle and intracellular glucose could limit phosphorolytic and glucosidic glycogenolysis in multiple tissues of the rainbow trout.",

Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of T. pyriformis AK1, but not AK2, had a distinct myristoylation signal sequence at the N-terminus, suggesting that 40-kDa AK1 targets the membrane.

The results suggested that significant arising of GH putative promoter methylation levels in pituitary was observed in females compared with males. However, no such sex-specific changes were found in GHR1 and GHR2 promoters. The GH mRNA expression also was influenced by GH promoter methylation levels in pituitary, which resulted in the higher growth rate of Nile tilapia males. Meanwhile, the methylation levels of GH putative promoter were negatively correlated with growth rate as well as mRNA expression of GH. Furthermore, the methylation of specific E-Box CpG site is also negatively related to the mRNA expression of GH in pituitary.

Sequence analysis indicated that M. amblycephala myog shared an analogous structure with the highly conserved His/Cys-rich, bHLH and C-terminal helix III domains with other vertebrates. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree showed that M. amblycephala myog had the highest identity with the homologues of Ctenopharyngodon idella and Cyprinus carpio. Spatio-temporal expression patterns revealed that myog mRNA levels at the segmentation period and 12 h post-hatching (hph) were significantly higher than at other development stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, the highest myog expression level was predominantly observed in white muscle compared with the other types of muscle.

Four isoproteic and isolipidic diets were formulated containing either 30 or 60% of SPC (diets SP30 and SP60), supplemented or not with 1% of taurine (diets SP30T and SP60T). A fish meal (FM) based diet, without SPC and taurine supplementation, was used as a control. Triplicate groups of 32 totoaba juveniles (average body mass\u00a0=\u00a07.5\u00a0g) were fed these diets over 45\u00a0days. Results revealed that dietary FM replacement by SPC depressed the overall intermediary metabolism. Activity of key enzymes of amino acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis was significantly reduced and a trend to reduce glycolysis and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was observed. The incorporation of the highest level of SPC also significantly increased hepatic lipid peroxidation and the activity of superoxide dismutase. Concomitant taurine supplementation restored the activity of amino acid catabolic and gluconeogenic enzymes and hexokinase to levels similar of those of the control diet. Taurine supplementation also led to a significant increase of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and catalase activity, as well as to a significant reduction of liver lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that taurine may play an important metabolic modulation action on totoaba fed SPC based diets, contributing to the enhancement of the overall metabolism and to the reduction of liver oxidative damage.",

In this study, we analyzed the roles of FoxO/Daf-16 on the recovery from heat stress damage by monitoring thrashing movement. Heat shock reduced the movement, which was restored by culturing at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Thrashing movement was not restored in the daf-16 mutant, which suggests that Daf-16 is one of the essential factors in repairing the damage. Movement restoration was promoted in the daf-2 mutant, a homolog of insulin/IGF-1-like receptor, in a daf-16-dependent manner. In addition, heat stress decreased the expression of daf-28 and ins-7, agonists of Daf-2. Taken together, these results revealed that FoxO/Daf-16 removes heat stress damage and restores movement via inhibition of the insulin-like signaling pathway in C. elegans, suggesting that FoxO/Daf-16 plays a critical role in thermotolerance.",

     "abstract": "Dicer plays a key role in the biogenesis of microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, which control the coordinated expression of multiple of genes during follicle development. In this study, the cDNAs encoding two Dicer isoforms (gDicer-a and gDicer-b, respectively) were isolated and cloned from goose ovary using RT-PCR. This is the first time a new Dicer splice variant has been characterized at the molecular level in vertebrates. Sequence analysis indicated that both of the two isoforms consist of seven conserved functional domains, where gDicer-b lacks a linker sequence between DEAD box and helicase C domain composed of 158 amino acids. Each domain of gDicer-a/gDicer-b showed higher than 89.5% identity to corresponding domain of Dicers from chicken, human, and mouse. The ubiquity of transcripts of gDicer-a/gDicer-b was found in all tested tissues by real time PCR with the pituitary, oviduct, and hypothalamus being the predominant site of expression of gDicer-a. A similar expression profile of the gDicer-a/gDicer-b mRNAs was found during follicle development. The abrupt changes in transcripts of gDicer in 2\u20134\u00a0mm, 9\u201310\u00a0mm, F5, and F1 follicles support its participation in the process of follicle recruitment, selection, dominance, and ovulation. However, high mRNA levels of gDicer-b and caspase-3 were detectable in atretic and post-ovulatory follicles, where expression of gDicer-a was considerably low. These findings suggest that gDicer is required for follicle development, and structural differences in the helicase domain of two gDicer isoforms might contribute to their different roles in controlling granulosa cell apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Estuarine waters are prone to regular bouts of low oxygen (hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia). In vertebrates, tissue hypoxia followed by reoxygenation can generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that exceed cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to tissue damage. Here we quantified the expression of several antioxidant genes in the hepatopancreas of Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia for 4\u00a0h or 24\u00a0h followed by recovery in air-saturated water (normoxia) for 0, 1, 6 or 24\u00a0h, as compared to time-matched controls maintained only in normoxia. Transcripts of cytoplasmic Mn-superoxide dismutase (cMnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and peptide-methionine (R)-S-oxide reductase (MsrB) increased after 4\u00a0h exposure to either hypoxia or hypercapnic hypoxia; these elevated transcript levels persisted longer in animals recovering from hypercapnic hypoxia than hypoxia alone. cMnSOD transcripts generally increased, but GPX, MsrB, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and thioredoxin 1 (TRX-1) decreased or did not change in most long-term (24\u00a0h) treatment-recovery groups. Thus, the transcriptional responses of several antioxidant genes during recovery from tidally-driven hypoxia and hypercapnic hypoxia decrease or are muted by more persistent exposure to these conditions, leaving L. vannamei potentially vulnerable to ROS damage during recovery.",

     "abstract": "Hibernation in 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) is associated with a substantial suppression of whole-animal metabolism. We compared the metabolism of liver mitochondria isolated from torpid ground squirrels with those from interbout euthermic (IBE; recently aroused from torpor) and summer euthermic conspecifics. Succinate-fuelled state 3 respiration, calculated relative to mitochondrial protein, was suppressed in torpor by 48% and 44% compared with IBE and summer, respectively. This suppression remains when respiration is expressed relative to cytochrome c oxidase activity. We hypothesized that this suppression was caused by inhibition of succinate transport at the dicarboxylate transporter (DCT) by long-chain fatty acyl CoAs that may accumulate during torpor. We predicted, therefore, that exogenous palmitoyl CoA would inhibit respiration in IBE more than in torpor. Palmitoyl CoA inhibited respiration ~\u00a070%, in both torpor and IBE. The addition of carnitine, predicted to reverse palmitoyl CoA suppression by facilitating its transport into the mitochondrial matrix, did not rescue the respiration rates in IBE or torpor. Liver mitochondrial activities of carnitine palmitoyl transferase did not differ among IBE, torpor and summer animals. Although palmitoyl CoA inhibits succinate-fuelled respiration, this suppression is likely not related exclusively to inhibition of the DCT, and may involve additional mitochondrial transporters such as the adenine-nucleotide transporter.",

     "abstract": "The molluscan shell is a remarkable product of a highly coordinated biomineralisation process, and is composed of calcium carbonate most commonly in the form of calcite or aragonite. The exceptional mechanical properties of this biomaterial are imparted by the embedded organic matrix which is secreted by the underlying mantle tissue. While many shell-matrix proteins have already been identified within adult molluscan shell, their presence and role in the early developmental stages of larval shell formation are not well understood. In the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata, the shell first forms in the early trochophore larva and develops into a mineralised protoconch in the veliger. Following metamorphosis, the juvenile shell rapidly changes as it becomes flattened and develops a more complex crystallographic profile including an external granular layer and an internal nacreous layer. Amongst the matrix proteins involved in abalone shell formation, Lustrin A is thought to participate in the formation of the nacreous layer. Here we have identified a partial cDNA coding for the Lustrin A gene in H. tuberculata and have analysed its spatial and temporal expression during abalone development. RT-PCR experiments indicate that Lustrin A is first expressed in juvenile (post-metamorphosis) stages, suggesting that Lustrin A is a component of the juvenile shell, but not of the larval shell. We also detect Lustrin A mRNAs in non-nacre forming cells at the distal-most edge of the juvenile mantle as well as in the nacre-forming region of the mantle. Lustrin A was also expressed in 7-day-old post-larvae, prior to the formation of nacre. These results suggest that Lustrin A plays multiple roles in the shell-forming process and further highlight the dynamic ontogenic nature of molluscan shell formation.",

Lo microdomains, also named as lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin and certain types of proteins, which facilitate cell signalling and nutrient uptake. Lipid rafts have been extensively researched in mammals and the presence of functional lipid rafts was recently demonstrated in goldfish, but there is currently very little knowledge about their composition and function in fish. Therefore a protocol was established for the analysis of lipid rafts and membranous lipids in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) tissues. Twelve lipids were identified and analysed in the Ld domain of the membrane with the most predominant lipids found in all tissues being; triglycerides, cholesterol, phosphoethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Four lipids were identified in lipid rafts in all tissues analysed, triglycerides (33\u201362%) always found in the highest concentration followed by cholesterol (24\u201332%), phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Isolation of lipid rafts was confirmed by identifying the presence of the lipid raft associated protein flotillin, present at higher concentrations in the detergent resistant fraction.

The liver-specific and highly abundant microRNA-122 has emerged as a powerful regulator of lipogenesis in higher vertebrates, but little is known about its endocrine and nutritional regulation. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that insulin regulates hepatic expression of omy-miRNA-122 isomiRNAs (omy-miRNA-122a and omy-miRNA-122b) by using in vivo and in vitro approaches. Since the hepatic insulin pathway and lipogenesis are acutely regulated by dietary macronutrient ratios in rainbow trout, we further investigated the effect of single meals with altered carbohydrate/protein ratio and lipid/protein ratio on the postprandial expression of omy-miRNA-122 isomiRNAs. Insulin acutely induced omy-miRNA-122b expression in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, a single meal with increased lipid to protein ratio acutely decreased expression of both omy-miRNA-122 isomiRNAs. As a direct proof of lipogenic effects of miRNA-122 is currently still lacking in fish, we investigated the correlated expression between omy-miRNA-122 isomiRNAs and the rate-limiting lipogenic gene fas, an indirect target gene of miRNA-122 in mammals. Our results show a significant positive correlation of omy-miRNA-122b and fas, consistent with a potential evolutionary conserved role for miRNA-122 in the regulation of postprandial lipogenesis in trout.",

     "abstract": "Pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) is a fast-growing fish that is extensively used in Brazilian aquaculture programs and shows a wide range of thermal tolerance. Because temperature is an environmental factor that influences the growth rate of fish and is directly related to muscle plasticity and growth, we hypothesized that different rearing temperatures in juvenile pacu, which exhibits intense muscle growth by hyperplasia, can potentially alter the muscle growth patterns of this species. The aim of this study was to analyze the muscle growth characteristics together with the expression of the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin and the growth factor myostatin in juvenile pacu that were submitted to different rearing temperatures. Juvenile fish (1.5\u00a0g weight) were distributed in tanks containing water and maintained at 24\u00a0\u00b0C (G24), 28\u00a0\u00b0C (G28) and 32\u00a0\u00b0C (G32) (three replicates for each group) for 60\u00a0days. At days 30 and 60, the fish were anesthetized and euthanized, and muscle samples (n\u00a0=\u00a012) were collected for morphological, morphometric and gene expression analyses. At day 30, the body weight and standard length were lower for G24 than for G28 and G32. Muscle fiber frequency in the <\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcm class was significantly higher in G24, and the >\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcm class was lower in G24. MyoD gene expression was higher in G24 compared with that in G28 and G32, and myogenin and myostatin mRNA levels were higher in G24 than G28. At day 60, the body weight and the standard length were higher in G32 but lower in G24. The frequency distribution of the <\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcm diameter muscle fibers was higher in G24, and that of the >\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcm class was lower in G24. MyoD mRNA levels were higher in G24 and G32, and myogenin mRNA levels were similar between G24 and G28 and between G24 and G32 but were higher in G28 compared to G32. The myostatin mRNA levels were similar between the studied temperatures. In light of our results, we conclude that low rearing temperature altered the expression of muscle growth-related genes and induced a delay in muscle growth in juvenile pacu (P. mesopotamicus). Our study provides a clear example of thermally induced phenotypic plasticity in pacu fish and shows that changing the rearing temperature during the juvenile stage can have a considerable effect on gene expression and muscle growth in this species.",

Four full-length cDNAs encoding lipoprotein receptors (Paj-VgR, Paj-LpR1, Paj-LpR2A, and Paj-LpR2B) were identified from Pandalopsis japonica through a combination of EST screening and PCR-based cloning. Paj-LpR1 appears to be the first crustacean ortholog of insect lipophorin receptors, and its two paralogs, Paj-LpR2A and Paj-LpR2B, exhibited similar structural characteristics. Several transcriptional isoforms were also identified for all three Paj-LpRs. Each expression pattern was unique, suggesting different physiological roles for these proteins. Paj-VgR is an ortholog of vitellogenin (Vg) receptors from other decapod crustaceans. A phylogenetic analysis of lipoproteins and their receptors suggested that the nomenclature of Vgs from decapod crustaceans may need to be changed. A PCR-based transcriptional analysis showed that Paj-VgR and Paj-LpR2B are expressed almost exclusively in the ovary, whereas Paj-LpR1 and Paj-LpR2A are expressed in multiple tissues. The various transcriptional isoforms of the three Paj-LpRs exhibited unique tissue distribution profiles. A transcriptional analysis of each receptor using tissues with different GSI values showed that the change in transcription of Paj-VgRs, Paj-LpR2A and Paj-LpR1 was not as significant as that of Vgs during maturation. However, the transcriptional levels of Paj-LpR2B decreased in ovary at maturation, suggesting that their transcriptional regulation is involved in reproduction.",

It is a glyco-lipo-carotenoprotein scarcely lipidated (<\u00a01%) but highly glycosilated (13% by wt). Lipids include phospholipids, free fatty acids and carotenoids; mannose and galactose predominate over other monosaccharides. Main carotenoids are esterified and non-esterified astaxanthin (71 and 25%, respectively). Carotenoid removal does not seem to affect the structural characteristics of the oligomer, while deglycosilation reduces subunit number from five to a single one. The carotenoid\u2013protein association protected the former against oxidation. PmPV1 cross reacts with polyclonal antibodies against the PcOvo, the major carotenoprotein from Pomacea canaliculata.

MALDI\u2013ToF experiments were selected as the primary tool for a rapid screening of the saponin mixtures, whereas LC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS/MS techniques were used to achieve chromatographic separation of isomers. First of all, our analyses demonstrated that the diversity of saponins is higher than previously reported. Indeed, nine new congeners were observed in addition to the 17 saponins already described in this species. On the basis of all the collected MS/MS data, we also identified collision-induced key-fragmentations that could be used to reconstruct the molecular structure of both known and unknown saponin ions. Secondly, the comparison of the saponin contents from the five different body components revealed that each organ is characterized by a specific mixture of saponins and that between animals there are also qualitative and quantitative variability of the saponin contents which could be linked to the sex or to the collecting season. Therefore, the observed high variability unambiguously confirms that saponins probably fulfill several biological functions in A. rubens.

Previous investigations have revealed that two xiphisterine pricklebacks\u2014Xiphister mucosus and Xiphister atropurpureus\u2014become herbivorous or omnivorous, respectively, as their bodies grow larger, and that their guts show related changes in length and function. In this study we found that, with increase in size, the basal member of the Xiphisterini, Phytichthys chirus, showed an increased proportion of algae in its diet, increased activity of \u03b1-amylase and decreased activity of aminopeptidase, all of which support the synapomorphy hypothesis. Cebidichthys violaceus, a herbivore in the Esselenichthyini, shows similar ontogenetic changes in diet and digestive tract length and physiology, but these features were not observed in two derived carnivores, Dictyosoma burgeri and Dictyosoma rubrimaculatum, within the clade. These results suggest that herbivory is isolated to C. violaceus within the Esselenichthyini. Allometric relationships of gut length as a function of body size generally follow diet within the Xiphisterini and Esselenichthyini, with herbivores having the longest guts, which become disproportionately longer than body size as the fishes grow, omnivores intermediate gut lengths, and carnivores the shortest. A carnivore from an adjacent clade, Anoplarchus purpurescens, had the shortest gut, which did not change in length relative to body length as the fish grew. Overall, our results clarify the patterns of dietary evolution within the Stichaeidae and lay the foundation for more detailed studies of dietary and digestive specialization in fishes in the family.",

In the present paper we studied the insecticidal activity of the variant vicilins purified from a resistant cowpea variety (IT81D-1053). Bioassays showed that the seeds of this genotype affected larval growth, causing developmental retardation and 100% mortality. By feeding C. maculatus larvae on susceptible and IT81D-1053 derived vicilins (FITC labelled or unlabelled), followed by fluorescence and immunogold cytolocalization, we were able to demonstrate that both susceptible and variant forms are internalized in the midgut cells and migrate inside vesicular structures from the apex to the basal portion of the enterocytes. However, when larvae were fed with the labelled vicilins for 24\u00a0h and then returned to a control diet, the concentration of the variant form remained relatively high, suggesting that variant vicilins are not removed from the cells at the same rate as the non-variant vicilins. We suggest that the toxic effects of variant vicilins on midgut cells involve the binding of these proteins to the cell surface followed by internalization and interference with the normal physiology of the enterocytes, thereby affecting larval development in vivo.",

Structural and functional annotations were performed for all paralogs, which suggested possible differences in function and subcellular localization. The phylogenetic analysis, based on the amino acid sequences, revealed four groups corresponding to teleostean GPx1a, GPx1b, GPx4a, and GPx4b and three groups for mammalian GPx1, GPx2 and GPx4. The tree topology indicated past duplication events for fish genes, unlike their mammalian homologs. Transcriptional analysis in ten tissues by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) evidenced a tissue-specific pattern for each GPx homolog. Fish experimental groups were exposed to stress factors such as fasting and confinement. Relative expression analysis in fish liver demonstrated that GPx1 genes were not regulated by dietary restriction; GPx4b was differentially expressed opposed to regularly fed fish. On the other hand, both GPx1 and GPx4 genes were up-regulated in fish post exposed to confinement, considered as a response to acute stress. The results underline the role of GPx genes as indicators of stress and welfare status in gilthead sea bream aquaculture.",

In the present paper, we have characterized biochemically the shell matrix associated to the crossed-lamellar structure of the giant queen conch Strombus gigas. The acid-soluble (ASM) and acid-insoluble (AIM) matrices represent an extremely minor fraction of the shell. Both are constituted of polydisperse and of few discrete proteins among which three fractions, obtained by preparative SDS-PAGE and named 1P3, 2P3 and 3P3, are dominant and were further characterized. Compared to other matrices, the acid-soluble matrix is weakly glycosylated (3%) and among the discrete components, only 3P3 seems noticeably glycosylated. The monosaccharide composition of the ASM shows that mannose represents the main monosaccharide. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a high ratio of this sugar in a skeletal matrix. Furthermore, the ASM interacts with the in vitro crystallization of calcium carbonate, but this interaction is moderate. It differs from that of the isolated 1P3 fraction but is similar to that of the 2P3 and 3P3 fractions. At last, antibodies developed from the 3P3 fraction were used to localize this fraction within the shell by immunogold. This study is the first one aiming at characterizing the organic matrix associated to the crossed-lamellar structure of the queen conch shell.",

We hypothesized that the evolution of this species in the stable cold waters of Lake Baikal resulted in a reduction of its thermal stress-response mechanisms at the biochemical and cellular levels. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results show that exposure to a thermal challenge activates the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of thermal resistance, such as heat shock proteins and antioxidative enzymes, and alters energetic metabolism in B. limnaeoides ongurensis. Thermal stress caused the elevation of heat shock protein 70 and the products of anaerobic glycolysis together with the depletion of glucose and phosphagens in the studied species. Thus, a temperature increase activates the complex biochemical system of stress response and alters the energetic metabolism in this endemic Baikal gastropod. It is concluded that the deepwater Lake Baikal endemic gastropod B. limnaeoides ongurensis retains the ability to activate well-developed biochemical stress-response mechanisms when exposed to a thermal challenge.",

Electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF-MS and AUC show that the MM values of HbRa subunits are very close, but not identical to the Glossoscolex paulistus hemoglobin (HbGp). The monomer d is found to exist in, at least, two isoforms: the main one, d1, displays a MM of 16,166\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0Da, and the second one, d2, is less intense with MM of 16,490\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0Da. For the trimer abc and tetramer abcd, single contributions around 51,470\u00a0Da and 67,690\u00a0Da were observed, respectively. Finally, the monomers a, b, and c, present MM values of 17,133, 17,290 and 15,506\u00a0Da, respectively. Both CTAC and DTAB interact strongly with HbRa, and up to seven surfactant molecules are bound to the protein. On the other hand, spectroscopic studies show that HbRa is more stable at alkaline pH, as compared to HbGp. Thus, our data suggest that alkaline medium, up to pH\u00a010.0, induces the oligomeric dissociation, without promoting the subunits unfolding and heme iron oxidation.

However, in contrast to insect species, no genome-wide analysis has been carried out in crustacean species and cDNAs encoding chitinase and chitinase-like proteins have been characterized in relatively few species. In this study, we identified six chitinase genes in the oriental river prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense, according to the established expressed sequence tag (EST) information using Rapid Amplification of the cDNA Ends (RACE) technique and homology cloning. We assigned these genes to three different chitinase groupings, which were designated MnCht1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, 3C and 4. The domain organization analysis of the six MnCht proteins revealed that only MnCht3C and MnCht4 possessed full structure, while MnCht1A, 1B, 3A and 3B lacked the serine/threonine (S/T)-rich linker and chitin-binding domains (CBDs). Their expression in different tissues and different developmental stages suggested that all of them have a function in the digestion of chitinous foods, modification of gut peritrophic membrane and degradation of the chitin exoskeleton. Analysis of the stage-specific moulting cycle and different temperature stimulation provided further evidence that MnCht1A, 1B and 3B have pivotal roles in the moulting cycle, while MnCht 4 only assists in the moulting process. This study provides important information for further investigations on the functions of chitinase in M. nipponense and other crustaceans.",

     "abstract": "Lipid nutrition of marine fish larvae has focused on supplying essential fatty acids (EFA) at high levels to meet requirements for survival, growth and development. However, some deleterious effects have been reported suggesting that excessive supply of EFA might result in insufficient supply of energy substrates, particularly in species with lower EFA requirements such as Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). This study addressed how the balance between EFA and non-EFA (better energy sources) affects larval performance, body composition and metabolism and retention of DHA, by formulating enrichment emulsions containing two different vegetable oil sources (olive oil or soybean oil) and three DHA levels. DHA positively affected growth and survival, independent of oil source, confirming that for sole post-larvae it is advantageous to base enrichments on vegetable oils supplying higher levels of energy, and supplement these with a DHA-rich oil. In addition, body DHA levels were generally comparable considering the large differences in their dietary supply, suggesting that the previously reported \u22064 fatty acyl desaturase (fad) operates in vivo and that DHA was synthesized at physiologically significant rates through a mechanism involving transcriptional up-regulation of \u22064fad, which was significantly up-regulated in the low DHA treatments. Furthermore, data suggested that DHA biosynthesis may be regulated by an interaction between dietary n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 and n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 PUFA, as well as by levels of LC-PUFA, and this may, under certain nutritional conditions, lead to DHA production from C18 precursors. The molecular basis of putative fatty acyl \u22065 and \u22066 desaturation activities remains to be fully determined as thorough searches have found only a single (\u22064) Fads2-type transcript.

MALDI\u2013FTICR MS and nano-HPLC-chip Q-TOF MS were used for mass profiling and isomer separation, respectively giving a unique chemical saponin fingerprint. Moreover, the methods used yield the highest number of congeners. However, saponin concentration, bioactivity and chemical diversity had no apparent relationship. MS fingerprint showed the presence of holothurinosides, which was observed for the first time in other Holothuria genera besides the basally positioned Holothuria forskali. This congener is proposed to be a primitive character that could be used for taxonomic purposes. The phylogenetic mapping also showed that the glycone part of the compound evolved from non-sulfated hexaosides to sulfated tetraosides, which have higher membranolytic activity and hydrophilicity, the two factors affecting the total ecological activity (i.e. chemical defense) of these compounds. This might be an adaptation to increase the fitness of the organism.",

However, evolution of insect resistance to Bt toxins threatens their long-term application. Therefore, search for new targets which could function as Cry toxin receptors is an immediate mandate. In the present study, two full-length APN cDNAs were cloned from Malpighian tubule and salivary gland tissues of the moth, Achaea janata. Both these APNs showed 99% and 32% sequence homology with fat body and midgut APNs respectively. Tissue distribution analysis revealed the presence of two different APN isoforms, one predominant in non-gut visceral tissues while the other exclusively expressed in the midgut. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses showed cross-reactivity in Malpighian tubule and salivary gland when probed with anti-fat body APN antiserum. These results clearly indicated the presence of non-gut (AjAPN1) and gut-specific (AjAPN4) isoforms in this moth. The expression of both the isoforms steadily increased during the larval development. Hormonal studies indicated regulation of the APN genes by the morphogenetic hormones, 20-hydroxyecdyone and juvenile hormone. Further, in vitro ligand-blotting studies demonstrated binding of Cry toxins to APNs in Malpighian tubule and salivary gland indicating their potential as alternate targets.",

We examined their expression profiles in different tissues and during different reproductive stages. The full-length cDNA of GYS was 4771\u00a0bp in length with a 2023\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF), predicted to encode a protein of 674\u00a0aa. The full-length GSK3\u03b2 cDNA was 2333\u00a0bp long, with an ORF of 1242\u00a0bp. High expression levels of both genes were observed in the gonad and the adductor muscle, as compared to the mantle, gill, or visceral mass, which correlates well with the ability to store glucose. The regulation of both genes was correlated with glycogen content via qPCR and in situ hybridization and was dependent upon the stage of the reproductive cycle (initiation stage, maturation stage, ripeness stage). Thus, it appears that the expression of Ca-GYS and Ca-GSK3\u03b2 is driven by the reproductive cycle of the oyster, reflecting the central role played by glycogen in energy storage and gametogenic development in C. angulata. We suggest that Ca-GYS and Ca-GSK3\u03b2 can be used as useful molecular markers for identifying the stages of glycogen metabolism and reproduction in C. angulata.",

In this study, a full-length cDNA encoding of a CPR (named CsCPR) was isolated from the Asiatic rice striped stem borer, Chilo suppressalis, by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The cDNA contains a 2061\u00a0bp open reading frame, which encodes an enzyme of 686 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 77.6\u00a0kDa.

To further elucidate the mechanism, the mRNA expression levels of Ihh, parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP), Gli-2, Bcl-2, Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 (BMP-6), type X collagen (Col X) and type II collagen (Col II) were detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, and the protein expressions of Ihh, Col X, and Col II were determined using Western blot analysis.

Tissue distribution analysis confirmed that PEPT1 mRNA was detected specifically in the anterior and posterior intestines of adult eel.

The trypsinogen mRNA was only detected in the gastric region including the pancreas. Intense immunoreaction for PEPT1 was observed in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells of both larval and adult eel. These results indicated that PEPT1 was an intestine-specific transporter, which was localized at the luminal side of the epithelial cells, suggesting that di/tri-peptide absorption via PEPT1 takes place in the eel intestine. According to the ontogenetic analyses by quantitative PCR, PEPT1 and trypsinogen mRNA expressions were simultaneously increased at 5\u20137\u00a0dph.

     "abstract": "Methanol is among the most common short-chain alcohols in fermenting fruits, the natural food and oviposition sites of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our previous results showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) were associated with methanol detoxification in the larvae. Catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), esterases (ESTs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were specifically inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethylmeleate (DEM), respectively. CYPs were inhibited by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT). In the present paper, the involvements of these enzymes in methanol metabolism were investigated in female and male adults by determining the combination indices of methanol and their corresponding inhibitors. When PBO, 1-ABT, 3-AT, 4-MP and TPP were individually mixed with methanol, they exhibited significant synergism to the mortality of the adults after 72\u00a0h of dietary exposure. In contrast, the DEM and methanol mixture showed additive effects. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity and up-regulated mRNA expression levels of several Cyp genes. Bioassays using different strains revealed that the variation in ADH activity and RNAi-mediated knockdown of \u03b1-Est7 significantly changed LC50 values for methanol. These results suggest that CYPs, catalases, ADHs and ESTs are partially responsible for methanol elimination in adults. It seems that there are some differences in methanol metabolism between larvae and adults, but not between female and male adults.",

Biochem. Physiol., B 164, 80\u201388). These enzymes degraded starch producing maltooligosaccharides but not glucose. However, the digestive fluid itself could produce glucose from starch, indicating that the digestive fluid contains \u03b1-glucosidase-like enzymes together with the \u03b1-amylases. Thus, in the present study, we isolated this \u03b1-glucosidase-like enzyme from the digestive fluid and characterized it to some extent. Isolation of this enzyme was carried out by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by conventional column chromatographies and FPLC. The purified enzyme showed an apparent molecular mass of 97\u00a0kDa on SDS-PAGE, and optimal temperature and pH of 45\u00a0\u00b0C and 3.8\u20135.5, respectively. This enzyme could degrade various sizes of maltooligosaccharides into glucose and released glucose from starch producing no appreciable intermediate oligosaccharides. We concluded that this enzyme is an \u03b1-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) exolitically acting on polymer substrate and named HdAgl. HdAgl efficiently degraded maltose but hardly degraded p-nitrophenyl \u03b1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0D-glucopyranoside (\u03b1-pNPG) and isomaltose. This enzyme was regarded as a maltase-like \u03b1-glucosidase that preferably degrades maltose but scarcely aryl glucosides. When starch was used as a substrate, HdAgl converted approximately 40% (w/w) of the starch to glucose. If an abalone \u03b1-amlylase HdAmy58 was added to the reaction mixture, the glucose yield increased to 60% (w/w). These results suggested that both HdAgl and HdAmy58 play important roles for the production of glucose from dietary starch in the digestive fluid. The amino-acid sequence of 887 residues for HdAgl was deduced by the cDNA method. This sequence showed 41\u201346% amino-acid identities to those of mammalian and avian \u03b1-glucosidases belonging to glycoside-hydrolase-family31.",

Evidence indicated that glucose uptake increased under methionine deprivation, primarily due to the increased abundance of membrane bound sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), which was likely facilitated by the cellular reduction in [ATP] resulting from increased mitochondrial uncoupling, as supported by elevated transcript levels of uncoupling protein 2a (UCP2a). This study is the first to suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the rapid glucose uptake associated with MR are facilitated by the greater abundance of SGLT2 glucose transporter and mitochondrial uncoupling.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water playing a key role in the respiratory chain and ATP synthesis. The nucleus-encoded COX subunits do not participate in catalysis, but some are known to play a role in the expression, assembly and activity of the enzyme. Since hypoxia continuously affects the shrimp environment, it is important to study COX to understand their ability to deal with low oxygen levels. The goal of this research was to characterize the complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of three nucleus-encoded subunits \u2014coxIV, coxVa, and coxVb\u2014 and to evaluate the shrimp COX response to hypoxia by measuring their gene expression. The cDNA sequence of coxIV consisted of 532\u00a0bp, which encodes a 17.47\u00a0kDa protein, while coxVa cDNA consisted of 460\u00a0bp and coded a protein of 17.11\u00a0kDa, and the coxVb coding sequence consisted of 364\u00a0bp encoding a 13.74\u00a0kDa protein. Shrimp subunits do not have isoforms, and they are not differentially expressed during hypoxia, as observed in mammals. Coordinated changes were detected in the mRNA amounts of nuclear and mitochondrial subnits; these changes, at the transcriptional level, are suggested to be controlled through transcriptional factors Sp1 and NRF2.",

     "abstract": "Our previous behavioural, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses conducted in selected regions (supra/sub oesophageal masses) of the Octopus vulgaris brain detected a cytoplasmic poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (more than 90% of total enzyme activity). The protein was identified as the vault-free form of vault-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase. The present research extends and integrates the biochemical characterization of poly-ADP-ribosylation system, namely, reaction product, i.e., poly-ADP-ribose, and acceptor proteins, in the O. vulgaris brain. Immunochemical analyses evidenced that the sole poly-ADP-ribose acceptor was the octopus cytoskeleton 50-kDa actin. It was present in both free, endogenously poly-ADP-ribosylated form (70\u00a0kDa) and in complex with V-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase and poly-ADP-ribose (260\u00a0kDa). The components of this complex, alkali and high salt sensitive, were purified and characterized. The kind and the length of poly-ADP-ribose corresponded to linear chains of 30\u201335 ADP-ribose units, in accordance with the features of the polymer synthesized by the known vault-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase. In vitro experiments showed that V-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activity of brain cytoplasmic fraction containing endogenous actin increased upon the addition of commercial actin and was highly reduced by ATP. Anti-actin immunoblot of the mixture in the presence and absence of ATP showed that the poly-ADP-ribosylation of octopus actin is a dynamic process balanced by the ATP-dependent polymerization of the cytoskeleton protein, a fundamental mechanism for synaptic plasticity.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial plasticity plays a central role in setting the capacity for acclimation of aerobic metabolism in ectotherms in response to environmental changes. We still lack a clear picture if and to what extent the energy metabolism and mitochondrial enzymes of Antarctic fish can compensate for changing temperatures or PCO2 and whether capacities for compensation differ between tissues. We therefore measured activities of key mitochondrial enzymes (citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (COX)) from heart, red muscle, white muscle and liver in the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii after warm- (7\u00a0\u00b0C) and hypercapnia- (0.2\u00a0kPa CO2) acclimation vs. control conditions (1\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.04\u00a0kPa CO2). In heart, enzymes showed elevated activities after cold-hypercapnia acclimation, and a warm-acclimation-induced upward shift in thermal optima. The strongest increase in enzyme activities in response to hypercapnia occurred in red muscle. In white muscle, enzyme activities were temperature-compensated. CS activity in liver decreased after warm-normocapnia acclimation (temperature-compensation), while COX activities were lower after cold- and warm-hypercapnia exposure, but increased after warm-normocapnia acclimation. In conclusion, warm-acclimated N. rossii display low thermal compensation in response to rising energy demand in highly aerobic tissues, such as heart and red muscle. Chronic environmental hypercapnia elicits increased enzyme activities in these tissues, possibly to compensate for an elevated energy demand for acid\u2013base regulation or a compromised mitochondrial metabolism, that is predicted to occur in response to hypercapnia exposure. This might be supported by enhanced metabolisation of liver energy stores. These patterns reflect a limited capacity of N. rossii to reorganise energy metabolism in response to rising temperature and PCO2.",

     "abstract": "The ability of intestine to sense glucose in carnivorous animals (consuming minimal carbohydrate) has been partially evaluated to date only in cats. We have evaluated the expression of markers involved in the detection of simple sugars in the intestine of the strict carnivorous fish species rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in response to an oral glucose load and to glucose, galactose and mannose stimulation in vitro. These markers include metabolic (GLUT2 and glucokinase (hexokinase IV, GK)) and electrogenic (SGLT1) sensors, the nuclear receptor nr1h3 and the components of the G-protein-coupled taste receptors (tas1r2-like, tas1r3-like and gnat3-like). For the first time, we show that the gut of rainbow trout can detect simple sugars including glucose, galactose and mannose and respond by changing the expression levels of glucose-sensing proteins. The glucosensing response based on the metabolic and nuclear receptor systems had not been evidenced before in any carnivorous vertebrate species, whereas the responses of markers of the electrogenic mechanism and the taste receptor mechanism were different than those already described in cats. When the responses observed in rainbow trout were compared with those of omnivorous mammals, similar responses were obtained for nr1h3 whereas several differences arise in the responses of the other markers. Intestinal glucose sensing in the rainbow trout appears to be distinct from that reported for other carnivores such as cats and omnivores, revealing a novel glucose sensing mechanism not related entirely to diet in vertebrates and supports the idea that this species constitute a robust model for nutrient sensing study. Since only mRNA abundance is presented, depth studies are needed to fully understand the importance of the present findings.",

Addition of coriander oil increased the production of 22:6n-3, from [1-14C] 18:3n-3, at the 0.5 and 1.0% inclusion levels and reduced the conversion of [1-14C] 18:2n-6 to 20:4n-6. \u03b2-Oxidation was significantly increased at the 1.5% inclusion level for [1-14C] 18:2n-6, however \u03b2-oxidation for [1-14C] 18:3n-3 only showed an increasing trend. Acetate, a main breakdown product of fatty acids (FA) via peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation, decreased three-fold for [1-14C] 18:2n-6 and nearly doubled for [1-14C] 18:3n-3 when coriander was added at a 1.5% inclusion level.

In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel cuticle protein R&R gene, referred to as AccCPR1, from Apis cerana cerana. The open reading frame of AccCPR1 has a length of 573 nt and encodes a protein of 190 amino acids that contains a chitin binding region and is a typical cuticle R&R-2 protein. Five putative E74 binding sites and four BR-C binding sites were predicted in the 5\u2032-flanking region, which suggests a potential function in molting and metamorphosis. RT-qPCR showed that AccCPR1 transcript occurred as the ecdysteroid titer decreased after reaching a peak, which suggests AccCPR1 expression requires a \u201cpulse\u201d regimen of ecdysteroids. This hypothesis was tested using different experimental strategies. When larvae were reared with different concentrations of 20E in their diet, the ecdysteroid peak repressed AccCPR1 expression. Exposure of the thoracic integument of the pupae in vitro to different concentration of 20E repressed AccCPR1 expression, which recovered after the removal of 20E. These results suggest that AccCPR1 is a typical cuticle R&R-2 protein that plays an important role in development, and an ecdysteroid pulse is critical for high AccCPR1 gene expression.",

A rabbit antibody (a-Vtgr) was raised against a recombinant Vtgr protein in order to immunologically detect and localize Vtgr within the ovarian follicles. Western blotting using a-Vtgr detected a bold band with an apparent mass of ~\u00a095\u2013105\u00a0kDa in an ovarian preparation that also bound Sakhalin taimen, Hucho perryi, vitellogenin in ligand blots. Immunohistochemistry using a-Vtgr revealed that the Vtgr was uniformly distributed throughout the ooplasm of perinucleolus stage oocytes, subsequently translocated to the periphery of lipid droplet stage oocytes, and became localized to the oolemma during vitellogenesis. We provide the first characterization of Vtgr at both the transcriptional and the translational levels in the cutthroat trout, and our results suggest that this receptor is involved in uptake of Vtg by oocytes of this species.",

In the hepatopancreas, a reduction in the Km glucose for hexokinase from the anoxic animal suggests a more active enzyme form during anoxia. Conversely, in the foot muscle, an increase in Km ATP and a decrease in Vmax for anoxic snail hexokinase were consistent with a less active enzyme form during anoxia. In either case, the molecular basis for the stable modification of hexokinase kinetics is reversible phosphorylation. The activation of endogenous PKC and AMPK increased the Km glucose for anoxic hepatopancreas hexokinase to a value that was similar to the control Km glucose. Alternatively, stimulation of endogenous PKA, PKG, and CamK for control foot muscle hexokinase increased the Km ATP to a value similar to that seen for the anoxic enzyme form. In both tissues, activation of endogenous phosphatases reversed the effects of protein kinases. Dephosphorylation and activation of hepatopancreas hexokinase during anoxia may allow for increased shunting of glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby producing reducing equivalents of NADPH needed for antioxidant defense upon tissue re-oxygenation. Conversely, phosphorylation and inhibition of foot muscle hexokinase during anoxia may reflect the decreased need for glucose oxidation during hypometabolism.",

The fatty acid composition and biophysical properties of the fat body lipids differed markedly between non-diapausing and diapausing larvae. Diapause was associated with a dramatic increase in the proportions of palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) and oleic acid (18:1n-9), with concurrent reductions in palmitic acid (16:0) and linoleic acid (18:2n-6). The increase in the level of unsaturation of the fat body lipids, which caused a marked shift in their phase transitions to lower temperatures, was triggered by diapause rather than low temperatures.

Their propensities for elastomeric or amyloid structures are discussed in light of Er_P1's large content of intrinsically disordered long tandem repeats. The low carbohydrate content of both glues is consistent with conventional protein glycosylation, which in the N. bennetti adhesive was explored by 2D PAGE.

Overall, there are enough similarities between the frog and the velvet worm glues to suspect that they employ related mechanisms for setting and adhesion. A common paradigm is proposed for amphibian and onychophoran adhesives, which, if correct, points to convergent evolution.",

Brain, gonads (male), intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, stomach and yolk sac membrane (YSM) of chicken embryos on the embryonic (E) ages of 10, 16 and 21\u00a0days (right before hatch) were investigated. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) was performed to determine the methylation status of the promoter region of all the six genes in the liver. Somatostatin (SST) was predominately expressed in intestine, brain and gonads (male) with different ontogenic patterns. The highest expression in intestine was detected at E10. There was ontogenic shift from intestine to brain as development progressed. Expression pattern of SSTRs in brain, intestine and kidney was similar to human embryonic expression. In liver, the ontogenic expression pattern of SST and its receptors was associated to methylation status of the respective promoters. Methylation of site Sp1 determines expression level of SST, SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3 while site a is important in governing the expression of SSTR4 and SSTR5. The results show that ontogenic expression profile of chicken SST and SSTRs is time and tissue specific.",

In order to clarify the structure and function of G1, we cloned the full-length cDNA of G1 from the hepatopancreas of red sea bream. G1 cDNA encoded 633 amino acids with a secretory signal sequence at N-terminus, three epidermal growth factor-like domains, a kringle domain, and a trypsin-like serine protease domain. The active site residues of a serine proteinase were conserved in the serine protease domain of G1. The tissue distributions of the mRNA and gelatinolytic activity of G1 were investigated using RT-PCR and gelatin zymography, respectively. Its activity was detected in various tissues while the mRNA of it was strongly expressed in the hepatopancreas. These results suggest that G1 is synthesized in hepatopancreas and carried to the muscle, kidney, heart and ovary via the bloodstream in the red sea bream. The enzyme has a similar domain structure and tissue distribution to those of human hyaluronan binding protein 2 (HABP2) engaged in the extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Thus, it is suggested that G1 is identified as HABP2 and is possibly involved in ECM proteolysis of red sea bream.",

The energy resources provided by the lipovitellins have not yet been investigated in the Order Araneae. Using the wolf spider Schizocosa malitiosa (Lycosidae) as an experimental model, we identified and characterized the lipovitellins present in the cytosol, focusing on the energetic contribution of those lipoprotein particles in the vitellus. Two lipovitellins (LV) named SmLV1 and SmLV2 were isolated. SmLV1 is a high-density lipoprotein with 67% lipid and 3.6% carbohydrate, and SmLV2 is a very high-density lipoprotein with 9% lipid and 8.8% carbohydrate. Through electrophoresis in native conditions we observed that SmLV1 has a molecular mass of 559\u00a0kDa composed of three apolipoproteins of 116, 87, and 42\u00a0kDa, respectively. SmLV2 comprised several proteins composed of different proportions of the same subunits (135, 126, 109, and 70\u00a0kDa). The principal lipids of these lipovitellins are sphingomyelin\u00a0+\u00a0lysophosphatidylcholine, esterified sterols, and phosphatidylcholine. Lipovitellin-free cytosol contains abundant phospatidylcholine and triacylglyceride related to the yolk nuclei (the vitellus organizing center). The principal fatty acids of SmLV1 and SmLV2 are 18:2 n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06, 18:1 n\u00a0\u2212\u00a09, and 16:0. Spectrophotometry detected no pigments in either the lipovitellins or the cytosol.

To elucidate the impact of Ubc9 on sex modification and development, the full length of the cDNA and genomic sequence was cloned from half-smooth tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that ubc9 was ubiquitously expressed in different tissues, and the expression levels varied in the different stages of embryonic and gonadal development. In addition, the expression level was significantly higher in the temperature-treated females than the normal females and males. Moreover, the PET-32-Ubc9 plasmid was constructed and the recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. Follistatin gene expression was initially up-regulated and FSE genes (cyp19a1a, ctnnb1, foxl2) were initially down-regulated after the injection of Ubc9 protein, prior to 96\u00a0h eventually recovered to normal levels. Taken together, the results show that Ubc9 is involved in embryogenesis, gametogenesis and sex modification, and exerts an effect on gene expression.",

In chicken adipogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a key regulator of preadipocyte differentiation and abdominal fat accumulation. However, in a recent study in mammals, some novel factors related to regulation of adipogenesis, including preadipocyte differentiation, were identified in mammals. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the expression profiles of these mammalian adipogenesis-related factors, such as zinc-finger protein 423 (ZNF423), Kr\u00fcppel-like factor -2, -5, and -15 (KLF-2, -5, -15), and FGF10, in the chicken (Gallus gallus). Specifically, we analyzed their expression in primary preadipocyte differentiation in vitro and also analyzed their tissue distribution and their temporal expression in adipose tissue development in vivo. During chicken adipocyte differentiation, the gene expression of ZNF423, KLF-2, KLF-5 and FGF10 was found to rapidly decrease in the early stage of preadipocyte differentiation. Expression of ZNF423 then increased in the late stage of differentiation. KLF-15 expression increased in a time-dependent manner for 48\u00a0h. Protein expressions of these factors were reflected by Western blot analysis. High levels of aP2, PPAR\u03b3 and FGF10 mRNA were found in adipose tissue. In addition, aP2, PPAR\u03b3 and ZNF423 mRNA levels in the adipose tissue were elevated at days 10 and 20. These expression profiles of the adipogenesis-related factors in chicken are, in part, different from mammalian adipogenesis but this seems to reflect the differences in the regulation of adipogenesis and in adipose tissue functions between avians and mammals.",

Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) undergoes a metamorphosis from the larval to juvenile form. Here, we identified 21 let-7 miRNA precursors from different genome loci in Japanese flounder. P. olivaceus let-7 miRNAs are widely expressed in adult tissues, highly expressed during metamorphosis, but weakly during embryonic development. Exogenous thyroid hormone (0.1\u00a0mg/L), which induces premature metamorphosis, significantly promotes the expression of let-7 miRNAs, while thiourea (30\u00a0mg/L), which affects metamorphic arrest, inhibits the expression of let-7 miRNAs in metamorphosis in P. olivaceus. These results show that let-7 miRNAs widely participate in tissue development and metabolism during development and are also involved in regulation of temporal transitions associated with cell proliferation and differentiation during metamorphosis, in P. olivaceus.",

The mRNA level of the genes was analyzed after 0, 2, and 4\u00a0h of fasting in the liver and white adipose tissue. In the liver, the mRNA level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 was significantly increased after 2\u00a0h of fasting. The mRNA levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a and acyl-CoA oxidase were significantly increased after 4\u00a0h of fasting. In contrast, the mRNA levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase \u03b1, and fatty acid synthase were significantly decreased after 4\u00a0h of fasting. The mRNA levels of cholesterol metabolism-related genes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase were significantly decreased after 4\u00a0h of fasting. In the white adipose tissue, the mRNA level of adipose triglyceride lipase was significantly increased after 4\u00a0h of fasting. In contrast, the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 and lipoprotein lipase were significantly decreased after 4\u00a0h of fasting. These results demonstrated that the gene expression of lipid metabolism-related genes is regulated by short term fasting in both the liver and WAT in chicks.",

The goal of this study was to clone and characterize five key sex differentiation-related genes in a Scorpaeniform fish, sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). Complete mRNA sequences of foxl2, cyp19a1a, dmrt1, sox9a and amh were cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. The sablefish mRNA sequences exhibited the characteristic domains of each gene. The deduced amino sequences were highly conserved in some cases, such as Foxl2, whereas others, such as Amh, exhibited lower homology to corresponding sequences in other vertebrates. Using quantitative PCRs developed for each gene, we found that foxl2 and cyp19a1a mRNA levels were significantly elevated in juvenile sablefish ovaries compared to testes, whereas dmrt1, sox9a and amh mRNA levels were significantly elevated in testes relative to ovaries. These patterns were upheld in our tissue distribution analyses of adult fish, but overall four of the genes, foxl2, cyp19a1a, dmrt1 and amh, were robust markers of sex in sablefish.

Yet, cursorial mammals are unable to support high intensity exercise with fat stores. We hypothesized that migratory bats and birds have converged on similar physiological mechanisms to fuel endurance flight with fat. We predicted bats would seasonally upregulate fatty acid transport and oxidation pathways when migration demands were high. We studied seasonal variation in mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activities and fatty acid transport protein expression in the flight muscle of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Carnitine palmitoyl transferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activity increased during migration. There were no changes in expression of fatty acid translocase or plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein. Heart-type fatty acid binding protein expression increased 5-fold in migrating females, but did not vary seasonally in males. An aerial insectivore lifestyle, and the coincidence of migration and pregnancy may explain differences in transporter expression compared to previously studied birds. Overall, our results are consistent with seasonal upregulation of lipid metabolism and aerobic capacity, and confirm that migration poses distinct physiological challenges for bats.",

Multiple sequence alignment showed that Pawap65-1 is similar in structure to wap65-1 in fish. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Pawap65-1 is most closely related to that of a rainbow trout. Pawap65-1 transcripts are present in various tissues and are most abundant in the liver. We expressed recombinant PaWAP65-1 in Escherichia coli and raised antiserum against it in mouse. Western blot analysis revealed that the higher molecular mass of PaWAP65-1 in blood plasma was caused by post-translational N-glycosylation. Quantitative real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot analysis data showed that the hepatic mRNA and blood plasma levels of PaWAP65-1 were both influenced by warm temperature acclimation and cadmium exposure, but not by Listonella anguillarum infection, hypo-osmotic, or cold temperature acclimation.

This coincided with a marked increase in specific and individual pepsin activity, indicating complete development of digestive function. Expression levels of try, ctr, amy and bal were high between 3 and 15\u00a0dph and thereafter a decreasing trend was observed. Intestinal enzymes, lap and alp, showed highest expression levels during the yolk sac stage, and thereafter levels decreased.

The duplicated medaka crabp1 and crabp2 genes contain four exons separated by three introns, which encode polypeptides of 137 and 142 amino acids, respectively. Sequence alignment revealed that medaka Crabp sequences share highest sequence identity and similarity with their orthologs from vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the orthology of the medaka Crabps as they form a distinct clade with their orthologous polypeptides from vertebrates. Conserved gene synteny was evident between the duplicated crabp1 and crabp2 genes from medaka, and CRABP1 and CRABP2 genes from human, which provides compelling evidence that the identified duplicated crabp1 and crabp2 genes from medaka most likely arose owing to teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. The tissue-specific distribution of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka crabp1a, crabp1b, crabp2a, and crabp2b gene transcripts suggests acquisition of new function by these genes in medaka, which may explain potential evolutionary processes that led to the retention of sister duplicates of crabp1 and crabp2 genes in the medaka genome.",

In order to better understand its adaptation mechanism against plant protease inhibitors, bioassays were carried supplementing diet with the Kunitz trypsin inhibitor from Entada acaciifolia seeds (EATI). In vitro assays showed an increase of proteolytic activity in EATI-fed larvae midgut. Moreover, the trypsin enzymes showed insensitivity to inhibition with EATI. In order to understand what genes were overexpressed after chronic exposition to EATI, quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed and revealed an increase in transcription of two trypsin genes, suggesting its participation in insensitivity of midgut trypsins. Another important result was the expression of one chymotrypsin gene, which is not expressed in control fed-larvae but induced in EATI-fed larvae. New regions of higher molecular weight showing proteolytic activity were visualized in inhibitor-fed larvae by zymography gel electrophoresis, proposing that the new enzymes expressed in response of inhibitor dietary would be formatting oligomers. This is a characteristic also observed in other pest insects that adapt to feed in plant protease inhibitors diet. Additional assays revealed that trypsins from EATI-fed larvae also became insensitive against Kunitz and Bowman-Birk inhibitors from soybean. This result suggests a possible involvement of the same S. frugiperda genes in adaptation against Kunitz and Bowman-Birk inhibitors in their host plants.",

In this study, a spider (Araneus ventricosus) chymotrypsin inhibitor (AvCI) that acts as an elastase inhibitor and a microbial serine protease inhibitor was identified. AvCI is a 70-amino acid mature peptide that displays eight conserved cysteine residues and a P1 lysine residue. Recombinant AvCI expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrated inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin (Ki 49.85 nM), but not trypsin, which defines a role for AvCI as a spider-derived chymotrypsin inhibitor. AvCI also exhibited inhibitory activity against microbial serine proteases such as subtilisin A (Ki 20.51 nM) and proteinase K (Ki 65.42 nM). Furthermore, AvCI exhibited no detectable inhibitory effects on factor Xa, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator, or plasmin; however, AvCI strongly inhibited human neutrophil elastase (Ki 8.74 nM) and porcine pancreatic elastase (Ki 11.32 nM), indicating that AvCI acts as an anti-elastolytic factor. These findings constitute molecular evidence that AvCI acts as an inhibitor against chymotrypsin, microbial serine proteases, and elastases.

Alteration of inflammatory cytokines and other immune gene expressions by PAHs in immune organs may play a pivotal role in immunotoxicity.

In Q-PCR analysis, proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF\u03b1) gene expressions were significantly upregulated by BaP while Mx and IgM gene expressions were significantly downregulated in head kidney by a longer exposure to BaP in vivo and in vitro. Lysozyme gene expression was initially upregulated but later downregulated in head kidney in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition test revealed that TNF\u03b1 gene expression was upregulated by BaP via the AHR pathway as blocked by ANF while IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 gene expressions were upregulated by a calcium dependent pathway (i.e. NFAT) as blocked by EGTA. In primary macrophage cells, only IL-8 gene expression was significantly upregulated among proinflammatory cytokines while IFN\u03b3, lysozyme and IgM gene expressions were downregulated by BaP. FasL and SOD expressions were not altered in head kidney cells but significantly upregulated in macrophage cells, indicating apoptosis and oxidative stress. These results indicate that exposure to BaP causes the downregulation of immune response by triggering the death of macrophage cells, the reduction of effectors like IgM and lysozyme, and the decrease of macrophage cell activity.",

Glutathione-S-transferases (GST) are a multifunctional superfamily of enzymes which function in conjugating toxic compounds to less toxic and excretable forms. In this study, we report the molecular characterization and expression patterns of different classes of GST genes in different tissues and developmental stages plus their specific activity. Multiple sequence alignment of all six A. planipennis GSTs (ApGST-E1, ApGST-E2, ApGST-E3, ApGST-O1, ApGST-S1 and ApGST-\u03bc1) revealed conserved features of insect GSTs and a phylogenetic analysis grouped the GSTs within the epsilon, sigma, omega and microsomal classes of GSTs. Real time quantitative PCR was used to study field collected samples. In larval tissues high mRNA levels for ApGST-E1, ApGST-E3 and ApGST-O1 were obtained in the midgut and Malpighian tubules. On the other hand, ApGST-E2 and ApGST-S1 showed high mRNA levels in fat body and ApGST-\u03bc1 showed constitutive levels in all the tissues assayed. During development, mRNA levels for ApGST-E2 were observed to be the highest in feeding instars, ApGST-S1 in prepupal instars; while the others showed constitutive patterns in all the developmental stages examined.

After 12\u00a0weeks, blood was collected and plasma separated for analysis of plasma Ax and cholesterol content. In addition, plasma samples from each group of fish were fractionated into lipoproteins using a sucrose density gradient and ultracentrifugation. The apolipoprotein components of VLDL, LDL and HDL from each sample fraction were separated using SDS-PAGE. The addition of 2% cholesterol to the Ax-containing diet significantly increased the concentration of Ax and cholesterol in fish plasma. The protein-rich fraction was found to be the major carrier of Ax in salmon plasma. Cholesterol supplementation significantly increased Ax in plasma and VLDL as well as increasing plasma cholesterol. The VLDL fraction showed the most significant change in fish fed diet supplemented with cholesterol resulting in higher levels of Ax in this lipoprotein. The results clearly show that dietary cholesterol had a significant effect on the Ax transport process in the blood.",

In the same period (20\u00a0dah), the PAN-RS strain showed significantly faster growth rate than the DAN strain in all the parameters measured in this study. In the case of the 13\u00a0dah of PAN-RS strain, they showed similar morphometries and growth rate with the DAN strain (20\u00a0dah). To investigate why they showed different growth rates in both strains, we analyzed the transcript profile of several genes, such as growth-, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis-, vitellogenesis-, steroidogenesis-, and sex-related gene for both strains. Based on our results, the different growth rates with several reproduction parameters would be associated with transcript profiles of some gene batteries as the first trigger for the related protein expression in both strains. In addition, this study would provide a better understanding of the physiology and endocrinology in K. marmoratus, particularly, of the transcriptional regulation of growth- and reproduction-related genes with clonal difference.",

At least two separate aromatase loci exist in teleost fish that encode distinct isoforms. The activity of two forms, cyp19a and cyp19b1, is predominantly associated with the ovary and the brain, respectively. We isolated sequences that compose the proximal promoters of cyp19a, cyp19b1 and foxl2a, to identify potential transcription factor binding motifs to define sex-specific regulatory profiles for each gene. We also provide evidence for the translation and immunological localization of DAX-1, FOXL2 and MIS to the endoplasmic reticulum and accumulation within secretory vesicles of the salmon oocyte. We found no evidence for the expression of CYP19A or CYP19B1 in the oocyte at the one-year-old stage. However, synthesis of both aromatases was localized to testicular germ and soma cells at this early stage of development.

The expression patterns of FA metabolism genes have not been characterized in developing fish embryos nor compared to lipid class profiles. Full lipid metabolism only occurred after hatching, as revealed by alterations in lipid profiles and FA gene expression. Nonetheless, transcriptional changes of some FA genes were already present in embryos at notochord formation. Many genes displayed an expression profile opposed to the decrease of lipids along the development, while others responded solely to starvation. Transcription of most genes involved in FA metabolism had a strong correlation to PPARs' mRNA levels (\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b2, \u03b3).

In this study, we hypothesized that short period of fasting followed by refeeding would change the expression of muscle growth-related genes in juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of MyoD, myogenin and myostatin and the muscle growth characteristics in the white muscle of juvenile Nile tilapia during short period of fasting followed by refeeding. Juvenile fish were divided into three groups: (FC) control, feeding continuously for 42\u00a0days, (F5) 5\u00a0days of fasting and 37\u00a0days of refeeding, and (F10) 10\u00a0days of fasting and 32\u00a0days of refeeding. At days 5 (D5), 10 (D10), 20 (D20) and 42 (D42), fish (n\u00a0=\u00a014 per group) were anesthetized and euthanized for morphological, morphometric and gene expression analyses. During the refeeding, fasted fish gained weight continuously and, at the end of the experiment (D42), F5 showed total compensatory mass gain. After 5 and 10\u00a0days of fasting, a significant increase in the muscle fiber frequency (class 20) occurred in F5 and F10 compared to FC that showed a high muscle fiber frequency in class 40. At D42, the muscle fiber frequency in class 20 was higher in F5. After 5\u00a0days of fasting, MyoD and myogenin gene expressions were lower and myostatin expression levels were higher in F5 and F10 compared to FC; at D42, MyoD, myogenin and myostatin gene expression was similar among all groups. In conclusion, this study showed that short periods of fasting promoted muscle fiber atrophy in the juvenile Nile tilapia and the refeeding caused compensatory mass gain and changed the expression of muscle growth-related genes that promote muscle growth. These fasting and refeeding protocols have proven useful for understanding the effects of alternative warm fish feeding strategies on muscle growth-related genes.",

     "abstract": "The molecular genetics of inward-rectifier potassium (Kir) channels in insects is poorly understood. To date, Kir channel genes have been characterized only from a few representative dipterans (i.e., fruit flies and mosquitoes). The goal of the present study was to characterize Kir channel cDNAs in a hemipteran, the bed bug (Cimex lectularius). Using our previously reported bed bug transcriptome (RNA-seq), we identified two cDNAs that encode putative Kir channels. One was a full-length cDNA that encodes a protein belonging to the insect \u2018Kir3\u2019 clade, which we designate as \u2018ClKir3\u2019. The other was a partial cDNA that encodes a protein with similarity to both the insect \u2018Kir1\u2019 and \u2018Kir2\u2019 clades, which we designate as \u2018ClKir1/2\u2019. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that ClKir1/2 and ClKir3 exhibited peak expression levels in late-instar nymphs and early-instar nymphs, respectively. Furthermore, ClKir3, but not ClKir1/2, showed tissue-specific expression in Malpighian tubules of adult bed bugs. Lastly, using an improved procedure for delivering double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to male and female bed bugs (via the cervical membrane) we demonstrate rapid and systemic knockdown of ClKir3 transcripts. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the bed bug possesses at least two genes encoding Kir channels, and that RNAi is possible for at least Kir3, thereby offering a potential approach for elucidating the roles of Kir channel genes in bed bug physiology.",

Despite the enormous progress in the study of transthyretin-like protein, little is known about it in amphioxus, a model organism for insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrates. Here we identified a transthyretin-like protein gene in Branchiostoma japonicum, named Bjtlp, which possessed a TLP-HIUase (an enzyme hydrolyzing 5-hydroxyisourate) domain and a consensus C-terminal tetrapeptide Tyr-Arg-Gly-Ser that are both characteristics of all known transthyretin-like proteins. Phylogenetic and intron\u2013exon structure analyses support that TTR likely arose from a vertebrate specific duplication after vertebrates diverged from invertebrate chordates. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that Bjtlp was expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, with the transcript levels being most abundant in the hepatic caecum and hind gut. Enzymatic activity assays demonstrated that recombinant BjTLP had the capacity to hydrolyze 5-hydroxyisourate. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that both Y156 and R93 residues were critical for 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase activity of recombinant BjTLP. Moreover, the single mutation, Y156T, at the active site of BjTLP caused approximately 97% loss of its enzymatic activity, and meanwhile gained the thyroxine binding activity. All these data together suggest that the single mutation Y156T is critical for converting BjTLP to a new transport protein capable of distributing thyroxine.",

To date, full-length sequences of only two genes encoding major ampullate silk protein (MaSp) in Latrodectus hesperus have been determined. In order to further understand this gene family, we utilized in this study a variety of strategies to isolate full-length MaSp1 and MaSp2 cDNAs in the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi. A. bruennichi MaSp1 and MaSp2 are primarily composed of remarkably homogeneous ensemble repeats containing several complex motifs, and both have highly conserved C-termini and N-termini. Two novel amino acid motifs, GGF and SGR, were found in MaSp1 and MaSp2, respectively. Amino acid composition analysis of silk, luminal contents and predicted sequences indicates that MaSp1 and MaSp2 are two major components of major ampullate glands and that the ratio of MaSp1 to MaSp2 is approximately 3:2 in dragline silk. Furthermore, both the MaSp1:MaSp2 ratio and the conserved termini are closely linked with the production of high quality synthetic fibers.

However, we previously found that only GalR1 and GalR2 exist in fish, and fish GalR1 has two genes (GalR1a and GalR1b), with GalR1a possibly representing the primitive gene form during fish evolution. To uncover the functions of GalR1a in fish, here the tissue distribution, developmental expression and the role in nutrition regulation of GalR1a were investigated in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Interestingly, the expression of GalR1a mRNA was restricted to the intestine and brain in adult zebrafish, while GalR1b mRNA was present in all tissues tested. During embryogenesis, GalR1a mRNA was abundant at 1\u00a0hpf (hour past fertilization) and decreased gradually in abundance from 3\u00a0hpf to 10 hpf; then a significant increase in the amount of GalR1a transcripts was observed at 35\u00a0hpf, and this high level was maintained until 5\u00a0dpf (day past fertilization). In situ hybridization of embryos and larvae, expression pattern of GalR1a was mainly restricted to the intestine, pectoral fin, branchial arches and head, indicating a role of GalR1a during zebrafish embryogenesis. Quantitative real-time PCR assay suggested that fasting, high fat feeding or linoleic acid (LA) all could significantly induce up-regulation of GalR1a both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting roles of GalR1a in control of nutrition intake, especially to fat. In addition, a potential role of zebrafish GalR1a in accumulation of lipid droplets in cells was also demonstrated.

Ca-DA1R was expressed ubiquitously, although transcript levels varied between tissues, with higher mRNA levels detected in the ovary, labial palps and mantle. During the four stages of ovarian development, Ca-DA1R mRNA expression level was higher in the proliferation stage than in the other three stages during the ovary cycle. In situ hybridization results reveal that the Ca-DA1R mRNA is mainly expressed in the epithelium of the gonoducts.

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of metabolism and increases during intensive exercise. This is especially problematic for migratory birds that metabolize fat to fuel long-distance flight. Birds can mitigate damage by increasing endogenous antioxidants (e.g. uric acid) or by consuming dietary antioxidants (e.g. tocopherol). During flight, birds may increase protein catabolism of lean tissue which may increase circulating uric acid and many birds also consume an antioxidant-rich frugivorous diet during autumn migration. We evaluated three related hypotheses in a migratory passerine: (1) protein consumption is positively related to circulating antioxidants, (2) a dietary oxidative stressor [i.e. polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)] influences antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage, and (3) oxidative stress influences dietary antioxidant preferences. White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) consuming a high protein diet increased circulating uric acid; however, uric acid, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress did not differ between birds consuming a high PUFA versus a low PUFA diet, despite increased oxidative damage in high PUFA birds.

     "abstract": "The oligopeptide transporter (PepT1) is located on the brush-border membrane of the intestinal epithelium, and plays an important role in dipeptide and tripeptide absorptions from protein digestion. In this study, we cloned the PepT1 cDNA from grass carp and characterized its expression profile in response to dietary protein and feed additives (sodium butyrate) treatments. The PepT1 gene encodes a protein of 714 amino acids with high sequence similarity with other vertebrate homologues. Expression analysis revealed highest levels of PepT1 mRNA expression in the foregut of grass carp. In addition, PepT1 mRNA expression exhibited diurnal variation in all three bowel segments of intestine with lower levels of expression in daytime than nighttime. During embryonic development, PepT1 showed a dynamic pattern of expression reaching maximal levels of expression in the gastrula stage and minimal levels in the organ stage. The PepT1 expression showed constant levels from 14 to 34\u00a0day post-hatch. To determine whether fish diet of different protein contents may have any effect on PepT1 expression, we extended our research to dietary regulation of PepT1 expression. We found that dietary protein levels had a significant effect on PepT1 gene expression. In addition, PepT1 mRNA levels were higher after feeding with fish meal than with soybean meal. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo sodium butyrate treatments increased PepT1 expression in the intestine of grass carp. The results demonstrate for the first time that PepT1 mRNA expression is regulated in a temporal and spatial pattern during development, and dietary protein and feed additives had a significant effects on PepT1 gene expression in grass carp.",

The kinetic analysis shows that dopamine is a more specific substrate for CpH than catechol and l-Dopa (Km value of 0.01\u00a0mM for dopamine versus 0.67\u00a0mM for catechol, and 2.14\u00a0mM for l-Dopa), while kcat is highest for catechol (2.44\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 versus 0.67\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 for l-Dopa and 0.71\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 for dopamine). On treatment with 4\u00a0mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or by proteolysis the o-diPO activity of CpH increases about twofold. In contrast, native LpH shows no o-diPO activity, and exhibits only a slight activity after incubation with SDS. Neither CpH nor LpH show intrinsic mono-PO activity with l-tyrosine and tyramine as substrates. To explore the possible correlation between the degree of PO activity and protein stability of arthropod hemocyanins, the thermal stability of CpH and LpH was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. CpH is found to be less thermostable (Tm\u00a0~\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting that the dicopper active sites are more accessible, thereby allowing the hemocyanin to show PO activity in the native state. The LpH, on the other hand, is more thermostable (Tm\u00a0~\u00a092\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting the existence of a correlation between the thermal stability and the intrinsic PO activity of arthropod hemocyanins.",

In order to better understand the characteristic differences between native MBSP and recombinant MBSP (rMBSP) and to obtain large quantity of MBSP for its application in protein science study, the crucian carp MBSP gene was cloned (669\u00a0bp) and expressed in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris). The recombinant P. pastoris strain was cultured in shake flasks, and 66.85\u00a0mg rMBSP/L in the fermentation supernatant was obtained. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) showed a main protein band with molecular weight of approximately 36\u00a0kDa. Substrate specificity analysis revealed that the rMBSP specifically cleaved substrates at the carboxyl side of lysine residue which differed from native MBSP that cleaved substrates at the carboxyl side of arginine and lysine residues. The optimum temperature and optimum pH range of the rMBSP were 55\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a07.5, respectively.

In this study, we assessed the divergences among teleosts, including within closely related species. The pou2 and sox2 gene expression patterns were characterised over several developmental stages in a cyprinid model, i.e., the goldfish, and the potential regulation sites of these genes within teleost conserved regions were localised. During embryonic development, differences in the expression patterns between the goldfish and other teleosts, including zebrafish, were observed for both genes. The in silico analysis of the 5\u2032 flanking regions of the pou2 gene showed high conservation within teleosts, whereas the sox2 sequence diverged in tetraodontiforms. Certain putative cis regulatory elements were common to all teleosts, whereas others were found only in cyprinids. The analysis of the DNA methylation patterns of the pou2 and sox2 upstream sequences revealed that the studied CpG sites remained hypomethylated at all stages of embryo development in both genes. In contrast, in the adult fin, the studied CpG sites were hypermethylated in pou2 but not in sox2, suggesting the existence of methylation-sensitive regions in pou2.

Here we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of spliced and precursor (unspliced) transcripts as well as the 5\u2032 flanking region of MSTN-2 from the marine fish Umbrina cirrosa (ucMSTN-2). In silico analysis revealed numerous putative cis regulatory elements including several E-boxes known as binding sites to myogenic transcription factors.

Comparative informatics analysis of MSTN-2 from several fish species revealed high conservation of the predicted amino acid sequence as well as the gene structure (exon length) although intron length varied between species. The proximal promoter of MSTN-2 gene was found to be conserved among Perciforms. In conclusion, this study reinforces our conclusion that MSTN-2 promoter is a very strong promoter, especially in muscle cells.

Purification was achieved by gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-75 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on CM Sephadex C-25. Homogeneity of Malabarase was confirmed by RP-HPLC. Malabarase is a monomer that migrated as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The molecular mass of Malabarase was determined to be 23.4\u00a0kDa using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Malabarase is the first serine protease purified from T. malabaricus venom and is selective for fibrinogen. Malabarase hydrolyzes A\u03b1 and B\u03b2 but not \u03b3-chains of fibrinogen similar to the metalloproteases, Malabarin and Trimarin, isolated from the same venom. However, the action of Malabarase on plasma coagulation is opposite than those of Malabarin, Trimarin and the whole venom. Malabarase significantly prolonged plasma coagulation time from 152\u2013341\u00a0s; whereas Malabarin, Trimarin, and whole venom, greatly reduce plasma clotting time from 152 to 12, 48, and 14\u00a0s, respectively. Malabarase did not show hemorrhagic or myotoxic activity. In contrast, Malabarin, Trimarin and whole venom are highly hemorrhagic and myotoxic. These observations support the specificity of Malabarase towards fibrinogen and its non-toxic nature.

The maintenance of mass-specific metabolic rate at routine levels during estivation suggests that metabolic rate suppression is not a major response to estivation in this species. There was a significant decline in liver glycogen and a loss of adipose tissue mass during estivation, suggesting that both carbohydrate and lipid pathways are used to fuel metabolism during estivation. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, an important regulator of carbohydrate oxidation, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, regulators of lipid oxidation, showed no significant change in activity in liver, heart, and muscle between estivating and active frogs. There was an increase in plasma osmolality, which is characteristic of estivating animals.

In this study the comprehensive larval transcriptome from S. exigua was analyzed for the presence of novel repat-homolog sequences. These analyses revealed the presence of at least 46 repat genes in S. exigua, establishing a new gene superfamily in this species. Phylogenetic analysis and studies of conserved motifs in these hypothetical proteins have allowed their classification in two main classes, \u03b1REPAT and \u03b2REPAT. Studies on the transcriptional response of repat genes have shown that \u03b1REPAT and \u03b2REPAT differ in their sequence but also in the pattern of regulation. The \u03b1REPAT were mainly regulated in response to the Cry1Ca toxin from B. thuringiensis but not to the increase in the midgut microbiota load.

Differential expression between midgut stem cells and the whole midgut tissue was studied for the different repat genes revealing changes in the gene expression distribution between midgut stem cells and midgut tissue in response to midgut microbiota.

     "abstract": "We identified full-length cDNAs encoding pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), PACAP-related peptide (PRP), and PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1R) from olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. Two variant mRNA forms were created by alternative splicing. Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences of the PRP\u2013PACAP precursor revealed that skipping of exon 4 within PRP resulted in two variant transcripts: a long form encoding both PRP and PACAP and a short form encoding PACAP only. Both transcripts were constitutively observed only in the brain, whereas the short form appeared in gut tissues, such as the intestine and pyloric cecum in fish challenged with a pathogen, but not in healthy fish. Furthermore, expression of the long PRP/PACAP transcript gradually increased in the intestine of flounder challenged with bacteria, suggesting that PRP and/or PACAP may serve as a regulator(s) of the immune system, especially in the gastrointestinal tract of olive flounder. The biological functions of PACAP and PRP were investigated by exogenous treatment of flounder embryogenic cells (hirame natural embryonic cells, HINAE cells) with synthetic peptides of fPACAP-38 and/or fPRP-45. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in PAC1R-overexpressing HINAE cells was regulated by fPACAP-38 in a concentration-dependent manner, but was not regulated by fPRP-45. Results from real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that PAC1R mRNA was specifically induced by fPACAP-38 but not by fPRP-45; PACAP significantly increased TNF-\u03b1 mRNA but not growth hormone (GH) mRNA in HINAE cells; however, PRP affected GH but not TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression. These results suggest that the expression ratio of PRP and PACAP is regulated at the transcriptional level depending on the tissues and conditions, and that the unique biological roles of PRP and PACAP differ from that of mammalian PRP.",

Results indicated that on average, while the ALA levels of the barramundi liver and fillet increased with increasing dietary ALA, there was no corresponding increase in the levels of the omega-3 (n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). Compared to fish consuming a commercial feed, which contained fish meal and fish oil, fish on the ALA diets grew slower, had a lower feed intake and lower n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 LCPUFA levels in the tissues. Hepatic mRNA expression of \u03946 desaturase (FADS2) and elongase (ELOVL5/2) was ~\u00a010 fold and ~\u00a03 fold higher, respectively, in all the ALA dietary groups, relative to those fed the commercial feed. However, the level of expression of the two genes was not different between fish fed differing ALA levels. These data demonstrate that increasing the ALA level of the diet is not an appropriate strategy for replacing marine sources of n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 LCPUFA in barramundi. It was also noted, however, that within the different ALA dietary groups there was a large amount of variation between individual fish in their tissue DHA levels, suggesting a significant heterogeneity in their capacity for conversion of ALA and/or retention of n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 LCPUFA. When dietary ALA intakes were greater than 0.8% en, tissue DHA levels were inversely related to ALA intake, suggesting that high intake of dietary ALA may inhibit DHA synthesis.",

Within the Lake Nabugabo region, individuals were sampled from Lake Kayanja (normoxic) and Lwamunda Swamp (hypoxic); within the Mpanga River system, individuals were sampled from Bunoga and Kahunge (characterized by seasonal variation in dissolved oxygen (D.O.)). Enzyme activity levels of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and cytochrome C oxidase were measured in four tissues: white skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and liver. Two additional enzymes were measured in the liver, malate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Regional differences between enzyme activities in most tissues were evident; however, little variation was observed between two sites within a region despite differences in D.O. In general, P. multicolor from the Mpanga River system displayed greater anaerobic enzyme activity in white skeletal muscle, lower gluconeogenic enzyme activity in the liver, and an overall higher enzyme activity in the heart and brain tissues than fish from the Nabugabo region. The latter may reflect a long-term adaptation to low-oxygen conditions at the metapopulation level in the Nabugabo region.",

Whole body ammonia levels, the activity of the enzyme GS and the mRNA expression of the splice variants of three paralogues of glul, glutamine synthetase gene (glula, glulb and glulc) were examined in brain, liver and kidney of zebrafish. Whole body ammonia reached significantly higher levels by 48\u00a0h, while brain showed higher levels as early as 24\u00a0h, compared to the values at the start of the transport. The GS activities in brain, liver and kidney were significantly higher at the end of 72\u00a0h transport than those at the start. However, only the expression of mRNA of glulb-002 and glulb-003 were significantly upregulated during the simulated transport. In silico analysis of the putative promoter regions of glul paralogues revealed glucocorticoid receptor binding sites. However, glucocorticoid response elements of glulb were not different. The up-regulation of GS enzyme activity and hitherto unreported mRNA expression of glul paralogues during zebrafish transport indicate a physiological response of fish to ammonia.",

We used high-performance liquid chromatography to determine the types and concentrations of carotenoids in the testes of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus). Additionally, we examined the relationships between testes carotenoid concentrations and carotenoid pools in other body tissues, as well as body mass, testes mass and plumage coloration. We detected low concentrations of several carotenoids \u2013 lutein (the predominant carotenoid), zeaxanthin, anhydrolutein, \u00df-cryptoxanthin, \u00df-carotene and an unknown carotene \u2013 in the testes of wild house finches. We also found that testes lutein levels were significantly and positively associated with circulating lutein levels, while the concentration of zeaxanthin in testes was positively associated with zeaxanthin levels in liver, though in this instance the relationship was much weaker and only marginally significant. Furthermore, lutein levels in testes were significantly negatively associated with testes mass. Finally, plumage coloration was not associated with either the concentration of carotenoids in the testes or relative testes mass. These results suggest that testes carotenoids are reflective of the pool of circulating carotenoids in house finches, and that plumage coloration is unlikely to signal either the carotenoid content of testes tissue or a male's capacity for sperm production.",

To better understand the molecular mechanism of oocyte and spermatocyte maturation in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain), the full length cDNA of cdc2 (Sp-cdc2) and cyclin B (Sp-cyclin B) were cloned and characterized. The full length cDNA of Sp-cdc2 gene is of 1593\u00a0bp encoding a protein of 299 amino acids. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the expression level of Sp-cdc2 in the ovary was higher than in other tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01); and its expression level was not significantly different in different stages of ovary development (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), meanwhile there was higher expression in T3 stage than in T1 and T2 stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Paj-MIPI and Paj-MIPII encoded proteins with 189 and 117 amino acid residues, respectively, and a total of 10 mature peptides are putatively produced from the two MIP cDNAs (seven from Paj-MIPI and three from Paj-MIPII). Among the MIPs from various arthropods, their size and organization varied and it was unable to establish the monophyletic evolutionary relationship, which is mainly due to difference in the number and location of the mature peptide W(X6)W motif of each MIP gene. Based on the sequence similarity of six residues flanked by two conserved tryptophan (W) residues, crustacean MIPs could be further classified into at least four groups. Paj-ASTC cDNA (648\u00a0bp) encoded a protein with 143 amino acid residues. The prepropeptide of Paj-ASTC showed conserved C-type AST characteristics including a signal sequence, two dibasic cleavage sites, and a mature peptide sequence with two cysteine residues at the 7th and 14th positions, creating a disulfide bridge. Based on the sequence similarity in the mature peptides, the ASTCs in arthropods could be further classified into two subgroups, AVSCF-ASTC and PISCF-ASTC. Phylogenetic and sequence similarity analysis showed that Paj-ASTC belonged to the PISCF-ASTC subgroup. Expression studies revealed that AST-like peptides from P. japonica were mainly expressed in neuronal tissues, and the expression of Paj-ASTC was also detected in the intestine. Eyestalk ablation (ESA) altered the mRNA expression levels of both Paj-MIPs and Paj-ASTC, suggesting that factors from the sinus gland/X organ complex had a transient effect on AST-like peptide transcription.

They are small cationic AMPs (5\u20137\u00a0kDa) characterized by a proline-rich amino-terminal domain and a cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain. Here, the first 3 crustin-like cDNAs (Pj-crus Ia, Ib, and II) were identified from the morotoge shrimp, Pandalopsis japonica. The full-length cDNAs of Pj-crus Ia, Ib, and II consisted of 1135, 580, and 700 nucleotides and encoded putative proteins containing 109, 119, and 186 amino acids residues, respectively. All 3 identified Pj-crus sequences exhibited the conserved domain organization for crustins, including a signal sequence, a cysteine-containing region, a glycine-rich region, and a whey-acidic protein (WAP) domain. Amino acid sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Pj-crus Ia and Ib belong to type I crustins (e.g., carcinin), which have been mostly identified from Brachyura and Astacidea, whereas Pj-crus II was classified as belonging to the type II crustins, which are mainly found in Dendrobranchiata. An analysis of the organization of these 3 Pj-crus genes revealed that the splicing site within the WAP domain may be an important key for classifying types I and II crustin family members. The tissue distribution profile results showed that the Pj-crus I genes were expressed in a tissue-specific manner but that the Pj-crus II gene was expressed ubiquitously, suggesting that these crustins may play different roles in various tissues or under different physiological conditions. The bacterial challenge results suggested that the Pj-crus genes may be transcriptionally influenced by different bacterial types. This comparative study of various crustin family members will help extend the knowledge on the crustacean innate immune response, which will provide important basic information for controlling shrimp immunity against various pathogens.",

     "abstract": "Wild female Crassostrea corteziensis oyster (n\u00a0=\u00a0245) were analyzed over one year to understand the main ecophysiological events associated to gonad development. Different indicators (mainly biochemical) were analyzed to infer: i) utilization and accumulation of energy reserves (e.g. neutral lipids, carbohydrates, proteins; vitellogenin), ii) membrane components provided by the diet as essential nutrients and indicative of cell proliferation (e.g. highly unsaturated fatty acids linked to phospholipids, sterols), iii) indicators of food availability (chlorophyll a in water, pigments in tissues, specific fatty acids and sterols), iv) gonad development (e.g. gonad coverage area, vitellin). A PCA analysis was applied to 269 measured variables. The first PC (PC1) was composed of total carbohydrate and lipid concentration, percentage of esterified sterols, fatty acids specific of diatoms; 16:1n\u22127/16:0, 20:5n\u22123 in neutral lipids with positive loadings and non methylene\u2212interrupted fatty acids (NMI) in neutral lipids with negative loadings. The second PC (PC2) was composed of 18:4n\u22123 in lipid reserves and the concentration of zeaxanthin, a pigment typical of cyanobacteria with positive loadings and the proportion of 20:4n\u22126 in polar lipids with negative loading. The third PC (PC3) was composed of gonad coverage area (GCA) and the concentration of vitellin. Variation in GCA confirms that gonad development began in April with an extended period of spawning and rematuration from April to November. The PCA further shows that a second period of minimal maturation from November to March corresponds to the accumulation of reserves (PC1) together with an initial high availability of food (PC2) at the beginning of this period. These two periods are in accordance with the classical periods of allocation of energy to reserves followed by gonad development reported for several mollusks.",

Rainbow trout are also vulnerable to thiamin deficiency in wild life and are useful models for thiamin metabolism research. We identified the tpk gene transcript including seven splice variants in the rainbow trout. Almost all cell lines and tissues examined showed co-expression of several tpk splice variants including a potentially major one at both mRNA and protein levels. However, relative to other tissues, the longest variant mRNA expression was predominant in the ovary and abundant in embryos. During embryogenesis, total tpk transcripts increased abruptly in early development, and decreased to about half of the peak shortly after hatching. In rainbow trout, the tpk transcript complex is ubiquitously expressed for all tissues and cells examined, and its increase in expression could be important in the early-middle embryonic stages. Moreover, decimated tpk expression in a hepatoma cell line relative to hepatic and gonadal cell lines appears to be consistent with previously reported down-regulation of thiamin metabolism in cancer.",

A forward suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library was constructed from the S. litura fat body and the up-regulated genes were identified to isolate differentially expressed genes in response to N. rileyi. A total of 345/1175 random clones screened by cDNA array dot blotting were sequenced, resulting in 117 uniquely expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Potential functional genes were identified by BLAST searches and were categorized into seven groups associated with different biological processes based on the literature and gene ontologies. Among 117 genes, 74 had matches in the non-redundant (NR) protein database and were found to be involved in different biological processes, while 43 of the screened genes were classified to the \u201cunknown function\u201d gene group. Notably, only two genes had previously been reported in S. litura and most of the screened genes showed less similarity to known sequences based on BLASTn results, suggesting that 115 genes were found for the first time in S. litura. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of seven randomly selected genes revealed that most were differentially expressed after N. rileyi infection. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that four genes (Hsp70, Hsp90, gallerimycin, and cysteine proteinase) were significantly up-regulated after N. rileyi infection. Taken together, the present study identified up-regulated S. litura genes in response to N. rileyi infection.

In this study, the effects of anoxic submergence (20\u00a0h at 7\u00a0\u00b0C in nitrogen-bubbled water) were assessed on LDH from liver of an anoxia-tolerant freshwater turtle, the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans). Liver LDH from aerobic and anoxic turtles was purified to homogeneity in two steps. The kinetic properties and thermal stability of purified LDH were analyzed, revealing significant differences between the two enzyme forms in Vmax, Km pyruvate, and I50 pyruvate as well as melting temperature determined by differential scanning fluorimetry. The phosphorylation state of aerobic and anoxic forms of LDH was visualized by ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining, the results indicating that the anoxic form had a higher phosphorylation state. Incubation studies that promoted protein kinase versus protein phosphatase actions showed that changes in the phosphorylation state of aerobic and anoxic forms mimicked the anoxia-responsive changes in Km pyruvate and I50 pyruvate. The high phosphate form of liver LDH that occurs in anoxic turtles appears to be a less active form. Turtle liver LDH was also subject to another form of posttranslational modification, protein acetylation, with a 70% higher content of acetylated lysine residues on anoxic versus aerobic LDH. This is the first study to show that LDH function in an anoxia-tolerant animal can be differentially modified between aerobic and anoxic states via the mechanism of posttranslational modification.",

Both GHRH and GHRH-R mRNAs were expressed throughout embryonic development from the multi-cell stage to the newly hatched larvae stage, and the highest GHRH and GHRH-R expressions appeared at the brain vesicle stage and the heart stage, respectively. In vitro studies performed on the grouper pituitary primary cells showed that a synthetic grouper GHRH-NH2 increased both GH mRNA expression and GH protein release in a dose-dependent manner.

Follistatin plays a key role in regulating folliculogenesis and the development of ovary. However, limited information on follistatin genes from molluscs is available until now. By using Race, real-time PCR, in situ hybridization and in silico analysis, a full-length cDNA of follistatin of the Portuguese oyster Crassostrea angulata was acquired. The full-length (1297\u00a0bp) cDNA of Ca-follistatin encodes a peptide of 241 amino acids. The similarity of its deduced amino acid sequence to these of other invertebrate species was about 60%. Ca-follistatin mRNA transcript was most abundantly expressed in ovary (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and it was also expressed in testis, adductor muscle, mantle, gill and visceral mass. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression and distribution of Ca-follistatin gene were expressed exclusively in granulosa cells, neither in cumulus oophorus nor in oocytes. During the reproductive cycle of female oyster (initiation stage, maturation stage, ripeness stage and partially spent stage), the expression of Ca-follistatin in the ovary continuously increased from initiation to ripeness stages attaining its highest value (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), then the expression level decreased sharply to the lowest point in the partially spent stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the Ca-follistatin mRNA transcript of male oyster in the testis maintained a relatively stable low level during the first three stages, and also noticeably decreased thereafter (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

To investigate how bears maintain energy homeostasis during hibernation, we analyzed changes in mRNA expression of hepatic genes involved in energy metabolism throughout the hibernation period in captive, adult, female Japanese black bears (Ursus thibetanus japonicus). Real-time PCR analysis revealed down-regulation of glycolysis- (e.g., glucokinase), amino acid catabolism- (e.g., alanine aminotransferase) and de novo lipogenesis-related genes (e.g., acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1), and up-regulation of gluconeogensis- (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase), \u03b2-oxidation- (i.e., uncoupling protein 2) and ketogenesis-related genes (i.e., 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary-CoA synthase 2), during hibernation, compared to the active period (June). In addition, we found that glycolysis-related genes (i.e., glucokinase and pyruvate kinase) were more suppressed in the early phase of hibernation (January) compared to the late phase (March). One week after the commencement of feeding in April, expression levels of most genes returned to levels comparable to those seen in June, but \u03b2-oxidation-related genes were still up-regulated during this period. These results suggest that the modulation of gene expression is not static, but changes throughout the hibernation period.

However, their biosynthesis, metabolism, and biological function remain largely un-elucidated due to their extreme instability and high reactivity. Tunichromes and related compounds uniquely possess dehydrodopamine moieties, all originating from post-translational modification of peptidyl tyrosine. It is conceivable that the presence of such novel post-translationally modified groups provide attributes that are crucial for their biological roles. Therefore, we examined the chemistry and reactivity of tunichromes in light of the available knowledge of the biochemistry of simple monomeric dehydro-N-acyldopamine units. Based on the reactivity of such simple compounds, the potential biological activities of tunichromes are predicted. Their possible biosynthetic route from peptidyl tyrosine is critically evaluated to provide a better basis for unraveling their biological functions.

The control of cell fate by these two interconvertible lipids has been called the sphingolipid rheostat or sphingolipid biostat. Sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that synthesizes S1P, is a crucial enzyme in regulation of the balance of these sphingolipids. Sphingosine kinase has been shown to play dynamic roles in the responses of cells to stress, leading to modulation of cell fate through a variety of signaling pathways impinging on the processes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence.

     "abstract": "Hypoxic tolerance is subjected to modification during environmental stress. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the plasticity of hypoxic tolerance will be helpful for clinical applications such as stroke prevention. In a freshwater invertebrate, Daphnia pulex, we found that preconditioning with the antidiabetic drug metformin protects the animals from hypoxic insult. Metformin is known to activate the cellular energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Application of the AMPK antagonist, compound C, effectively abolished the protective action by metformin. Meanwhile, the AMPK agonist AICAR failed to mimic the protective effect of metformin. At transcript level, metformin treatment increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) \u03b1 and \u03b2 genes, as well as the HIF target genes in an AMPK-dependent manner, while AICAR treatment alone failed to increase the expression of HIF genes. Metformin treatment also increased the expression of AMPK \u03b1 and \u03b3 genes, and this effect was blocked by compound C. These observations suggest that HIF activation and HIF target gene expression are possibly involved in metformin-mediated protection, while AMPK activation is necessary, but not sufficient for metformin-induced protection. Since increased hypoxic tolerance involves regenerative responses and thus protein synthesis, we measured the gene expression of the components of mTOR signaling pathway. Metformin increased the gene expression of raptor, a component of mTORC1 and known to control protein synthesis, and such increase was also eliminated by compound C. Taken together, metformin preconditioning activates multiple signaling pathways involved in gene expression and protein synthesis.",

In the 1160\u00a0bp genomic sequence, four exons, three introns, and 5\u2032-/3\u2032-flanking sequences were identified. The putative peptide was 92 residues long, including a putative signal peptide containing 23 amino acids, the GnRH decapeptide, a proteolytic cleavage site of three amino acids and a GnRH associated peptide of 56 amino acids. The overall amino acid sequence of C. semilaevis GnRH-III (csGnRH-III) was highly conserved with other teleost GnRH-III genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed the evolutionary relationships of csGnRH-III with other known GnRH genes. A 320\u00a0bp promoter sequence of the csGnRH-III was also analyzed, and several potential regulatory motifs were identified which were conserved in the GnRH promoters of other teleosts. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated csGnRH-III was expressed only in brain and gonads. In C. semilaevis, the csGnRH-III transcript was maternally deposited and appeared to be developmentally regulated during embryogenesis and early larval development. Comparing sequence and expression patterns of csGnRH-III with other teleosts GnRH-IIIs suggested that the main function of GnRH-III might be conserved in teleosts.",

We isolated two closely related NELL2 transcript sequences from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). These conceptually translated NELL2a and -b sequences share 83% identical residues and the NELL-typical structure. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that bony fish possess two NELL genes, though these are either present as NELL1/2 pair corresponding to their mammalian orthologs or as a NELL2a/2b combination that might have arisen by a fish-specific duplication event. Both trout NELL2 genes are highly expressed at early developmental stages. In adult rainbow trout, NELL2a copies were detected in each tissue analyzed, whereas NELL2b is abundantly expressed only in brain. Cerebral NELL2a/b gene expression seems to be temperature-independent, whereas NELL2a gene expression is clearly down-regulated in gill and up-regulated in muscle tissue after temperature elevation. Infection with Aeromonas salmonicida leads to a considerable increase in NELL2a/b copy number in trunk kidney at day 7 p.i. Moreover, comparative qRT-PCR revealed different NELL2a/b expression pattern in two rainbow trout strains, imported rainbow trout TCO and a local trout selection strain BORN that is known to be resistant to several biotic and abiotic stressors.",

The 39\u00a0kDa protein as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions made up about 17% of plasma proteins and was found in extrapallial fluid. RACE reactions with primers designed from an EST sequence identified by BLAST search in GenBank using the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained by Edman degradation of the purified protein, predicted a 997\u00a0bp complete cDNA that encoded 277 amino acids including a 16-residue signal peptide at the N-terminus. The deduced mature protein, composed of 261 amino acids, had a calculated molecular mass of 30,483.9\u00a0Da which was lower than the molecular mass of the purified protein measured by MALDI. The difference was likely due to post-translational modifications as the protein was predicted to have multiple sites for glycosylation and phosphorylation. The protein mRNA was detected in hemocytes by in situ hybridization and quantified in oyster tissues by RT-qPCR. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the protein was most abundant in tissues rich in blood sinuses like the gills and dorsally along the base of the mantle. ICP metal analysis of purified protein indicated highest association with zinc, calcium and iron and much greater metal content than in purified dominin, the most abundant protein of eastern oysters. Results of N-terminal and internal peptide sequencing of SDS-PAGE separated plasma proteins from Pacific, Suminoe and European flat oysters indicated that the second most abundant plasma protein is conserved. Several possible functions of segon in metal transport and detoxification, host defense, antioxidation and shell mineralization are proposed as they relate to its capacity to bind metals.",

Both sox8a and sox10a genes contain three exons and two introns, and encode putative proteins with typical structures of group E Sox. Sox8a was expressed in diverse tissues including the central nervous system and some peripheral tissues. In contrast, sox10a mRNA was detected primarily in the central nervous system. During embryogenesis, sox8a mRNA seemed to be de novo synthesized in the embryos from otic vesicle stage. However, sox10a mRNA was only detectable in juvenile fish 35\u00a0days post hatching and thereafter. The mRNA levels of sox8a in the gonads were not significantly different among ovarian developmental stages but increased in the testis. In vitro transfection assays showed that the Sox10a but not Sox8a up-regulated cyp19a1a promoter activities. Taken together, these results suggested that the sox8a may play roles in diverse tissues and during embryogenesis, whereas sox10a may be mainly involved in the neural regulation of juvenile and adult fish, and that certain Sox homologues may regulate the orange-spotted grouper cyp19a1a promoter.",

Modulation of AMYA mRNA level had already been observed in response to food availability, whereas the functional role of AMYB was still unknown. To improve knowledge about the regulation of amylase expression in C. gigas and the respective roles of the two genes, we made an assay of amylase expression at mRNA and enzymatic levels in the digestive gland of oysters that had received dietary supplements of starch. After 18\u00a0days, a significant increase of translatable mRNA for AMYB was observed, with a correlated increase in Michaelis-Menten constant Km values and a decrease in total amylase activity. This modulation is the first evidence of observable functioning of AMYB in digestive processes. Amylase B is suggested to display a higher Km than amylase A, offering a means of adapting to high substrate concentrations. The highest starch supplement level (10\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) induced alteration in oyster physiology.

Teleost fish possess two MSTN paralogs (MSTN-1 and MSTN-2) whose respective physiological functions are still largely unclear. To clarify the role of each of these paralogs the transcript abundance of Mstn-1 and Mstn-2 was quantified during embryonic and larval development of the teleosts, barramundi, Lates calcarifer. Histological analyses of developing muscle fibers were also obtained to correlate Mstn paralog expression with muscle hypertrophy as larvae undergo metamorphosis. Mstn-1 and Mstn-2 transcripts were detected as early as immediately postfertilization of eggs, with the level of expression observed to increase during embryonic development and reach a peak near hatching. Mstn-2 expression was thousands-fold higher than that observed for Mstn-1. Close to metamorphosis, the expression of Mstn-1 was non-significantly, although positively associated, with muscle hypertrophy (r\u00a0=\u00a00.384, p\u00a0=\u00a00.064), while that of Mstn-2 showed a highly significant negative correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.691, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) suggesting that this paralog may be responsible for muscle hypertrophy that occurs post-metamorphosis. Altogether, findings from this study support the hypothesis that Mstn paralogs are differentially regulated during various phases of fish development and that they may have evolved different functions in fish, particularly that related to muscle hypertrophy.",

     "abstract": "Many cancer cells have a strong requirement for glutamine. As an aid for understanding this phenomenon the 18F-labeled 2S,4R stereoisomer of 4-fluoroglutamine [(2S,4R)4-FGln] was previously developed for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET). In the present work, comparative enzymological studies of unlabeled (2S,4R)4-FGln and its deamidated product (2S,4R)4-FGlu were conducted as an adjunct to these PET studies. Our findings are as follows: Rat kidney preparations catalyze the deamidation of (2S,4R)4-FGln. (2,4R)4-FGln and (2S,4R)4-FGlu are substrates of various aminotransferases. (2S,4R)4-FGlu is a substrate of glutamate dehydrogenase, but not of sheep brain glutamine synthetase. The compound is, however, a strong inhibitor of this enzyme. Rat liver cytosolic fractions catalyze a \u03b3-elimination reaction with (2S,4R)4-FGlu, generating \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Coupling of a deamidase reaction with this \u03b3-elimination reaction provides an explanation for the previous detection of 18F\u2212 in tumors exposed to [18F](2S,4R)4-FGln. One enzyme contributing to this reaction was identified as alanine aminotransferase, which catalyzes competing \u03b3-elimination and aminotransferase reactions with (2S,4R)4-FGlu. This appears to be the first description of an aminotransferase catalyzing a \u03b3-elimination reaction. The present results demonstrate that (2S,4R)4-FGln and (2S,4R)4-FGlu are useful analogues for comparative studies of various glutamine- and glutamate-utilizing enzymes in normal and cancerous mammalian tissues, and suggest that tumors may metabolize (2S,4R)4-FGln in a generally similar fashion to glutamine. In plants, yeast and bacteria a major route for ammonia assimilation involves the consecutive action of glutamate synthase plus glutamine synthetase (glutamate synthase cycle). It is suggested that (2S,4R)4-FGln and (2S,4R)4-FGlu will be useful probes in studies of ammonia assimilation by the glutamate synthase pathway in these organisms. Finally, glutamine transaminases are conserved in mammals, plants and bacteria, and probably serve to close the methionine salvage pathway, thus linking nitrogen metabolism to sulfur metabolism and one-carbon metabolism. It is suggested that (2S,4R)4-FGln may be useful in studies of the methionine salvage pathway in a variety of organisms.",

The full-length cDNA sequence of bmp15 is 2217\u00a0bp which contained 214\u00a0bp 5\u2032-UTR and 845\u00a0bp 3\u2032-UTR.

BMP15 has a specific RXXR protease cleavage site of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily (is RIRR) and six conserved cysteine residues. Using real-time quantitative PCR revealed that bmp15 mRNA was largely expressed in the ovary and testis and mostly in oocytes within the follicle, slightly expressed in muscle, liver and pituitary. BMP15 is mainly present at stage I follicles by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Phylogenetic analysis showed that gibel carp bmp15 was similar to bmp15 of zebrafish and other fish species. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in isolated follicles of gibel carp in vitro showed altered bmp15 mRNA expression: when treated with 10\u00a0ng/mL hCG for 10\u00a0h, the expression level of bmp15 was significantly increased. However, with proceeding cultivation, the expression level of BMP15 mRNA decreased.

     "abstract": "Membrane composition, particularly of mitochondria, could be a critical factor by determining the propagation of reactions involved in mitochondrial function during periods of high oxidative stress such as rapid growth and aging. Considering that phospholipids not only contribute to the structural and physical properties of biological membranes, but also participate actively in cell signaling and apoptosis, changes affecting either class or fatty acid compositions could affect phospholipid properties and, thus, alter mitochondrial function and cell viability. In the present study, heart and brain mitochondrial membrane phospholipid compositions were analyzed in rainbow trout during the four first years of life, a period characterized by rapid growth and a sustained high metabolic rate. Specifically, farmed fish of three ages (1-, 2- and 4-years) were studied, and phospholipid class compositions of heart and brain mitochondria, and fatty acid compositions of individual phospholipid classes were determined. Rainbow trout heart and brain mitochondria showed different phospholipid compositions (class and fatty acid), likely related to tissue-specific functions. Furthermore, changes in phospholipid class and fatty acid compositions with age were also tissue-dependent. Heart mitochondria had lower proportions of cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol, and higher levels of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) with age. Heart mitochondrial membranes became more unsaturated with age, with a significative increase of peroxidation index in CL, PS and sphingomyelin (SM). Therefore, heart mitochondria became more susceptible to oxidative damage with age. In contrast, brain mitochondrial PC and PS content decreased in 4-year-old animals while there was an increase in the proportion of SM. The three main phospholipid classes in brain (PC, PE and PS) showed decreased n\u2212\u00a03 polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid and peroxidation index, which indicate a different response of brain mitochondrial lipids to rapid growth and maturation.",

Cysteine protease inhibitors act upon the cysteine proteases to regulate their activity.

Here, we report the identification of a new member of the family 1 cystatin in Oplegnathus fasciatus rock bream (denoted as RbCyt B) and the characterization at the molecular level. The complete genomic sequence of RbCyt B consists of three exons and a promoter region. The open reading frame (ORF) encodes for a 100 amino acids length polypeptide with a single cystatin-like domain and a cysteine protease inhibitor signature motif. The conserved N-terminal glycine, glutamine-valine-glycine motif, QxVxG, and a variant of the proline-tryptophan, PW, motif were identified. RbCyt B showed closest phylogenetic distance to Dicentrarchus labrax cystatin B, and shared up to 73% amino acid identity and 90% amino acid similarity with known cystatin B genes. RbCyt B mRNA expression was detected in nine different tissues and was highly expressed in liver, spleen, gill, brain, intestine, kidney, head kidney, and blood, as compared with muscle. In vivo immune stimulation with Edwardsiella tarda bacteria caused significant up-regulation of RbCyt B mRNA in head kidney and spleen at 24\u00a0h post-infection (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Recombinant RbCyt B was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein demonstrated 82% papain inhibitory activity at 500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u03bcL\u2212\u00a01 in a concentration-dependent manner.

Enzyme activities were measured over a range from 0 to 70\u00a0\u00b0C (lipases/esterases, proteinases) and pH 5 to 9 (proteinases). In all species, relative proteinases activity peaked at 40/50\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6; relative lipases/esterases activity peaked at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Between 0 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C, lipase activity of C. glacialis was higher (40\u201370% of maximum) than that of the boreal copepods (25\u201364%), which suggests thermal adaptation of the lipid metabolism in the polar species. Incubating C. glacialis with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii showed (i) that enzyme activities increased especially in the alkaline range and (ii) that enzyme patterns, revealed by gel electrophoresis, differed from that of starving individuals, indicating that feeding induced enzyme expression. Such studies, linking abiotic and biotic conditions to enzyme functioning, can help elucidating the capacity of copepods to respond to environmental changes.",

The present study investigated autoregulatory effects of gonadotropins, using recombinant FSH (rFSH) and LH (rLH) in cinnamon clownfish (Amphiprion melanopus). Experiments were carried out to investigate the actions of cinnamon clownfish rFSH and rLH on expression of GTH subunits, GTH receptors, and vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA in vivo and in vitro. Plasma estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) level was also measured in immature fish following treatments with rFSH and rLH. The results demonstrate increasing levels of GTH subunits, GTH-receptors, Vtg mRNA levels, as well as plasma E2 levels following injection with rFSH and rLH. The findings support the hypothesis that LH and FSH stimulate reproduction, in part, by autoregulatory mechanisms leading to upregulation of GTH receptors and GTH hormone production in cinnamon clownfish. The results provide a framework for better understanding of the mechanisms of GTH-mediated control of reproduction in cinnamon clownfish and other vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "The present study was conducted to explore the effects of corticosterone (CORT) on the regulation of appetite-associated genes in laying hens. Forty eight laying hens were randomly divided into two groups: one received subcutaneous injection of CORT (2\u00a0mg/kg body weight, CORT-exposed) and the other received sham-treatment (Control). Treatment of hens with CORT stimulated an increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in plasma CORT, glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, cholesterol (Chol) and triiodothyronine (T3), but the concentrations of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triacylglycerol (TG) were decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CORT treatment had no significant effect (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) on the mRNA levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), melanocortin receptor 4 and 5 (MCR-4 and MCR-5) and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the hypothalamus when compared with control hens. However, the expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti-related protein (AgRP) and melanocortin recepter 1 (MCR-1) were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) suppressed while the mRNA levels of ghrelin and cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) were significantly upregulated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in CORT-treated hens. Treatment of laying hens with CORT had no significant (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) effect on the mRNA levels of CCK in the glandular stomach and the duodenum, and those of ghrelin in the glandular stomach, the duodenum and the jejunum. However, the mRNA levels of CCK in the jejunum and the ileum, and those of ghrelin in the ileum were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) suppressed by CORT treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that CORT plays a unique role in some special neuropeptides (e.g., ghrelin, CART, POMC, CCK and MCRs) and a dynamic balance between these appetite-associated peptides in the hypothalamus and the gastrointestinal tract defines the feeding status of CORT-exposed laying hens.",

     "abstract": "Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) peptide family members play critical roles in growth and reproduction in decapods. Three cDNAs encoding CHH family members (Pj-CHH1ES, Pj-CHH1PO, and Pj-CHH2) were isolated by a combination of bioinformatic analysis and conventional cloning strategies. Pj-CHH1ES and Pj-CHH1PO were products of the same gene that were generated by alternative mRNA splicing, whereas Pj-CHH2 was the product of a second gene. The Pj-CHH1 and Pj-CHH2 genes had four exons and three introns, suggesting the two genes arose from gene duplication. The three cDNAs were classified in the type I CHH subfamily, as the deduced amino acid sequences had a CHH precursor-related peptide sequence positioned between the N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal mature peptide sequence. The Pj-CHH1ES isoform was expressed at a higher level in the eyestalk X-organ/sinus gland (XO/SG) complex and at a lower level in the gill. The Pj-CHH1PO isoform was expressed at higher levels in the XO/SG complex, brain, abdominal ganglion, and thoracic ganglion and at a lower level in the epidermis. Pj-CHH2 was expressed at a higher level in the thoracic ganglion and at a lower level in the gill. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the effects of eyestalk ablation on the mRNA levels of the three Pj-CHHs in the brain, thoracic ganglion, and gill. Eyestalk ablation reduced expression of Pj-CHH1ES in the brain and Pj-CHH1PO and Pj-CHH2 in the thoracic ganglion. Sequence alignment of the Pj-CHHs with CHHs from other species indicated that Pj-CHH2 had an additional alanine at position #9 of the mature peptide. Molecular modeling showed that the Pj-CHH2 mature peptide had a short alpha helix (\u03b11) in the N-terminal region, which is characteristic of type II CHHs. This suggests that Pj-CHH2 differs in function from other type I CHHs.",

Partial (50%) replacement of the added dietary fish oil with poultry oil significantly improved fish growth whereas 100% replacement with canola oil significantly depressed fish growth. The fatty acid profiles of the fish fillets generally reflected those of the dietary oils except that there was apparent selective utilization of palmitic acid (16:0) and oleic acid (18:1n-9) and apparent selective retention of eicospentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). The Prx 1 and 4 genes were expressed at 10- and 100-fold the level of the GPx 4 and 1 genes, respectively, and at one-tenth the level of the highly expressed \u03b2-actin reference gene. Dietary fish oil replacement with canola oil significantly up-regulated GPx 1 gene expression and there was a non-significant tendency towards down-regulation of Prx 1 and Prx 4.

After 10\u00a0h at hypoxia (1.5\u20132.0\u00a0mg oxygen/L), the concentration of L-lactate in plasma increased significantly, but the ATP amount and the concentration of ATP\u03b2 protein remained unaffected. Nevertheless, an increase of 70% in the ATPase activity was detected, suggesting that the enzyme may be regulated at a post-translational level. Thus, during hypoxia shrimp are able to maintain ATP amounts probably by using some other energy sources as phosphoarginine when an acute lack of energy occurs. During re-oxygenation, the ATPase activity decreased significantly and the ATP production continued via the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. The results obtained showed that shrimp faces hypoxia partially by hydrolyzing the ATP through the reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial ATPase which increases its activity.",

Competent larvae of H. elegans undergo the transition from the swimming larval stage to the sessile juvenile stage with substantial morphological, physiological, and behavior changes. This transition is often referred to as larval settlement and metamorphosis. In this study, we examined the possible involvement of calmodulin (CaM) \u2014 a multifunctional calcium metabolism regulator, in the larval settlement and metamorphosis of H. elegans. A full-length CaM cDNA was successfully cloned from H. elegans (He-CaM) and it contained an open reading frame of 450\u00a0bp, encoding 149 amino acid residues. It was highly expressed in 12\u00a0h post-metamorphic juveniles, and remained high in adults. In situ hybridization conducted in competent larvae and juveniles revealed that He-CaM gene was continuously expressed in the putative growth zones, branchial rudiments, and collar region, suggesting that He-CaM might be involved in tissue differentiation and development. Our subsequent bioassay revealed that the CaM inhibitor W7 could effectively inhibit larval settlement and metamorphosis, and cause some morphological defects of unsettled larvae. In conclusion, our results revealed that CaM has important functions in the larval settlement and metamorphosis of H. elegans.",

ZaUCP4 shows a high similarity to predicted insect UCP4 isoforms and known mammalian UCP4s, both at the nucleotide and amino acid sequence levels. Bioenergetic studies clearly demonstrate UCP function in mitochondria from larval and pupal fat bodies. In non-phosphorylating mitochondria, ZaUCP activity was stimulated by palmitic acid and inhibited by the purine nucleotide GTP. In phosphorylating mitochondria, ZaUCP4 activity decreased the yield of oxidative phosphorylation. ZaUCP4 was immunodetected with antibodies raised against human UCP4 as a single 36-kDa band. A lower expression of ZaUCP4 at the level of mRNA and protein and a decreased ZaUCP4 activity were observed in the Z. atratus pupal fat body compared with the larval fat body.

Transitions into and out of torpor are more physiologically challenging than the extreme metabolic suppression and cold body temperatures of torpor per se. Mammals that hibernate show unprecedented capacities to tolerate cerebral ischemia, a decrease in blood flow to the brain caused by stroke, cardiac arrest or brain trauma. While cerebral ischemia often leads to death or disability in humans and most other mammals, hibernating mammals suffer no ill effects when blood flow to the brain is dramatically decreased during torpor or experimentally induced during euthermia. These animals, as adults, also display rapid and pronounced synaptic flexibility where synapses retract during torpor and rapidly re-emerge upon arousal. A variety of coordinated adaptations contribute to tolerance of cerebral ischemia in these animals. In this review we discuss adaptations in heterothermic mammals that may suggest novel therapeutic targets and strategies to protect the human brain against cerebral ischemic damage and neurodegenerative disease.",

RpGST\u03b8 was cloned and the recombinant protein expressed, in order to study its biochemical characteristics and determine its physiological activities. The cDNA comprised an ORF of 693\u00a0bp, encoding 231 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27\u00a0kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.2. Sequence analysis revealed that RpGST\u03b8 possessed characteristic conserved domains of the GST_N family, Class Theta subfamily (PSSM: cd03050) and GST_C_family Super family (PSSM: cl02776). Phylogenetic analysis showed that RpGST\u03b8 evolutionarily linked with other theta class homologues. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and the purified enzyme showed high activity with GST substrates like CDNB and 4-NBC. Glutathione dependent peroxidase activity of GST, investigated with cumene hydroperoxide as substrate affirmed the antioxidant property of rRpGST\u03b8. By quantitative PCR, RpGST\u03b8 was found to be ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels occurring in gills, mantle, and hemocytes. Since GSTs may act as detoxification enzymes to mediate immune defense, the effects of pathogen associated molecular pattern, lipopolysaccharide and intact Vibrio tapetis bacteria challenge on RpGST\u03b8 gene transcription were studied. Furthermore, the RpGST\u03b8 expression changes induced by immune challenges were similar to those of the antioxidant defense enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (RpMnSOD).

In the present study, the complete express sequence of g-type lysozyme genes from Japanese scallop (designated as MyLysoG) was directly obtained by PCR. The complete sequence of MyLysoG cDNA consisted of a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 25\u00a0bp, an open reading frame (ORF) of 606\u00a0bp, and a 3\u2032 UTR of 100\u00a0bp with one polyadenylation signal (AATAAA).

It shared the sequence similarity and the common structure features with the g-type lysozyme from other species. Quantitative reverse trancriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay demonstrated that mRNA transcripts of g-type lysozyme could be detected in various tissues of unchallenged scallop, and the highest expression of MyLysoG was detected in hepatopancreas tissue. The temporal expression of MyLysoG in hemolymph after Vibrio anguillarum challenge was up-regulated and reached the maximum level at 3\u00a0h post stimulation, and then dropped back to the original level even lower than the control group. Furthermore, a 978\u00a0bp of 5\u2032-flanking sequence of MyLysoG was identified by genome walking, and several potential transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were detected in the putative promoter region.

To investigate the evolutionary origin of the sensitivity of FBPase to effectors, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of known animal amino acids sequences of the enzyme. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the high, mammalian-like, sensitivity of FBPase to Ca2\u00a0+ is not essential for controlling the stability of glyconeogenic complex in striated muscles, instead it ensures the precise regulation of mitochondrial metabolism during prolonged Ca2\u00a0+ elevation in contracting muscle fibers. Comparison of the kinetic properties of vertebrate and insect FBPases suggests that the high sensitivity of muscle isozyme to inhibitors has arisen as an adaptation enabling coordination of energy metabolism in warm-blooded animals.",

     "abstract": "Pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) were formerly thought to act as passive pheromone carriers. However, recent studies, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster, suggest that PBPs are involved in the recognition of semiochemicals, thus making ligand-binding studies more meaningful. Previously, we cloned three PBPs from Spodoptera litura (Slit), and showed that SlitPBP1 is much more abundant than the other two, particularly in male antennae. To investigate the ligand specificity of SlitPBP1, we expressed the protein in a bacterial system and performed binding experiments with the three components of the specific sex pheromones (Z9-14:Ac, Z9,E11\u201314:Ac and Z9,E12\u201314:Ac), as well as with 26 volatile ligands. The results indicated that SlitPBP1 bound all three sex pheromone components with dissociation constants between 0.6 and 1.1\u00a0\u03bcM. The same protein also bound with comparable affinities several pheromone analogs, but not plant volatiles. The presence of a double bond was the most important element for a strong binding, while its position and configuration also affected the affinity. Finally, the binding of pheromone components is strongly affected by pH, showing a critical pH value corresponding to isoelectric point of the protein. This suggests that a pH-dependent conformational mechanism might exist in SlitPBP1 for pheromone binding and release.",

     "abstract": "In mollusks, the shell mineralization process is controlled by an array of proteins, glycoproteins and polysaccharides that collectively constitute the shell matrix. In spite of numerous researches, the shell protein content of a limited number of model species has been investigated. This paper presents biochemical data on the common edible land snail Helix aspersa maxima, a model organism for ecotoxicological purposes, which has however been poorly investigated from a biomineralization viewpoint. The shell matrix of this species was extracted and analyzed biochemically for functional in vitro inhibition assay, for amino acid and monosaccharides compositions. The matrix was further analyzed on 1 and 2D gels and short partial protein sequences were obtained from 2D gel spots. Serological comparisons were established with a set of heterologous antibodies, two of which were subsequently used for subsequent immunogold localization of matrix components. Our data suggest that the shell matrix of Helix aspersa maxima may differ widely from the shell secretory repertoire of the marine mollusks studied so far, such as the gastropod Haliotis or the pearl oyster Pinctada. In particular, most of the biochemical properties generally attributed to soluble shell matrices, such as calcium-binding capability, or the capacity to interfere in vitro with the precipitation of calcium carbonate or to inhibit the precipitation of calcium carbonate, were not recorded with this matrix. This drastic change in the biochemical properties of the landsnail shell matrix puts into question the existence of a unique molecular model for molluscan shell formation, and may be related to terrestrialisation.",

     "abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN) is a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 superfamily which could play an important role in negatively regulating skeletal muscle growth and development in mammal and non-mammal species. In the present study, a MSTN1 gene (designated as VvMSTN1) was cloned and characterized in one flatfish species, spotted halibut (Verasper variegatus). In the 3078\u00a0bp genomic sequence, three exons, two introns and a promoter sequence were identified. Sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed that it contained several cis-regulatory elements such as CAAT-box, TATA-box and E-boxes. The deduced protein sequence included a signal peptide, a TGF-\u03b2 propeptide in the N-terminal region and the TGF-\u03b2 active peptide in the C-terminal region. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that VvMSTN1 is an orthologue of teleost MSTN1 proteins which arose along with MSTN2 during a duplication event at the base of teleost evolution. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that VvMSTN1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all nine tested tissues, with the most transcriptionally abundant in skeletal muscle. A primary assessment of sequence variability revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existed in the promoter region, among which three (G-653T, T-355C and G-253A) were genotyped with an advanced melting temperature (Tm)-shift method and tested for their association with growth traits (body length, body depth and total mass). Results indicated that genotype CC of locus T-355C had significantly higher growth traits than genotype TC and TT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in female spotted halibut. These results suggest that V. variegatus MSTN could be selected as a candidate gene for the future molecular breeding of stains with enhanced individual growth performance.",

The function of this vanadium is unclear, but enhanced pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) has been implicated in its reduction and accumulation. We compared aspects of intermediary metabolism in coelomic cells from ascidian species that have a wide range of vanadium accumulation including non-accumulators. All species appear to have similar aerobic poise with no apparent link to vanadium accumulation. Similarly, all species examined have a limited anaerobic poise that does not seem to relate to vanadium levels. Based on the activities of phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase we demonstrate that, relative to the capacity for entry into glycolysis, vanadium-accumulating species have enhanced capacity to metabolize glucose-6 phosphate via the PPP compared to non-accumulators. This finding provides the first comparative support for enhanced PPP capacity linked to vanadium accumulation in tunicates.",

Little is known about osmoregulatory mechanisms in holocephalan fishes except that they conduct urea-based osmoregulation, as in elasmobranchs. In the present study, we examined the ornithine urea cycle (OUC) enzymes that play a role in urea biosynthesis in the holocephalan elephant fish, Callorhinchus milii (cm). We obtained a single mRNA encoding carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III (cmCPSIII) and ornithine transcarbamylase (cmOTC), and two mRNAs encoding glutamine synthetases (cmGSs) and two arginases (cmARGs), respectively. The two cmGSs were structurally and functionally separated into two types: brain/liver/kidney-type cmGS1 and muscle-type cmGS2. Furthermore, two alternatively spliced transcripts with different sizes were found for cmgs1 gene. The longer transcript has a putative mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) and was predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney. MTS was not found in the short form of cmGS1 and cmGS2. A high mRNA expression and enzyme activities were found in the liver and muscle. Furthermore, in various tissues examined, mRNA levels of all the enzymes except cmCPSIII were significantly increased after hatching. The data show that the liver is the important organ for urea biosynthesis in elephant fish, but, extrahepatic tissues such as the kidney and muscle may also contribute to the urea production. In addition to the role of the extrahepatic tissues and nitrogen metabolism, the molecular and functional characteristics of multiple isoforms of GSs and ARGs are discussed.",

PnPLA2 is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.6, which migrates as a single band under both non-reducing and reducing conditions in SDS-PAGE. PnPLA2 had a molecular mass of 15,802.6\u00a0Da, determined by ESI-MS. Three tryptic peptides of this protein were characterized by HPLC-nESI-MS/MS, and N-terminal sequencing by direct Edman degradation showing homology to other acidic PLA2s from viperid venoms. PnPLA2 displayed indirect hemolytic activity in agarose erythrocyte-egg yolk gels and bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus in a dose-dependent manner, with a MIC and MBC of 32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. In addition, PnPLA2 showed a potent inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation with doses up to 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.

     "abstract": "The benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. was once the predominant macroinvertebrate in deep, offshore regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, since the early 1990s, Diporeia populations have steadily declined across the area. It has been hypothesized that this decline is due to starvation from increasing competition for food with invasive dreissenid mussels. In order to gain a better understanding of the changes in Diporeia physiology during starvation, we applied two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (GCXGC/TOF-MS) for investigating the responses in Diporeia metabolome during starvation. We starved Diporeia for 60\u00a0days and collected five organisms every 12\u00a0days for metabolome analyses. Upon arrival to the laboratory, organisms were flash frozen and served as control (day 0). We observed an increase in lipid oxidation and protein catabolism with subsequent declines of essential amino acids (proline, glutamine, and phenylalanine), down-regulation of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid abundance in nutritionally stressed Diporeia. Abundance of 1-Iodo-2-methylundecane, a metabolite closely related to insect pheromones, also declined with starvation. This research has further substantiated the applicability of GCXGC/TOF-MS as a research tool in the field of environmental metabolomics. The next step is to apply this new knowledge for evaluating nutritional status of feral Diporeia to elucidate the underlying cause(s) responsible for their decline in the Great Lakes.",

Homology and evolutionary analysis indicated that the induced amino acid sequence of AccGSTs4 belonged to an insect sigma class group.

Immunolocalization further revealed the distribution of AccGSTs4 in 4th instar larvae. RT-qPCR showed that the transcripts of AccGSTs4 from the larvae were upregulated under dietary HgCl2. The GST activity under stress was higher than the controls fed on HgCl2-free diet. Disc diffusion assay provided evidence of recAccGSTs4 resistance to long-term exposure of HgCl2 stress. Additionally, analysis of 5\u2032-flanking region further clarified the probable expression patterns of AccGSTs4.

Specifically, farmed fish of three ages (1-, 2- and 4-years) were studied, and PL compositions of whole liver and liver mitochondria, and fatty acid compositions of individual PL classes were determined. Liver mitochondrial membranes showed a PL composition different to that of the whole tissue suggesting adaptation of cell and subcellular membranes to specific functions. Individual PL had characteristic fatty acid compositions that were similar in whole liver and mitochondrial membranes. Whole liver and mitochondria showed increased lipid peroxidation with age along with changes in membrane PL fatty acid compositions. Most PL classes showed similar changes in fatty acid composition among the age groups, with reduced proportions of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and, generally, concomitantly increased levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, which together resulted in reduced peroxidation index (PIn). However, total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content did not change significantly with age due to increased eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and, in most PL, increased n\u22126 PUFA. These results suggest there may be oxidation of PL DHA with compensatory mechanisms to maintain membrane fluidity and function. However, modification of fatty acid composition of specific PLs, such as cardiolipin, could affect the electron transport chain efficiency and propagate the oxidative reaction throughout the cell. In addition, both the content and fatty acid composition of sphingomyelin, which has been suggested as a possible mediator of cell dysfunction and apoptosis, changed with age differently to the other PL classes. Moreover, these changes showed different trends between mitochondria and whole liver. These data suggest there is marked oxidative stress associated with rapid growth and maturation in rainbow trout. Changes observed in membrane lipids point to their possible participation in the processes involved in this species response to oxidative stress and damage accumulation rate.",

In this study, we cloned IGFBP-1 cDNA from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) liver. The full-length cDNA is 1070\u00a0bp, including a 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of 69\u00a0bp, a 3\u2032-UTR of 272\u00a0bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 729\u00a0bp encoding a polypeptide of 242 amino acids. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that IGFBP-1 mRNA is mainly expressed in the liver, and a small amount of mRNAs was also found in other adult tissues. There are maternal transcripts of IGFBP-1 gene, and relatively low mRNA levels were observed in different embryonic stages. A higher level of IGFBP-1 mRNA was detected at 3\u00a0days post hatching (dph), and it got to the highest level at 29\u00a0dph (metamorphic climax), and finally brought back to a lower level at the end of metamorphosis. The expression of IGFBP-1 mRNA was greatly up-regulated in thyroid hormone (TH)-treated larvae, and declined after thiourea (TU) treatment. These results provide basic information for further studies on the role of IGF system in the P. olivaceus development and metamorphosis.",

However, the structural conservation of invertebrate FXRs has only been studied for the major model organisms and studies on additional invertebrate FXRs are clearly required to obtain better resolution of FXR phylogeny and comparative developmental insights in chordates. In the present study, the cDNA encoding the farnesoid X receptor, HrFXR, was cloned from a marine invertebrate Halocynthia roretzi. The open reading frame of HrFXR encoded 688 amino acids including a longer N-terminal region and showed overall sequence identities of 28\u201341% to vertebrate and Ciona intestinalis FXRs. The N-terminal activation function 1 (AF-1) and hinge domains of HrFXR displayed relatively low identities (<\u00a020%), whereas the DNA-binding and ligand-binding domains showed relatively high (>\u00a073%) and intermediate (21\u201350%) identities, respectively. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, HrFXR belonged to a urochordate group, which was placed differently from vertebrate FXR\u03b1 and FXR\u03b2 subgroups. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the HrFXR mRNA originated maternally and was highly expressed in adult gonads. Additionally, HrFXR mRNA levels in the gills and hepatopancreas showed significantly higher values in animals with soft tunic syndrome compared to those of normal individuals. Furthermore, direct injection of cholic acid significantly increased HrFXR transcript levels in vivo, although an expression vector containing HrFXR cDNA did not show a significant transactivation function in response to a well-known ligand for vertebrate FXR, GW4064, in HepG2 cells. These results suggest that the tunicate FXR has different structural and expressional characteristics compared to those of vertebrate FXRs.",

The cDNAs, designated Pj-Cht1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4, encoded proteins ranging from 388 to 607 amino acid residues in length (43.61\u201367.62\u00a0kDa) and displayed a common structural organization: an N-terminal catalytic domain, a Thr/Pro-rich linker region, and either 0 (Pj-Cht2, 3A), 1 (Pj-Cht1, 3B, and 3C), or 2 (Pj-Cht4) C-terminal chitin-binding domain(s) (CBD). Pj-Cht1 and 2 lacked the 5\u2032 end of the open reading frame (ORF); the other Pj-Chts contained the complete ORF. All known decapod crustacean chitinases were segregated into at least four groups based on phylogenetic analysis and domain organization. Group 1 chitinases, represented by Pj-Cht1, were most closely related to insect group I chitinases and may function in the digestion of the peritrophic membrane. Group 2 chitinases including Pj-Cht2 show different domain organizations and pI value from other chitinases and appear to function in degradation of the old exoskeleton during the premolt period. Group 3 chitinases, represented by Pj-Cht3A, 3B, and 3C, may function in digestion of chitin-containing food and defense against pathogens. Group 4 chitinases, represented by Pj-Cht4, have two CBDs and their functions are unknown. Five Pj-Chts (Pj-Cht1, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4) are expressed in the hepatopancreas and intestine, whereas Pj-Cht2 is expressed in epidermis and SG/XO complex suggesting crustacean chitinases can be classified into two groups (hepatopancreatic and epidermal) based on the expression profile. Eyestalk ablation (ESA) down-regulated the hepatopancreatic chitinase expression (Pj-Cht1, 3A, and 3C); Pj-Cht3B expression was not significantly affected by ESA. By contrast, mRNA levels of Pj-Cht2 were significantly upregulated in 7\u00a0days post-ESA. Pj-Cht4 mRNA levels were too low for measurement with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. ESA had no significant effect on chitinase expression in the intestine. These data indicate that Pj-Cht1, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4 are hepatopancreatic chitinases that may function in the digestion of ingested chitin and the modification of peritrophic membrane in the intestine. By contrast, epidermal chitinase, Pj-Cht2 may play a role in chitin metabolism during molt cycle as shown in other crustacean group 2 chitinases.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, AA) is an antioxidant that acts as a free radical scavenger and cofactor for several important enzymatic reactions, thus being important for normal cellular functions, growth and development. Accumulation of AA in cells depends on two types of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporters (SVCTs), designed as SVCT1 and SVCT2. In human, they are the products of SLC23A1 and SLC23A2 genes, respectively. In the present work, the molecular cloning of the cDNAs corresponding to slc23a1 and slc23a2 in a teleost fish, the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858) is first described. Sequence analysis of the predicted polypeptides revealed a conserved topology with those of mammals with important motifs involved in structure and function, being also present in svct1 and svct2. Phylogenetic analyses including a range of vertebrate SVCTs suggest that both transporters are the result of an ancient gene duplication event that occurred prior to the divergence of tetrapods and teleosts, which took place 450\u00a0million years ago. Expression profiles in juvenile tissues and during larval development were analyzed using a real-time PCR approach. In juvenile fish, slc23a1 was strongly expressed in intestine, whereas slc23a2 exhibited a widespread distribution in tissues. Transcripts of both genes were detected at early developmental stages, probably representing mRNAs of maternal origin. A possible regulation by their own substrate was detected after first uptakes of AA from diet in both genes. During metamorphosis, both slc23a1 and slc23a2 were down-regulated, the former in a thyroid hormone (TH) dependent way. This pattern coincided with a significant reduction in the AA content of larvae during metamorphosis. These results are interpreted in a physiological context of general reduction in the metabolism of metamorphic larvae. Data presented here provide the first step toward a better understanding of the physiological role of SVCTs in teleost fish.",

The DR1 enhancer, that is an established DNA binding site for the ecdysone receptor/ultraspiracle heterodimer, was necessary for transcriptional activation by 20-OH ecdysone. For this activated transcription, a natural sequence closely 5\u2032 to the TATA box is necessary. Cotreatment with juvenile hormone III strongly suppressed the steroid activation of transcription. However, in the absence of the sequence located closely 5\u2032 to the TATA box, cotreatment with juvenile hormone instead increased transcription over that occurring due to 20-hydroxy-ecdysone alone. This sensitivity to activation by cotreatment with juvenile hormone could be transferred to a related, but otherwise unresponsive, hexamerin core promoter simply by transferring to the unresponsive promoter the five base transcription start site ( A CAGT) from the responsive hexamerin gene. These are the first reports that the direction of JH action on 20-OH ecdysone-activated transcription can be reversed by removal of a sequence at the core promoter, and that modulatory action of juvenile hormone can be transferred to a different gene by transferring the transcription start site motif.",

The Japanese lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum, is a parasitic member of the lampreys known to store large amounts of vitamin A within its body. How this storage is achieved, however, is wholly unknown. Within the body, the absorption, transfer and metabolism of vitamin A are regulated by a family of proteins called retinoid-binding proteins. Here we have cloned a cDNA for cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP) from the Japanese lamprey, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that lamprey CRBP is an ancestor of both CRBP I and II. The lamprey CRBP protein was expressed in bacteria and purified. Binding of the lamprey CRBP to retinol (Kd of 13.2\u00a0nM) was identified by fluorimetric titration. However, results obtained with the protein fluorescence quenching technique indicated that lamprey CRBP does not bind to retinal. Northern blot analysis showed that lamprey CRBP mRNA was ubiquitously expressed, although expression was most abundant in the intestine. Together, these results suggest that lamprey CRBP has an important role in absorbing vitamin A from the blood of host animals.",

The mammalian enzyme has been extensively characterized and several forms of cathepsin have also been identified. Cathepsins have also been isolated from other vertebrates and invertebrates and recent studies suggest that the lysosomal sorting machinery is evolutionarily conserved from fish to mammals. We recently characterized the putative mannose 6-phosphate receptors from the invertebrate starfish (Asterias rubens). In the present study we affinity purified the cathepsin D from this animal and biochemically characterized the same. Purified enzyme migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to a molecular mass of 45\u00a0kDa. The protein bound specifically to Con A-Sepharose gel and is glycosylated.

Furthermore, an antibody raised for the purified enzyme in a rabbit recognizes the crude, the purified enzyme as well as the deglycosylated product in a western blot experiment. The enzyme in the extracts of different tissues can also be quantified by ELISA. We have further evaluated the binding of purified starfish cathepsin D with its receptor, MPR 300 (mannose 6-phosphate receptor) by immunoprecipitation. Cross-linking experiments using purified cathepsin D and MPR 300 revealed a cross-linked product that migrated with a higher molecular mass (345\u00a0kDa) compared to the enzyme (45\u00a0kDa).

The molecular mass of the purified trypsin was about 22\u00a0kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified trypsin were 9.0 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The trypsin was stable in the pH range of 7.5\u20139.5 and below 45\u00a0\u00b0C.

The rate of the aminating reaction (glutamate formation) was approximately three times higher than for the deaminating reaction (glutamate utilisation). GDH provides a pathway for ammonia assimilation, although the affinity for ammonia was low. Allosteric regulation by GTP, ATP and ADP of L3 and adult H. contortus and Teladorsagia circumcincta (Nematoda) GDH depended on the concentration of the regulators and the direction of the reaction.

Protein phosphatase measured in the liver increased by at least 3-fold and is significantly as a result of exposure to these sublethal concentrations of crude extract, his indicates an early defense response against protein phosphatase inhibition from cyanotoxins. This was corroborated by the decreased phosphate content in proteins found in the liver and brain. No increase in glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity was observed and lipid peroxidation was unaffected in both liver and brain tissue exposed to the cyanobacterial extracts. The data revealed that the proportion of the reduced (metal-binding) form of metallothionein (MT) decreased by two-fold relative to the control group (with a concomitant increase in the proportion of the oxidized form).

The aim of this study was to determine whether cutaneous blood vessels were regulated in the caudal fin during the initial transition from water to aerial exposure, and after 10\u00a0days of aerial acclimation. Acute changes (first 3\u00a0min following emersion) in the cutaneous vessels diameter were measured in real-time on live fish using light microscopy. The data show that under control conditions, only arterioles in the caudal fin were vasoactive. During the first 20\u00a0s of aerial acclimation the arterioles significantly constricted (\u2212\u00a02.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcm), which was followed immediately by a relaxation (from 40 to 180\u00a0s). This vasoconstriction was eliminated with the addition of phentolamine (50\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0l\u2212\u00a01), which indicates that the vasoconstriction was mediated by \u03b1-adrenoreceptors. Longer-term changes in the cutaneous surface vasculature were determined using fluorescent immunohistochemistry and antibodies for the endothelial marker, CD31. Fish aerially acclimated for 10\u00a0days exhibited significantly higher levels of endothelial fluorescence in the caudal fin when compared to control fish in water, indicating endothelial cell production (i.e. angiogenesis). These data combined show that for every emersion episode, there is an initial \u03b1-adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction, which is most likely, a stress response. This is then followed by a long-term acclimation involving an upregulation in endothelial cell production, which would subsequently enhance blood perfusion to the cutaneous surface and potentially increase the capacity for gas exchange with the external environment.",

In the presence of 1\u00a0mM DTT, renal rT3 deiodination rates are 20-fold lower. In contrast, rT3 5\u2032-deiodination in liver is potently stimulated by 1\u00a0mM DTT. The marked biochemical differences between 5\u2032-deiodination in liver and kidney are not associated with the expression of either Dio1 or Dio2 mRNA since both organs express both deiodinase types. In liver and kidney, DTT stimulates the incorporation of N-bromoacetylated affinity labels in proteins with estimated molecular masses of 57 and 55, and 31 and 28\u00a0kDa, respectively. Although primary structures are highly homologous, the biochemistry of carp deiodinases differs markedly from their mammalian counterparts.",

Most VO are rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and few are rich in n-3 PUFA but Camelina oil (CO) is unique in that, besides high 18:3n-3 and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio, it also contains substantial long-chain monoenes, commonly found in FO. Cod (initial mass ~\u00a01.4\u00a0g) were fed for 12\u00a0weeks diets in which FO was replaced with CO. Growth performance, feed efficiency and biometric indices were not affected but lipid levels in liver and intestine tended to increase and those of flesh, decrease, with increasing dietary CO although only significantly for intestine. Reflecting diet, tissue n-3 long-chain PUFA levels decreased whereas 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 increased with inclusion of dietary CO. Dietary replacement of FO by CO did not induce major metabolic changes in intestine, but affected genes with potential to alter cellular proliferation and death as well as change structural properties of intestinal muscle. Although the biological effects of these changes are unclear, given the important role of intestine in nutrient absorption and health, further attention should be given to this organ in future.",

Both isoforms possessed similar tissue expression profiles with the highest levels in the brain. The rem2a gene has significantly higher expression levels than rem2b in all tissues assayed except the brain and head kidney. In the central nervous system, both isoforms showed similar expression levels with the highest levels occurring in the olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and midbrain, though rem2a expression is significantly higher in the spinal cord. Based on known functional roles of Rem2 in synapse development and stem cell proliferation, the characterization of Rem2 in rainbow trout could shed light on its role in adult vertebrate neurogenesis and brain regeneration.",

BpMPI was purified in two chromatography steps on ion exchange CM-Sepharose Fast flow and Sephacryl S-300. This protease was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE and showed a single chain polypeptide of 20\u00a0kDa under non reducing conditions. The partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed high similarity with other SVMPs enzymes from snake venoms. BpMPI showed proteolytic activity upon azocasein and bovine fibrinogen and was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10 phenanthroline and \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Moreover, this enzyme showed stability at neutral and alkaline pH and it was inactivated at high temperatures. BpMPI was able to hydrolyze glandular and tissue kallikrein substrates, but was unable to act upon factor Xa and plasmin substrates. The enzyme did not induce local hemorrhage in the dorsal region of mice even at high doses. Taken together, our data showed that BpMP-I is in fact a fibrinogenolytic metalloproteinase and a non hemorrhagic enzyme.",

Carotenoid-based visual signals are a well-studied example, as carotenoids may be environmentally limited and impact signaler health. However, not all bright yellow, orange and red ornaments found in vertebrates are carotenoid-based; pteridine pigments may also produce these colors. We examine the contribution of carotenoid and pteridine pigments to the orange reproductive color of female striped plateau lizards (Sceloporus virgatus). This color ornament reliably indicates female mate quality, yet costs maintaining signal honesty are currently unknown. Dietary carotenoid manipulations did not affect orange color, and orange skin differed from surrounding white skin in drosopterin, not carotenoid, content. Further, orange color positively correlated with drosopterin, not carotenoid, concentration. Drosopterin-based female ornaments avoid the direct trade-offs of using carotenoids for ornament production vs egg production, thus may relax counter-selection against color ornament exaggeration in females. Direct experimentation is needed to determine the actual costs of pteridine-based ornaments. Like carotenoids, pteridines influence important biological processes, including immune and antioxidant function; predation and social costs may also be relevant.",

In the present study, the antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor activities of Om-hep1 were determined using its synthetic and recombinant pro-peptides. The recombinant pro-hepcidin1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and an effective method to produce recombinant Pro-Omhep1 was developed in order to obtain a right folded structure. The results showed that both the synthetic mature peptide and recombinant pro-peptide had similar antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and negative bacteria. In particular, both the synthetic mature Om-hep1 and recombinant Pro-Omhep1 inhibited the viral replication of white spot syndrome virus in the hematopoietic tissue cells of the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Om-hep1 also presented antitumor activity on the cultured human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, the antimicrobial mechanism of Om-hep1 was measured and it was found that Om-hep1 was likely to be non-membranolytic.

Storage pests need specific digestive enzymes to efficiently hydrolyze these storage proteins. Therefore, post-glutamine cleaving peptidases (PGP) were isolated from the midgut of the stored-product pest, Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm). Three distinct PGP activities were found in the anterior and posterior midgut using the highly-specific chromogenic peptide substrate N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Gln p-nitroanilide. PGP peptidases were characterized according to gel elution times, activity profiles in buffers of different pH, electrophoretic mobility under native conditions, and inhibitor sensitivity. The results indicate that PGP activity is due to cysteine and not serine chymotrypsin-like peptidases from the T. molitor larvae midgut. We propose that the evolutionary conservation of cysteine peptidases in the complement of digestive peptidases of tenebrionid stored-product beetles is due not only to the adaptation of insects to plants rich in serine peptidase inhibitors, but also to accommodate the need to efficiently cleave major dietary proteins rich in glutamine.",

Bombyx mori PLK (BmPLK) is 10 or more residues shorter than mammalian PLKs, and some amino acid residues conserved in the PLKs from mammals are not maintained in the protein. Multiple sequence alignment suggested that amino acid residues Thr47, Ile54, Arg88, Asn121 and Glu230 might play important roles in BmPLK. In this study, we used a site-directed specific mutagenesis approach to determine the functional significance of these particular amino acid residues in BmPLK. Our results demonstrated that the mutation of Asn121 to Glu did not affect the catalytic function of BmPLK. The corresponding site-directed mutants of Thr47 to Asn, Ile54 to Phe, and Arg88 to Ile displayed a decreased catalytic efficiency and an elevated Km value for substrate relative to the wild-type value, and no enzyme activity could be detected in mutant of Trp230 to Glu. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the mutation of Trp230 to Glu resulted in mis-folding of the protein.

Mean oocyte size-frequency distributions showed that the majority of the oocytes had an intermediate size (Group II) before spawning (April and June). The late-vitellogenic oocytes (Group III) became absent in August and October and, during this post-spawning period, oocytes were primarily of small size (Group I). Most of the major FA, 16:0, 18:0, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3, and the tetracosapolyenoic fatty acid (TPA), 24:6n-3, varied significantly throughout the year (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with two peaks in August/October and February. The boost in early oogenesis, also associated with warmer temperatures, seemed to be responsible for the observed increase in FA content between June and August. The highest values of FA content were observed in February when intermediate oogenesis (Group II) was at its peak and there were considerable levels of available food in the environment. Also, the increase in food availability seemed to trigger the final stages of gametogenesis. The high quantity of 18:1n-7, odd-numbered and branched FAs, suggested the presence of a dynamic bacterial community in V. cynomorium, probably as an adaptive response to the lack of symbiotic microalgae. Although the presence of TPAs is the main feature distinguishing octocorals from other coral species, here we showed that there was no single FA clearly dominating the FA composition of V. cynomorium throughout the year. Instead, four main FAs share similar concentrations: 16:0, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 24:6n-3. The predominance of these four FAs combined with the higher amount of 24:6n-3 when compared to 24:5n-6 may serve as a chemotaxonomic feature to distinguish this octocoral species (or genus).",

Gastric glands were observed until 20\u00a0dph, followed by the differentiation of the stomach between 20 and 25\u00a0dph. Trypsinogen expression and trypsin activity were detected at hatching, increasing concomitantly to larval development and the change in the type of food. Maximum levels of trypsinogen expression were observed at 25\u00a0dph, when animals were fed with Artemia nauplii, and maximum trypsin activity was detected at 35\u00a0dph, when larvae were fed with an artificial diet. On the other hand, pepsinogen gene expression was detected at 18\u00a0dph, two days before pepsin enzymatic activity and appearance of gastric glands. Maximum pepsin activity was also observed at 35\u00a0dph. These results suggest that in this species weaning could be initiated at an earlier age than is currently practiced (between 28 and 30\u00a0dph), since larvae of spotted rose snapper develop a functional stomach between days 20 and 25 post-hatch.",

Cloning produced a full-length gene sequence of 201\u00a0bp predicted to encode a 66-amino-acid precursor protein maturing to a 44-amino-acid residue. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that MCdef is similar to defensins from marine mollusks and ticks. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that MCdef is closely related to defensins from Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel) and Crassostrea gigas (Pacific cupped oyster). The three-dimensional structure of MCdef was modeled using the solution structure of C. gigas defensin as a template. With the exception of three variable loop areas, the modeled structure of MCdef was identical to that of C. gigas defensin. MCdef antiserum was raised against a synthetic MCdef peptide and verified by Western blotting using recombinant MCdef. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated high levels of MCdef mRNA in hemocytes and adductor, foot, gill, mantle, palp, and siphon tissues of Vibrio tapetis-infected Manila clams, whereas in V. tapetis-uninfected Manila clams, the level of MCdef mRNA was low in adductor, palp, and siphon tissues and even lower in the other tested tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed high MCdef expression was detected in the gill, the mantle, and the digestive tubules of the diverticulum of V. tapetis-infected Manila clams. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the purified rMCdef was determined. MCdef showed highest activity against Streptococcus iniae and Staphylococcus aureus.",

Its function has not been clearly described in shrimp species belonging to the sub-order Dendrobranchiata, which includes the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and other species from the Penaeidae family. Studies on vertebrates suggest that these lysosomal enzymes intracellularly hydrolize protein, as other cystein proteinases. However, the expression of the gene encoding the shrimp cathepsin B in the midgut gland was affected by starvation in a similar way as other digestive proteinases which extracellularly hydrolyze food protein. In this study the white shrimp L. vannamei cathepsin B (LvCathB) cDNA was sequenced, and characterized. Its gene expression was evaluated in various shrimp tissues, and changes in the mRNA amounts were compared with those observed on other digestive proteinases from the midgut gland during starvation. By using qRT-PCR it was found that LvCathB is expressed in most shrimp tissues except in pleopods and eye stalk. Changes on LvCathB mRNA during starvation suggest that the enzyme participates during intracellular protein hydrolysis but also, after food ingestion, it participates in hydrolyzing food proteins extracellularly as confirmed by the high activity levels we found in the gastric juice and midgut gland of the white shrimp.",

In this study, the full-length cDNAs encoding PACAP and PACAP-related peptide (PRP) and the PACAP-specific receptor (PAC1-R) were cloned from the brain of darkbarbel catfish Pelteobagrus vachelli. The PRP\u2013PACAP cDNA had two variants expressed by alternative splicing: a long form encoding both PRP and PACAP and a short form encoding PACAP only. Our data showed that the exon skipping on the PACAP transcripts was a possible mechanism regulating the expression ratio of PACAP to PRP in non-mammalian vertebrates. Based on multi-sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis, the catfish PACAP and PAC1-R were highly conserved during evolution. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the PACAP-short and PAC1-R tanscripts were mainly expressed in the brain and gonad of darkbarbel catfish, though a small amount of mRNAs was also found in other tissues. Immunofluorescent staining studies showed wide distribution and high levels of PAC1-R in the catfish brain, suggesting that the PAC1-R form may play a central role in growth hormone release. The expressions of PACAP and PAC1-R in gonads and the occurrence of PACAP-immunoreactive material in testis suggest that PACAP may act as a paracrine/autocrine factor for gonad development.",

However, very little is known about the function of cathepsin B in fish. In this study, we identified and analyzed a cathepsin B homologue (CsCatB) from tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis, Pleuronectiformes), an economic fish species cultured in China. CsCatB is composed of 322 amino acid residues and shares 70\u201381.3% overall sequence identities with its counterpart in teleosts and humans. CsCatB possesses typical cathepsin B structural features including the propeptide region and the papain family cysteine protease domain, the latter containing the four catalytic residues (Q101, C107, H277, and N297) that are conserved in lower and higher vertebrates. Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis showed that CsCatB expression occurred in multiple tissues and was positively regulated by bacterial infection and by immunization with a subunit vaccine. Recombinant CsCatB purified from Escherichia coli exhibited apparent protease activity, which was optimal at 35\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 5.5. In contrast, a mutant CsCatB bearing glutamic acid substitution at H277 was dramatically reduced in proteolytic activity. These results indicate that CsCatB is a biologically active protease that is likely to be involved in host immune response during bacterial infection and vaccination.",

Here, we present the first thermal stability analysis of cUNG and hUNG by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the results showed that cUNG is less stable than hUNG and unfolds at a melting temperature (Tm) 9\u00b0 lower than its warm-adapted homologue. In addition, an ion-pair (D183-K302) suggested to be crucial for global stability of hUNG was investigated by biochemical characterization and DSC of four mutants (cUNG G183D and cUNG G183D-R302K, hUNG D183G and hUNG D183G-K302R). The hUNG mutants with an expected disruption of the ion-pair showed a slight increase in stability with concomitant reduction in the enzyme activity, while the apparent introduction of the ion-pair in cUNG caused a reduction in the enzyme activity but no increase in stability. Because the mutants did not behave as expected, the phenomenon was further investigated by crystal structure determination. Indeed, the crystal structure of the hUNG D183G-K302R mutant revealed that compensating interactions for the loss of the ion-pair were generated close to and in regions distant from the mutation site. In conclusion, the reduced stability of cUNG supports the suggested requirement of a flexible structure for improved activity at low temperatures. Furthermore, the lack of a direct correlation between enzyme activity and global stability of the mutants supports the significance of distributing locally flexible and/or rigid regions for modulation of enzyme activity.",

Besides standard vitamin A forms, freshwater fish tissues contain high levels of didehydroretinoids or vitamin A2 forms. However, the tissue distribution, metabolism and function of both standard and particularly the didehydroretinoids are still poorly known in fish. In this study, we have quantified the levels of retinoids, including retinol, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate and their corresponding didehydro forms, as well as the levels of the active polar retinoids all-trans-, 9-cis- and 13-cis-retinoic acid in distinct tissues of juvenile rainbow trout. Our results indicate that the liver is clearly the main retinoid storage tissue in juvenile rainbow trout. Didehydroretinoids were dominant over retinoids in all analyzed tissues with the exception of plasma. Additionally, significant differences among tissues were observed between retinoids and didehydroretinoids, such as differences in the ester profiles and the proportions between free and esterified forms, suggesting that mechanisms that favor the utilization or storage of one of the other groups of compounds might exist in fish. Our data also show the presence of polar retinoids in different tissues of fish at the fmol/g scale. Overall, this study clearly demonstrates the presence of tissue-specific patterns of accumulation of both polar and nonpolar retinoids in fish tissues. The biological relevance of these findings should be the focus of future studies.",

The molecular mass of albolabrase was 33.7\u00a0kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and 35.8\u00a0kDa as determined by Superose gel filtration chromatography. The N-terminal sequence was determined to be VVGGDECNINE which is homologous to many snake venom thrombin-like enzymes. Albolabrase exhibits both arginine ester hydrolase and arginine amidase activities and the enzyme is fastidious towards tripeptide chromogenic anilide substrates. The fibrinogen clotting activity was optimum at 3\u00a0mg/mL bovine fibrinogen, and showed distinct species differences in the following decreasing order: bovine fibrinogen\u00a0>\u00a0dog fibrinogen\u00a0\u2248\u00a0human fibrinogen\u00a0>\u00a0goat fibrinogen. The enzyme failed to clot both rabbit and cat fibrinogens. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis on the breakdown products of fibrinogenolytic action of albolabrase indicated that the enzyme belongs to the AB class of snake venom thrombin-like enzyme. In the indirect ELISA, IgG anti-albolabrase reacted extensively with most crotalid venoms, except with Tropidolaemus wagleri and Calloselasma rhodostoma venoms. The double sandwich ELISA, however, showed that anti-albolabrase reacted strongly only with venoms from the Trimeresurus complex, and that the results support the proposed new taxonomy changes concerning the Trimeresurus complex.",

This is in contrast to the Y2 receptor where they differed considerably from one another. N-terminally truncated NPY binds poorly and the Y2 antagonist BIIE0246 binds well to Y2-2, results that are reversed in comparison to Y2.

Administration of 10\u00a0\u03bcg cortisol per mL of water from before the onset of metamorphosis (stage E) to metamorphic climax (stage G) induced the development of adult type pigment cells on the blind side of the metamorphosed juveniles and increased the occurrence of ambicolored juveniles.

M-diverticula and hemolymph were labeled by in vivo 14C-palmitic acid injection. In vitro incubations were performed between M-diverticula and either hemolymph or isolated lipoproteins.

Isolated lipoproteins showed a similar behavior to that observed with whole hemolymph. Lipid transfer between lipoproteins showed that HDL1 transfer more 14C-lipids to VHDL than vice versa. Only 38% FFA and 18% TAG were transferred from M-diverticula to lipoproteins, while on the contrary 75% and 73% of these lipids, respectively, were taken up from hemolymph. A similar trend was observed regarding lipoprotein phospholipids. This study supports the hypothesis that HDL1 and hemocyanin-containing VHDL are involved in the uptake and release of FFA, phospholipids and triacylglycerols in the spider P. pythagoricus. The data support a directional flow of lipids from HDL1 and VHDL suggesting a mode of lipid transport between lipoproteins and M-diverticula.",

     "abstract": "Gobiocypris rarus is an emerging fish model for aquatic toxicology in China as it is sensitive to environmental hormone disruptors. Exogenous sex steroids can affect sex differentiation and the expression of sex-related genes. Foxl2, a member of forkhead-box transcription factor family, is the key gene for ovary development and its mutation causes the blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome in human. We find that two foxl2 genes exist in fish genome, one is foxl2, and the other is foxl2b. Here, we reported the isolation and expression of foxl2 in G. rarus. G. rarus foxl2 cDNA is 1700\u00a0bp in length with a 921\u00a0bp of open reading frame encoding 306 amino acids containing the typical FH-domain. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed its predominant expression in the eye, brain, gill and gonads. Moreover, the expression level in the ovary was significantly higher than that in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that foxl2 was up regulated after treatment with estradiol and was down regulated with 2-methyl-testosterone. These results suggested that Foxl2 plays an important role in female development of G. rarus, foxl2 mRNA expression is regulated by downstream sex hormones, and foxl2 can be used as a molecular indicator monitoring the environmental endocrine disruptors.",

     "abstract": "The lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis L.) is an extant representative of the ancient vertebrate group of Agnathans. During the prespawning migration (the river period of life from autumn until spring) lamprey hepatocytes exhibit widely different energy states: a high-energy state in autumn and spring, corresponding to a normal physiological standard, and a low-energy state in winter, which is provoked by prolonged starvation and profound metabolic arrest. In spring the restoration of energy status (return to an active state) is associated with hormonally induced lipolysis of the lipid droplets stored in the cells. Lamprey hepatocytes demonstrate an aerobic metabolism based on oxidation of free fatty acids. The dynamics of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured throughout the prespawning migration. Pharmacological inhibition of the electron transport chain decreased the MMP and caused extensive depletion of cellular ATP without loss of cell viability. The potential molecular mechanisms responsible for winter metabolic depression in lamprey hepatocytes are discussed.",

This study focuses on the composition of the main energy source and its catabolism by lipase from the midgut gland (hepatopancreas) of the crustacean Macrobrachium borellii. Silver-ion thin-layer chromatography of prawn large TAG deposit (80% of total lipids) and its subsequent fatty acid analysis by gas chromatography allowed the identification of 4 major fractions. These are composed of fatty acids of decreasing unsaturation and carbon chain length, the predominant being 18:1n-9. Fraction I, the most unsaturated one, contained mainly 20:5n-3; fraction II 18:2n-6; fraction III 18:1n-9 while the most saturated fraction contained mostly 16:0. Hepatopancreas main lipase (Mr 72\u00a0kDa) cross-reacted with polyclonal antibodies against insect lipase, was not dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and had an optimum activity at 40\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 8.0. Kinetic analysis showed a Michaelis\u2013Menten behavior. A substrate competition assay evidenced lipase specificity following the order: 18:1n-9-TAG\u00a0>\u00a0PUFA-enriched-TAG\u00a0>\u00a016:0-TAG different from that in vertebrates. These data indicate there is a reasonable correspondence between the fatty acid composition of TAG and the substrate specificity of lipase, which may be an important factor in determining which fatty acids are mobilized during lipolysis for oxidation in crustaceans.",

To examine the mechanisms of the sexual growth dimorphism in the Tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), molecular cloning, expression analysis of IGF-I gene and IGF-I serum concentration analysis were performed. As a result, the IGF-I cDNA sequence is 911\u00a0bp, which contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 564\u00a0bp encoding a protein of 187 amino acids. The sex-specific tissue expression was analyzed by using 14 tissues from females, normal males and extra-large male adults. The IGF-I mRNA was predominantly expressed in liver, and the IGF-I expression levels in females and extra-large males were 1.9 and 10.2 times as much as those in normal males, respectively. Sex differences in IGF-I mRNA expressions at early life stages were also examined by using a full-sib family of C. semilaevis, and the IGF-I mRNA was detected at all of the 27 sampling points from 10 to 410\u00a0days old. An increase in IGF-I mRNA was detected after 190\u00a0day old fish. The significantly higher levels of IGF-I mRNA in females were observed after 190\u00a0days old in comparison with males (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The IGF-I concentrations in serum of mature individuals were detected by ELISA. The IGF-I level in the serum of females was approximately two times as much as that of males. Consequently, IGF-I may play an important role in the endocrine regulation of the sexually dimorphic growth of C. semilaevis.",

     "abstract": "Ureotelic Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) do not excrete urea continuously; instead, urea is accumulated internally until a branchial urea transport mechanism is activated to facilitate the excretion of urea in distinct pulses. This unusual pulsatile urea excretion pattern is regulated, in part, by permissive declines in circulating cortisol concentrations. The current study examined toadfish urea transporter (tUT) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcript levels in toadfish gill following chronic (days) and acute (hours) changes in corticosteroid activity. Experimentally lowering circulating cortisol did not significantly alter tUT mRNA abundance but increased GR mRNA. On an acute timescale, a 6.2-fold upregulation of tUT mRNA occurred 12 to 18\u00a0h following a urea pulse event with no change in GR mRNA. In silico analysis of an isolated 1.2\u00a0kb fragment, upstream promoter region of the tUT gene, revealed 6 putative glucocorticoid response element (GRE) half sites. In vivo reporter assays of the tUT promoter fragment demonstrated relative luciferase activity was enhanced 3.4- and 9.8-fold following exposure to moderate (via a 48\u00a0h crowding stress) and high (via infusion for 48\u00a0h) cortisol. We conclude that a GRE-mediated upregulation of mRNA may be required to maintain tUT activity by offsetting post-transcriptional and/or post-translational changes that may be associated with chronically elevated plasma cortisol.",

In nature, insects such as houseflies (Musca domestica) are commonly exposed to multiple stressors including heavy metals (e.g. Cadmium, Cd) and high temperatures. In this paper, we identify two novel MT genes from the cDNAs of M. domestica, MdMT1 and MdMT2, which putatively encode 40 and 42 amino acid residues respectively. Expression of the two MTs\u2019 mRNAs, which are examined in the fat body, gut, hemocyte, and the epidermis. From our study, we saw that the expression of MdMT1 and MdMT2 are enhanced by Cd and thermal stress. Levels of expression are highest at 10\u00a0mM Cd2+ within a 24-h period, and expressions increase significantly with exposure to 10\u00a0mM Cd for 12\u00a0h. Levels of the mRNAs are up-regulated after heat shock and that of MdMT2 reaches its maximum peak faster than MdMT1. Both of the MT genes might be involved in a transient systemic tolerance response to stressors and they may play important roles in heavy metal and high temperature tolerance in the housefly. To detect whether or not the MTs bind heavy metals, the target genes are cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-DsbA to obtain fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Recombinant DsbA-MdMT1 significantly increases tolerance of the host bacteria to Cd2+, but DsbA-MdMT2 is absent. These differential characteristics will facilitate future investigations into the physiological functions of MTs.",

In the present study, we further analyzed the morphological features of these neurons by an intracellular injection of Lucifer yellow, and found that these neurons extend neurites out of the brain through at least 5 nerve bundles. We then isolated a gene and a cDNA clone potentially encoding a NdWFamide precursor, and investigated expression at the levels of mRNA and protein in Limax. The NdWFamide gene consists of 5 exons spanning at least 17\u00a0kb of the genome, and its open reading frame extends over 3 exons. The spatial expression pattern of NdWFamide mRNA was almost identical to that of the NdWFamide peptide, with some minor discrepancies in between.

This enzyme showed no activity when taurine or \u03b2-alanine was used as substrate. These data strongly support that this recombinant enzyme is octopine dehydrogenase and not another opine dehydrogenase such as alanopine or strombine dehydrogenases. The superimposition of the theoretical three-dimensional model of the M. galloprovincialis OcDH and the crystal structure of its homologous counterpart from the great scallop Pecten maximus showed interesting changes in the amino acid binding site which could explain the differences found in the substrate affinity between the two molluscs. A phylogenetic analysis was performed comparing M. galloprovincialis OcDH and annotated sequences representing the five opine dehydrogenase (OpDH) protein family members. The phylogenetic tree which was obtained clustered the OpDH enzymes according to the evolutionary relationships of the species and not to the biochemical reaction catalysed.

In contrast to the pattern observed when adult conspecifics are compared, we show that jumping muscle CS activity increased more than 2-fold from 2nd instars to adults, while jumping muscle LDH activity increased more than 5-fold. The increased LDH activity in older grasshoppers supports previous data that older grasshoppers have a reduced jumping endurance. The increased CS activity with age may help older grasshoppers efficiently produce aerobic ATP to bend cuticular springs for energy storage before a jump or alternatively recover from anaerobic metabolism after jumping. Metabolic changes in S. americana jumping muscle are similar to other developing taxa and highlight the importance of including juveniles within intraspecific studies.

We have identified three SCP variants in the freshwater crayfish Procambarus clarkii. The variants (pcSCP1a, pcSCP1b, and pcSCP1c) differ across a 37 amino acid region that lies mainly between the second and third EF-hand calcium binding domains. We evaluated tissue distribution and response of the variants to cold exposure, a stress known to affect expression of parvalbumin. Expression patterns of the variants were not different and therefore do not provide a functional rationale for the polymorphism of pcSCP1. Compared to hepatopancreas, expression of pcSCP1 variants was 100,000-fold greater in axial abdominal muscle and 10-fold greater in cardiac muscle. Expression was 10\u2013100 greater in fast-twitch deep flexor and extensor muscles compared to slow-twitch superficial flexor and extensors. In axial muscle, no significant changes of pcSCP1, calmodulin (CaM), or sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) expression were measured after one week of 4\u00a0\u00b0C exposure. In contrast, large decreases of pcSCP1 were measured in cardiac muscle, with no changes in CaM or SERCA. Knockdown of pcSCP1 by dsRNA led to reduced muscle activity and decreased expression of SERCA. In summary, the pattern of pcSCP1 tissue expression is similar to parvalbumin, supporting a role in muscle contraction. However, the response of pcSCP1 to cold exposure differs from parvalbumin, suggesting possible functional divergence between the two proteins.",

Transcriptional regulation of sseKer3 by thyroid hormones (THs) was also evaluated. Larvae exposed to the goitrogen thiourea (TU) exhibited higher mRNA levels than untreated control. Moreover, adding exogenous T4 hormone to TU-treated larvae restored or even reduced the sseKer3 transcript levels with respect to the untreated control.

Specific activity was highest in fresh water (26.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0U mg\u2212\u00a01), decreasing in 5\u2030 to 21\u2030, attaining 3-fold less at 15\u2030. Apparent affinities for ATP and Mg2+ respectively increased 3.2- and 2-fold at 10\u2030, suggesting expression of different isoenzymes. In a 240-h time-course study of exposure to 21\u2030, maximum specific activity decreased 2.5- to 4-fold within 1 to 24\u00a0h while apparent affinities for ATP and Mg2+ respectively increased by 12-fold within 24\u00a0h and 2.4-fold after 1\u00a0h, unchanged thereafter. KI for bafilomycin A1 decreased 150-fold after 1\u00a0h, remaining constant up to 120\u00a0h. This is the first kinetic analysis of V-ATPase specific activity in crustacean gills during salinity acclimation. Our findings indicate active gill Cl\u2212 uptake by D. pagei in fresh water, and short- and long-term down-regulation of V-ATPase-driven ion uptake processes during salinity exposure, aiding in comprehension of the biochemical adaptations underpinning the establishment of the Brachyura in fresh water.",

     "abstract": "Phytomonas are trypanosomatid plant parasites closely related to parasites that cause several human diseases. Little is known about the biology of these organisms including aspects of their metabolism. Arginine kinase (E.C. 2.7.3.3) is a phosphotransferase which catalyzes the interconversion between the phosphagen phosphoarginine and ATP. This enzyme is present in some invertebrates and is a homolog of another widely distributed phosphosphagen kinase, creatine kinase. In this work, a single canonical arginine kinase isoform was detected in Phytomonas Jma by enzymatic activity assays, PCR, and Western Blot. This arginine kinase is very similar to the canonical isoforms found in T. cruzi and T. brucei, presenting about 70% of amino acid sequence identity and a very similar molecular weight (40\u00a0kDa). The Phytomonas phosphagen system seems to be very similar to T. cruzi, which has only one isoform, or T. brucei (three isoforms); establishing a difference with other trypanosomatids, such as Leishmania, which completely lacks phosphagen kinases, probably by the presence of the arginine-consuming enzyme, arginase. Finally, phylogenetic analysis suggests that Kinetoplastids' arginine kinase was acquired, during evolution, from the arthropod vectors by horizontal gene transfer.",

All isozymes possessed similar Vmax values and thus hydrolysed both carboxy methyl cellulose and lichenan equally. Furthermore the chromatography profiles for lichenase activities mirrored that for endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase activities suggesting that the same enzyme possessed both activities. Given this, the endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase enzymes described for other animals, may, like the isozymes described in this study, may be able to hydrolyse lichenan. However this ability needs to be confirmed. The main digestive function of these isozymes may be to hydrolyse hemicelluloses such as lichenan and mixed beta-D-glucan. All three isozymes randomly hydrolysed internal glycosidic bonds within carboxy methyl cellulose and lichenan to release short oligomers of 4\u20135 glucose units in length. They also hydrolysed cellotetraose to either two units of cellobiose or cellotriose and glucose. Cellotriose was hydrolysed to cellobiose and glucose. All three enzymes lacked \u03b2-1,4-glucosidase activity as they could not hydrolyse cellobiose.",

In this study, we isolated the CYP17A1 gene and its processed pseudogene from R. rugosa. The former was found to consist of 8 exons, and the latter a single-exon gene, designated CYP17A1P. The sequence of the promoter region of CYP17A1 differed from that of CYP17A1P. We found several consensus binding-sites for candidate transcription factors including androgen receptor (AR), Sox and FoxL2 in the CYP17A1 promoter region, but an AR-binding site was absent from CYP17A1P. When AR was over-expressed in Xenopus A6 cells, it did not increase CYP17A1 transcription in luciferase assays. CYP17A1 was strongly expressed in indifferent male gonads during sex determination and exclusively in testis, among eight adult tissues of R. rugosa. By contrast, CYP17A1P was expressed at very low, and similar levels in the adult tissues of both sexes. Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that CYP17A1P is localized to chromosome 4, while CYP17A1 is on chromosome 9. These results collectively suggest that CYP17A1, but not CYP17A1P is involved in male sex-determination in R. rugosa, and that androgens may not have a direct effect on the CYP17A1 transcription.",

Malondialdehyde levels in both tissues increased in parallel with starvation and food restriction and these values did not return to normal after the refeeding period. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) in liver and gills increased during the 49\u00a0days of starvation, but glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities decreased.

Each cDNA encoded 128 amino acids, with 94% similarity between the two and 83% similarity with AFPIV of the longhorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus octodecemspinosus. The genome structures of both genes consisted of four exons and three introns, and were highly conserved in terms of sequences and positions. In contrast, the third intron of PaAFPIV had additional nucleotides with inverted repeats at each end, which appeared to be a MITE-like transposable element. Comparative analysis revealed that fish AFPIVs were widely distributed across teleost fishes, well conserved in their intron positions, but more variable in intron sequences and sizes. However, the intron sequences of two Antarctic fishes were highly conserved, indicating recent radiation of notothenioids in the evolutionary lineage. The recombinant PaAFPIV and NcAFPIV were expressed in E. coli, and examined antifreeze activity. PaAFPIV and NcAFPIV gave ice crystals with star-shaped morphology, and thermal hysteresis (TH) values were 0.08\u00a0\u00b0C at the concentration of 0.5\u00a0mg/ml.",

     "abstract": "The benefits of dietary fish and fish oil are derived from n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) that have beneficial effects in a range of human diseases and pathologies such as cardiovascular and other inflammatory disorders, neural development and neurological pathologies. The precursor of n-3 LC-PUFA, 18:3n-3 does not have the same beneficial effects prompting interest in the pathways of endogenous synthesis of LC-PUFA in vertebrates. The LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway classically involves \u03946 and \u03945 fatty acyl desaturases (Fad), but it was recently shown that \u03946 Fad in mammals also displayed \u03948 activity demonstrating a possible alternative \u201c\u03948-pathway\u201d for the synthesis of LC-PUFA. Our primary hypothesis was that \u03948 desaturase activity would be a common feature of vertebrate \u03946 Fads, and so the aim of the present study was to determine the ability of teleostei Fads for \u03948 desaturation activity. To this end, cDNAs for Fads from a range of freshwater, diadromous and marine teleost fish species were assayed for \u03948 activity in the heterologous yeast expression system. In summary, the present study has demonstrated that \u03948 desaturation activity was also a characteristic of fish orthologs, although the activity varied notably between freshwater/diadromous and marine fish species, with the latter possessing Fads2-like proteins with \u03948 activity far higher than mammalian FADS2. The data showed that, generally, the fish Fad are technically \u03c5-3 desaturases, with new double bonds introduced 3C beyond a pre-existing double bond. However, the ability of zebrafish and rabbitfish Fads, previously characterised as \u03946/\u03945 bifunctional desaturases, to introduce non-methylene interrupted double bonds in 20:3n-3 and 20:2n-6 suggested that a novel combination of regioselectivity modes operates within these enzymes.",

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) remained consistently elevated (>\u00a01750\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) suggesting that elephant seals defend HDL concentrations, despite significant depletion of TC and LDL across the breeding fast. Triglyceride levels were significantly higher during the molt, consistent with lower rates of lipid oxidation needed to meet metabolic energy demands during this period. The maintenance of HDL during breeding is consistent with its role in delivering cholesterol from adipose tissue for steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis and potentially mitigates oxidative stress associated with fasting.",

     "abstract": "Phenoloxidases (POs) play a key role in melanin production, are involved in invertebrate immune mechanisms, and have been detected in different bivalves. Recently, we identified catecholase- and laccase-like PO activities in plasma and haemocyte lysate supernatant (HLS) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. To go further in our investigations, the aims of this study were (i) to determine the tissue distribution of PO activities in C. gigas, and (ii) to identify and characterise the different sub-classes of POs (i.e. tyrosinase, catecholase and/or laccase) involved in these oxido-reductase activities. With dopamine and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) but not with l-tyrosine used as substrates, PO-activities were detected by spectrophotometry in the gills, digestive gland, mantle, and muscle. These results suggest the presence of catecholase and laccase but not of tyrosinase activities in oyster tissues. The highest activity was recovered in the digestive gland. PO-like activities were all inhibited by 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) and by the specific laccase inhibitor, cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). With dopamine as substrate, the catecholase inhibitor 4-hexylresorcinol (4-HR) only inhibited PO in the muscle. SDS-PAGE zymographic assays with dopamine and PPD elicited a unique ~\u00a040\u00a0kDa protein band in the muscle. In the other tissues, laccase-like activities could be related to ~\u00a010\u00a0kDa and/or ~\u00a0200\u00a0kDa protein bands. The ~\u00a010\u00a0kDa protein band was also detected in plasma and HLS, confirming the presence of a laccase in the later compartments, and probably in most of the tissues of C. gigas. This is the first time to our knowledge that a ~\u00a010\u00a0kDa protein band is associated to a laccase-like activity in a mollusc species, contributing to the characterisation of phenoloxidase activities in marine bivalves.",

Biochem. Physiol., B157, 137\u2013148 (2010)). In the present study, we cloned the cDNA encoding AkMan and constructed a bacterial expression system for this enzyme to enrich information about the primary structure and the characteristic properties of this enzyme. cDNA fragments encoding AkMan were amplified by PCR followed by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-RACE PCRs from the A. kurodai hepatopancreas cDNA using degenerated primers designed on the basis of partial amino-acid sequences of AkMan. The cDNA including entire translational region of AkMan consisted of 1392\u00a0bp and encoded 369 amino-acid residues. The N-terminal region of 17 residues of the deduced sequence except for the initiation Met was regarded as the signal peptide of AkMan and the mature enzyme region was considered to comprise 351 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 39961.96\u00a0Da. Comparison of the primary structure of AkMan with other \u03b2-1,4-mannanases indicated that AkMan belongs to the subfamily 10 of glycosyl-hydrolase-family-5 (GHF5). Phylogenetic analysis for the GHF5 \u03b2-1,4-mannanases indicated that AkMan together with other molluscan \u03b2-1,4-mannanases formed an independent clade of the subfamily 10 in the phylogenetic tree. The recombinant AkMan (recAkMan) was expressed with an Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pCold1 expression system as an N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recAkMan showed the broad pH optimum in acidic pH range as did native AkMan; however, heat stability of recAkMan was considerably lower than that of native enzyme. This may indicate that the stability of AkMan is derived from an appropriate folding and/or some posttranslational modifications in Aplysia cells.",

Muscle extracts from control and frozen frogs were incubated with ions and second messengers to stimulate the actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases, with results indicating that HK can be phosphorylated by protein kinases A and C, and AMP-activated protein kinase, and can be dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases 1, 2A and 2C. The data indicate that in control frogs, HK is in a higher phosphate form and displays a high substrate affinity and high activity, whereas in frozen frogs HK is less phosphorylated, with lower substrate affinity and lower activity. Studies also showed that HK affinity for ATP decreases further in response to low temperature, but that high cryoprotective glucose concentrations can prevent these changes in affinity.

In shrimp gills, the 14-3-3A transcript levels slightly changed after transfer of the shrimp from 3 to 25 or to 40\u00a0ppt. In contrast, significant change in the mRNA levels in response to salinity stress was detected for 14-3-3B, where a significant decrease of 14-3-3B transcript was observed in gills of shrimp transferred from hypo-osmotic (3\u00a0ppt) salinity to iso-osmotic or hyper-osmotic (25 and 40\u00a0ppt, respectively) salinity. On the other hand, shrimp transferred from 40\u00a0ppt to 3\u00a0ppt showed a strong induction of 14-3-3B mRNA expression in the gills. These transcript expression analyses suggest that 14-3-3B is likely to be involved in the hyper-osmotic regulation in P. monodon.

     "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1 and IGF-1R) play main roles in vertebrate growth and development. In fish, besides contributing to somatic growth, both molecules exhibit pleiotropic functions. We isolated complete cDNAs sequences encoding for both IGF-1 and IGF-1R in the Chilean flounder by using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNAs ends (RACE) techniques. We analyzed gene expression in pre-metamorphic larvae and different organs of juvenile fish through whole mount in situ hybridization and RT-PCR, respectively. In addition, we studied the presence of calcified skeletal structures in pre-metamorphic larvae through the fluorescent chromophore calcein. The IGF-1 cDNA sequence displays an open reading frame of 558 nucleotides, encoding a 185 amino acid preproIGF-1. Moreover, IGF-1R contains an open reading frame spanning 4239 nucleotides, rendering a 702 amino acid subunit alpha and a 676 amino acid subunit beta. The deduced mature IGF-1 and IGF-1R exhibited high sequence identities with their corresponding orthologs in fishes, especially those domains involved in biological activity. RT-PCR showed expression of IGF-1 and IGF-1R transcripts in all studied tissues, consistent with their pleiotropic functions. Furthermore, we observed IGF-1 expression in notochord and IGF-1R expression in notochord, somites and head in larvae of 8 and 9\u00a0days post fertilization. Complementarily, we detected in larvae of 8\u00a0days post fertilization the presence of calcified skeletal structures in notochord and head. Interestingly, both mRNAs and calcified structures were found in territories such as notochord, an embryonic midline structure essential for the pattern of surrounding tissues as nervous system and mesoderm. Our results suggest that IGF-1 and its receptor play an important role in the development of the nervous system, muscle and bone-related structures during larval stages.",

     "abstract": "Methyl farnesoate (MF), a crustacean juvenile hormone (JH) analog, plays important roles in the regulation of a number of physiological processes such as molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction. Understanding its metabolic pathway is a key for various potential applications in crustacean aquaculture, including artificial seed production and enhancement of growth. Although the synthetic pathway of MF is well established, little is known about its degradation and recycling in crustaceans. In insects, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), a carboxylesterase, is responsible for JH inactivation. Two cDNAs, encoding JHE-like carboxylesterases (CXEs) from the hepatopancreas and ovary of Pandalopsis japonica, were isolated by using a combination of in-silico data mining from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database and traditional PCR-based cloning. The full length Pj-CXE1 (2084\u00a0bp) and Pj-CXE2 (1985\u00a0bp) cDNAs encoded proteins composed of 584 and 581 amino acids, respectively. The active site sequence and domain organization of the Pj-CXEs were highly conserved, including the catalytic triad and other motifs, which suggested that both Pj-CXEs are biologically active carboxylesterases. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced sequences of Pj-CXEs showed that both were most closely related to the JHEs from non-lepidopteran insects. End-point RT-PCR showed that Pj-CXE1 was expressed primarily in the gonad, whereas Pj-CXE2 was expressed in both the hepatopancreas and hindgut. Quantitative PCR showed that Pj-CXE1 was upregulated in the gonads by eyestalk ablation (ESA). In contrast, ESA had no significant effect on Pj-CXE2 expression in hepatopancreas or gonad. This is the first report of the cloning of two JHE-like CXE cDNAs in decapods and the upregulation of Pj-CXE1 by acute withdrawal of eyestalk neuropeptides. Further study is needed to understand the function of CXEs in MF metabolism and its regulation by eyestalk neuropeptides.",

The primary internal lipids of both diapause IP and nondiapausing adults are triacylglycerols. Only trace amounts of internal lipids were detected in day 1 diapause IP adults. A dramatic increase in internal lipids was observed between day 7 and day 15 post-emergence in the diapause IP adults. The majority of the triacylglycerol isomers were identified as C50, C52 and C54 chain lengths by GC\u2013MS. There were no observed differences in the isomeric distribution of the major internal lipids between diapause IP and nondiapausing adults. External lipids were mainly methyl-branched alkanes containing a 25 to 53 carbon backbone.

Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that 20\u03b2-HSD has widespread tissue distribution, with expression being abundant in tissues with high metabolic rates like gonads, liver, intestine, stomach and gill. In vivo experiments showed that expression level was highest at testicular mature stage indicating that 20\u03b2-HSD could play an important role in testicular developmental maturation in yellow catfish. During testicular mature stage, 20\u03b2-HSD related metabolism was regulated by GnRH and LH. Moreover, structural analysis showed that the predicted 20\u03b2-HSD contained 7 functional motifs of SDR superfamily of enzymes, including the putative coenzyme binding domain (Rossmann fold), GlyXXXGlyIleuGly, and the region responsible for nucleophilic attack of the substrate pocket, TyrXXXLys. These motifs are strictly conserved in yellow catfish 20\u03b2-HSD. Comprehensive functional analysis revealed that this enzyme has multiple functions, such as xenobiotic metabolism, and steroid conversion. Catfish 20\u03b2-HSD contains multiple potential post-translational modification sites. Its subcellular location, theoretical isoelectric point and molecular weight were also investigated.

Purified trypsins revealed single band on SDS-PAGE and their molecular masses were 21\u00a0kDa and 21.5\u00a0kDa, respectively. Trypsins A and B exhibited maximal activity at 40\u00a0\u00b0C, and shared the same optimal pH at 9.0 using Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA as the substrate.

Glutamate dehydrogenase is a significant source NH3/NH4+ in some species, but previous reports indicate that the enzyme is absent from L3Haemonchus contortus. We show that glutamate dehydrogenase was active in both L3 and adult T. circumcincta. The apparent Kms of the L3 enzyme differed from those of the adult enzyme, the most significant of these being the increase in the Km for NH4+ from 18\u00a0mM in L3 to 49\u00a0mM in adults. The apparent Vmax of the oxidative deamination reaction was greater than that of the reductive reaction in L3, but this was reversed in adults. The activity of the oxidative reaction of the L3 enzyme was not affected by adenine nucleotides, but that of the reductive reaction was stimulated significantly by either ADP or ATP. The L3 enzyme was more active with NAD+ than it was with NADP+, although the activities supported by NADH and NADPH were similar at saturating concentrations. While the activity of the oxidative reaction was sufficient to account for the NH3/NH4+ efflux we have previously reported, the reductive amination reaction was likely to be more active.",

Several nonmammalian GHRH-like peptides were reported previously to be encoded by PACAP and processed from the same transcript and prepropolypeptide. However, the true nonmammalian GHRHs in amphibian and fishes were only recently discovered. We identified and characterized the primary structure of the GHRH gene and determined its expression profiles under normal and infectious conditions in the teleost fish, Paralichthys olivaceus. The 142 amino acids of the GHRH precursor are encoded by six exons spanning 2290\u00a0bp. The flounder GHRH precursor mRNA was constitutively expressed in the brain as well as gills and ovary. Inducible expression of GHRH mRNA was observed in the gills of Edwardsiella tarda-challenged fish. Induction of GHRH mRNA was highest at 24\u00a0h post-bacterial challenge. Subsequently, the biological role of GHRH was investigated by exogenous treatment of flounder embryogenic cells (hirame natural embryonic cells, HINAE cells) and primary cultured pituitary cells with a synthetic GHRH peptide (fGHRH-28). The 10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M concentration of fGHRH-28 produced intracellular cAMP in HINAE cells and induced growth hormone mRNA in both of HINAE and pituitary cells. The profiles of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression differed from HINAE and pituitary cells after fGHRH-28 treatment. TNF-\u03b1 mRNA levels elevated approximately 3-fold in HINAE cells, but decreased to one-third in pituitary cells stimulated by fGHRH-28. These results suggest that the flounder GHRH plays roles in the bidirectional communication network between growth and immunity in fish.",

Using grass carp PBLs as a cell model, effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the mRNA and protein levels of Hsp70/Hsc70 were examined. In this case, LPS increased the mRNA expression of Hsp70 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on Hsc70 mRNA expression. In agreement with this, LPS elevated the intracellular Hsp70 markedly, but not the Hsc70 protein levels in parallel experiments. Furthermore, Hsp70 protein was also detected in culture medium. Moreover, inhibition of LPS on Hsp70 release in a time-dependent manner was observed, indicating that there may be a dynamic balance between Hsp70 stores and Hsp70 release in grass carp PBLs following exposure to LPS. Taken together, these results not only shed new insights into the different regulations of LPS on Hsp70/Hsc70 gene expression, protein synthesis and release, but also provide a basis for further study on the functional role of Hsp70 in fish immune response.",

Here we report on the cloning of a novel Elovl4-like elongase from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The salmon Elovl4 cDNA codes for a putative protein containing 306 amino acids. Heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that salmon Elovl4 efficiently elongated saturated FAs up to 36:0, with 24:0 and 26:0 appearing as preferred substrates. Additionally, salmon Elovl4 effectively converted C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids to elongated polyenoic products up to C36.

GPx is also involved in immune defenses. In this study, we report cloning and characterization of a GPx (designated as MyGPx) coding sequences and promoter from Japanese scallop, Mizuhopecten yessoensis. The full-length 1081 nt MyGPx mRNA contained a 28 nt 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 603 nt open reading frame and a 450 nt 3\u2032 UTR containing a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA). Multiple sequence alignment revealed that amino acids essential to enzymatic function of MyGPx proteins were highly conserved. A 1628 nt 5\u2032-flanking sequence of MyGPx was identified by genome walking. Here, several potential transcription factor binding sites were detected in the putative promoter region, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the 5\u2032 sequence flanking the promoter region. Quantitative Real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to measure GPx mRNA expression in adult tissues and monitor mRNA expression patterns during embryonic development and following stimulation by the bacteria Vibrillo anguillarum. Collectively, the results suggest that MyGPx fulfills an important function during M. yessoensis development and may be an important immune effector in adult molluscs.",

Hepatic lipolysis and lipogenesis revealed significant differences which could, eventually, result from the diet during the parasitic phase of sea lamprey life cycle.

The full-length mitochondrial Mn-SOD cDNA of blood clam Tegillarca granosa (denoted as TgmMnSOD) was identified from haemocytes by homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approaches. The nucleotide sequence of TgmMnSOD consisted of 1106\u00a0bp with a 5\u2032 UTR of 195\u00a0bp, a 3\u2032 UTR of 227\u00a0bp with a candidate polyadenylation signal sequence ATTAAA and a short polyA tail, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 648\u00a0bp encoding a secreted polypeptide of 227 amino acids residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of TgmMnSOD shared significant homology to mMnSODs from other species, indicating that TgmMnSOD should be a novel member of the mMnSOD family. Several highly conserved motifs including three mMnSOD signatures, amino acid residues responsible for coordinating the manganese and the putative active center were almost completely conserved in the deduced amino acid of TgmMnSOD. The mRNA expression of TgmMnSOD in the tissues of mantle, foot, gill, haemocytes and hepatopancreas was examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qT-PCR) and mRNA transcripts of TgmMnSOD were mainly detected in hepatopancreas, haemocytes, and gill and weakly detected in the mantle and foot. The temporal expression of TgmMnSOD in haemocytes after heavy metal exposure revealed that TgmMnSOD could be induced by the three pollutants with different response profiles. The polyclonal antibodies generated from the recombinant product of TgmMnSOD could specifically identify not only the recombinant product, but also the native protein from haemocytes. The present results strongly suggested that TgmMnSOD was a cute response protein involved in marine heavy metal contaminants challenge in T. granosa.",

Larval \u03b413C values also indicated greater selection and/or assimilation of rotifers in relation to the inert diet. Results demonstrate that during early larval development of sole, diet modulates ssetryp1 gene expression. The rapid and intense response to diets that promoted different growth and survival suggests the suitability of this biomarker as a nutritional status indicator in early sole larvae.",

The most stable mRNA expression was obtained with RPL6 and ACTB, whereas the least stable was RPL13. After normalization using RPL6, ACTB and RPL6/ACTB combination, the mRNA expression of GULO was highest at the embryonic stage (2\u00a0days before hatching; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and started to decline from hatching of larvae to the rest of the developmental time-points.

The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 26\u00a0kDa by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In activity staining by native-PAGE, the Japanese flounder Mn-SOD gave three active bands and exhibited KCN-insensitive activity. In addition, the electrophoretic mobility of this enzyme was observed to be faster than that of Japanese flounder Cu,Zn-SOD. On the other hand, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this Mn-SOD was determined to be 16 amino acid residues, and the sequence showed high homology to other Mn-SODs but not Japanese flounder Cu,Zn-SOD. Analysis of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the Mn-SOD cDNA consisted of a 64\u00a0bp 5\u2032-non-coding region, a 675\u00a0bp open reading frame encoding 225 amino acids, and a 465\u00a0bp 3\u2032-non-coding region. The first 27 amino acids containing a mitochondria-targeting signal were highly conserved among other Mn-SODs.",

A 2-kb nucleotide sequence upstream of the start codon of chicken PPAR\u03b3 gene was cloned and characterized by using bioinformatics and experimental approaches.

Further study by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and mutational analysis revealed that the chicken C/EBP\u03b1 could directly bind to and regulate the PPAR\u03b3 gene promoter.

Two different isoforms have been described in mammals, the skeletal and cardiac isoforms, encoded by CASQ1 and CASQ2 genes, respectively. In this study, we present molecular phylogenetic evidence of a gene duplication event of both calsequestrin genes in teleosts, referred to as casq1a/casq1b and casq2a/casq2b. We obtained the entire cDNAs encoding the four genes in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup). Main features and sequence identities with other fish and mammalian calsequestrins are described. Expression profiles during larval development and in juvenile tissues were analyzed using a real-time PCR approach. In juvenile fish, casq1a and casq1b were highly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas the highest casq2a and casq2b transcript levels were detected in heart and brain, respectively. During metamorphosis, casq2a and casq1b expression remained unchanged. In contrast, casq1a and casq2b mRNAs exhibited a continuous increase from the beginning of metamorphosis until post-metamorphosis. Transcriptional regulation of casq1 and casq2 genes by thyroid hormones (THs) was also evaluated. Larvae exposed to the goitrogen thiourea (TU) exhibited higher casq1a mRNA levels than untreated control, whereas expression of the remaining genes did not vary significantly. Moreover, addition of exogenous T4 hormone to TU-treated larvae increased the casq1a steady-state levels with respect to the untreated control at metamorphosis climax. Comprehensively, these results demonstrate the existence of four calsequestrin genes in teleosts differentially regulated by THs.",

The X-ray diffraction pattern of the mutant enzyme crystal revealed that amino acid residues involved in substrate binding are closer to one another than in the rabbit enzyme, and the cysteine283 active site of the mutant enzyme points away from the ADP binding site. At pH 7.4\u20138.0 and 35\u201310\u00a0\u00b0C, with a smaller substrate, dADP, specific activities of the mutant enzyme were consistently higher than the wild-type rabbit enzyme and more similar to the carp M1-CK enzyme.

Therefore, we investigated gastrointestinal calcium transport of sheep as influenced by a dietary calcium restriction and/or a supraphysiological dosage of exogenous calcitriol. Using the Ussing chamber technique, we determined calcium and mannitol flux rates to differentiate between para- and transcellular calcium transport in rumen, duodenum, jejunum and colon. Expression of epithelial calcium channels, calbindin-D9K, and basolateral extrusion mechanisms was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Active calcium transport could be demonstrated in jejunum and rumen. A significant stimulation of jejunal calcium absorption was only observed in animals treated with calcitriol. The alimentary calcium restriction alone did not result in significant effects indicating a less effective intestinal adaptation to alimentary calcium restriction than observed in monogastric animals. The observed ruminal calcium transport was not affected at all, neither by the diet nor the calcitriol treatment. Furthermore, no significant expression of epithelial calcium channels or calbindin-D9K could be detected in the rumen; therefore it is concluded that calcium transport in the forestomachs is probably mediated by a different, so far unknown mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Muscle growth is determined primarily by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. When rates of protein synthesis are similar between individuals, protein degradation is critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency. Studies in mammals showed that muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown, and is associated with activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including induction of the muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, MuRF1. Animals lacking MuRF1 are resistant to muscle atrophy. In fish, little is known about the role of the proteasome/MuRF pathway in muscle degradation. The objectives of this study were to: 1) clone and characterize MuRF genes in rainbow trout; and 2) determine expression of MuRF genes in association with starvation- and vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for three MuRF genes (MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3). These genes encode proteins with typical MuRF structural domains, including a RING-finger, a B-box and a Leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that MuRF genes are predominantly expressed in muscle and heart tissues. Real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of all MuRF genes is up-regulated during starvation and MuRF3 is up-regulated in vitellogenesis-associated muscle degradation. These results suggest that MuRF genes have an important role in fish muscle protein degradation. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential use of MuRF genes as tools to monitor fish muscle growth and degradation.",

A cDNA of a PKC alpha binding protein (also called PICK1: protein interacting with C kinase 1) was cloned in hemocytes of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera). It encodes 475 amino acid residues with putative PDZ and BAR domains interacting with other proteins or ligands. The PICK1 gene of S. exigua (Se-PICK1) was expressed in all developmental stages. In the larval stage, it was highly expressed in hemocyte and brain tissues. A quantitative RT-PCR indicated that its expression was significantly up-regulated by a bacterial challenge. RNA interference of Se-PICK1 in the fifth instar larvae with 100\u00a0ng of a specific double-stranded RNA could effectively knockdown its expression after 48\u00a0h post-injection in hemocytes. The suppressed expression of Se-PICK1 significantly impaired the larvae of S. exigua to induce hemocyte-spreading behavior and to form hemocyte nodules in response to bacterial infection.

     "abstract": "We have previously identified a histone H2B isomer (cvH2B-1) from tissue extracts of the bivalve mollusk, the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). In this paper, we isolate an additional three antibacterial proteins from acidified gill extract by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Extraction of these proteins from tissue was best accomplished by briefly boiling the tissues in a weak acetic acid solution. Addition of protease inhibitors while boiling resulted in somewhat lower yields, with one protein being totally absent with this method. Via mass spectrometry, the masses of one of these purified proteins was 13607.0\u00a0Da (peak 2), which is consistent with the molecular weight of histone H2B. In addition, via western-blotting using anti-calf histone H2B antibody, all three proteins were positive and were thus named cvH2B-2, cvH2B-3 and cvH2B-4. The antibacterial activity of cvH2B-2 was similar to that of cvH2B-1, with activity against a Gram-positive bacterium (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis; minimum effective concentration [MEC] 52\u201357\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) but inactive against Staphylococcus aureus (MEC\u00a0>\u00a0250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). However, both proteins had relatively potent activity against the Gram-negative oyster pathogen Vibrio parahemolyticus (MEC 11.5\u201314\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) as well as the human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus (MEC 21.3\u201325.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). cvH2B-3 and cvH2B-4 also had similarly strong activity against Vibrio vulnificus. These data provide further evidence for the antimicrobial function of histone H2B isomers in modulating bacterial populations in oyster tissues. The combined estimated concentrations of these histone H2B isomers were far above the inhibitory concentrations for the tested vibrios, including human pathogens. Our results indicate that the highly conserved histone proteins might be important components not only of immune defenses in oysters but have the potential to influence the abundance of a ubiquitous microbial resident of oyster tissues that is the major source of seafood-borne illness in humans.",

In this study, we characterized the expression profiles of BmAK using RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. The expression level of BmAK fluctuated in various developing stage and various tissue. Remarkably, the expression level of BmAK increased more than 10-fold 24 hours post inoculation (h p.i.) of NPV in strain NB and BC8, while such increment was abraded in strain 306 although the basal expression level of BmAK in strain 306 was higher than that of strain NB and BC8. Western blotting analysis using polyclonal antibody against BmAK verified such observation, and immunofluoresence analysis indicated for the first time that BmAK was mainly located to the cytoplasm or some structures in cytoplasm.

In Dysdercus peruvianus midgut perimicrovillar space a soluble aminopeptidase maybe involved in the digestion of oligopeptides and proteins ingested in the diet. This D. peruvianus aminopeptidase was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on an Econo-Q column, hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-agarose column and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results suggested that there is a single molecular species of aminopeptidase in D. peruvianus midgut. Molecular mass values for the aminopeptidase were estimated to be 106\u00a0kDa (gel filtration) and 55\u00a0kDa (SDS-PAGE), suggesting that the enzyme occurs as a dimer under native conditions. Kinetic data showed that D. peruvianus aminopeptidase hydrolyzes the synthetic substrates LpNA, RpNA, A\u03b2NA and AsnMCA (Kms 0.65, 0.14, 0.68 and 0.74\u00a0mM, respectively). The aminopeptidase activity upon LpNA was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating the importance of metal ions in enzyme catalysis. One partial sequence of BLAST-identified aminopeptidase was found by random sequencing of the D. peruvianus midgut cDNA library. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the aminopeptidase genes were expressed throughout the midgut epithelium, in the epithelia of V1, V2 and V3, Malphigian tubules and fat body, but it was not expressed in the salivary glands.

LVs were analyzed by spectrophotometry, immunochemical and electron microscopy, showing that the respiratory pigment hemocyanin was not present as apolipoprotein. This fact evidenced that these LVs were not related to hemolymphatic lipoproteins.",

     "abstract": "Fish skin mucus has recently been recognized to be a potential source of antimicrobial peptides, which provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. This study reports the purification and characterization of a novel linear antimicrobial peptide, pelteobagrin, from the skin mucus of yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, Richardson). Pelteobagrin is 20 amino acids in length (GKLNLFLSRLEILKLFVGAL) and shows no clear homology with any known bioactive peptides. MALDI-TOF MS indicated the molecular mass of the purified peptide was 2244.4\u00a0Da, which is in good agreement with pelteobagrin's predicted molecular weight of 2244.8\u00a0Da. Pelteobagrin exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi, and the activity was relatively salt-insensitive as it was not affected by NaCl concentrations of up to 137\u00a0mM. Moreover, pelteobagrin displayed no hemolytic activity to rabbit red blood cells. Transmission electron microscopy suggested that pelteobagrin might kill bacteria via acting on both the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. These results suggest that pelteobagrin might be involved in the innate defense system in yellow catfish.",

In our study, AS-hepc2 and AS-hepc6 hepcidin isoforms from black porgy were characterized for their in vivo expression patterns following bacterial challenge, and their in vitro antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi. As a result, two isoforms were observed to be widely distributed in all the tissues tested. AS-hepc2 was a liver-expressed hepcidin peptide which was always highly more expressed in the liver than in the other tissues tested no matter whether this was before or after bacterial challenge. AS-hepc6 was detected mainly in the head kidney and trunk kidney of normal fish, but, in the challenged fish, its expression involved more tissues than just the kidneys. The mature peptides of AS-hepc2 and AS-hepc6 were modeled for 3D structure and then synthesized for antimicrobial assay. AS-hepc6 had a wider antimicrobial spectrum than AS-hepc2 and, in particular, had more potent antifungal activity. Our study indicated that the two hepcidin isoforms had different characteristics in terms of their expression patterns and antimicrobial activity, and they were assumed to play an overlapping role in the innate immune system of black porgy against invading pathogens.",

Trypsin-like proteinases were major enzymes for H. coriaceus, with minor activity by chymotrypsin proteinases. More importantly, gut proteinases of H. coriaceus were inhibited by trypsin inhibitor from Inga laurina seeds. In addition, a serine proteinase inhibitor from I. laurina seeds demonstrated significant reduction of growth of H. coriaceus larvae after feeding on inhibitor incorporated artificial diets. Dietary utilization experiments show that 0.05% I. laurina trypsin inhibitor, incorporated into an artificial diet, decreases the consumption rate and fecal production of H. coriaceus larvae. Dietary utilization experiments show that 0.05% I. laurina trypsin inhibitor, incorporated into an artificial diet, decreases the consumption rate and fecal production of H. coriaceus larvae. We have constructed a three-dimensional model of the trypsin inhibitor complexed with trypsin. The model was built based on its comparative homology with soybean trypsin inhibitor. Trypsin inhibitor of I. laurina shows structural features characteristic of the Kunitz type trypsin inhibitor.

In vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that water-soluble extracts of nacre stimulate osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization, but the component responsible for this activity is unclear. It was reported that Pinctada fucata mantle gene 3 (PFMG3) with an N-terminal signal peptide could be secreted into the nacre of P. fucata. Here we report that PFMG3 is specifically expressed at the outer fold of the mantle and could promote calcium carbonate crystal formation in vitro. Consistent with this observation, we found that matrix mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, a murine osteoblast cell line, is accelerated upon treatment with PFMG3. Intriguingly, we observed that alkaline phosphatase activity and cell viability are increased after treating MC3T3-E1 cell with PFMG3. mRNA levels of osteoblast-specific marker genes osteocalcin and osteopontin are also increased. We conclude that PFMG3 from the mantle of P. fucata promotes MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell differentiation, matrix mineralization, and calcium carbonate deposition in vitro.

Whole mount in situ hybridization showed that mef2a and mef2dI were expressed in both cardiac ring and cone prior to looping morphogenesis, while mef2dII expression was only detectable in the cardiac ring. The mef2cI and mef2cII paralogs displayed different spatial expression patterns in the heart tube with a venous and arterial pole preference, respectively.

     "abstract": "The major plasma protein of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, was purified, characterized and named dominin. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that dominin consistently made up more than 40% of eastern oyster plasma and extrapallial fluid proteins. Three different forms of dominin were observed under non-reducing conditions. PCR and RACE primers designed from partial amino acid sequences obtained by tandem mass spectrometry of purified dominin identified 720\u00a0bp of complete cDNA encoding 192 amino acid residues. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of mature dominin, its molecular mass was calculated to be 19,389\u00a0Da and was lower than the molecular mass of purified dominin measured by MALDI. This difference is likely due to post-translational modifications of dominin as the purified protein was found to be glycolysated, phosphorylated and likely sulfated. The amino acid sequence showed high similarity to the major plasma protein of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), cavortin, and of the green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus), pernin, and to a recently described protein labeled as an extracellular superoxide dismutase from the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata. While dominin was found to possess a Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) domain, the domain was not completely conserved which explained why purified dominin lacked SOD activity. Dominin mRNA was detected in hemocytes by in situ hybridization and its expression measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR was significantly higher in winter than summer. Although the function(s) of dominin and homologous proteins is uncertain, the reported ability of cavortin to sequester iron and possibly limit the availability of this essential metal to pathogens suggests a potential role in host defense for this group of dominant plasma proteins. Other possible functions of dominin in antioxidation, wound repair, metal transport and shell mineralization are discussed leading us to conclude that dominin is likely a multifunctional protein.",

     "abstract": "Most young fishes lack the ability to function as herbivores, which has been attributed to two aspects of the digestive system: elevated nitrogen demand and a critical gut capacity. We compared the digestive morphology and biochemistry of two size classes of the marine herbivore Hyporhamphus regularis ardelio, pre-ontogenetic trophic shift (pre-OTS, <\u00a0100\u00a0mm) and post-ontogenetic trophic shift (post-OTS, >\u00a0100\u00a0mm), to determine what limits the onset of herbivory and how their digestive processes fit with current models of digestion. Two gut-somatic indices comparing gut length to body length (relative gut length) and body mass (Zihler's Index) demonstrated a significant decrease (RGL 0.59\u00a0\u2192\u00a00.49, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; ZI 3.24\u00a0\u2192\u00a02.44, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in gut length relative to body size. There was little difference in enzyme activity between the two classes, with juveniles showing similar levels of carbohydrase and lipase and less protease compared with adults, indicating that juveniles did not preferentially target nitrogen and were as capable of digesting an herbivorous diet. These findings suggest that herbivory in this fish is not limited by the function of the post-oesophageal digestive tract, but rather the ability of the pharyngeal mill to mechanically process plants. Our findings offer partial support for the current model of stomachless digestion, indicating that further refinement may be necessary.",

Herein, we report the characterization, spatiotemporal expression and developmental function of zebrafish ABCC5 and its transcriptional responses to heavy metals. Zebrafish abcc5 gene is located on chromosome 18 and comprised of 28 exons. The deduced polypeptide of zebrafish ABCC5 consists of 1426 amino acids, which shares high sequence identity with those from other species. Zebrafish abcc5 is maternally expressed and its transcripts are mainly distributed in brain, lens, liver and intestine of developing embryos. In adults, zebrafish abcc5 is extensively expressed, at higher levels in testis, brain, eye, ovary, intestine and kidney, but at relatively lower levels in gill, liver, heart and muscle. Blockage of endogenous ABCC5 activity by its dominant-negative led to the developmental retardation of zebrafish embryos in which activity of p21 signaling was markedly stimulated and cellular cGMP content was significantly increased. In addition, expression of abcc5 in ZF4 cells and zebrafish embryos was significantly induced by cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) or arsenic (As). The induced expression of ABCC5 by heavy metals was mainly detected in the liver of embryos at 96-h post-fertilization (hpf). In adult zebrafish, expression of abcc5 in brain, intestine, liver, kidney and ovary was significantly induced by one or more of these heavy metals. Furthermore, overexpression of ABCC5 attenuated the toxicity of Cd to zebrafish embryos, but did not affect the toxicity of Hg or As. Thus, ABCC5 is likely to play an active role in embryonic development and heavy metal detoxification through the export of second messenger molecules and toxicants out of cells in zebrafish.",

     "abstract": "The Harderian gland of Pelophylax esculentus (previously: Rana esculenta) shows seasonal secretory activity changes. Specifically, the secretory activity reaches a maximum during the hottest months, i.e., July and August, drops in September and slowly increases from October onwards. Expressions of P-CaMKII, P-ERK1 and P-Akt1 correlate well with gland secretory activity; i.e., they peak immediately before the hottest part of the year (maximum secretory activity). When the gland activity declines, kinase expressions drop and remain low until February. Experiments of thermal manipulation indicate that high temperature induces the activation of CaMKII, ERK1 and Akt1, and at low temperatures, Akt1 expression decreases. Experiments of chemical castration indicate that the Harderian gland of Cyproterone acetate-treated frogs shows lower Akt1 activity as compared to controls, but the CaMKII and ERK1 activities remain unchanged. Furthermore, in a period of resumed gland activity (October\u2013December) we observed the highest expression of PCNA, a mitotic marker. Immediately after the proliferative phase, we found the highest expression of caspase 3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis. In combination, the results suggest the following: 1) CaMKII, ERK1, and Akt1 modulate the annual secretory activity of the frog Harderian gland; 2) CaMKII and ERK1 activities are regulated by temperature, whereas both temperature and testosterone likely play a central role in Akt1 regulation; and 3) proliferation and apoptosis occur to restore and balance, respectively, an adequate cell number, which is essential to gland function.",

     "abstract": "Seabirds differ dramatically in life history traits and breeding strategies. For example, gulls have short incubation shifts (several hours) and high metabolic rates, auks have medium-length incubation shifts (12\u201324\u00a0h) and high metabolic rates, and petrels have long incubation shifts (days) and low metabolic rates. How these different strategies affect the dynamics of body components is poorly known. We compared body, organ and lipid mass changes among three different seabirds (gull: black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla; auk: thick-billed murre Uria lomvia; petrel: northern fulmar Fulmarus glacialis) at Prince Leopold Island, Nunavut, Canada during 2002 (a year with low reproductive success and poor chick growth across all three species). This study is among the first to compare mass and lipid dynamics among different species foraging in the same food web and at similar trophic levels during the same breeding season (same environmental conditions). In fulmars and murres, most of decreases in body mass reflected decreases in lipid mass while in kittiwakes the increase in body mass reflected an increase in lean mass, especially the muscle. The species with the longest fasting endurance (incubation shift length) had the highest percent body lipids during incubation (fulmars: 13.3%, murres: 7.3%, kittiwakes: 6.9%), the highest variability in body lipids, tended to regulate body mass primarily through lipid stores and tended to regulate exercise and digestive organs separately. In contrast, in the species with the highest metabolic rate, all organ systems were adjusted similarly and in relation to body mass, and in a similar manner between incubation (stress due to heavy ice conditions) and chick-rearing (lower stress due to ice-free conditions). In high metabolic rate species, we suggest that organ size varies in response to environmental stress. We conclude that the organ dynamics of seabirds are set by a combination of key life history traits (like incubation shift and metabolic rate) and environmental conditions.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (EC 2.5.1.18; GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes that are mainly involved in xenobiotic metabolism and protection against oxidative damage. Most studies of GSTs in insects have been focused on their role in detoxifying exogenous compounds in particular insecticides. Here, we show the expression profiles of GSTs of the bumblebee Bombus ignitus in response to oxidative stress. We identified a sigma-class GST from B. ignitus (BiGSTS). The BiGSTS gene consists of 4 exons that encode 201 amino acids. Comparative analysis indicates that the predicted amino acid sequence of BiGSTS shares a high identity with the sigma-class GSTs of hymenopteran insects such as Apis mellifera (70% protein sequence identity) and Solenopsis invicta (59% protein sequence identity). Tissue distribution analyses showed the presence of BiGSTS in all tissues examined, including the fat body, midgut, muscle and epidermis. The oxidative stress responses analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR showed that under H2O2 overload, BiGSTS and BiGSTD (identified in our previous study) were upregulated in all tissues examined, including the fat body and midgut of B. ignitus worker bees. Under uniform conditions of H2O2 overload, the expression profile of GSTs and other antioxidant enzyme genes, such as phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (Bi-PHGPx) and peroxiredoxins (BiPrx1 and BiTPx1), showed that other antioxidant enzyme genes are acutely induced at 3\u00a0h after H2O2 exposure, whereas BiGSTS and BiGSTD are highly induced at 9\u00a0h after H2O2 exposure in the fat body of B. ignitus worker bees. These findings indicate that GSTs and other antioxidant enzyme genes in B. ignitus are differentially expressed in response to oxidative stress. Taken together, our findings indicate that BiGSTS and BiGSTD are oxidative stress-inducible antioxidant enzymes that may play a role in oxidative stress response.",

ApoLp-III purified from larval hemolymph as well as that present in hemolymph extracts adsorbed on the surface of different bacteria. The adsorption capacity of apoLp-III on bacterial cells prompted us to investigate the effect of this phenomenon on bacterial growth. Our results demonstrate antibacterial activity of apoLp-III against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. Among bacteria tested, Salmonella typhimurium and K. pneumoniae were the most sensitive to apoLp-III. LIVE/DEAD staining of bacteria incubated with purified apoLp-III revealed their growth inhibition; however, neither morphological changes in the cell shape nor formation of cell aggregates was noticed.

Optimal pH and temperature of the two enzymes were similarly observed at pH 6.7 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Temperature that caused a half inactivation of the two enzymes during 20-min incubation was also similar to each other, i.e., 38\u00a0\u00b0C. However, NaCl requirement and activity toward oligosaccharide substrates of the two enzymes were significantly different from each other. Namely, AkAly28 showed practically no activity in the absence of NaCl and the maximal activity at NaCl concentrations higher than 0.2\u00a0M, whereas AkAly33 showed ~\u00a020% of maximal activity despite the absence of NaCl and the maximal activity at around 0.1\u00a0M NaCl. AkAly28 hardly degraded oligosaccharides smaller than tetrasaccharide, while AkAly33 could degrade oligosaccharides larger than disaccharide producing disaccharide and 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconaldehyde (an open chain form of unsaturated monosaccharide).

When vitellin (Vt) degradation by egg and larval enzymes was analyzed, stage-specific differences for RmLCE activity in comparison to vitellin-degrading cysteine endopeptidase (VTDCE) were observed. RmLCE is also able to degrade host hemoglobin (Hb). In agreement, an acidic cysteine endopeptidase activity was detected in larval gut.

The goal of this work was to study the effects of early post-hatch (PH) development and the time of initiation of feeding on activation of the genetic program regulating hepatic lipogenesis. A comparison of liver total RNA samples at hatch and 7\u00a0days PH was performed using oligonucleotide-based (Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae) chicken genome microarrays. During the first week PH there was significant up-regulation of key lipogenic genes including: ATP citrate lyase (ACL), malic enzyme (ME), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC\u03b1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1), sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and thyroid hormone responsive spot 14\u03b1 (Spot 14\u03b1) among others. These findings were confirmed using gene-specific RT-PCR assays. In a follow-up study, we investigated the effects of withholding feed for the first 48\u00a0h PH (delayed feeding, DF) on lipogenic gene expression through 8\u00a0days PH. Body weight gain was significantly depressed by DF. Plasma levels of the major metabolic hormones that regulate lipogenic gene expression (insulin, glucagon and T3) changed significantly during PH development, but were largely unaffected by DF. Plasma glucose was significantly lower in the DF group at 24\u00a0h PH but recovered thereafter. In general, DF inhibited the up-regulation of lipogenic genes until feeding was initiated. Delayed up-regulation was also observed for the lipogenic transcription factor genes, SREBP-1, SREBP-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), but not for carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREB) or liver X receptor (LXR).

A comparison of amino acid sequences of digestive and non-digestive cathepsin D-like enzymes from invertebrates showed that most cathepsin D enzymes involved in food digestion, lack the polyproline loop, whereas all non-digestive cathepsin Ds, including the American lobster cathepsin D2 paralog, contain the polyproline loop. We propose that the absence or presence of this loop may be characteristic of digestive and non-digestive aspartic proteinases, respectively.",

During the proliferation and differentiation phases, DFAT-P and 3T3-L1 cells expressed only the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG)-2 receptor and not EDG-4 and EDG-7 receptors. LPA promoted the proliferation of DFAT-P cells more extensively than that of 3T3-L1 cells. After adipogenic induction, LPA inhibited glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and lipid droplet accumulation, and suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) protein expression, this inhibitory effect in DFAT-P cells was twice as high as that in 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, treatments with low LPA concentrations significantly inhibited adipocyte differentiation in DFAT-P cells but not in 3T3-L1 cells. We conclude that LPA promotes the proliferation of porcine preadipocytes through the EDG-2 receptor but inhibits their differentiation, and these effects depend on the down-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 expression via the EDG-2 receptor. Furthermore, DFAT-P cells are more sensitive to LPA than 3T3-L1 cells. These findings in a porcine model will contribute to the understanding of LPA action mechanisms on in vitro proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes in domestic animals and/or humans.",

Individuals from a natural population in north-eastern Venezuela (Caribbean Sea) were sampled monthly during one year. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and a visual assessment of gonadic status are also reported. The environmental conditions characterized by chlorophyll a, temperature and seston concentration were measured in parallel. The highest reproductive activity, with a GSI of 13\u201318%, was observed from November 2003 to April 2004, and a decrease in GSI, taken as an indication of three spawning periods, was recorded in October, January and May\u2013June. The GSI was 5\u20138% outside these intervals. A similar trend was observed in maturity stage frequency. Statistical analysis (MDS-ANOSIM) established two different periods; one dominated by upwelling (January to July) and the other characteristic of non-upwelling conditions (August to December). The fatty acids 16:0, 22:6n-3, 20:5n-3 and 16:1n-7 were responsible for the differences between two periods and explained 50% of the observed variance. Accordingly, during the upwelling period, fatty acids such as 22:6n-3 were positively correlated with temperature, organic seston and bivalves in the spent sexual stage and inversely related to the GSI. Furthermore, individuals in the ripe sexual stage were positively related to 20:5n-3 and 18:3n-3, whereas chlorophyll a was directly related to 18:1n-7 and 16:1n-7. In the non-upwelling period, a significant and positive correlation was obtained between fatty acids such as 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 and the GSI and the bivalves in the ripe sexual stage, whereas these acids were inversely correlated with the spent sexual stage. In addition, chlorophyll a was positively related to 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6. Changes in the gonadal fatty acid profile of N. nodosus were influenced by the environmental variables (exogenous factors) during the upwelling and non-upwelling periods and by reproductions (endogenous factors).",

The orange-spotted grouper Sox11a contained the signature features of mammalian SOX11 homologues except the Pro\u2013Glu rich region, was clustered with Sox11a homologues of other teleosts in the phylogenetic tree, and shared higher homologies with Sox11 of other species than the duplicated copy Sox11b. Interestingly, significant conservation was observed in the 3\u2032UTR of sox11a but not sox11b transcripts when compared with mammalian Sox11 homologues. The expression of sox11a mRNA was detected in a wide range of tissues, with higher abundances in the central nervous system. During embryogenesis and larval development, the expression of sox11a mRNA remained at considerably high levels at all stages examined, from newly fertilized eggs, through organogenesis, to the larvae 18\u00a0days posthatching. Together, these results indicated that the orange-spotted grouper sox11a was evolutionarily more conserved than sox11b, and may play important roles in neurogenesis, embryogenesis, and larval development.",

We examined the RAS and NP system in the euryhaline Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina (Lesueur). To determine the relative sensitivity of target organs to these hormonal systems, we isolated cDNA sequences encoding the D. sabina angiotensin receptor (AT) and natriuretic peptide type-B receptor (NPR-B). We then determined the tissue-specific expression of their mRNAs in saltwater D. sabina from local Texas waters and an isolated freshwater population in Lake Monroe, Florida. AT mRNA was most abundant in interrenal tissue from both populations. NPR-B mRNA was most abundant in rectal gland tissue from both populations, and also highly abundant in the kidney of saltwater D. sabina. This study is the first to report the sequence of an elasmobranch angiotensin receptor, and phylogenetic analysis indicates that the D. sabina receptor is more similar to AT1 vs. AT2 proteins. This classification is further supported by molecular analysis of AT1 and AT2 proteins demonstrating conservation of AT1-specific amino acid residues and motifs in D. sabina AT. Molecular classification of the elasmobranch angiotensin receptor as an AT1-like protein provides fundamental insight into the evolution of the vertebrate RAS.",

The Southern and Northern analysis carried out showed that methionine rich hexamerin in rice moth is a single copy gene. Multiple alignment analysis of amino acid sequence revealed that the cDNA clone is most similar to Plodia interpunctella hexamerin storage protein (74% identity). The calculated isoelectric point is 9.2. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponded to 86\u00a0kDa subunit of hexamerin protein in rice moth.

In rainbow trout, the cDNA sequences of two E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box proteins, FBXO32 and FBXO25, were characterized and their expression across tissues in response to feed deprivation was determined. The cDNA sequence for FBXO32 encodes a protein 355 amino acids long and is 97% identical to the homologous protein in salmon, 85% to zebrafish and 72% identical to both human and mouse. The cDNA for FBXO25 encodes a protein 356 amino acids in length that is 98% identical to the homologous protein in salmon, 84% to zebrafish, and 75% to human. After 28\u00a0days of feed deprivation, FBXO32 expression increased by approximately 13-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold in white muscle, red muscle, and intestine, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The present work aimed to characterize both in vivo and in vitro the transcriptional regulation of several major genes involved in autophagy (LC3B, gabarapl1, atg12l, atg4b) in the white skeletal muscle of rainbow trout. We found that fasting fish for 14\u00a0days or serum depletion of trout myocytes strongly induces the expression of all studied genes.

In zymograms using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as substrate, we detected four distinct cellulolytic protein bands in D. carolina gut fluids, common to all developmental stages. These cellulolytic enzymes were localized to foregut and midgut regions of the D. carolina digestive tract. Cellulases were purified from D. carolina head and gut fluid extracts by liquid chromatography to obtain N-terminal amino acid sequence tags. Database searches with sequence tags from head fluids indicated high similarity with invertebrate, bacterial and plant \u03b21,4-endoglucanases, while no homologues were identified for the gut-derived protein.

We examined the chronic effect of 4\u00a0weeks of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (H, 480\u00a0mm Hg), cold (C, 5\u00a0\u00b0C) and the combination of the two stressors (HC) compared to normoxic thermoneutral controls (N, 28\u00a0\u00b0C) in male CD-1 mice. We found that hypoxic/cold acclimated mice had significantly lower body temperatures (Tb) after acclimation along with complete abolishment of diurnal Tb fluctuations. Capacity for NST was assessed by changes in intrascapular BAT mass, mitochondrial content and UCP1 content per milligram mitochondria. Acclimation caused distinct remodeling of BAT that was reflected in differences in NE-induced increases in oxygen consumption (VO2) used to assess NST capacity. Reduction of Tb in HC acclimated mice was not due to a decreased heat-generating capacity of BAT. VO2 during an acute temperature challenge (32 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C) in normoxia was similar in all treatment groups compared to controls but thermal conductance was greater in C acclimated mice and Tb higher in HC acclimated mice. We propose that an overriding inhibition by hypoxia on neural feedback pathways persists even after weeks of acclimation when combined with chronic cold.",

     "abstract": "Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a key enzyme that links amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism in cells. Regulation is likely most important when organisms are confronted with extreme stresses such as the low environmental temperatures and lack of food associated with winter. Many small mammals, such as Richardson's ground squirrels, Spermophilus richardsonii, cope with these conditions by hibernating. Animals enter long periods of profound torpor where metabolic rate is greatly suppressed, body temperature drops to near-ambient and all metabolic needs must be met from fixed internal body stores of fuels. To investigate how GDH is regulated under these conditions, kinetic properties of GDH were analyzed in liver from euthermic and torpid squirrels, revealing significant differences in Vmax, Km glutamate, Ka ADP and inhibition by urea between the two forms of GDH. These data suggested an activation of the glutamate-oxidizing activity of GDH in the hypometabolic state. Subsequent experiments suggested that the molecular basis of the kinetic differences was a change in the protein phosphorylation state of GDH between euthermia and torpor. Specifically, liver GDH appears to be dephosphorylated and activated when animals transition into torpor and this may serve to promote amino acid oxidation to contribute to energy production and gluconeogenesis. This is the first study to show that mammalian liver GDH can be regulated by reversible phosphorylation, providing an important new regulatory mechanism for GDH control.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin E is one of the most important lipid-soluble antioxidants to occur in plants and animals for cellular protection against lipid peroxidation. An essential adaptation to low temperature is the elaboration of high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the composition of cellular membranes, which is necessary to maintain functional membrane fluidity. Increasing the content of lipid unsaturation, however, occurs at the expense of enhancing the vulnerability of cellular membranes to oxidative damage. First isolated from salmon eggs, cold-water marine organisms were found to produce, or acquire, a specific vitamin E homologue, named \u201cmarine-derived tocopherol\u201d (MDT), having an unusual methylene unsaturation at its isoprenoid-chain terminus. In this overview we compare the antioxidant composition of tropical, temperate and polar fishes, present provisional evidence that MDT is produced at the primary food chain, and provide empirical confirmation that the enhanced reactivity of MDT at low temperature is attributed to its greater rate of diffusion in viscous lipids at low temperatures. This claim of biochemical adaptation is supported by a unique model of diffusion-limited reactivity that mimics changes in the ratio of the MDT/\u03b1-tocopherol rate constants at diminishing levels of radical flux in viscous media at low temperature. We offer in conclusion future outlooks to research on antioxidant protection in cold-water ectotherms.",

This cDNA sequence encodes a 670 amino acid residue protein that contains eight consensus regions for the DEAD box protein family, 9 arginine\u2013glycine repeats and 9 arginine\u2013glycine\u2013glycine repeats, a common character of known Vasa homologues. CiVasa shows high identity to that of zebrafish and other animals, suggesting Vasa is highly conserved through evolution. RT-PCR analysis reveals that in grass carp tissues, both ovaries and testes contain large amounts of vasa gene transcripts whereas no Civasa transcript is detected in somatic tissues examined. The Civasa transcripts are present at a high level from the 2 cell stage to gastrula stages which indicated that Cicasa transcripts are maternally inherited. The predicted protein sequence, localization and conserved pattern of gene expression suggest that Civasa plays an important role in the germ cell determinant and development in grass carp as proposed for other teleost species.",

CfGPx3 possessed all the conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of glutathione peroxidase, such as the selenocysteine encoded by stop codon UGA, the GPx signature motif (96LGVPCNQF103) and the active site motif (179WNFEKF184). The high similarity of CfGPx3 with GPx from other organisms indicated that CfGPx3 should be a new member of the glutathione peroxidase family. By fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR, the CfGPx3 mRNA was universally detected in the tissues of haemocytes, gill, gonad, muscle and hepatopancreas with the highest expression in hepatopancreas. After scallops were challenged by Listonella anguillarum, the expression level of CfGPx3 transcript in haemocytes was significantly up-regulated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 8\u00a0h post challenge.

The regulation and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1; EC No 2.3.1.21) are critical processes in the control of fatty acid metabolism, and here we report a cDNA from gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) which encodes a protein with high identity to vertebrate CPT1. This sea bream CPT1 mRNA is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, with little expression in other tissues. Phylogenetic analysis of other vertebrate CPT1 sequences show that fish genomes contain a single gene related to mammalian CPT1B, and a further two multi-gene families related to mammalian CPT1A. Genes related to mammalian CPT1C are absent in fish. Therefore, based on both functional and evolutionary orthology to mammalian CPT1B, the sea bream CPT1 reported here is a CPT1B isoform. Sea bream CPT1B mRNA expression progressively decreases in heart and muscle up to 12\u00a0h after last feeding, but returns to initial, non-fasted levels after 72\u00a0h. In contrast, in liver non-fasted expression is low, but strongly increases at 24 and 72\u00a0h after last feeding. In white muscle and liver, CPT1B mRNA expression is highly correlated with the expression of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor \u03b2 (PPAR\u03b2). Thus fatty acid metabolism by CPT1B and its control by PPARs are similar in fish and mammals, but multiple genes for CPT1A-like proteins in fish also suggest different and more complex pathways of lipid utilisation than in mammals.",

Ascidians, the closest relatives of vertebrates, have a simple chordate body plan. In the present study, we identified an almost complete set of genes encoding proteins homologous to chondroitin/dermatan sulfotransferases in the genome of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. We found eight genes encoding 4-O-sulfotransferases, eight genes encoding 6-O-sulfotransferases, and three genes encoding uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferases. The number of sulfotransferase genes was unexpectedly large, considering that ascidians do not have a well-developed endoskeleton. In addition, most of the genes within each sub-family seemed to have arisen by gene duplication events that occurred in the ascidian lineage after divergence from the main chordate lineage. This suggests that a unique pattern of sulfation independently developed during ascidian evolution. Some of the genes identified in the present study showed tissue-specific expression in the epidermis, notochord, muscle, and central nervous system.

It is the first report to demonstrate the presence of parvalbumin-like protein in fish spermatozoa. Using antibodies produced against purified carp parvalbumin-like protein, we localized parvalbumin-like protein to spermatids and spermatozoa. Our results indicate that parvalbumin-like protein appeared during the final stage of spermatogenesis. We also detected high amounts of parvalbumin-like protein in carp seminal plasma but not in blood plasma which suggests that its function may be specific for the male reproductive tract. The activation mechanism of carp sperm movement is not fully understood, but in carp, Ca2+ influx is the prerequisite for the initiation of sperm motility. The appearance of parvalbumin-like protein in high amounts in mature spermatozoa coincides with their acquiring the ability to move. The presence of parvalbumin-like protein in spermatozoa and seminal plasma strongly suggests that parvalbumin-like protein is an important part of the Ca2+-mediated mechanism of sperm activation in carp.",

Glucose and water absorptions by the anterior ventriculus of Dysdercus peruvianus midgut were determined by feeding the insects with a glucose and a non-absorbable dye solution, followed by periodical dissection of insects and analysis of ventricular contents. Glucose absorption decreases glucose/dye ratios and water absorption increases dye concentrations. Water and glucose transports are activated (water 50%, glucose 33%) by 50\u00a0mM K2SO4 and are inhibited (water 46%, glucose 82%) by 0.2\u00a0mM phloretin, the inhibitor of the facilitative hexose transporter (GLUT) or are inhibited (water 45%, glucose 35%) by 0.1\u00a0mM phlorizin, the inhibitor of the Na+\u2013glucose cotransporter (SGLT). The results also showed that the putative SGLT transports about two times more water relative to glucose than the putative GLUT. These results mean that D. peruvianus uses a GLUT-like transporter and an SGLT-like transporter (with K+ instead of Na+) to absorb dietary glucose and water. A cDNA library from D. peruvianus midgut was screened and we found one sequence homologous to GLUT1, named DpGLUT, and another to a sodium/solute symporter, named DpSGLT. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR studies revealed that DpGLUT and DpSGLTs mRNA were expressed in the anterior midgut, where glucose and water are absorbed, but not in fat body, salivary gland and Malpighian tubules.

Native HlH exhibits a predominant didecameric structure as revealed by electron microscopy and additionally few tridecamers are shown in the electron micrographs of HlH resulting from the association of a further decamer with one didecamer. The three isoforms are represented mainly as homogeneous didecamers, but they have different behaviour after dissociation and reassociation in the pH-stabilizing buffer, containing 20\u00a0mM CaCl2.

In our study, the effects of the ecdysone agonist RH-5849 and second messengers, dibutyryl cyclic 3\u2032, 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) and dibutyryl cyclic 3\u2032, 5\u2032 guanosine monophosphate (dibutyryl cGMP), either alone or combined with other additives, on midgut E20M were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Pre-incubation of midguts with dibutyryl cAMP was ineffective, but dibutyryl cGMP elevated E20M activity. In vivo, the 50-fold increase in E20M activity was diminished by injections of guanylate cyclase inhibitors alone or combined with RH-5849. Guanylate cyclase inhibitor effects were significantly diminished when co-injected with dibutyryl cGMP, or a guanylate cyclase activator. Although dibutyryl cGMP injections into head- or thorax-ligated pre-wandering larvae did not elevate midgut E20M activity, they did synergize when co-injected with a suboptimal dose of RH-5849, thereby eliciting significant activity increases. Radioimmunoassays of midgut cGMP content throughout the M. sexta fifth larval instar revealed that levels of cGMP significantly increased between days four and five consistent with the 50-fold E20M activity increase. These data indicate cGMP involvement in the ecdysone-mediated increase in midgut E20M activity.",

Sparus aurata semen contained enzyme systems to metabolize sugars and lipids. Also key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enzymes involved in ATP metabolism were detected. When spermatozoa were incubated in sperm motility inhibiting saline solution for 48\u00a0h phospholipid levels decreased constantly and triglycerides levels during the first 24\u00a0h of incubation indicating that spermatozoa utilize lipids as energy resources. After 24\u00a0h triglycerides levels started to re-increase indicating a change in sperm metabolism, in particular the onset of triglycerides synthesis by the fatty acid synthase complex. In the incubation period from 0 to 24\u00a0h glucose levels were constant, and decreased thereafter. Glycogen levels did not change at all. Semen contained also considerable amounts of sialic acid, glucuronic acid and hexosamines, components of mucopolysaccharides. To find out whether lipids, carbohydrates, and related metabolites had a positive effect on sperm functionality semen was incubated together with the described compounds in sperm motility inhibiting saline solution and motility when activated was determined. In the control 37.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1% of the spermatozoa were locally motile and 38.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.3% motile after 24\u00a0h, 36.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2% were locally motile and 9.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5% were motile after 48\u00a0h.

Different types of lipids (arachidic acid, linoleic acid, and glycerol trimyristate) and metabolites acting as fuel for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (hydroxybutyrate, ketoglutarate, and pyruvate) had a positive effect on the sperm viability. Tested carbohydrates (fucose, galactose, glucosamine, glucose, glucoheptose, glycogen, and sialic acid) had no effect. Also lactate and fructose-6-phosphate had no effect on sperm viability while glucose-6-phosphate, oxalacetate, and phosphoglycerate had negative effects.",

Six hours after induction, potassium channel subfamily K member 10 (KCNK10) gene expression in the preadipocytes was found to be 100-fold greater than that at the baseline; this expression declined until day 4 after the induction. Moreover, knockdown of the KCNK10 gene by transfection with short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) significantly decreased triacylglycerol accumulation on day 8 after the induction. An RNA interference study revealed that KCNK10 knockdown inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. These results indicate that KCNK10 plays an important role in the early stages of preadipocyte differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The type II interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RII) cDNA was cloned from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) by mRNA differential display (DD-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA is 1793\u00a0bp in length, including a 100\u00a0bp 5\u2032-terminal untranslated region (UTR), a 430\u00a0bp 3\u2032-terminal UTR, and a 1263\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF). The ORF encodes 420 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 46.65\u00a0kDa. The protein possesses signature features of the IL-R family, consisting of one N-terminal signal peptide, one transmembrane (TM) domain, two Ig-like domains in its extracellular region, one short cytoplasmic tail of 17 amino acids and four conserved proline residue sites. The predicted amino acid sequence has 65.3%, 52.5% and 51.6% identity with gilthead seabream, rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon IL-1RII, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis supported a close relation to mammalian IL-1RII. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that the IL-1RII gene expression of Japanese flounder was weakly up-regulated and reached the peak expression in the kidney, spleen, and gill at 6\u00a0h after infection with Vibrio anguillarum, at 1.9, 2.0 and 1.5 times relative to the uninfected fish, respectively. These results suggest that IL-1RII has a signal transduction function and possibly plays a minor role in immune regulation against bacterial(s) infection in Japanese flounder.",

All subunits of both proteins are glycosylated and appear to be glycoforms with isoelectric points ranging from \u223c\u00a05.3 to \u223c\u00a09.1. Complete deglycosylation reduced subunit heterogeneity to spots of similar molecular weight (\u223c\u00a027 and \u223c\u00a025\u00a0kDa in scalarin and ovorubin, respectively) but with varying IP. Serine phosphorylation, present in both perivitellins, explains part of the isoforms. Glycosylation patterns of scalarin were determined using biotinylated lectins, PNGaseF treatment and selective chemical deglycosylation, which revealed the presence of hybrid and oligomannose N-linked glycans in all subunits. Scalarin has terminal sialic acid residues possibly resistant to neuraminidase and O-linked residues derived from the T- and Tn antigens. Ovorubin displayed predominantly the same glycans, though in different amounts. Capillary gas chromatography (GC) showed galactose and mannose as the major monosaccharides followed by GlcNAc and fucose. An interesting feature was the important amount of sialylated and fucosylated structures found in both perivitellins determined by GC, spectroscopy and lectins.

     "abstract": "Sugarbeet root maggots, Tetanops myopaeformis (Diptera, Ulidiidae), survive more than five years of laboratory cold (6\u00a0\u00b0C) storage as mature third-instar larvae. To quantify energy costs associated with prolonged storage, internal lipids of larvae stored for 1, 2, 3, and 5\u00a0years were compared and characterized with those of field-collected diapausing larvae. Internal lipid concentration was highest (21.8% wet wt. and 29.8% dry wt.) in diapausing larvae. Lipids decreased progressively over storage time with greater than 70% reductions for 5-year stored larvae. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed that triacylglycerols (TAGs) were the most predominant class of internal lipids, with trace amounts of diacylglycerols and hydrocarbons also being present. Gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analyses of TAG fractions identified ten major fatty acids (FAs). The proportion of unsaturated FAs was higher (73 to 78%) than saturated FAs in diapausing and stored larval groups. Palmitoleic acid (16:1) was the predominant FA, constituting 40\u201350% of total unsaturated FAs with lesser amounts of myristoleic (14:1), oleic (18:1), lauroleic (12:1), gadoleic (20:1), and the saturated FAs, palmitic (16:0), myristic (14:0), lauric (12:0), stearic (18:0), and arachidic (20:0) being detected at much lower concentrations. Characterization of intact TAGs by high performance liquid chromatography and GC\u2013MS revealed the presence of more than 40 TAG constituents. In conclusion, TAGs are utilized as an important energy source for T. myopaeformis larvae during diapause and long-term cold storage with no observed impact of multi-year storage on the TAG composition and distribution of their fatty acids.",

To address this adaptation, cysteine proteinases (E.C. 3.4.22), one of the main proteinases in weevils, was purified from an insecticide-susceptible and two insecticide-resistant strains of the maize weevil (one with fitness costs, referred as resistant-cost, and the other without it, referred to as resistant no-cost) using thiol-sepharose affinity chromatography. Purification of the cysteine proteinases revealed a single 74,000\u00a0Da molecular mass band in the susceptible strain, two bands of 72,000 and 83,000\u00a0Da in the resistant cost strain, and two bands of 68,000 and 74,000\u00a0Da in the resistant no-cost strain. Purified cysteine proteinases of the three strains behaved differently regarding casein degradation and inhibition; the proteinases least sensitive to inhibition by the specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 were those from the resistant no-cost strain as indicated by their highest I50 value. The pH and temperature profile of cysteine proteinase activity differed among strains and although substrate affinity (i.e. KM) of the cysteine proteinases was similar, the Vmax value for cysteine-proteinases from the resistant cost strain was 3-fold and 5-fold higher than Vmax values for the resistant no-cost and susceptible strains respectively. Cysteine proteinase activity was highest for the resistant cost strain rather than the resistant no-cost. Therefore enhanced cysteine proteinase activity is unlikely to be playing significant role in mitigating the costs usually associated with insecticide resistance.",

In order to determine the molecular mechanism of endosulfan as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC), differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) was used to isolate genes in the shrimp, Pandalopsis japonica, affected by endosulfan exposure. PCR screening of cDNA from the hepatopancreas from control and endosulfan-exposed animals, using 120 sets of random primers, yielded partial cDNAs encoding two vitellogenin-like proteins (Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2). Complete sequences were obtained using a combination of RT-PCR and RACE-PCR. Pj-Vg1 (7883\u00a0bp) encoded a protein composed of 2533 amino acid residues (283.27\u00a0kDa estimated mass), whereas Pj-Vg2 (7792\u00a0bp) encoded a protein composed of 2537 amino acids residues (284.87\u00a0kDa estimated mass). Alignment of the Pj-Vgs with those of other vitellogenins identified a conserved subtilisin cleavage site (RQKR) and the lipoprotein N-terminal (vitellin), DUF1081, and von Willebrand factor type D domains, indicating both genes encoded functional proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2 were most similar to Pandalus hypsinotus Vg. Both Pj-Vg1 and -Vg2 were expressed primarily in the hepatopancreas, although the Pj-Vg2 transcript was also detected in the ovary. The effects of the 3-day endosulfan exposure (2.5\u00a0\u00b5g/L and 25\u00a0\u00b5g/L) on Vg expression in the hepatopancreas were determined by quantitative RT-PCR.

     "abstract": "Storage of retinal has been confirmed in eggs from a range of anamniotic vertebrates (teleosts and amphibians) and an ascidian, but the retinoid-storage state in eggs of oviparous amniotic vertebrates (reptiles and birds) has yet to be clarified in detail. We studied four reptilian and five avian species and found that retinal was commonly stored in their egg yolk. Furthermore, retinal was the major retinoid in reptilian eggs, with only low levels of retinol, whereas significant amounts of retinol as well as retinal were stored in avian eggs. In both reptilian and avian eggs, retinal was commonly bound to proteins, which were assumed to be homologous to the proteins that bind retinal in the eggs of anamniotic vertebrates. Despite the common storage state of retinal, retinol would be bound to different proteins. In the reptilian eggs, retinol was found in the yolk-granule fraction, which also contained retinal. However, retinol in avian eggs was found largely in the yolk-plasma fraction, separate from retinal. These results suggest that retinol storage in avian eggs acquired after the divergence of birds from the reptiles, while retinal storage was acquired before the appearance of the vertebrates, and has subsequently been conserved during evolution of oviparous vertebrates.",

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proven to be one of the most important humoral components that afford resistance to pathogen infection. The AMP gene to be identified was that encoding theromacin in the triangle-shell pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii (Hc theromacin); this gene was identified from a suppression subtractive hybridization library, and subsequently cloned by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The full-length theromacin cDNA contains 547\u00a0bp, with a 294-bp open reading frame that encodes a 97-amino acid peptide, and the deduced peptide sequence contains a 61-amino acid putative mature peptide. The sequence also contains 10 cysteine residues. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that Hc theromacin transcripts were constitutively expressed in the liver, foot, gill, adductor muscle, heart, mantle, intestine, and hemocytes, with the highest level in hemocytes. Theromacin mRNA levels were found to increase after challenge with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. After injection of the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, Hc theromacin expression showed the highest fold-change at 48 and 36\u00a0h after infection, respectively, and its levels decreased gradually thereafter.",

In contrast to mammalian, there are only limited data concerning avian acrosin, mostly focused on the characterization of mature enzyme. In the present study, acrosin was isolated from turkey spermatozoa using gel filtration in the presence of 4\u00a0M urea at acidic pH. N-terminal Edman sequencing allowed the identification of the first 26 N-terminal amino acids: VVGGTEALHG SWPWIVSIQNPRFAGT. This sequence was used to construct primers and obtain a cDNA sequence from the testis. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows that turkey acrosin is initially synthesized as prepro-protein with 19-residue signal peptide. This signal sequence is followed by a 327-residue sequence corresponding to the acrosin zymogen. Turkey proacrosin does not contain a proline-rich segment at the C-terminal portion. Mature turkey acrosin is a two-chain molecule consisting of light and heavy chains and was found to be glycoprotein. The proacrosin/acrosin system exists in turkey spermatozoa and this system can be activated similarly to that of mammals. The high value of association constant strongly suggests that acrosin activity in turkeys can be controlled by a seminal plasma Kazal inhibitor under physiological conditions.",

The optimal temperature of AkMan was 55\u00a0\u00b0C at pH 7.0 and temperature that caused 50% inactivation of AkMan during a 20-min incubation was 52\u00a0\u00b0C.

In this study, the total substitution of a fish meal and fish oil by a blend of vegetable meals (corn, soybean, wheat and lupin) and linseed oil in the diet of European sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax) was investigated. Two groups of European sea bass were fed with fish diet (FD) or vegetable diet (VD) for 9\u00a0months. VD, totally deprived of eicosapentaenoate (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoate (DHA; 22:6n-3), revealed a nutritional deficiency and affected growth performance. Whilst VD induced a significant increase in fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) and sterol binding regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) mRNA levels, the desaturation rate of [1-14C]18:3n-3 into [1-14C]18:4n-3, analysed in microsomal preparations using HPLC method, did not show an upregulation of FADS2 activities in liver and intestine of fish fed VD. Moreover Western-blot analysis did not revealed any significant difference of FADS2 protein amount between the two dietary groups.These data demonstrate that sea bass exhibits a desaturase (FADS2) activity whatever their diet, but a post-transcriptional regulation of fads2 RNA prevents an increase of enzyme in fish fed a HUFA-free diet. This led to a lower fish growth and poor muscle HUFA content.",

In mammals, Prx 4 proteins have an N-terminal signal peptide which targets them for secretion from the cell. This has not been investigated in fish. Thus, here we describe the cloning of a Prx 4 cDNA from yellowtail kingfish (YTK, Seriola lalandi) and the elucidation of the signal peptide cleavage site. The YTK Prx 4 cDNA included a 792\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a predicted protein of 264 amino acids (referred to as Prx264). SignalP software and a multiple sequence alignment predicted signal peptide cleavage sites after residues 33 and 67 giving rise to Prx231 and Prx197, respectively. All three proteins were expressed in E. coli and assayed for thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activity. Prx231 and Prx197 both exhibited activity whereas Prx264 did not. Thus, either potential cleavage site may be physiologically relevant. Both active forms of the enzyme displayed a single-displacement reaction mechanism and typical saturable Michaelis\u2013Menten type kinetics. This is unusual for Prx enzymes. In addition, they both displayed a clear preference for H2O2 over cumene hydroperoxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide.",

The recombinant SalG has a melting temperature (Tm) of 36.8\u00a0\u00b0C under thermal denaturation conditions and regains activity after returning to permissive (low) temperature. Furthermore, refolding is dramatically reduced in solutions with high SalG concentrations, coupled with significant protein precipitation. The structural features of SalG closely resemble those of other g-type lysozymes. However, the N-terminal region of SalG is less anchored to the rest of the molecule due to the absence of disulphide bonds, thus, contributing significantly to the low Tm of SalG. The absence of disulphide bonds and the distribution of salt bridges may at the same time ease refolding leading to renaturation.",

In the present study, we cloned the exact fragment that code for this truncated variant and demonstrated its growth promoting activity in goldfish when it's administered by immersion bath. Furthermore, a better characterization of this polypeptide was performed. Administration of the polypeptide derived from tiGH increased superoxide anion production and has a mitogenic effect on peripheral blood leukocytes. This molecule binds to liver membranes proteins in vitro in a saturable manner. Beside, we cloned and expressed tiGH and its truncated variant in mammalian cells using the signal peptide of this hormone and we observed that the secretion was drastically reduced in the truncated tiGH as compared to the intact molecule. Truncated tilapia growth hormone lacking the helix 4 and two disulfide loops is still a bioactive hormone, suggesting that the disulfide bonds and the helix 4 are not essential for the biological activities examined in this work.

Although many aspects of host\u2013parasitoid interactions have been explored, studies that attempted to assess the effects of parasitism on the availability of inorganic elements in the host are virtually nonexistent. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of parasitism on the concentrations of inorganic elements in the fat bodies of larvae of Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) during the development of the parasitoid Cotesia flavipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), by using total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF). TXRF analysis allowed comparisons of the changes in the availability of the elements P, S, K, Ca, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn in the fat body tissues of D. saccharalis larvae parasitized by C. flavipes. Overall, the concentration of inorganic elements was higher early in parasitoid development (1 and 3\u00a0days after parasitism) compared to non-parasitized larvae, but much lower towards the end of parasitoid development (7 and 9\u00a0days after parasitism). Ca, K, and S were reduced after the fifth day of parasitism, which affected the total abundance of inorganic elements observed in the fat bodies of the parasitized hosts. The regulatory mechanisms or pathological effects related to the observed variation of the host inorganic elements induced by the parasitoid remain unknown, but there might be a strategy to make these elements available to the parasitoid larvae at the end of their development, when higher metabolic activity of the host fat body is required to sustain parasitoid growth. The observed variation of the host's inorganic elements could also be related to the known effects of parasitism on the host's immune response.",

Associated with this disease are pro-apoptotic tumor-suppressor protein p53 isoforms, which are highly conserved between molluscs and vertebrates. The vertebrate wildtype p53 protein is maintained at low levels by the MDM2 protein in non-stressed cells to prevent undesired apoptosis. Identification of a putative invertebrate MDM-like homolog suggests early evolution of this mechanism of p53 regulation. The M. trossulus MDM homolog consists of a conserved NH2-terminal p53 binding domain, an acidic domain with highly conserved phosphorylation sites, and a highly conserved C-terminal RING-finger Zn-binding domain. Although BLAST queries predict this homologue to be more similar to vertebrate MDM2 than to MDM4, phylogenetic analysis suggests that it may be an ancestral form to both vertebrate MDM genes. Using yeast-two-hybrid assays and pull-down assays, we show that this molluscan MDM is able to bind to its p53 counterpart. We also show that MDM expression levels are directly correlated with p53 expression levels in healthy and in neoplastic haemocytes, but not with other p53 isoforms or with the proto-oncogene RAS. The combination of expression levels of five gene transcripts (p53, mdm, ras, \u2206Np63/73, and TAp63/73) is significantly correlated with late-stage haemic neoplasia in M. trossulus.",

     "abstract": "Regulation of oxidative stress (OS) in adipocytes is an important mediator of their development and dysfunction. Highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) play essential roles in marine fish, where they have anti-lipogenic effects, but they are prone to peroxidation. The aim of this study was to investigate how the effects of HUFAs in fish adipocytes are modulated by changes in their intracellular redox status. Adipocytes from Atlantic salmon were cultivated on HUFA-rich media and treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which is known to deplete stores of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) thus increasing OS, and \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-TOC), which protects from OS. Gene expression was assessed by qPCR. In addition, phospholipid composition, total fatty acid (FA) composition, TBARS, the activities of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 (CASP3) and antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined. BSO treatment decreased the expression of genes encoding GSH-based antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 2 and GPX3. Consequently, depletion of GSH resulted in the highest level of peroxidation products TBARS despite the increased activity of SOD in this group. Significant reduction of TBARS was achieved by \u03b1-TOC. Further, in comparison to two \u03b1-TOC supplemented groups, GSH-depleted cells accumulated less fat and their gene expression profile of adipogenic markers was lower. The formation of large intracellular vesicles was prominent in the control and BSO groups while reduction of OS by \u03b1-TOC coincided with the increased gene expression of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a transducer of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response. CASP3 assay showed no difference between groups; however, depletion of GSH resulted in the increased gene expression of several apoptotic markers. Up-regulation of the apoptosis inducible factor (AIF) implied higher probability of CASP3-independent apoptosis in cells under increased OS. In conclusion, the study provides several lines of evidence in favour of anti-adipogenic effects of OS in a cold blooded vertebrate.",

In this study, a cDNA encoding the E75 of Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FcE75) was cloned using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. FcE75 cDNA was 3611\u00a0bp in length with an ORF of 2394\u00a0bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of FcE75 had the highest sequence identity to E75 from a land crab Gecarcinus lateralis and E75 of the shrimp Metapenaeus ensis. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a prominently high expression of FcE75 mRNA in the whole body RNA extract of late premolt period (D3) juvenile shrimp. The role of E75 in the process of shrimp molting was investigated using the RNA interference technique. Long double-stranded RNA corresponding to the FcE75 (dsE75) efficiently silenced the FcE75 transcript levels in juvenile F. chinensis. Further, injection with dsE75 completely arrested the molting process in experimental shrimp which eventually caused death. Setogenic analysis of the uropods from molt-arrested shrimp, showed defective epidermal retraction, poor development of setae and new cuticle. These results indicate that E75 might be related to the molting process and is essential for proper molting and survival of shrimp. This is the first report demonstrating the use of double stranded RNA to elucidate the possible role of E75 in the molting of decapod crustaceans.",

     "abstract": "The signal transduction mechanisms in mollusks are still elusive since the genome information is incomplete and cell lines are not available. In previous study, we cloned a highly conserved Smad3 homolog (designated as Pf-Smad3) from the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. It seems that transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling may play similar roles in the oyster as in vertebrate. Here we report a cDNA encoding an activin like receptor 1 homolog (designated as Pf-ALR1) of the oyster, another kind of TGF\u03b2 superfamily member. Compared to the activin receptor-like kinases (ALK) in human, the amino acid sequence of Pf-ALR1 is more similar to that of ALK1, especially the L45 loop. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results indicate that Pf-ALR1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in the adult oyster. Thus, Pf-ALR1 may be important for many physiological processes in the oyster. To lay a basis for further investigation of the TGF\u03b2 signal pathway functions in the oyster shell formation, in this report, the Pf-ALR1 mRNA expression in the oyster mantle was detected by in situ hybridization. The results show that Pf-ALR1 in the oyster mantle is mainly expressed at the inner epithelial cells of the outer fold and the outer epithelial cells of the middle fold, similarly as Pf-Smad3. The mRNA levels of Pf-ALR1 and Pf-Smad3 are all changed after shell notching. These results indicate that both Pf-ALR1 and Pf-Smad3 may take part in shell formation and repair. The results of drug treatment experiments with in-vitro cultured oyster mantle tissue cells demonstrate that the mRNA expression levels of Pf-Smad3, Pf-ALR1 and two oyster nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-kB) members can be adjusted and correlated. All our observations suggest that there should be similar TGF\u03b2 signal pathways in the oyster and vertebrate. However, the potential functions of Pf-ALR1 and the relations of TGF\u03b2 and NF-kB members in the oyster all need to be thoroughly investigated.",

This process may require spermatid-specific adaptation of cytoskeleton and associated molecular motor proteins. KIFC1 is a C-terminal kinesin motor with important roles in acrosome biogenesis and nuclear reshaping during spermiogenesis in rat. Here, we have cloned and characterized the gene encoding a homologue of rat KIFC1, termed as ot-kifc1, from the testis of O. tankahkeei. The 2229\u00a0bp complete cDNA contains a 75\u00a0bp 5\u2032-untranslated region, a 1992\u00a0bp open reading frame and a 162\u00a0bp 3\u2032-untranslated region.

Tissue expression analysis revealed ot-kifc1 was expressed in testis, gill and hepatopancreas, but not in other tissues examined. In situ hybridization result showed the ot-kifc1 message was hardly detectable in early spermatid, concentrated at the tail region of intermediate spermatid, abundant in spermatid undergoing dramatic elongation and compression, enriched at one end in late spermatids and disappeared in mature sperm. In conclusion, the expression of ot-kifc1 at specific stages of spermiogenesis suggests a role for this motor in major cytological transformations.",

Non-volatile components of uropygial secretions are believed to serve a number of functions including waterproofing and conditioning the feathers. Volatile components have been characterized in fewer species, but are particularly interesting because of their potential importance in olfactory interactions within and across species. We used solid-phase microextraction headspace sampling with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry to detect and identify volatiles in uropygial secretions of gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), a North American migratory bird. We consistently detected the following carboxylic acids: acetic, propanoic, 2-methylpropanoic, butanoic, and 3-methylbutanoic. We tested for the effect of lengthened photoperiod and/or exogenous testosterone on volatile signal strength and found a negative effect of lengthened photoperiod on the signal strength of propanoic, 2-methylpropanoic, and butanoic acids, suggesting a trade-off between their production and heightened night-time activity associated with lengthened photoperiod. Signal strength of propanoic and 2-methylpropanoic acids was lower in birds treated with exogenous testosterone than in birds treated with placebos.

The primary objective of this study was to quantify and identify oxidized serum proteins in fetal and newborn piglets. Protein carbonyls were converted to hydrazones with dinitrophenyl hydrazine and quantified spectrophotometrically. For identification, serum protein carbonyls were derivatized with biotin hydrazide, separated by 2D PAGE and stained with FITC-avidin. Biotin-labeled proteins were excised from gels and identified by mass spectrometry. At birth, carbonyls were determined to be \u223c\u00a0600\u00a0pmole/mg serum protein. Fetuses at 50 and 100\u00a0days of gestation had similar levels of protein carbonyls as newborns. Carbonyl levels were also similar for control and runt (<\u00a01\u00a0kg at birth) piglets between 1 and 21\u00a0days of age; however, distribution of many proteins varied by age and was also influenced by birth weight. Major oxidized proteins identified in fetal (f) and newborn (n) pigs included; albumin (f, n), transferrin (f, n), fetuin-A (f, n) alpha fetoprotein (f, n), plasminogen (f, n), fetuin-B (f), alpha-1-antitrypsin (f, n) alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (f) and immunoglobulins (n).

Molecular studies of dmrt1 were initiated to gain knowledge about the regulation of gonad development for the first time in a species of the superorder Paracanthopterygii. The predicted cod Dmrt1 of 310 amino acids contains a highly conserved DM domain, including six Cys residues probably involved in the formation of a double zinc-finger motif for DNA binding. The tissue expression analysis revealed that dmrt1 is expressed exclusively in the gonads, and the signal was localized in the germ cells in both genders by in situ hybridization. Sexually dimorphic expression of dmrt1 was documented by quantitative PCR with the highest mRNA levels in immature males corresponding to the start of spermatogenesis. Although significantly less expressed in the ovary, Dmrt1 might also play a role in oogenesis. Southern blot analysis revealed several DM domain-containing genes in the cod genome, but no sex-linked polymorphism was shown.",

Its average molecular weight (Mw) and sulfate content were 39\u00a0kDa and 25% w/w, respectively. This DS prolonged thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and inhibited the thrombin generation in a concentration-dependent manner whereas it had no effect on the anti-Xa assay and on platelet function. Data from the anti-IIa assay allowed the assessment of the specific anticoagulant activity which was 40\u00a0units/mg. The kinetics of the thrombin inhibition by heparin cofactor II (HCII) has been studied as a function of DS concentration according to a kinetic model in which the polysaccharide binds quickly to the inhibitor and forms a complex more reactive than the free inhibitor towards thrombin. This DS accelerated thrombin inhibition exclusively by HCII. The dissociation constant of the DS\u2013HCII complex, KDSHCII, and the rate constant of the thrombin inhibition by this complex, k, were (2.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M and (2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01, respectively.Our findings indicated that the major polysaccharide in the skin of the ray Raja montagui was a DS endowed with a high anticoagulant effect mediated by HCII and which may constitute an anticoagulant drug of interest in anticoagulant therapy.",

Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis indicated that SmFerM expression was highest in muscle and lowest in heart and responded positively to experimental challenges with bacterial pathogens and poly(I:C). Exposure of cultured turbot hepatocytes to treatment of stress inducers (iron, copper, and H2O2) significantly upregulated the expression of SmFerM in a dose dependent manner.

From the Penaeus monodon EST database, cDNA contigs and singletons for three chitinases, namely PmChi1, 2 and 3, were identified. The complete sequences for the mature PmChi1, 3 and partial PmChi2 were amplified and cloned. The reading frames of PmChi1 and 3 encoded mature proteins of 644 and 468 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 72.4 and 51.9\u00a0kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequence comparison among the penaeid chitinases revealed homology around 90%. Therefore, they were grouped together along with those of other crustaceans and insects into three groups separated from those of mammals. PmChi1, 2 and 3 were expressed mainly in hepatopancreas, gill and hepatopancreas, respectively, though small amounts were expressed in other tissues. After molting, only the expression of PmChi2 was down-regulated, while the expression of PmChi1 and 3 was relatively unchanged. The results suggested that the PmChi2 was likely involved in molting while the others might function in the digestion of chitinous foods.

Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a Prx 2 cDNA from southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii), an important aquaculture species in South Australia. The SBT Prx sequence was closely related (76\u201392% identical) to Prx 1 and 2 sequences from other fish and mammals and phylogenetic analyses showed that it was most likely a Prx 2. The deduced amino acid sequence contained the peroxidatic and resolving Cys residues characteristic of typical 2-Cys Prx proteins from all kingdoms of life. It also contained the GGLG motif associated with the sensitivity of eukaryotic typical 2-Cys Prx proteins to overoxidation and consequent inactivation by H2O2. When the SBT Prx 2 was expressed in E. coli, it showed thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent peroxidase activity with H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bOOH). The SBT Prx displayed Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics with Trx but sigmoidal kinetics with H2O2 and CuOOH.

     "abstract": "Sea lice are copepod ectoparasites that constitute a major barrier to the sustainability and economic viability of marine finfish aquaculture operations worldwide. In particular, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, poses a considerable problem for salmoniculture in the northern hemisphere. The free-swimming nauplii and infective copepodids of L. salmonis are lecithotrophic, subsisting principally on maternally-derived lipid reserves. However, the lipids and fatty acids of sea lice have been sparsely studied and therefore the present project aimed to investigate the lipid and fatty acid composition of sea lice of the genus Lepeophtheirus obtained from a variety of fish hosts. Total lipid was extracted from eggs and adult female L. salmonis obtained from both wild and farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) sampled at two time points, in the mid 1990s and in 2009. In addition, L. salmonis from wild sea trout (Salmo trutta L.) and L. hippoglossi from wild Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) were sampled and analyzed. The lipids of both females and egg strings of Lepeophtheirus were characterized by triacylglycerol (TAG) as the major neutral (storage) lipid with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine as the major polar (membrane) lipids. The major fatty acids were 22:6n\u22123 (DHA), 18:1n\u22129 and 16:0, with lesser amounts of 20:5n\u22123, 22:5n\u22123 and 18:0. L. salmonis sourced from farmed salmon was characterized by higher levels of 18:2n\u22126 and 18:3n\u22123 than lice from wild salmon. Egg strings had higher levels of TAG and lower DHA compared to females, whereas L. hippoglossi had lower levels of TAG and higher DHA than L. salmonis. The results demonstrate that the fatty acid compositions of lice obtained from wild and farmed salmon differ and that changes to the lipid and fatty acid composition of feeds for farmed salmon influence the louse compositions.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in all aerobic organisms, potentially leading to oxidative damage of all biological molecules. A number of defence mechanisms have developed to protect the organism from attack by ROS. Desiccation tolerance is correlated with an increase in the antioxidant potential in several organisms, but the regulation of the antioxidant defence system is complex and its role in desiccation-tolerant organisms is not yet firmly established. To determine if anhydrobiotic tardigrades have an antioxidant defence system, capable of counteracting ROS, we compared the activity of several antioxidant enzymes, the fatty acid composition and Heat shock protein expression in two physiological states (desiccated vs. hydrated) of the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus richtersi. In hydrated tardigrades, superoxide dismutase and catalase show comparable activities, while in desiccated specimens the activity of superoxide dismutase increases. Both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione were induced by desiccation. The percentage of fatty acid composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances are higher in desiccated animals than in hydrated ones. Lastly, desiccated tardigrades did not differ significantly from the hydrated ones in the relative levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90. These results indicate that the possession of antioxidant metabolism could represent a crucial strategy to avoid damages during desiccation in anhydrobiotic tardigrades.",

A total of 84 (40 males and 44 females) newly hatched bearded dragons were allocated to six levels of oral vitamin D3 supplementation (0 to 400%) or six UVb exposure times (2 to 12\u00a0h). At 3 and 6\u00a0months of age, blood samples were obtained from each animal and analysed for 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3. At 3\u00a0months of age, plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D3 did not increase with increasing vitamin D3 supplementation unlike the 1,25(OH)2D3. At 6\u00a0months of age, plasma concentrations of both 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 increased with increasing vitamin D3 supplementation. Plasma concentrations in UVb-exposed animals were 18 times higher for 25(OH)D3 (178.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0 vs. 9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0nmol/L) and 5.3 times higher for 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.205\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.100 vs. 0.229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.025\u00a0nmol/L) than in vitamin D3 supplemented animals at 6\u00a0months of age. This study shows that 2\u00a0h of UVb exposure enables adequate physiological concentrations of plasma vitamin D metabolites to be maintained in growing bearded dragons. Oral supplementation of vitamin D3 is ineffective in raising plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to concentrations observed in UVb-exposed animals.",

     "abstract": "Physiological processes of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, larvae parasitized by Cotesia plutellae are altered by several parasitic factors including a polydnavirus, C. plutellae bracovirus (CpBV). Two homologous genes, CpBV15\u03b1 and CpBV15\u03b2, have been proposed as host translation inhibitory factors (HTIFs). This study analyzed their effects on host gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. A proteomic approach using two dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the parasitization resulted in 24.0% (60/250 spots) reduction of gene expression compared to nonparasitized control. It also indicated that the transient expression of CpBV15\u03b1 or CpBV15\u03b2 in nonparasitized larvae resulted in 26.0% (65/240 spots) or 28.0% (70/240 spots) reduction, respectively. Seven spots that were not detected in the transiently expressed samples were further analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometry. These proteins were predicted to be associated with host cell signaling and metabolism. To investigate translation inhibitory effects of CpBV15\u03b1 and CpBV15\u03b2, capped mRNA of a storage protein 1 (SP1) of P. xylostella, a common inhibitory target of both HTIFs, was prepared by in vitro transcription and translated in vitro in the presence or absence of recombinant HTIFs prepared from Sf9 cells by recombinant baculoviruses. Translation of SP1 mRNA containing 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) was inhibited by both HTIFs. However, translation of SP1 mRNA without 5\u2032-UTR was insensitive to the exposure of both HTIFs. Both HTIFs inhibited the host gene translation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, these two factors showed cooperative inhibition. This study suggests that CpBV15\u03b1 and CpBV15\u03b2 inhibit host mRNAs directly by acting on translation machinery, in which 5\u2032-UTR of target mRNAs would be required for the inhibitory action.",

     "abstract": "Creatine kinase and arginine kinase are the typical representatives of an eight-member phosphagen kinase family, which play important roles in the cellular energy metabolism of animals. The phylum Annelida underwent a series of evolutionary processes that resulted in rapid divergence and radiation of these enzymes, producing the greatest diversity of the phosphagen kinases within this phylum. Lombricine kinase (EC 2.7.3.5) is one of such enzymes and sequence information is rather limited compared to other phosphagen kinases. This study presents data on the cDNA sequences of lombricine kinase from two oligochaete species, the California blackworm (Lumbriculus variegatus) and the sludge worm (Tubifex tubifex). The deduced amino acid sequences are analyzed and compared with other selected phosphagen kinases, including two additional lombricine kinase sequences extracted from DNA databases and provide further insights in the evolution and position of these enzymes within the phosphagen kinase family. The data confirms the presence of a deleted region within the flexible loop (the GS region) of all six examined lombricine kinases. A phylogenetic analysis of these six lombricine kinases clearly positions the enzymes together in a small subcluster within the larger creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) clade.",

In this study we sampled blood chemistry of 342 white stork Ciconia ciconia chicks from nests in western Poland during four years (2005\u20132008). Special attention was paid to the effect of chick age and sex on blood biochemistry. Since white stork is a monomorphic species, the sex of chicks was established by a molecular technique. Nine blood biochemical parameters were studied: total protein concentration, urea, uric acid, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). There were sexual differences in total protein, uric acid, cholesterol, HDL and AST. However, total protein and uric acid only differed significantly between sexes if an age effect was included as a covariate in the analysis. Triglycerides decreased significantly, and AST, increased significantly with chick age.We confirm that blood biochemistry varies with chick age, but we also found significant differences between the sexes. Therefore, to understand changes in blood parameters, and to establish reference ranges useful in captive rearing of this endangered species, establishing gender may be important, even in very young individuals.",

The mutation, Trp251-Ser appeared to play a role in beta-cypermethrin resistance and cross-resistance between organophosphates (OPs) and pyrethroids in the CRR strain. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that Md\u03b1E7 was over-expressed in the CRR strain, the reciprocal cross progeny F1 and back-cross progeny BC2 compared with the CSS strain, respectively. Two \u03b1-cynaoester substrates as surrogates for beta-cypermethrin and deltamethrin, were synthesized to determine the pyrethroid hydrolase activity. Results showed that carboxylesterases from the CRR strain hydrolyzed cypermethrin/deltamethrin-like substrate 9.05- and 13.53-fold more efficiently than those from the CSS strain, respectively.

Based on comparative sequence analysis and in silico sequence merging of predicted gene models, a new full-length gene model for the bovine CCDC3 gene was predicted and confirmed experimentally. The CCDC3 gene was assigned to bovine chromosome 13. It consists of three exons comprising 2599\u00a0bp encoding for a respective protein of 274 amino acids. The strong CCDC3 sequence homology on amino acid level between species suggests a conserved universal function of this protein. In mice, the CCDC3 gene had been found to be highly expressed in adipocytes and regulated by hormonal-nutritional alternations and in obesity. The tissue expression pattern of bovine CCDC3 mRNA indicates a ubiquitous physiological function of the gene. Significant differences in CCDC3 mRNA expression in skeletal muscle between individuals characterized by divergent intramuscular fat deposition support the potential function of the gene in fat or energy metabolism, which possibly could also be inferred for other mammalian species.

Treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F indicated that N-glycosylation was predominant. CmCatB contains three N-glycosylation Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequences. Simultaneously replacing all three Asn residues with Gln via site-directed mutagenesis did not result in completely unglycosylated protein, suggesting the existence of additional atypical glycosylation sites. We subsequently investigated potential N-glycosylation at the two Asn-X-Cys sites (Asn100 and Asn236) in CmCatB. Asn to Gln substitution at Asn100-X-Cys on the background of the double mutation at the canonical sites (m1m2, Asn97\u2192Gln and Asn207\u2192Gln) resulted in a single discrete band on the gel, namely m1m2c1 (Asn97\u2192Gln, Asn207\u2192Gln and Asn100\u2192Gln).

The full-length cDNA of VpLYZ consisted of 805 nucleotides with a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a polyA tail, and an open-reading frame of 558\u00a0bp encoding a polypeptide of 185 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 20.87\u00a0kD and theoretical pI of 8.44.

By semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, mRNA transcript of VpLYZ was found to be most abundantly expressed in the tissues of gills, hepatopancreas and haemocytes, weakly expressed in the tissues of muscle, foot and mantle. After clams were challenged by Vibrio anguillarum, the mRNA level of VpLYZ in overall haemocyte population was recorded by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. VpLYZ mRNA was down-regulated sharply from 6\u00a0h to 12\u00a0h post-infection. Then, the expression level increased to the peak at 72\u00a0h and recovered to the original level at 96\u00a0h.

We hypothesized differences in diet and trophic level among populations and that these differences would predict the expression of the morphological and biochemical features of the digestive tract. More specifically, we predicted shorter intestines and higher levels of peptidases in more insectivorous than in more frugivorous/herbivorous lizards. The diet of L. pictus was characterized by the consumption of a wide diversity of food types, including fruit and insects, in all populations. Stable isotopes revealed higher trophic level, and hence probably higher protein intake, in mainland than in island populations, but contrary to our prediction, they had shorter intestines and higher relative activity of intestinal peptidases than mainland lizards. Furthermore, the proportion of fruit items in the stomach content was higher in the population that exhibited the lowest tropic level. These results suggest that morphological and physiological differences among populations of L. pictus are not correlated with feeding ecology, suggesting that the lizard's first responses to the selective pressure represented by a diet shift are behavioral.",

     "abstract": "Fever is an adaptive physiological response that animals use to fight infections by microorganisms. Although used routinely by veterinary and medical doctors for assessment of health status, there are hardly any studies of fever in free-living animals. Body temperature in a sample of more than 500 adult barn swallows Hirundo rustica varied considerably, but was consistent among capture events. Body temperature increased during the day, and reached a minimum in the middle of the breeding season. A normal quantile plot revealed that 4.5% of adults constituted a separate population that had fever. There were only marginal effects of handling on body temperature. Body temperature increased by 2.6 standard deviations following injection with LPS, showing that body temperature indeed increased with an immune challenge. Body temperature was negatively related to abundance of feather mites, but was not related to abundance of other ectoparasites or size of the uropygial gland. Barn swallows with high body temperatures also had large body mass and showed weak stress responses as reflected by their tonic immobility. Barn swallows in large colonies had lower body temperatures than solitary or less colonial individuals. Body temperature was not related to arrival date, timing of breeding, annual fecundity or adult survival. However, individuals that were easier to catch had higher body temperatures. These findings suggest that body temperature is a consistent physiological parameter of individuals, a small fraction of individuals has fever, and that febrile individuals have specific parasite loads, body mass, social environment and ability to escape capture.",

After 12\u00a0months of feeding, plant diet-fed fish had smaller lenses with higher water contents and lower concentrations of histidine (His) and N-acetylhistidine (NAH) than fish fed with the marine diet. Cataract development in both dietary groups was minimal and no differences between the groups were observed. Lens fatty acid and lipid class composition differed minimally, although a significant increase in linoleic acid was observed. The lenses were examined for their ability to withstand osmotic disturbances ex vivo. Culture in hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic media led to increase and decrease of lens volume, respectively. Lenses from plant diet-fed fish were less resistant to swelling and shrinking, released less NAH into the culture medium, and accumulated His and NAH at higher rates than lenses from marine diet-fed fish. Culture in hypoosmotic medium resulted in higher cataract scores than in control and hyperosmotic medium. mRNA expression of selected genes, including glutathione peroxidase 4 and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), was affected by diet and osmotic treatment. It can be concluded that lenses of farmed Atlantic salmon are affected by the diet composition, both in biochemical composition and physiological functionality in relation to osmoregulation.",

The amount of apoLp-III in the eggs increased from day 2, peaked on day 4, and then gradually decreased until hatching (on day 9.5). ApoLp-III was apparently synthesized during early embryogenesis, as radioactive amino acids were incorporated into newly synthesized apoLp-III in three-day-old eggs. Moreover, radioactive apoLp-III was found only in the embryo and not in the extraembryonic tissue. KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation of egg homogenates showed that apoLp-III was associated with low-density lipophorin (LDLp).

To explore the effects of maternal dietary treatments with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on lipid metabolism in the embryo, we investigated serum lipid profile and hepatic lipid metabolism-related gene expression in the maternal and embryonic chicken. Sixteen-week-old pullets were allocated into 3 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a030), and after laying, they were provided with a commercial diet supplemented with DHEA at 0, 20 or 100\u00a0mg/kg diet. Eggs were collected after DHEA treatment and incubated at 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C and a relative humidity of 60%. Blood and liver samples were collected from hens and embryonic chickens. DHEA treatment resulted in decreased body weight and increased relative liver weight in both maternal and embryonic chickens, while the concentrations of blood triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) were significantly lower in the 20\u00a0mg DHEA/kg group as compared to the control group during embryonic development. The expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPTI) gene was also reduced following treatment with 20\u00a0mg DHEA/kg at hatching. However, blood TC, and hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) and hydroxy methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) gene expression were significantly up-regulated in the 100\u00a0mg DHEA/kg group during embryonic development and hatching.

Further analyses revealed that MdL1 and MdL2 surfaces are less positively charged than HEWL surface. To verify the relevance of these differences to the acidic pH optimum of digestive lysozymes it was determined that pKas of the catalytic residues of the triple mutant MdL2 (N46D\u2013S106V\u2013T107A) are similar to HEWL pKas and higher than those for MdL2. In agreement, triple mutant MdL2 and HEWL exhibits the same pH optimum upon methylumbelliferylchitotrioside. In addition to that, the introduction of six basic residues on MdL1 surface increased by 1\u00a0unit the pH optimum for the activity upon bacterial walls. Thus, the acidic pH optimum for MdL2 and MdL1 activities upon methylumbelliferylchitotrioside is determined by the presence of N46, S106 and T107 in the environment of their catalytic residues, which favors pKas reduction. Conversely, acidic pH optimum upon bacterial walls is determined by a low concentration of positive charges on the MdL2 and MdL1 surfaces.",

The open reading frame consists of 813\u00a0bp encoding 270 amino acids with a putative signal peptide and a typical motif of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 (GHF16), E\u2013I\u2013D\u2013I\u2013T\u2013E.

CaLam digests laminarin and laminarioligosaccharides except laminaribiose as an endo-\u03b2-1,3-glucanase, releasing glucose, laminaribiose and laminaritriose as the major products. Analyses of molecular phylogeny of CaLam and its protein structure reveal that CaLam is closely related with bacterial \u03b2-1,3-glucanases more than with the eukaryotic homologues. Even so, the genomic structure of the CaLam gene consisting of six exons interspersed with approximately 57 to 63\u00a0bp introns confirms that it is endogenous in the genome of the Antarctic springtail.

Molecular analysis showed the presence of (GA)n, poly-A and GPGXX motifs in the amino acid sequence of Spidroin 2, the last being a motif described so far only in MaSp2 and Flag spidroins. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the previously known orthologous silk gene clusters, and placed this gene firmly within the orbicularian MaSp2 clade.

Therefore, while not refuting orb weaver monophyly, MaSp2s, and major ampullate silks in general cannot be classified as orbicularian synapomorphies, but have to be considered plesiomorphic for Opisthothelae. The evidence presented here challenges the simplified notion that mygalomorphs spin only one kind of silk, and adds to the suite of information suggesting a pattern of early niche diversification between Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae.

As muscle performance underlies both foraging ability and predator avoidance, any age-related decline should be detrimental to fitness and survival. Muscle samples of water shrews (Sorex palustris) and sympatrically distributed short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were therefore assessed for oxidative stress markers, protective antioxidant enzymes and apoptosis. Activity levels of catalase and glutathione peroxidase increased with age in both species. Similarly, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase isoform content was elevated significantly in older animals of both species (increases of 60% in the water shrew, 25% in the short-tailed shrew). Only one oxidative stress marker (lipid peroxidation) was age-elevated; the others were stable or declined (4-hydroxynonenal adducts and dihydroethidium oxidation). Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly higher in the short-tailed shrew, while catalase activity was 2\u00d7 higher in water shrews. Oxidative stress indicators were on average higher in short-tailed shrews. Apoptosis occurred in <\u00a01% of myocytes examined, and did not increase with age.

The mature HE was composed of an astacin protease domain of 200 amino acids and a CUB domain of 121 amino acids, and the estimated molecular size was 35,311. The protease domain contained two active site consensus sequences, HExxHxxGFxHExxRxDR and MHY. An immunoblotting test of an extract of allanto-chorions revealed a 40-kDa band by cross-reaction with the anti-Xenopus HE antiserum. The first change in the envelopes was the appearance of a hole, 1\u00a0mm in diameter, at the location around the animal pole of day 8 incubation eggs. A cluster of tall cells, forming a circle in the avascular chorion of day 8 embryos and facing the edge of the hole, had various sizes of inclusion bodies and secretory granules that were labeled by immuno-electron microscopic staining with the antiserum. The egg envelopes were degraded gradually from the animal pole side towards the vegetal pole side in accordance with translocation of the avascular site of the chorion in the same direction. Labeled cells degenerated, presumably when the chorion was underlain by allantois in succeeding developmental stages. The vitelline membrane and egg white were totally digested, presumably by secreted HE, during the hatching period and were consumed for embryonic growth.",

We measured protein carbonyls, 20S proteosome activity and glutathione (GSH) levels in farmed Salmo trutta in four different age groups from 5\u00a0months to 3\u00a0years. We found an increase in protein carbonyls and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in both brain and liver tissues of the fish with increasing size and age. Total GSH levels in liver tissue declined as fish aged and the GSSG:GSH ratio increased. Five month and 1\u00a0year old trout were treated with paraquat (PQ) to induce oxidative stress. Five month old fish showed no changes in the measured parameters while 1\u00a0year old fish had both an increase in protein carbonylation in liver tissue and a decrease in 20S proteosome activity in brain tissue.

Located in zebrafish chromosome 2, it is composed of 11 encoding exons and shows high sequence similarity to other Dab1 genes, including drDab1a, a zebrafish Dab1 gene previously characterised. drDab1b encodes by alternative splicing at least five different isoforms. Both drDab1a and drDab1b show differential gene expression levels in distinct adult tissues and during development. drDab1b is expressed in peripheral tissues (gills, heart, intestine, muscle), the immune system (blood, liver) and the central nervous system (CNS), whereas drDab1a is only expressed in gills, muscle and the CNS, suggesting a division of functions for two Dab1 genes in zebrafish adult tissues. RT-PCR analysis also reveals that both drDab1 genes show distinct developmental-specific expression patterns throughout development. drDab1b expression was higher than that of drDab1a, suggesting a major role of drDab1b in comparison with drDab1a during development and in different adult tissues. In addition, new putative Dab1 (a and/or b) from different teleost species were identified in silico and predicted protein products are compared with the previously characterised Dab1, demonstrating that the Dab1b group is more ancestral than their paralogue, the Dab1a group.",

Since the NTPDase family in zebrafish is poorly understood, here we evaluated the nucleotide hydrolysis in three tissues of adult zebrafish (brain, liver, and heart), confirmed the presence of distinct NTPDase members by a phylogenetic analysis and verified their relative gene expression profiles in the respective tissues. A different profile of ATP and ADP hydrolysis in the brain, liver, and heart as a function of time and protein concentration was observed. Sodium azide (20\u00a0mM), ARL 67156 (300\u00a0\u03bcM) and Suramin (300\u00a0\u03bcM) differently altered the nucleotide hydrolysis in zebrafish tissues, suggesting the contribution of distinct NTPDase activities. Homology-based searches identified the presence of NTPDase1-6 and NTPDase8 orthologs and the phylogeny also grouped three NTPDase2 and two NTPDase5 paralogs. The deduced amino acid sequences share the apyrase conserved regions, conserved cysteine residues, putative N-glycosylation, phosphorylation, N-acetylation sites, and different numbers of transmembrane domains. RT-PCR experiments revealed the existence of a distinct relative entpd1-6 and entpd8 expression profile in brain, liver, and heart. Taken together, these results indicate that several NTPDase members might contribute to a tight regulation of nucleotide hydrolysis in zebrafish tissues.",

The responses of the defense-associated genes at 3 and 24\u00a0h post-incubation (hpi) were assayed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Live and heat-inactivated GP21 caused a significant increase in the transcript levels of bacterial defense genes in the HK leukocytes: BPI/LBP and g-type lysozyme were highest at 24\u00a0hpi. The levels of BPI/LBP were significantly upregulated at 24\u00a0hpi by live GP12 but not by the heat-inactivated type. The expression of g-type lysozyme was significantly elevated regardless of the type of GP12. IL-1\u03b2 was significantly upregulated by live GP21 and GP12, with maximum expression observed at 3\u00a0hpi. In contrast, the expression levels of IL-8 in the HK leukocytes were not augmented by both types of GP21 and GP12. A significant upregulation of the non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein-1 (NCCRP-1) was observed with live GP12 at 3\u00a0hpi, whereas in the case of GP21 such a change was noted only with the heat-inactivated type at 24\u00a0hpi. A definite pattern of granzyme expression was not observed with both the live and heat-inactivated GP21 and GP12. The levels of antioxidant genes (catalase and GSH-Px) remained unchanged except in cells incubated with heat-inactivated GP21, where a significant elevation of GSH-Px was seen at 24\u00a0hpi. Thus, this in vitro study has revealed that the defense mechanisms in the HK leukocytes can be modulated by the commensal intestinal bacteria of Atlantic cod.

We describe here the presence of two high molecular mass lipovitellin isoforms in Bufo arenarum mature oocytes with masses of 113 and 100\u00a0kDa, respectively. The amino acid sequence analysis of p113 and p100 peptides showed a high sequence homology between both polypeptides and the complete reported sequences of Xenopus laevis vitellogenin. Using specific antibodies, we determined that the Vtg uptake begins early during oogenesis, at the previtellogenic stage, and continues until oocytes have reached their mature status. In addition, we found that large endocytic vesicles mediate Vtg uptake in stage I oocytes, and that the size of the endocytic vesicles declines with oogenesis progression. In terms of the Vtg protein trafficking, we detected the Vtg precursor (190\u00a0kDa) in the liver of estradiol-injected females. Finally, we propose a subclassification of B. arenarum stage II oocytes into three physiologically and morphologically distinct periods (early, mid and late).",

The BiTPx1 gene consists of three exons, encoding 195 amino acid residues with 2 conserved cysteine residues. Recombinant BiPrx1 (27\u00a0kDa) and BiTPx1 (25\u00a0kDa), expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells, reduced H2O2 in the presence of electrons donated by dithiothreitol. Unlike BiTPx1, however, BiPrx1 did not show reduction activity when thioredoxin was used as the electron donor. Both BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 protected super-coiled DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Tissue distribution analyses showed the presence of BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 in the fat body, midgut, muscle and epidermis, but not in the hemolymph, suggesting that BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 are not secretable. When H2O2 was injected into B. ignitus bees, BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 transcripts were acutely up-regulated in the fat body tissues. We also demonstrated the regulation of BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 expression via reduction of transcript levels in the fat body with RNA interference (RNAi). Under H2O2 overload, the RNAi-induced BiPrx1 knock-down B. ignitus worker bees showed up-regulated expression of BiTPx1. Reciprocally, BiTPx1 RNAi knockdowns showed up-regulated BiPrx1 expression in the fat body. These results indicate that the loss of expression of BiPrx1 or BiTPx1 is compensated by the up-regulation of expression of the other peroxidase in response to H2O2 overload.",

In this study, the Ubc9 was identified in the embryo and ovary of a freshwater prawn Macrobrachium nipponense for the first time and it was denoted as MnUbc9. Bioinformatics analyses showed that this gene encodes a protein of 161 amino acids with predicted molecular mass of 18.32\u00a0kDa.

The two genes were demonstrated to belong to zp3 isoforms by utilizing BLAST, alignment of amino acid sequence, and phylogenetic analysis. The two genes were named C. semilaevis zp3a and C. semilaevis zp3b. C. semilaevis zp3a encoded 519 amino acid protein, including a signal peptide and a ZP domain with 257 amino acids, which was 62% identical to the medaka ZPC5.

Alignment analysis showed that the ZP domain of the two ZP proteins contained eight conserved cysteines. RT-PCR indicated that the C. semilaevis zp3a was highly expressed in the ovary and kidney of females, and weakly expressed in female muscle and spleen. The C. semilaevis zp3b mRNA was expressed in several tissues of females, including a high expression level in the ovary and kidney, and a relatively low expression level in the heart, brain, muscle, spleen, gill, and intestine.

     "abstract": "Prohormone convertases (PCs) are calcium-dependent serine endoproteases of the subtilisin family that play a key role in the posttranslational processing of precursors for bioactive peptides. In this study, the cDNA of PC1 from abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) was cloned and sequenced. The PC1 cDNA consisted of 2216\u00a0bp with an open reading frame of 2010\u00a0bp encoding a 670 amino acid peptide. Comparative structural analysis revealed that abalone PC1 shared high similarity and identity with most PC counterparts. The profile of deduced peptide of PC1 was composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, a prosegment domain, a catalytic domain and a P domain, which were common in many species. Sequence analysis indicated that the abalone PC1 was highly conserved in catalytic domain, including three conserved serine catalytic signatures that comprised a catalytic triad active center. Also conserved were the potential cleavage site for release of the mature peptide, a cognate integrin binding site RGD in P domain, and four cysteine residues involved in forming an intrachain disulfide bridge. To further investigate the functions of PC1 in abalone, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine the expression level of this gene at three different reproduction stages (i.e. pre-, during- and post-breeding). Results indicated that PC1 was expressed throughout the three stages but the expression levels varied with the timepoints and different tissues in abalone. The expression levels of PC1 in digestive gland were much higher than those of the gonad. In female abalone, the expression of PC1 was higher at pre-breeding and during-breeding stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the expression declined at the subsequent stage. Whereas, the level of PC1 in male individual did not exhibit a significant difference in various reproduction stages. Also, the natural enzyme activity of PC1 partially exhibited a similar tendency with the mRNA expression. According to the results, it can be concluded that PC1 gene is involved in the abalone reproduction process (e.g. spawning or sperming). PC1 is a potential prohormone processing enzyme and it may play a critical role in abalone physiological processes related to reproduction.",

The 1854\u00a0bp full-length cDNA sequence of EcIRF-2 has been cloned, encoding a putative peptide of 336 amino acids which is highly consistent with the feature of IRF family members.

The expression of EcIRF-2 gene was detected in various tissues of healthy orange-spotted grouper and in four tissues after being challenged with poly I:C or LPS. EcIRF-2 gene is ubiquitously expressed in various healthy fish tissues and is up-regulated in vivo in response to poly I:C or LPS. Subcellular localization analysis of EcIRF-2 suggests it is an intranuclear protein in the fish cells. We believe this research is the first report of fish IRF-2 protein localization.

The enzyme functions in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a complex with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. In teleost fish, at least two separate loci, cyp19a and cyp19b, encode distinct aromatase isoforms. The activity of cyp19a and cyp19b are predominantly associated with the ovary and brain, respectively, although their expression is not confined solely to these tissues. We found that at least five cyp19b1 transcripts with different 5\u2032-UTRs are generated in the ovary and testis of rainbow trout. Regulation for selection of these variants may be through signals present in exon 2 that recruit alternative splicing factors. Also, binding elements for FOXL2 and SF-1 located within the cyp19b1 intron 1 may influence formation of transcripts that contain the 3\u2032-end of the intron. Another transcript devoid of the exon 2 methionine initiator codon may utilize other downstream in-frame start codons. Less developed stages of ovarian and testicular tissues express only the intron-containing transcripts whereas precocious and more mature gonads express all five cyp19b1 messages. The function of these different 5\u2032-UTRs may be for regulation of cyp19b1 at particular developmental stages or to specify control in distinct gonadal cell-types.",

Two LV were isolated from eggs of Macrobrachium borellii. corresponding to early (LVe ) and late (LVl) embryo developing stages. They differ in lipid composition but not in lipid/protein ratio or apoprotein composition. Structural information was obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy, far-UV circular dichroism, partial trypsinolysis and electron microscopy applied to LVe and LVl and two partially delipidated forms of LVe generated by phospholipase A2 (LVp) or Triton X-100 (LVt) treatment. All LV forms contained two apoprotein subunits of 94 and 112\u00a0kDa, being the 112\u00a0kDa subunit more accessible to trypsinolysis in all. Only in LVp, different cleavage sites appeared. Secondary structure was similar in LVe and LVl, but LVp and LVt showed a small increase in \u03b2-sheet at expense of \u03b1-helix. Electron microscopy revealed a spheroidal morphology in all LV and a decreased size in LVp. Delipidated LVs were more resistant to denaturation with guanidinium-HCl. Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was more efficient in delipidated LVs, probably due to apolipoprotein rearrangement, as reinforced by fluorescence anisotropy. It is concluded that LV stability, shape, and apoprotein conformation is not largely affected by the changes in lipid composition that take place during embryogenesis.",

The FA profiles for both species are overall similar, but organ peculiarities have been found, which could reflect metabolic specificities and feeding habits between species. With the exception of liver, the most abundant FA in organs was the n\u22123 polyunsaturated FA. The total n\u22126 polyunsaturated FAs were minor components in all evaluated organs.

Despite the large number of insect species that feed on lignocellulosic material, limited availability of quantitative studies comparing cellulase activity among insect taxa constrains identification of candidate species for more targeted identification of effective cellulolytic systems. We describe quantitative determinations of the cellulolytic activity in gut or head-derived fluids from 68 phytophagous or xylophagous insect species belonging to eight different taxonomic orders. Enzymatic activity was determined for two different substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), approximating endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanase and complete cellulolytic activity, respectively. Highest CMC gut fluid activities were found in Dictyoptera, Coleoptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera, while highest MCC gut fluid activities were found in Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera. In most cases, gut fluid activities were greater with CMC compared to MCC substrate, except in Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. In contrast, cellulolytic activity levels in most head fluids were greater on the MCC substrate. Our data suggests that a phylogenetic relationship may exist for the origin of cellulolytic enzymes in insects, and that cellulase activity levels correlate with taxonomic classification, probably reflecting differences in plant host or feeding strategies.",

Trypsin-like proteinases from the resistant strains exhibited higher affinity for L-BApNA. The resistant no-cost strain exhibited Vmax-values 1.5- and 1.7-fold higher than the susceptible and resistance cost strains, respectively. A similar trend was also observed when using N-\u03b1-p-tosyl-L-Arg methyl ester (L-TAME) as substrate. These results provide support to the hypothesis that the enhanced serine proteinase activity may be playing a role in mitigating physiological costs associated with the maintenance of insecticide resistance mechanisms in some maize weevil strains.",

Determination of the spatial distribution of \u03b1-glucosidases in Q. gigas midgut showed that this activity is not equally distributed between soluble and membrane-bound isoforms. The major membrane-bound enzyme was solubilized in the detergent Triton X-100 and purified to homogeneity by means of gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100, and ion-exchange on High Q and Mono Q columns. The purified \u03b1-glucosidase is a protein with a pH optimum of 6.0 against the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl \u03b1-d-glucoside and Mr of 61,000 (SDS-PAGE). Taking into account VMax/KM ratios, the enzyme is more active on maltose than sucrose and prefers oligomaltodextrins up to maltopentaose, with lower efficiency for longer chain maltodextrins. The Q. gigas \u03b1-glucosidase was immunolocalized in perimicrovillar membranes by using a monospecific polyclonal antibody raised against the purified enzyme from Dysdercus peruvianus. The role of this enzyme in xylem fluid digestion and its possible involvement in osmoregulation is discussed.",

     "abstract": "In vertebrates, both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the corresponding scavenging system components especially glutathione peroxidase (GPx) are indispensible for normal development of the gonads. To investigate the function of GPx in crustaceans, we cloned and characterized a full length GPx (MeGPx) transcript in the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus ensis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that MeGPx clustered withthe GPx from mollusks and nematodes and shared much higher similarity with vertebrate GPx3 and GPx5 than with GPx1 or GPx2. Multiple sequence alignment further demonstrated that MeGPx is evolutionarily conserved among invertebrates, with common functionally important motifs. MeGPx was specifically expressed in shrimp ovaries, but not in other tissues studied, including testis. In situ hybridization showed that MeGPx was highly expressed in pre-vitellogenic and mid-vitellogenic oocytes, while no expression was detected in late-vitellogenic oocytes. Moreover, real time PCR showed high level expression of MeGPx in the early ovaries. Since active protein synthesis and deposition occurred in mid-vitellogenic oocytes, MeGPx might play a pivotal role in preventing oocytes from oxidative damage and balancing ROS production. The present findings on shrimp GPx provide insights on the regulation of ROS in the ovarian maturation process and the role of GPx in crustacean reproductive biology.",

     "abstract": "Changes in water temperature and salinity are responsible for a variety of physiological stress responses in aquatic organisms. Stress induced by these factors was recently associated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which caused oxidative damage. In the present study, we investigated the time-related effects of changes in water temperature and salinity on mRNA expression and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the gills and digestive glands of the ark shell, Scapharca broughtonii. To investigate physiological responses, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lysozyme activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), and alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) were measured in the hemolymph. Water temperature and salinity changes significantly increased antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression and activity in the digestive glands and gills in a time-dependent manner. H2O2 concentrations increased significantly in the high-temperature and hyposalinity treatments. LPO, AspAT and AlaAT levels also increased significantly in a time-dependent manner, while lysozyme activity decreased. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes play important roles in reducing oxidative stress in ark shells exposed to changes in water temperature and salinity.",

     "abstract": "A study was conducted to elucidate hormonal control of leptin receptor gene expression in primary cultures of porcine hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were isolated from swine and seeded into T-25 flasks. Cultures were established in medium containing fetal bovine serum for one day and switched to serum-free medium (William's E medium and 1\u00a0ng/mL insulin) for the remainder of the 3\u00a0d culture period. For the final 24\u00a0h, medium was supplemented with porcine growth hormone (GH, 100 or 500\u00a0ng/mL), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, 50 to 250\u00a0ng/mL) or triiodothyronine (T3, 100\u00a0ng/mL). RNA was extracted and relative quantitative RT-PCR was performed with primers for long form leptin receptor. Receptor expression was calculated relative to 18S rRNA. Insulin had no effect (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), while T3 increased leptin receptor mRNA abundance (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Treatment with GH or IGF-I reduced leptin receptor expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to acute leptin treatment was inhibited by previous exposure to GH or IGF-I. Hepatocytes secreted IGF-I under basal conditions and this was enhanced by GH addition. These data suggest porcine hepatocytes may be less sensitive to leptin stimulation due to the actions of endogenous IGF-I on leptin receptor expression.",

     "abstract": "After intense physical activity animals generally experience a rise in metabolic rate, which is associated with a proliferation of pro-oxidants. If unchecked, these pro-oxidants can cause damage to DNA and peroxidation of lipids in cell walls. Two factors are thought to ameliorate post-exercise oxidative damage, at least in mammals: dietary antioxidants and exercise training. So far it is unknown whether birds benefit similarly from exercise training, although a positive effect of dietary antioxidants on take-off flight has been indicated. In this experiment, we maintained captive wildtype budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus on enhanced (EQ) or reduced quality (RQ) diets differing in levels of the dietary antioxidants retinol, vitamin C and \u03b1-tocopherol for 12\u00a0months. Birds were then regularly trained to perform take-off escape flights, a strenuous and biologically relevant form of exercise. For these adult budgerigars, regular exercise training improved escape flight performance, particularly in males on the EQ diet. In terms of oxidative damage, post-exercise levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a by-product of lipid peroxidation, were significantly decreased after 9\u00a0weeks of flight training than after a single exercise session. Thus, individuals achieved faster escape flights with lower oxidative damage, after training. Also, birds that were fatter for their skeletal size initially had higher post-exercise MDA levels than thinner birds, but this relationship was broken by 9\u00a0weeks of flight training. Interestingly, there was no impact of diet quality on levels of MDA, suggesting that improved protection against oxidative damage for all birds was due to an up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant systems. Given their diversity, bird species provide rich research opportunities for investigating the interactions between exercise training, pro-oxidants production and antioxidant defences.",

The Bi-PHGPx gene consists of 4 exons, encoding 168 amino acid residues with a canonical cys-codon at residue 45 and active site residues Gln82 and Trp134. Recombinant Bi-PHGPx, expressed as a 19\u00a0kDa protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells, exhibited enzymatic activity against PLPC-OOH and H2O2 using glutathione as an electron donor. Tissue distribution analyses showed the presence of Bi-PHGPx in all tissues examined. Bi-PHGPx transcripts were upregulated by stresses, such as wounding, H2O2 exposure, external temperature shock, and starvation. Under H2O2 overload, the RNA interference (RNAi)-induced thioredoxin peroxidase (BiTPx1)-knock-down B. ignitus worker bees showed upregulated expression of Bi-PHGPx in the fat body. These results indicate that Bi-PHGPx is a stress-inducible antioxidant enzyme that acts on phospholipid hydroperoxide and H2O2.",

In this study, we have identified and characterized the expression profile of these genes in the chicken, Gallus gallus. Chicken LPL and ATGL have been cloned, and HTGL, EL, Lipase H, and CEL sequences were found in the chicken genome database. The deduced amino acid sequences of HTGL, EL, Lipase H, and CEL were 66, 75, 63, and 65% identical with their respective human genes, suggesting conservation of important enzymatic functions. In contrast, a homologue of the HSL gene was not identified in the chicken genome. We performed RT-PCR using chicken liver, muscle, abdominal adipose tissue, or pancreas mRNA as the template, and all partial products were completely matched to the corresponding predicted sequences of triglyceride lipase gene members. Quantitation by qPCR of the transcript levels of these genes in 13 tissues indicates that the expression patterns diverge greatly between species. A particularly interesting pattern was observed in the distribution of EL and HTGL mRNA, which were highly expressed in kidney and ovary. This is the first report of HTGL, EL, Lipase H, and CEL in a pre-mammalian species and reveals novel details about specific features of the expression of these important molecules in lipid metabolism.",

We investigated the Hp concentration in samples of 123 seals (Phoca vitulina) from the German and Danish Wadden Sea to study physiological ranges of Hp levels. Hp levels between 2002, the end of the phocine distemper virus epidemic (PDV), and 2007 were considered, and Hp concentrations between animals of different sex, ages as well as living areas were compared. Furthermore, as a case study, six animals from the open sea isle Helgoland were investigated in 2006. Influences on the health status of the seal population e.g. the PDV epidemic were reflected by increased Hp levels in North Sea seals in 2002. The results of the Wadden Sea seals showed no significant age-, sex-, or geographical area-related differences. Interestingly, for the seals of the open sea isle Helgoland higher Hp values were measured compared to the Wadden Sea seals. The present study demonstrates that Hp can be used as a diagnostic tool to monitor the health status of harbour seals.",

The first family including two members is esculentin-2-AL (esculentin-2-ALa and -ALb); the second family including three members is temporin-AL (temporin-ALd to -ALf). The family of esculentin-2-AL is composed of 37 amino acid residues (aa); the family of temporin-AL is composed of 16, 13 and 10 aa, respectively. All of these antimicrobial peptides showed antimicrobial activities against tested microorganisms. cDNAs encoding precursors of esculentin-2-ALs and temporin-ALs were cloned from the skin cDNA library of A. loloensis. All the precursors share similar overall structures. There is a typical prohormone processing signal (Lys-Arg) located between the acidic propiece and the mature peptide. The antimicrobial peptide family of esculentin-2 is firstly reported in the genus of Amolops. Combined with previous reports, a total of four antimicrobial peptide families have been identified from the genus of Amolops; three of them are also found in the genus of Rana.

Isolated full-length trypsinogen cDNA clones were 869\u00a0bp and 857\u00a0bp. The deduced amino acid sequences were 242\u00a0aa and 247\u00a0aa long, both containing the highly conserved residues essential for serine protease catalytic and conformational maintenance. The results from isoelectric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that grass carp trypsinogen is grouped with teleost trypsinogen group I, while topmouth culter trypsinogen is grouped with group II. The expression pattern of trypsinogen mRNA was similar between these two species, appearing 2\u00a0days post-hatching (dph) and reaching peaks at 11 and 23\u00a0dph. The trypsin-specific activities in both species were detected 2\u00a0dph and reached the major peaks at 8\u00a0dph, however the minor peaks were observed at 20\u00a0dph in the grass carp and 17\u00a0dph in the topmouth culter. The trypsin-specific activity was significantly higher in the grass carp than in the topmouth culter, which may be attributed to the nature of their different nutritional habits.",

Our aim was to isolate and perform biochemical characterization of lipid rafts from the intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to confirm their existence in a cold-water species and compare their characteristics with lipid rafts from other species in terms of lipid and protein content. To validate the isolation process, we assayed marker enzymes for subcellular organelles, including alkaline phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), both well-known marker enzymes for BBM and lipid rafts. All biochemical methods showed enrichment of AP in both the BBM and lipid raft fractions. Proteomic studies were performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using trypsin digested SDS-PAGE samples. Various proteins were associated with the cod intestinal lipid raft preparation such as aminopeptidase-N, prohibitin, and beta-actin. Lipid analysis with 31P NMR and thin layer chromatography on BBMs and lipid rafts samples gave higher content of sphingomyelin than previously reported in the BBM and lower content of phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, sphingomyelin was highly dominant in the lipid rafts together with cholesterol. The existence of lipid rafts containing previously reported lipid raft characteristics from the cod intestine has, therefore, been confirmed in a ray-finned fish for the first time to the best of our knowledge.",
