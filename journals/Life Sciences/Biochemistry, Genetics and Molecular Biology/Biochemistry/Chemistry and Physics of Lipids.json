     "abstract": "Electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy was used to investigate binary mixtures of single-chain micelle-forming lipids and diacyl bilayer-forming lipids dispersed in D2O at 77\u2009K. Mixtures of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and lyso-palmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PPC) over the entire composition range (0\u2013100\u2009mol%) and phosphatidylcholine spin-labeled at selected carbon atom position along the sn-2 chain (n-PCSL) were considered. On increasing the content of the lysolipids incorporated in DPPC, the lipid bilayers are first transformed in interdigitated lamellae and then converted in micelles of Lyso-PPC. In the interdigitated phase, the profile of translamellae water accessibility is rather uniform as all the hydrocarbon segments are equally exposed to the solvent. In Lyso-PPC micelle, water penetrates at any depth of the hydrocarbon region with a tendency to increase toward the chain termini. The extent of water penetration is higher in the interdigitated DPPC/Lyso-PPC dispersions than in Lyso-PPC micelles. The profiles of water permeation revealed directly by D2O-ESEEM are also confirmed by more indirect evaluation of the polarity profiles based on the 14N-hyperfine splitting in the conventional electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of n-PCSL in frozen DPPC/Lyso-PPC mixtures at 77\u2009K. The ESEEM data reveal that H-bonding formation between the \u2013NO group of the spin-label and the D2O molecules is favored in the intergitated phase with respect to the micellar phase and, in any lipid dispersion, the fraction of nitroxides that are singly H-bonded to deuterons is higher than the fraction that are doubly H-bonded. The overall results highlight the differences in the accessibility and properties of the solvent in the hydrocarbon region of lipid bilayers, interdigitated bilayers and micelles.",

     "abstract": "This neutron diffraction study of deuterated tripalmitin has provided further insight into a forensic observation of the crystallisation of lipids under high-shear conditions. To achieve this, an experimental set up was designed to enable simultaneous rheological data from a Couette cell to be recorded with neutron powder diffraction, enabling the influence of shear on the polymorph transformation on cooling to be monitored in real time. Tripalmitin was observed to directly transform from a liquid phase to a \u03b2 polymorph under the influence of shear. Although the liquid to \u03b2 transition was not observed to be influenced by shear rate, the degree of crystallinity, qualitatively denoted by an increase in the sharpness of the diffraction peaks, was observed at higher shear rates. Evidence is also presented that the rate of cooling influences the ordering in the \u03b2-polymorph produced in zero shear conditions.",

     "abstract": "In previous work, we have been able to determine the depth of intercalated molecules within the lipid bilayer using the solvent polarity sensitivity of three spectroscopic techniques: the 13C NMR chemical shift (\u03b4); the fluorescence emission wavelength (\u03bbem), and the ESR \u03b2-H splitting constants (a\u03b2-H). In the present paper, we use the quenching by a heavy atom (Br or I), situated at a known location along a phospholipid chain, as a probe of the location of a fluorescent moiety. We have synthesized various phospholipids with bromine (or iodine) atoms substituted at various locations along the lipid chain. The latter halolipids were intercalated in turn with various fluorophores into DMPC liposomes, biomembranes and erythrocyte ghosts. The most effective fluorescence quenching occurs when the heavy atom location corresponds to that of the fluorophore. The results show that generally speaking the fluorophore intercalates the same depth independent of which lipid bilayer is used. KBr (or KI) is the most effective quencher when the fluorophore resides in or at the aqueous phase. Presumably because of iodine's larger radius and spin coupling constant, the iodine analogs are far less discriminating in the depth range it quenches.",

     "abstract": "The possibility of modification of surface wettability is especially desirable in implantology. This effect is achieved by coating a given material with thin films containing nanoparticles of different chemical properties. In recent years, much interest has been paid to supported phospholipid bilayers (SPBs), because they can be exploited in novel biotechnological devices such as biosensors and mimetic membrane\u2013coated implants. In view of the above, we decided to study the modification of wetting properties of phospholipid layer by two types of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) with different functional groups attached to the silica open\u2013cage. The POSS and phospholipid (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPC) were vertically (Langmuir-Blodgett; LB) and horizontally (Langmuir-Schaefer; LS) deposited on quartz substrates to form a thin layer structure. The advancing contact angles on the modified surface coated with thin films were measured. The surface free energy (SFE) of DPPC, POSS and their mixed DPPC/POSS films was estimated by using Owens-Wendt-Rabel-K\u00e4elbe (OWRK) method. It was shown that the chemical structure of POSS used as a modifier influence the wetting properties of modified quartz surface. Incorporation fluoroalkyl-POSS into DPPC monolayer leads to obtaining a more hydrophobic film, while the addition of polyethylene glycol-POSS creates a more hydrophilic film. The transfer of the film with a more condensed structure led to a more hydrophobic material. The deposition technique (horizontal or vertical) had a particular impact on the modification of wettability of quartz surface coated with monocomponent fluoroalkyl-POSS film, whereas for the modification with mixed DPPC/POSS systems the choice of transfer method was not so significant.",

     "abstract": "The products of lipid peroxidation, resulting from cell metabolism as well as the action of external physical factors and xenobiotics, have a significant impact on cell functions. One of the mechanisms by which lipid peroxidation products influence cells is the formation of adducts with proteins, including enzymes and signaling molecules. This review describes the biological consequences of protein adduct formation with oxidative lipid fragmentation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), and acrolein, as well as cyclization products including isoprostanes, isoketals, and isolevuglandins. The generation of protein adducts with lipid peroxidation products can stimulate the antioxidant system, which may also possess proinflammatory or proapoptotic effects. However, the role of adducts between lipid peroxidation products and proteins depends on the condition of the cells and can range from the function of cytoprotective activity stimulation, to induction of toxicity involved in the development of degenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Aerobic life is based on numerous metabolic oxidation reactions as well as biosynthesis of oxygenated signaling compounds. Among the latter are the myriads of oxygenated lipids including a well-studied group of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) - octadecanoids, eicosanoids, and docosanoids. During the last two decades, remarkable progress in liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry has led to significant progress in the characterization of oxygenated PUFA-containing phospholipids, thus designating the emergence of a new field of lipidomics, redox lipidomics. Although non-enzymatic free radical reactions of lipid peroxidation have been mostly associated with the aberrant metabolism typical of acute injury or chronic degenerative processes, newly accumulated evidence suggests that enzymatically catalyzed (phospho)lipid oxygenation reactions are essential mechanisms of many physiological pathways. In this review, we discuss a variety of contemporary protocols applicable for identification and quantitative characterization of different classes of peroxidized (phospho)lipids. We describe applications of different types of LCMS for analysis of peroxidized (phospho)lipids, particularly cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolalmines, in two important types of programmed cell death - apoptosis and ferroptosis. We discuss the role of peroxidized phosphatidylserines in phagocytotic signaling. We exemplify the participation of peroxidized neutral lipids, particularly tri-acylglycerides, in immuno-suppressive signaling in cancer. We also consider new approaches to exploring the spatial distribution of phospholipids in the context of their oxidizability by MS imaging, including the latest achievements in high resolution imaging techniques. We present innovative approaches to the interpretation of LC\u2013MS data, including audio-representation analysis. Overall, we emphasize the role of redox lipidomics as a communication language, unprecedented in diversity and richness, through the analysis of peroxidized (phospho)lipids.",

Furthermore, high diversity of lipid physicochemical properties requires high resolving powers for both chromatographic and mass spectrometric analytical platforms. Reverse-phase chromatography coupled with data-dependent MS/MS acquisition is one of the most popular techniques in untargeted lipidomics. Optimal method should provide good chromatographic separation and resolution, reproducibility, selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we developed and set-up a RPLC-MS/MS workflow capable of resolving complex mixtures of lipids in 32\u2009min of analysis. Human blood plasma was chosen as a representative complex natural lipidome with large variance of lipid classes, species and lipid concentrations. Lipids were separated by RPLC on five different reverse phase columns with different types of stationary phase particles, size and chemistry. High mass accuracy MS analysis and data-dependent MS/MS analysis were performed using a Q Exactive\u2122 HF Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap\u2122 Mass Spectrometer to identify individual lipid molecular species. This workflow was applied to evaluate the separation capability of each column and to identify the lipidomics profile in highly complex biological samples. As a result, we report more than 600 lipid species covering 18 lipid classes in human blood plasma and provide suggestions to the selection of the appropriate reverse phase column for the analysis of specific lipidomes.",

     "abstract": "Biological membranes are selectively permeable barriers important for cell organization and compartmentalization. Their organisation strongly depends on the lipids that constitute the lipid bilayer as well as the proteins that reside in the membrane. Unravelling the organisation of biological membranes is therefore of great importance to understand cellular function driven by integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Recent developments in mass spectrometry made it a powerful tool contributing to our present-day understanding of membrane composition and organisation. The two main deliverables of mass spectrometry are (i) the identification and quantification of the membrane components, and (ii) the analysis of their structural arrangements. In this review article, we first briefly discuss the aspects of membrane organization that are accessible through mass spectrometry. We then provide detailed insights into the various mass spectrometric strategies which help identifying lipids from membranes or membrane protein assemblies, unravelling the lipid binding modes in membrane proteins and uncovering their structural roles. We further discuss the growing interest in membrane mimetics providing membrane proteins with a native-like lipid environment for structural and functional studies and the possibilities of mass spectrometry to contribute in these experiments.",

     "abstract": "The extensive number of metabolic processes regulated by phosphatidylinositol (PI) phospholipids highlights their physiological importance. The major metabolic pathway for their biosynthesis in cells is the PI-cycle. Contrary to most metabolic cycles, reactions of the PI-cycle occur in two different locations; those are, the plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Lipid movement between the two organelles is, therefore, a requirement of the cyclical process. Moreover, in mammals the PI-cycle yield PI molecular species enriched in specific acyl chains, namely 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl acyl chains. Hence, to ensure cycle efficiency and specificity it should take place in specialized regions of PM and ER rather than being randomly distributed among those membranes. Along these lines, ER-PM contact sites have emerged as the location where a number of proteins related to the PI-cycle have been reported to localize. Of importance to this review is the presence of the epsilon isoform of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK\u03b5) at ER-PM contact sites. In the PI-cycle DGK\u03b5 is in part responsible for the acyl chain enrichment of the PI molecular species. However, it has recently been shown that the enzyme can only engage in the PI-cycle upon membrane morphological changes. In this review we will discuss the PI-cycle at ER-PM contact sites and how the generation of membrane negative Gaussian curvature nearby those regions could regulate the cycle. We will focus our discussion on the hypothesis that actin polymerization provides the mechanical force needed to change membrane shape nearby ER-PM contact sites, which will transiently trigger DGK\u03b5 and, therefore, link enzymatic catalysis and lipid transfer in the PI-cycle.",

The free energy of the membranes with different geometries is then used to extract the bending modulus, Gaussian modulus, and line tension of the membranes. The results reveal that the bending modulus of the triblock membrane is greater than that of the diblock membrane. Furthermore, the Gaussian modulus and line tension of the triblock membrane indicate that the triblock membranes have higher pore formation energy than that of the diblock membranes. The equilibrium bridging and looping fractions of the triblock copolymers are also obtained.

A plausible mechanism of action in the case of many membrane additives seems to be in shifting the water encroachment the way that bilayers absorb more or less water molecules - one of the smallest and often neglected biomolecule. The difference in water interactions with different lipids and cholesterol has been noted at the interface and up to the bilayer center, the ion depending interplay between lipid-water and ion-water hydrations has been shown, and the anaesthetic effect also appears to link tightly to hydration, to discuss but a few examples. Although a complete understanding of the physicochemical processes taking place in biomembranes is not established fully, the understanding of lipid bilayer structural changes as a result of different properties of environment outside and/or inside the membrane provides a foundation for better insights into the structure-function relationships that most certainly take place in complex biomembrane systems.",

     "abstract": "Most membrane-solubilising amphiphilic copolymers such as diisobutylene/maleic acid (DIBMA) and styrene/maleic acid (SMA) carry high negative charge densities. Their polyanionic character results in strong Coulombic repulsion, both between polymer chains and lipid membranes during the solubilisation process as well as among polymer-encapsulated nanodiscs after solubilisation. Coulombic repulsion is attenuated by charge screening and, more efficiently, by counterion association, which is particularly strong for multivalent cations binding to polyanionic copolymers. Here, we investigated the effects of the two common alkaline earth metal ions Mg2+ and Ca2+ on the solubilisation properties of and the nanodiscs formed by DIBMA. By quantifying the kinetics and the equilibrium efficiency of lipid solubilisation by static and dynamic light scattering, respectively, we found that millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+ accelerated DIBMA-mediated lipid solubilisation several-fold and resulted in considerably smaller nanodiscs than without divalent cations. Time-resolved F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy revealed that collisional transfer of phospholipids among nanodiscs was up to \u223c20 and \u223c25 times faster in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ or 7.5 mM Ca2+ than in the absence of divalent cations. These major effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ contrasted with a moderate influence on the morphology and the thermotropic phase behaviour of the nanodiscs. Finally, we compared the yields of membrane-protein extraction from Escherichia coli membranes, which increased by up to two-fold upon addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+. None of these effects could be explained by Coulombic screening alone, as the change in ionic strength resulting from low millimolar concentrations of divalent cations was minor. Thus, we conclude that Mg2+ and Ca2+ specifically associated with DIBMA to neutralise part of the polymer\u2019s carboxylate groups.",

In addition, HDL lipid composition is altered in response to inflammation, which may induce the structural reorganization of SAA and affect its function. Therefore, the physiological roles of HDL can be influenced by changes in their protein and lipid compositions that are triggered by inflammatory diseases. Here, the effect of HDL lipid composition on the structural properties of SAA was examined. Uniformly sized reconstituted HDL (rHDL) was prepared and mainly composed of phosphatidylcholine with a single additional lipid species. Results showed that changes in lipid composition had no significant impact on the helical content of SAA and its thermodynamic stability. However, rHDL lipid composition affected other structural properties of SAA, such as its tryptophan microenvironment and kinetic stability, and thus influenced the susceptibility of SAA to enzymatic digestion. Therefore, changes in HDL lipid composition may affect the physiological function of SAA and the pathogenesis of SAA-related diseases.",

It has recently been shown that styrene-maleic acid (SMA) copolymers act as a macromolecular surfactant and therefore facilitate the formation of disk-shaped lipid bilayer nanoparticles (styrene-maleic acid copolymer-lipid nanoparticles (SMALPs)) that retain structural characteristics of native lipid membranes. We have previously reported controlled synthesis of SMA block copolymers using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, and that alteration of the weight ratio of styrene to maleic acid affects nanoparticle size. RAFT-synthesis offers superior control over SMA polymer architecture compared to conventional radical polymerization techniques used for commercially available SMA. However, the interactions between the lipid bilayer and the solubilized RAFT-synthesized SMA polymer are currently not fully understood. In this study, EPR spectroscopy was used to detect the perturbation on the acyl chain upon introduction of the RAFT-synthesized SMA polymer by attaching PC-based nitroxide spin labels to the 5th, 12th, and 16th positions along the acyl chain of the lipid bilayer. EPR spectra showed high rigidity at the 12th position compared to the other two regions, displaying similar qualities to commercially available polymers synthesized via conventional methods. In addition, central EPR linewidths and correlation time data were obtained that are consistent with previous findings.",

     "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein whose fundamental function is to facilitate and regulate the flow of metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the dependence of VDAC selectivity towards small inorganic anions on two factors: the ionic strength and the lipid composition. In agreement with experimental data we found that VDAC becomes less anion selective with increasing salt concentration due to the screening of a few basic residues that point into the pore lumen. The molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into the regulation mechanism of VDAC selectivity by the composition in the lipid membrane and suggest that the ion distribution is differently modulated by POPE compared to the POPC bilayer. This occurs through the more persistent interactions of acidic residues located at both rims of the \u03b2-barrel with head groups of POPE which in turn impact the electrostatic potential and thereby the selectivity of the pore. This mechanism occurs not only in POPE single component membranes but also in a mixed POPE/POPC bilayer by an enrichment of POPE over POPC lipids on the surface of VDAC. Thus we show here that computationally-inexpensive coarse-grained simulations are able to capture, in a semi-quantitative way, essential features of VDAC anion selectivity and could pave the way toward a molecular level understanding of metabolite transport in natural membranes.",

We aimed to obtain insight into this by making use of synthetic azobenzene-labeled phospholipids incorporated into di-16:0 PC nanodiscs. Azobenzene lipids undergo geometric isomerization upon exposure to light at 365\u2009nm, resulting in the formation of cis-isomers that possess a larger cross-sectional area than the trans-isomers. The influence of the lipid properties on the kinetics and extent of isomerization of the azobenzene groups was first tested in large unilamellar vesicles constituted by lipid mixtures with different packing properties of the acyl chains. Fastest isomerization kinetics were found when azolipids were present in membranes supplemented with lysolipids and slowest in those supplemented with di-unsaturated lipids, suggesting that the isomerization rate is sensitive to the lateral pressure profile in the lipid bilayer and hence may be considered a convenient tool to monitor packing properties of lipids enclosed in nanodiscs. When azolipids were incorporated in SMA-bounded nanodiscs, azolipid isomerization was found to take place readily, indicating that SMA polymers behave as rather flexible belts and allow expansion of the enclosed lipid material.",

Abnormal changes in the quantities or compositions of lipids present in meibomian gland secretions (meibum) are known to lead to dry eye disease, although the underlying mechanism is not yet well understood. The tree shrew is the non-primate mammal most closely related to humans. To assess the utility of the tree shrew as a model for the study of dry eye disease, we analyzed the lipid profile of tree shrew meibum using an untargeted ESI-MS and MS/MSall shotgun approach. The resulting lipidome shared many similarities with human meibum, while displaying some interesting differences. For example, several classes of lipids, including wax esters, cholesteryl esters, diesters, and (O-acyl)-\u03c9-hydroxy fatty acids, had relatively longer chain lengths in tree shrew meibum.

Oxidation of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, the major protein in HDL, reduces ABCA-1 mediated cholesterol efflux and other protective responses to HDL. The apoA-I mimetic peptide 4F has been shown to undergo oxidation; however, the ability of the peptide to mediate cholesterol efflux remains intact. Here, we show that 4F protects apoA-I from hypochlorite-mediated oxidation. Mass spectral analysis of apoA-I shows that tyrosine residues that are prone to hypochlorite-mediated chlorination are protected in the presence of 4F. Furthermore, 4F enhances the cholesterol efflux ability of apoA-I to a greater extent than either 4F or apoA-I alone, even after hypochlorite oxidation. These observations suggest that apoA-I in lipid complexes may be protected by the presence of 4F, resulting in the preservation of its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. These studies also form the basis for the future studies of nanoparticles possessing both apoA-I and 4F.",

     "abstract": "Glucagon is a 29 amino acid peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic \u03b1\u2212cells and interacts with specific receptors located in various organs. Glucagon tends to form gel-like fibril aggregates that are cytotoxic because they activate apoptotic signaling pathways. To understand mechanism of fibril formation, we investigated the structure and kinetics of glucagon fibril formation using 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy. In aqueous acetic acid solution at pH 3.3, distorted \u03b1\u2212helical structure appeared around Gly4, Leu14, Ala19 and Leu26 in the monomeric form. In contrast, Gly4 and Ala19 were involved in \u03b2-sheet structures in the fibril form. The fibrillation process can be explained by a two-step autocatalytic reaction mechanism in which the first step is a homogeneous nuclear formation (k1), and the second step is an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation process (k2). The rate constants k1 and k2 were separately determined in the acetic acid solution. Fibril formation was further investigated in the presence of lipid bilayers to mimic the physiological condition. We used bicelles which form discoidal nano-particles as the bilayer system and observed that the N-terminal \u03b1-helix did not change to \u03b2-sheet when fibrils formed in the presence of bicelles. Rate constant k1 became faster and k2 became slower in the presence of bicelles compared to the case in the absence of bicelles. Our findings reveal that the structure and kinetics of fibril formation by glucagon are altered in the presence of lipid bilayers.",

Polymer nanodiscs have been useful as a membrane mimetic by not only providing a native-like membrane environment, but also have the ability to extract the desired membrane protein directly from the cell membrane. In spite of such great potential, polymer nanodiscs have their disadvantages including lack of size control and instability at low pH and with divalent metals. In this review, we discuss how these limitations have been overcome by simple modifications of synthetic polymers commonly used to form nanodiscs. Recently, size control has been achieved using an ethanolamine functionalization of a low molecular weight polymer. This size control enabled the use of polymer-based lipid-nanodiscs in solution NMR and macro-nanodiscs in solid-state NMR applications. The introduction of quaternary ammonium functional groups has been shown to improve the stability in the presence of low pH and divalent metal ions, forming highly monodispersed nanodiscs. The polymer charge has been shown to play a significant role on the reconstitution of membrane proteins due to the high charge density on the nanodisc\u2019s belt. These recent developments have expanded the applications of polymer nanodiscs to study the membrane proteins using wide variety of techniques including NMR, Cryo-EM and other biophysical techniques.",

Apolipoprotein A-I is the dominant protein component of high density lipoproteins with important functions in cholesterol metabolism. 18A (Ac-DWLKA FYDKV AEKLK EAF- NH2) was designed to mimic the structure of tandem domains of class A amphipathic helices and has served as a lead peptide for biomedical applications. At low peptide-to-lipid ratios 18A partitions into phosphatidylcholine membranes with helix topologies parallel to the membrane surface, an alignment that is maintained when disc-like bicelles form at higher peptide-to-lipid ratios. Notably, the bicelles interact cooperatively with the magnetic field of the NMR spectrometer, thus the bilayer normal is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. A set of peptides that totals four 15N or 2H labelled positions of 18A allowed the accurate analysis of tilt and azimuthal angles relative to the membrane surface under different conditions. The topology agrees with a double belt arrangement forming a rim that covers the hydrophobic fatty acyl chains of the bicelles. In another set of experiments, it was shown that POPC nanodiscs prepared in the presence of diisobutylene/maleic acid (DIBMA) polymers can also be made to align in the magnetic field.

The inner and outer membranes of E. coli are largely composed of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), minor amounts of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL). We report here the utility of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) paired with ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) for the comprehensive analysis of the E. coli lipidome. Using strains with chromosomal deletions in the PG and CL synthesis genes pgsA and clsABC, respectively, we show that defective phospholipid biosynthesis in E. coli results in fatty-acid specific changes in select lipid classes and the presence of the minor triacylated phospholipids, acylphosphatidyl glycerol (acylPG) and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (N-acylPE). Notably, acylPGs were accumulated in the clsABC-KO strain, but were absent in other mutant strains. The separation of 1-lyso and 2-lyso-phosphatidylethanolamines (lysoPEs) is demonstrated in both the HILIC and IM dimensions. Using our previously validated calibration method, collision cross section values of nearly 200 phospholipids found in E. coli were determined on a traveling wave IM-MS platform, including newly reported values for cardiolipins, positional isomers of lysoPEs, acylPGs and N-acylPEs.",

     "abstract": "In the last ten years, mass spectrometry (MS) has become the favored analytical technique for sphingolipid (SPL) analysis and measurements. Indeed MS has the unique ability to both acquire sensitive and quantitative measurements and to resolve the molecular complexity characteristic of SPL molecules, both across the different SPL families and within the same SPL family. Currently, two complementary MS-based approaches are used for lipid research: analysis of lipid extracts, mainly by infusion electrospray ionization (ESI), and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) from a sample surface (i.e. intact tissue sections, cells, model membranes, thin layer chromatography plates) (Fig. 1). The first allows for sensitive and quantitative information about total lipid molecular species from a given specimen from which lipids have been extracted and chromatographically separated prior to the analysis; the second, albeit generally less quantitative and less specific in the identification of molecular species due to the complexity of the sample, allows for spatial information of lipid molecules from biological specimens. In the field of SPL research, MS analysis of lipid extracts from biological samples has been commonly utilized to implicate the role of these lipids in specific biological functions. On the other hand, the utilization of MSI in SPL research represents a more recent development that has started to provide interesting descriptive observations regarding the distribution of specific classes of SPLs within tissues. Thus, it is the aim of this review to discuss how MSI technology has been employed to extend the study of SPL metabolism and the type of information that has been obtained from model membranes, single cells and tissues. We envision this discussion as a complementary compendium to the excellent technical reviews recently published about the specifics of MSI technologies, including their application to SPL analysis (Fuchs et al., 2010; Berry et al., 2011; Ellis et al., 2013; Eberlin et al., 2011; Kraft and Klitzing, 2014).",

Two groups of current fluctuations which the average duration differs by two orders of magnitude can be distinguished. We assume that these differences in the duration of current fluctuations are associated with a different number of SDS molecules in the walls of the putative toroidal hydrophilic pores. We associated short pulses with the formation of short-lived lipid hydrophilic pores. Impulses of greater duration (steps) were associated with the formation of hydrophilic pores, the walls of which contain detergent. Taking into account the characteristics of these pores, we estimated the pore energy, as well as the edge energy of these two kinds of pores. We believe that the flip-flop of SDS molecules in liposomes is provided by long-lived pores, and the contents of the liposome leakage occurs through all pores.",

In this work, the interaction between quercetin and asolectin-based magnetoliposomes was investigated by monitoring the hydration degree, vibrational, rotational and translational mobility parameters of the system as well as its thermodynamic properties. The efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite magnetic nanoparticles was detected by high resolution-continuum source flame atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS FAAS). The magnetic behavior of the system was studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) technique. The size and surface charge of magnetoliposomes were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential (\u03b6-potential) measurements. The influence of quercetin on the physico-chemical parameters of the magnetoliposomes was evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. In vitro antioxidant and antitumoral assays were also performed for the magnetoliposomes. An insertion of quercetin into magnetoliposomes reduced the efficiency of the encapsulation of maghemite nanoparticles by 11%, suggesting a significant interaction between flavonoid and nanoparticles in a specific region of the system. Quercetin discreetly decreased the saturation magnetization of magnetoliposomes, but did not affect the superparamagnetic behavior of the system. 31P and 1H NMR results showed that quercetin did not alter the inverted hexagonal system phase state but decreased lipid polar head mobility. The flavonoid also seems to reorient the choline group above the bilayer phosphate membrane plane, as indicated by \u03b6-potential system values. FTIR, NMR and DSC responses showed that quercetin disordered the carbonyl and the methylene regions of the magnetoliposomes. Quercetin, as the nanoparticles, seems to be located in the polar head regions of magnetoliposomes, ordering it and diminishing the lipid intermolecular communication in the membrane carbonyl and non-polar regions. The lipid peroxidation of the magnetoliposomes was prevented 8-fold by the presence of quercetin in the system. Also, the flavonoid was responsible for a 45% reduction in the viability of glioma cells. Location and interactions between quercetin and magnetoliposomes components were discussed in order to be correlated with the results of biological activity, contributing to the design of more stable and efficient magnetoliposomes to be applied as contrast and antitumoral agents.",

Aurora\u2122 consists of an Au55 gold nanoparticle (about 1.4\u2009nm in diameter) capped with triphenylphosphine ligands and a single diglyceride (distearoyl glycerol) ligand. Gold nanoparticles have been incorporated in the past inside liposomes, or grafted onto their surfaces, with diagnostic or therapeutic aims. Including the gold nanoparticles in a stable form within the lipid bilayers has serious technical difficulties. We have tested the hypothesis that, because of the diglyceride ligand, Aurora\u2122 would allow the easy incorporation of gold nanoclusters into cell membranes or lipid bilayers. Our results show that Aurora\u2122 readily incorporates into lipid bilayers, particularly when they are in the fluid phase, i.e. the state in which cell membranes exist. Calorimetric, fluorescence polarization or fluorescence confocal microscopy concur in showing that bilayer-embedded Aurora\u2122hardly changes the physical properties of the bilayers, nor does it perturb the phase equilibrium in lipid mixtures giving rise to lateral phase separation in the plane of the membrane. Atomic force microscopy shows, in fluid bilayers, well-resolved particles, 1.2\u20132.9\u2009nm in height, that are interpreted as single Aurora\u2122conjugates. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy allows the clear observation of lipid bilayers with an enhanced contrast due to the Aurora\u2122 gold nanoparticles; the single particles can be resolved at high magnification.

While the area compressibility modulus did not change significantly, the bending modulus and water permeability of the bilayer was found to increase with increasing mole fraction of DSPE-PEG. This increase was more pronounced for higher molecular weight PEG. The measured bending modulus agreed with that predicted by scaling theory only at low mole fractions of DSPE-PEG. The water permeability was also measured as a function of the increase in area per lipid (due to steric repulsion between PEG chains), and for the same area per lipid, the PEG chain with MW 550 provided a greater resistance to water transport across the vesicle membrane compared to PEG 1000 and 2000. Lysis tension of the membrane, determined by osmotic lysis method at different loading rates showed a decrease in membrane strength on inclusion of the polymer lipid.

The anticipation of the adapted membrane properties is of high relevance to increase the targetability of such drugs. Herein, natural lipids extracted from Escherichia coli -phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL)- are used to form biomimetic membranes constituted by several PE:lipid ratios using the Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett techniques. The use of these techniques and the natural myriad of each lipid structures that constitute the biological E.coli membrane establishes a simple and reproducible model to evaluate the lipid-lipid interactions. PE and PG present similar shape and size, thus establish ideal and fluid -liquid expanded (LE) state - mixtures, whereas the differences between PE and CL motivate the formation of non-ideal and fluid (LE state) mixtures. The same physical state and the minor differences in elasticity (differences in the inverse of the compressibility modulus < 15\u2009mN\u00b7m\u22121) between both systems regardless the PE content in the (PE:lipid) mixture suggest that the changes in the lipid composition influence the membrane proteins function rather than affecting the rigidity of the bacterial membrane.",

     "abstract": "Cells contain high levels of macromolecular crowding; understanding how macromolecular crowding impacts the behaviour of biological systems can give new insights into biological phenomena and disease pathologies. In this study, we assess the effect of macromolecular crowding on the catalytic activity of the biomembrane binding protein phospholipase A1 (PLA1). Using 3D-printed equilibrium dialysis chambers we show that macromolecular crowding increases the binding of PLA1 to lipid vesicles. However, using a mass spectrometry assay of the hydrolysis of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) by PLA1 we surprisingly find that macromolecular crowding decreases the reaction rate and causes early cessation of the catalytic activity of PLA1. Using kinetic equilibrium modelling, we are able to estimate the effect of macromolecular crowding on the association and dissociation rate constants for PLA1 binding to the lipid vesicles. These data, coupled with particle sizing measurements enable us to construct a model to explain the early cessation of catalytic activity of PLA1 with increasing levels of macromolecular crowding. This model suggests that compositional changes in the membrane, due to PLA1 action, lead to the formation of larger vesicles, which deactivate the protein. This process is more rapid in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents, suggesting that a more detailed understanding of the effects of macromolecular crowding on membrane dynamics is required to understand membrane interacting proteins in macromolecularly crowded environments. The implications of this discovery are significant given the wide range of roles of membrane fusion and fission in neurocognitive processes and the failure of these processes in neurodegenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "The C-terminal helix of the Bcl-xl is known to initiate the membrane insertion of the protein by anchoring into the mitochondrial outer membrane. The C-terminal charged residues of that helix, R232 and K233, are reported to have an important structural role in the process of that insertion. The present work provides a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic contribution of these residues on the membrane insertion energy-profile, calculated from the Adaptive Biasing Force based MD simulations of 2.67\u2009\u03bcs altogether. Interestingly, the effect of the single neutralizing mutations at the C-terminus, i.e. K233A or R232A, is easily tolerated by the peptide without impacting the nature of insertion energy-profile, indicating the efficiency of one positively charged residue to drive the insertion. Whereas a double mutant, i.e. R232A and K233A, makes a significant impact on the energy-profile by destabilizing the membrane-associated states, as well as the membrane-embedded states. The finding provides molecular-level mechanistic insight. The water-mediated interaction formed by the peptide polar side chains within the bilayer core is found to modulate the membrane response during peptide insertion and that subsequently regulates the insertion mechanism. Mutation of the C-terminal residues eventually alters such a cascade of interactions that results in an insertion through energetically more expensive pathway. Since any one of the positively charged residues at the terminal is critical to ensure the membrane insertion, it appears that the natural selection of \u2018two\u2019 instead of \u2018one\u2019 charged residue is redundant in the context of membrane anchoring but may be important for other biochemical events.",

We used Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopic techniques to study the lipid vesicles while the solid supported bilayers were characterized by using electrochemical experiments (cyclic voltammetry and impedance). Valproic acid (Valp) was either present in the solution or incorporated into the lipid structure. As the Valp:DMPC ratio increases the phase transition temperature decreases while the phase transition becomes less marked. Moreover, for the Valp:DMPC complex species a slight decrease in the number of gauche isomers was observed relative to the number of trans isomers what corresponds to an increase in the packing density of the acylic chains. Based on derived electrical properties of the supported membranes it can be concluded that Valp induces the formation of pores and other defects in the lipid films. Valp incorporated into the membrane is seriously detrimental to the bilayer stability.",

Study subjects within the upper quartile (Q4) had significantly higher body height (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), waist and hip circumferences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and inflammatory markers (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) values than those in the lower quartile (Q1).

Resistin was also independently associated with hs-CRP in women free of CVD, suggesting that resistin may be related to low-grade inflammation among obese subjects in the absence of overt CVD.",

Nowadays, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) serves as a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular disorders and, simultaneously, affects whole body metabolism homeostasis. Therefore, an open question is whether ECS, apart from decreasing blood pressure, also affects cardiac muscle metabolism in hypertensive conditions. All experiments were conducted on a genetic model of primary hypertension i.e. spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) served as a normotensive control. ECS was chronically activated by 2-weeks intraperitoneal injections of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor \u2013 URB597. Lipid analyses in the left ventricle and serum were based on ex vivo heart perfusion in Langendorff perfusion system, thin layer chromatography, and gas liquid chromatography. The total expression of selected proteins was determined using Western blot as well as immunohistochemical techniques. As expected, URB597 markedly reduced systolic as well as mean blood pressures in SHRs. Moreover, prolonged FAAH inhibition resulted in stimulation of 3H-palmitate uptake and incorporation into different lipid fractions in cardiomyocytes in the hypertensive as well as normotensive conditions. An increase in fatty acid oxidation caused by URB597 treatment was observed only in WKY rats, but not SHRs, and was accompanied by an elevation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) and \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (\u03b2-HAD) expressions. Chronic activation of ECS significantly upregulates palmitate uptake and its esterification but not oxidation in the SHR\u2019s myocardium.",

Increasing LDS association to target cells and cargo delivery is crucial to bolstering overall nanodrug efficacy. Our laboratory aims to develop LDSs for molecular therapeutics aimed at vascular pathology. We have previously established a liposome platform that is an effective delivery system for RNA interference in vascular cell types by using polyethylene glycol (PEG) decorated liposomes bearing an octa-arginine (R8) cell penetrating peptide (CPP). Further tailoring liposome membranes to mimic vascular cell membrane lipid constituents may be a promising strategy for increasing cargo delivery. Here we aimed to develop liposomal formulations that could make use of diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylserine (PS), naturally occurring lipid species that are known to influence vascular cell function, as a facile and efficient means to increase nanodrug efficacy without compromising clinical viability. We investigated the ability of DAG and PS to amplify the cellular uptake of our previously established LDS platform loaded with small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) cargo. Cellular fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed in conjunction with quantitative cell association assays and cytotoxicity assays to analyze the effect of DAG/PS on the differential delivery of fluorescently-tagged liposomes to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and on liposomal-mediated toxicity. In these studies, significant, dose-dependent increases in association to target cells were observed, as well as cell-type specific effects on cell viability. The stability and encapsulation-efficiency of the DAG/PS-modified LDSs were analyzed by standard nanoparticle characterization methods, and siRNA transfection efficacy was quantified to gauge delivery potential as a function of DAG/PS modification. Our results suggest that the signaling lipids tested here imbue our LDS architectures with increased therapeutic potential, without compromising stability, encapsulation efficiency, or biocompatibility, thus presenting a natural strategy to increase nanodrug efficacy and specificity.",

These amphipathic polymers rapidly and spontaneously fragment membranes into water-soluble discs holding a section of bilayer. This allows structures of complexes found in vivo to be prepared without resorting to synthetic detergents or artificial lipids.

While a lot is known about the metabolite profile of the cells and about the biochemical pathways through which these metabolites are produced, the cellular localization of the biosynthetic machineries and the importance of this localization to the regulation of the metabolism has often been given less attention. This derives from the fact that, for several of these pathways, the enzymes involved are found colocalized in one compartment where their specific localization is unlikely to influence their function. The sphingolipid (SL) metabolic pathway is a notable exception to this as SL synthetic enzymes are laid out on a specific pattern across the secretory compartments. Such compartmentalized organization of the SL synthesis has functional implications as it makes the fine-tuned regulation of the process possible by allowing cells to regulate specific segments of the pathway in response to stimuli and for adaptation. The organization, dynamics, and regulation of the SLs and their biosynthetic machinery have been investigated using imaging-based methods.

A number of OH\u22efO and CH\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the hydroxymethyl groups of the head groups of NLT molecules belonging to opposite layers as well as NH\u22efO and CH\u22efO hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules belonging to the same layer, besides dispersion interactions between the all-trans hydrocarbon chains, stabilize the overall supramolecular organization of the self-assembled, interdigitated bilayer system. d-Spacings obtained from powder X-ray diffraction studies on all the NATs exhibited a linear dependence on the acyl chain length, suggesting that all of them adopt an interdigitated bilayer structure. These observations are relevant to developing structure-activity relationships for these amphiphiles and their analogs such as ceramides, N-acylserinols, N-acylalaninols and N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)acylamides.",

The stability of vesicles can affect their performance and depends on various experimental conditions. How bio-related ions affect vesicle morphology is poorly understood in some cases. Herein, we investigated changes in vesicle morphology influenced by cation in the static and flowing environments. The effects of different mono- and di-valent metal cations on the morphology of lipid vesicles were systematically studied using the various techniques. The results showed that divalent cations caused significant aggregation or fusion of lipid vesicles, but monovalent cations had little effect on the vesicle morphology. Cation binding increased the net surface potential of vesicles, leading to changes in the zeta potential. The same qualitative kinetics were observed for cations that had the same valence at the same ionic strength. However, different types of cations gave different quantitative effects. The order of the ability to destroy the vesicle morphology was Cu2+\u2009>\u2009Mg2+\u2009>\u2009Ca2+\u2009>\u2009Na+\u2009>\u2009K+.

     "abstract": "Membrane fusion is an integral part of the viral infection. The fusion between an enveloped virus and a host cell is the first step for viral infection. It has been a long-standing effort to develop anti-viral therapies involving inhibitors that block the fusion between virus and host cell. However, these inhibitors are highly specific against a particular virus. Development of generic inhibitors is extremely essential in the current scenario to overcome emerging and re-emerging contagious diseases that cause millions of fatalities every year. In this work, we have studied the effect of three different peptides derived from a phagosomal protein coronin 1. Coronin 1 is being recruited at the phagosomal membrane of Mycobacterium infected host cells and is implicated in preventing lysosomal fusion. Interestingly, coronin 1 contains tryptophan-aspartic acid repeats, which are conserved across species. In order to understand the mechanistic basis of coronin 1 function, we designed peptides that contain conserved tryptophan-aspartic acid region, and evaluated their membrane binding, effect on membrane fusion, depth-dependent membrane ordering and water penetration into the membrane. Our results demonstrate that these peptides exclusively bind to membranes in presence of negatively charged lipids and do not influence lipid mixing. However, two peptides, TG-23 and GL-22, substantially reduce the extent of content mixing. The reduction in content mixing in presence of TG-23 and GL-22 could be interpreted in terms of their inhibitory effect on water penetration into the membrane. We envisage that these results will contribute to the development of the generic peptide-based membrane fusion inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Cell function is tied to the interactions that occur within and across the cell membrane. Therefore, understanding membrane-affiliated interactions is important to many biomedical applications. Advancing the body of knowledge about these interactions will lead to discoveries in biomarker detection and therapeutic targets for disease detection and treatment. Model membrane systems are an effective way to study membrane proteins for such discoveries, allowing for stable protein structure and maintaining native activity. Bicelles, disc-shaped lipid bilayers created by combining long- and short-chain phospholipids, are the model membrane system of focus in this study. Bicelles are accessible from both sides and have a wide size range, which makes them attractive for studying membrane interactions without affecting function. In this work, bicelles were functionalized with peptoids to alter the edge chemistry. Peptoids are suitable for this application because of the large diversity of available side chain chemistries that can be easily incorporated in a sequence-specific manner. The peptoid sequence consists of three functional regions to promote insertion into the edge of bicelles. The insertion sequence at the C-terminus contains two alkyl chains and two hydrophobic, chiral aromatic groups that anchor into the bicelle edge. The facially amphipathic helix contains chiral aromatic groups on one side that interact with the lipid tails and positively charged groups on the other side, which interact with the lipid head groups. Thiol groups are included at the N-terminus to allow for visualization of peptoid location in the bicelle. Bicelle morphology and size were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Peptoid location in the bicelle was determined by attachment of gold nanoparticles, which confirmed preferential incorporation of the peptoid into the bicelle edge with 82% specificity. Additionally, the peptoid-functionalized bicelles are of similar size and morphology to non-functionalized bicelles. Results from this study show that peptoid-functionalized bicelles are a promising model membrane system with potential applications in biosensors or bioseparations.",

     "abstract": "Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that LDL can be oxidised by iron in lysosomes. As the iron-storage protein ferritin might enter lysosomes by autophagy, we have investigated the ability of ferritin to catalyse LDL oxidation at lysosomal pH. LDL was incubated with ferritin at 37\u2009\u00b0C and pH 4.5 and its oxidation monitored spectrophotometrically at 234\u2009nm by the formation of conjugated dienes and by measuring oxidised lipids by HPLC or a tri-iodide assay. Iron released from ferritin was measured using the ferrous iron chelator bathophenanthroline and by ultrafiltration followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. LDL was oxidised effectively by ferritin (0.05\u20130.2\u2009\u03bcM). The oxidation at lysosomal pH (pH 4.5) was much faster than at pH 7.4. Ferritin increased cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide, total lipid hydroperoxides and 7-ketocholesterol. Iron was released from ferritin at acidic pH. The iron chelators, diethylenetriaminepentaacetate and EDTA, and antioxidant N,N\u05f3-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine inhibited the oxidation considerably, but not entirely. The antioxidant tempol did not inhibit the initial oxidation of LDL, but inhibited its later oxidation. Cysteamine, a lysosomotropic antioxidant, inhibited the initial oxidation of LDL in a concentration-dependent manner, however, the lower concentrations exhibited a pro-oxidant effect at later times, which was diminished and then abolished as the concentration increased. These results suggest that ferritin might play a role in lysosomal LDL oxidation and that antioxidants that accumulate in lysosomes might be a novel therapy for atherosclerosis.",

     "abstract": "About twenty years ago, the functional lipid raft model of the plasma membrane was published. It took into account decades of research showing that cellular membranes are not just homogenous mixtures of lipids and proteins. Lateral anisotropy leads to assembly of membrane domains with specific lipid and protein composition regulating vesicular traffic, cell polarity, and cell signaling pathways in a plethora of biological processes. However, what appeared to be a clearly defined entity of clustered raft lipids and proteins became increasingly fluid over the years, and many of the fundamental questions about biogenesis and structure of lipid rafts remained unanswered. Experimental obstacles in visualizing lipids and their interactions hampered progress in understanding just how big rafts are, where and when they are formed, and with which proteins raft lipids interact. In recent years, we have begun to answer some of these questions and sphingolipids may take center stage in re-defining the meaning and functional significance of lipid rafts. In addition to the archetypical cholesterol-sphingomyelin raft with liquid ordered (Lo) phase and the liquid-disordered (Ld) non-raft regions of cellular membranes, a third type of microdomains termed ceramide-rich platforms (CRPs) with gel-like structure has been identified.

A limited number of proteins is known to specifically and strongly bind SM or CPE. These proteins are either toxins produced by non-mammalian organisms, subunits or fragments of toxins or a protein that has similar structure to a toxin.

Ceramides have been recognized as bioactive molecules and their metabolizing enzymes are attractive targets in cancer therapy and other diseases. The molecular mechanism of action of cellular ceramides are still not fully established, with insights into roles through modification of lipid rafts, creation of ceramide platforms, ceramide channels, or through regulation of direct protein effectors such as protein phosphatases and kinases. Recently, the \u2018Many Ceramides\u2019 hypothesis focuses on distinct pools of subcellular ceramides and ceramide species as potential defined bioactive entities. Traditional methods that measure changes in ceramide levels in the whole cell, such as mass spectrometry, fluorescent ceramide analogues, and ceramide antibodies, fail to differentiate specific bioactive species at the subcellular level. However, a few ceramide binding proteins have been reported, and a smaller subgroup within these, have been shown to translocate to ceramide-enriched membranes, revealing these localized pools of bioactive ceramides. In this review we want to discuss and consolidate these works and explore the possibility of defining these binding proteins as new tools are emerging to visualize bioactive ceramides in cells. Our goal is to encourage the scientific community to explore these ceramide partners, to improve techniques to refine the list of these binding partners, making possible the identification of specific domains that recognize and bind ceramides to be used to visualize the \u2018Many Ceramides\u2019 in the cell.",

Among many biomolecules, two are of prime importance for lubrication: hyaluronic acid (HA) and phospholipids (PL). The purpose of this study is to discuss a mechanism of interaction between these two components and how their synergies contribute to nanobiolubrication of articular cartilage. Preliminary molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate these interactions by adopting a capstan-like mechanism of action. By applying a constant pulling force to both ends of a HA molecule, wrapped around a PL micelle, we viewed the rotation of the PL micelle. The simulations were performed upon two physicochemical constraints: force- and solvent-dependency. The results show the efficiency of rotation from intermolecular bond creation and annihilation. We found a direct relation between the available surface of the micelle and the magnitude of the force, which varies significantly through the unwinding. The movement of the attached molecules is characterized by a slide-to-roll relation, which is affected by the viscosity of the surrounding medium. As a consequence, two solvents were studied for specific force conditions and the molecular dynamics simulation exhibited double the slide-to-roll coefficient for the viscous solvent as compared to its low-viscosity limit.",

DRMs of platelet membranes were isolated in 4 experimental groups: control; ADP, with platelets stimulated by 20\u2009\u03bcM ADP and 5\u2009mM CaCl2; ticagrelor, with platelets incubated by ticagrelor 4\u2009\u03bcM methanol dissolved; and ticagrelor\u2009+\u2009ADP, with incubation by ticagrelor followed by stimulation by ADP as above.After mass spectrometry analysis, we found 16 species of sphingomyelins in platelet membrane DRMs. We also found that treatment with ticagrelor and stimulation by ADP could induce changes in the composition, distribution and concentration of sphingomyelins in membranes of platelets. In all groups, the predominant species of sphingomyelins in platelet membrane was d18:1/16:0.Taken together, our results show that stimulation by ADP or inhibition by ticagrelor changed the level and composition of sphingomyelins in platelet membranes. These changes might be considered as reorganization or new recruitment of certain types of sphingomyelins through the membrane.",

     "abstract": "Lyotropic non-lamellar liquid crystalline (LLC) nanoparticles are attractive nanocarriers for drug delivery, particularly for the solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs. Due to the reported problems of complement activation and cytotoxicity of most investigated Pluronic F127-stabilized cubosomes and hexosomes, there is an interest in introducing safe stabilizers for these LLC nanodispersions. Citrem appears to be the stabilizer of choice for the colloidal stabilization of these LLC nano-self-assemblies owing to its hemocompatiblity and poor activation of the complement system. This anionic food-grade emulsifier in combination with soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC) can be used to introduce a library of hemocompatible lamellar and non-lamellar liquid crystalline nanodispersions at different lipid compositions. We found that batch-to-batch variability in citrem composition is associated with slight alterations in the size, structural characteristics, and surface charge of the produced citrem/SPC nanoparticles. Further, we report on the temperature-triggered alterations in these nano-self-assemblies at different lipid compositions by using synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The addition of citrem at different temperatures induces lamellar to non-lamellar structural transitions as evident from the appearance of inverse bicontinuous cubic Pn3m and discontinuous hexagonal (H2) phases, respectively, upon increasing citrem concentration and varying temperature in the range of 5\u201359\u2009\u00b0C. Citrem/SPC nanoparticles are attractive for use in the development of nanocarriers for drug delivery owing to their structural tunability and hemocompatiblity.",

Two nitroxide spin probes, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl-4-yl hexadecanoate (TP, TEMPO-Palmitate) and 2-Ethyl-2-(15-methoxy-15-oxopentadecyl)-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyloxy (16-DSE), are utilized in the study. TEMPO-Palmitate has the reporting EPR moiety located at the top of this spin probe, while 16-DSE has the reporting EPR moiety located at the tail of the spin probe. These two probes enable us to sample the surface and the middle of the phospholipid bilayer, respectively. All EPR measurements are done above the melting points of all four phospholipids when the bilayer is in the liquid crystal phase, the physiologically relevant phase. Due to non-linear spectral line fitting, the EPR spectral parameters are extracted with high precision. The results show that there are two populations of A\u03b2(25\u201335) and that one of them is located in the hydrophobic phospholipid layer below the hydrophilic headgroup region. The second population appears to be weakly coupled to the surface of the bilayer. Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions affect the insertion of A\u03b2(25\u201335) in the bilayer.

The present study reports on a biophysical investigation of these modulatory effects on the synthetic mastoparan-like peptide L1A (IDGLKAIWKKVADLLKNT-NH2). At pH 10.0 L1A was 6 times more efficient in lysing large anionic (1-palmitoyl-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC):1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG)/(8:2)) unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) than at pH 4.0. Despite the reduction of 60% in the L1A net charge in basic pH its affinity for this vesicle was almost insensitive to pH. On the other hand, L1A insertion into monolayers was dramatically influenced by subphase condition, showing that, in the neutral and basic subphases, the peptide induced surface pressure changes that surpassed the membrane lateral pressure, being able to destabilize a bilayer structure. In addition, in the basic subphase, visualization of the compression isotherms of co-spread 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC):POPG (8:2)\u2009+\u20094.8\u2009mol% L1A showed that the peptide induced significant changes in solid lipid domains, indicating its capability in perturbing lipid-packing. An insight into L1A lytic activity was also obtained in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) using phase contrast microscopy. The suppression of L1A lytic activity at acidic pH is in keeping with its lower insertion capability and ability to disturb the lipid monolayer. The lytic activity observed under neutral and basic conditions showed a quick and stochastic leakage following a lag-time. The permeability and the leakage-time averaged over at least 14 single GUVs were dependent on the bulk condition. At basic pH, permeability is higher and quicker than in a neutral medium in good accordance with the lipid-packing perturbation.",

Different NLC were characterized and compared in terms of particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), drug entrapment percentage and drug loading capacity. The results indicated that NLC containing black seed oil has the smallest size. Other features like PDI, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency were the same for all the liquid lipids.

     "abstract": "Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that binds and permeabilizes the cell membranes of Gram-positive bacteria. Membrane permeabilization requires both calcium and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the target membrane, and it correlates with the formation of an oligomer that likely comprises eight subunits, which are evenly distributed between the two membrane leaflets. In both bacterial cells and model membranes, changes in the fatty acyl composition of the membrane phospholipids can prevent permeabilization. We here used liposomes to study the effect of phospholipids containing oleoyl and other fatty acyl residues on daptomycin activity, and made the following observations: (1) Oleic acid residues inhibited permeabilization when part not only of PG, but also of other phospholipids (PC or cardiolipin). (2) When included in an otherwise daptomycin-susceptible lipid mixture, even 10% of dioleoyl lipid (DOPC) can strongly inhibit permeabilization. (3) The inhibitory effect of fatty acyl residues appears to correlate more with their chain length than with unsaturation. (4) Under all conditions tested, permeabilization coincided with octamer formation, whereas tetramers were observed on membranes that were not permeabilized. Overall, our findings further support the notion that the octamer is indeed the functional transmembrane pore, and that fatty acyl residues may prevent pore formation by preventing the alignment of tetramers across the two membrane leaflets.",

In this study, the hydrate crystal (Cr), the liquid crystalline (LC) phase and the glassy state formations of 6-O-acyl trehalose fatty acid monoester (TREn) were examined under in a desiccated system. TREn (n\u202f=\u202f10, 12, 14, 16) formed monohydrate Cr and showed the hydrate Cr-glassy fluid lamellar LC (L\u03b1) phase transition via dehydration in the heating process. Here, L\u03b1 phase for TRE10 and TRE12 was kinetically formed by the dehydration below the glass transition temperature (Tg). On the dehydration temperature (Tdeh), Tgs, and heat capacity changes (\u0394Cps) at these Tgs, no distinct effects by the difference of the acyl chain length were recognized, possibly because the core structure of containing sugar hydrate Cr or sugar moieties should be similar regardless of the acyl chain length. Besides, TRE10 having a relatively high hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance (HLB) afforded to form the cubic LC (Q) phase and the corresponding glassy phase, while TRE14 and TRE16 having low HLB afforded the L\u03b1 phase as well as the corresponding glassy phases above Tg. TRE12 having middle HLB afforded both LCs and the corresponding glassy phase by controlling the kinetics of LC-LC phase transition between L\u03b1 and Q phases. Furthermore, the anomalous reversible phase transition during both the heating and cooling processes was also ascertained in the glassy phase for TRE16, which was considered the phase transition between glassy L\u03b1 and glassy lamellar gel (L\u03b2) phase. It greatly empathizes the two-dimensional trehalose glass layer and fluid hydrocarbon chains in the TREn glassy phase. Thus, in this study, it was demonstrated that TREn as the simplest trehalose lipid exhibited the glassy formation performance as well as the hydrate Cr formation, which showed less chain length dependence, together with the LC formation and the phase transition between glassy L\u03b1 and glassy L\u03b2 phase, which depended on chain length greatly.",

A complete overview on discoveries about the general biophysical and physicochemical properties of the known ceramide species\u2019 is provided. The ceramides are one of the three major components of the lipid matrix and mainly govern its properties and structure. They are shown to exhibit very little redundancy, despite the minor differences in their chemical structure. The results are discussed, compared to each other as well as the current base of knowledge. New interesting aspects and concepts are concluded or suggested. A novel interpretation of the 3-dimensional structure of the lipid matrix and its influence on the barrier function will be discussed. The most important conclusion is the presentation of a new and up to date theoretical model of the nanostructure of the short periodicity phase. The model suggests three perpendicular layers: The rigid head group region, the rigid chain region and, a liquid-like overlapping middle layer. The general principle of the skin barrier function is highlighted in regard to this structure and the ceramides biophysical and physicochemical properties. As a result of these considerations, the entropy vs. enthalpy principle is introduced, shedding light on the function as well as the effectiveness of the skin barrier. Additionally, general ideas to effectively overcome this barrier principle for dermal and transdermal delivery of actives or how to use it for specific targeting of the stratum corneum are proposed.",

The DSC and DPH anisotropy data indicated that TO embedded into DPPC membrane lowered the enthalpy (\u0394Hm) and temperature (Tm) of the main phase transition as well its cooperativity. Fluidization of the membrane at a lowered temperature was accompanied by formation of mixed structures of tocopherol-enriched domains. SAXS studies showed the formation of various ordered structures in DPPC gel-phase during incorporation of TO into the bilayer, as evidenced by the existence of lamellar phases with repeat distances (d) of 6.13 and 6.87\u2009nm, assigned to TO-enriched domains and a lamellar, liquid-ordered DPPC phase with d\u2009=\u20098.45\u2009nm at increasing TO concentrations with lowering and broadening of the Bragg peaks, and diffuse scattering, characteristic of a fluid L\u03b1 phase, were observed. In DPPC fluid-phase, the increasing presence of TO at low concentrations resulted in the appearance of a liquid-ordered phase with repeat d\u2009=\u20096.9\u2009nm coexistent with a lamellar structure with d\u2009=\u20099.2\u2009nm, assigned to liquid-disordered structures. An increasing repeat distance observed with raising the TO amount in the DPPC bilayer evolved from an increasing interlamellar water layer of increasing thickness. Presence of TO facilitated penetration of water molecules into the acyl chain region which decreased van der Waals interactions in the bilayer. The DSC, SAXS, and fluorescence anisotropy data established that TO exhibited pronounced disruptive activity in DPPC membranes compared to \u03b1-tocopherol. The driving force of the observed action was attributed to electrostatic and dipole interactions of the acidic moiety with the polar head group of phospholipids in the interface region of the bilayer.",

The in-plane elasticity of a monolayer formed at air-water interface by 1,2-dipalmitoyl- sn-glycero- 3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipids was reduced in the presence of the ILs. The x-ray reflectivity studies on polymer supported lipid bilayer have shown the bilayer to shrink and correspondingly exhibit an increase in electron density.

     "abstract": "Fusion and fission of cellular membranes involve dramatic, protein-mediated changes in membrane curvature. Many of the experimental methods useful for investigating curvature sensing or generation require specialized equipment. We have developed a system based on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) in which lipid tubules are simple to produce and several types of membrane remodeling events can be readily imaged using widely available instrumentation (e.g., tubule fission and/or membrane budding). Briefly, high ionic strength during lipid bilayer deposition results in incorporation of excess lipids in the SLB. After sequentially washing with water and physiological ionic strength buffer solutions, lipid tubules form spontaneously. We find that tubule formation results from solution-dependent spreading of the SLB; washing from water into physiological ionic strength buffer solution leads to expansion of the bilayer and formation of tubules. Conversely, washing from physiological buffer into water results in contraction of the membrane and loss of tubules. We demonstrate the utility of these supported tubulated bilayers, termed \u201cSTuBs,\u201d with an investigation of Sar1B, a small Ras family G-protein known to influence membrane curvature. The addition of Sar1B to STuBs results in dramatic changes in tubule topology and eventual tubule fission.

     "abstract": "Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy was used to highlight the interactions between two photosensitisers (PS) of different geometries, TPPmOH4 and a glycoconjugated analogous, TPPDegMan, and lipid bilayers modelling retinoblastoma cell membranes. Retinoblastoma is a rare disease occurring in young infants, for whom conservative treatments may present harmful side-effects. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is expected to induce less side-effects, as the photosensitiser is only activated when the tumour is illuminated.Since efficiency of the treatment relies on photosensitiser penetration in cancer cells, bilayers with three lipid compositions - pure SOPC, SOPC/SOPE/SOPS/Chol (56:23:11:10) and SOPC/SOPE/SOPS/Chol/CL (42:32:9:8:6) \u2013 were used as plasma and mitochondria model membranes. FTIR spectra showed that the interaction of the PSs with the lipid bilayers impacted the lipid organization of the latter, causing significant spectral variations. Both studied photosensitisers inserted at the level of lipid hydrophobic chains, increasing chain fluidity and disorder. This was confirmed by surface pressure measurements. Photosensitisers - TPPmOH4 more than TPPDegMan - also interacted with the polar region of the bilayer, forming hydrogen bonds with phosphate groups that induced major shifts of phosphate absorption bands. This difference in PS interaction with moieties in the polar region was more pronounced with the models with complex lipid composition.",

     "abstract": "Sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol are major lipid components of biological membranes involved in the formation of ordered domains. In this study, we investigated the biophysical properties of milk-SM bilayers and determined the effect of cholesterol. The thermotropic phase behaviours of milk-SM and milk-SM/cholesterol mixtures were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high flux synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD). The melting phase transition temperature determined for fully hydrated milk-SM bilayers was Tm\u2009=\u200934.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u00b0C. The thermotropic phase behavior of milk-SM is complex, reflecting the mixture of different molecular species. Structural reorganisations successively occurring on heating of fully hydrated milk-SM bilayers were interpreted as follows: i) melting of C16:0-SM, ii) conversion of long and saturated SM species from fully interdigitated (L\u03b21) to mixed interdigitated (L\u03b22) lamellar structures evidencing gel phase polymorphism and then iii) transition to the fluid liquid-crystal L\u03b1 phase. We demonstrated that cholesterol modulates the physical properties of milk-SM bilayers and that building up of the lamellar liquid-ordered Lo phase is completed for 33\u2009mol% of cholesterol. The ordering effect of cholesterol on milk-SM bilayers and the temperature-independent behavior of the Lo phase formed by milk-SM/cholesterol complexes were characterized. The findings of this work will contribute in a better understanding of the biological functions exerted by the milk-SM as a function of its phase state and interactions with cholesterol (e.g. hypocholesterolemic effect).",

Acylceramides are essential components of LPP structures, and their absence influences skin barriers under physiological and pathological conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and dry skin. Although topical applications of acylceramide have been shown to facilitate maintenance of the skin barrier, it is unknown whether topically applied acylceramides are incorporated into intercellular lipids to form LPP structures. Thus, we assessed the effects of topical treatments with monomodal acylceramides on the formation of LPP structures in a surfactant-insulted reconstructed human epidermis model using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. In SAXS experiments, LPP structures give rise to a diffraction peak which indicates the presence of a structure with a 13\u202fnm real space repeat distance. LPP patterns of intercellular lipid matrixes in the SC were disrupted\u2019 by surfactant treatments and were recovered by topical acylceramide treatments. TEM images also showed specific repeating patterns of LPP structures, indicating that topical acylceramide treatments facilitate recovery of LPP structures in the SC. The present data show that the application of acylceramides might temporarily modify the lipid structure to resemble that of normal skin although the underlying cause of dry or diseased skin is not fully clarified.",

     "abstract": "Liposome solute permeability experiments are widely performed to gain information about lipid membrane characteristics. Spectroscopic methods are often used for this purpose, usually monitoring the leakage of a self-quenching fluorescent dye (e.g., carboxyfluorescein, CF) from the liposomes. Hereby, we investigate the effect of liposome-cuvette interactions, a seldom considered detail, on the results obtained from liposomal permeability experiments. The spontaneous leakage of CF from liposomes with different surface properties and phase states is followed using quartz and polystyrene cuvettes, and the results are compared. It is shown that for most lipid compositions the leakage profiles vary notably between different cuvette materials. Reproducibility of the measurements also varies depending on the cuvettes used, with polystyrene providing with more robust results. To explain these observations, the interaction of liposomes with polystyrene and quartz-like surfaces was characterized with the help of the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Our results show that, while liposomes seldom interact with polystyrene, quartz-liposome interactions are almost unavoidable and have a large impact on the leakage experiments mainly via two mechanisms: i) the rupturing of liposomes on the cuvette surface causing a fast release of encapsulated CF, and ii) the disruption of adsorbed liposomes caused by magnetic stirring. Depending on their composition, the liposomes interact in different ways with quartz, affecting thus the extent of each proposed mechanism. The experiments demonstrate the importance of considering the cuvette material when planning and conducting spectroscopic experiments with liposomes.",

Since then, this concept has been further developed and a large number of chemical reactions that fulfil totally or partially these criteria have been identified, contributing to widen the structural diversity in drug discovery campaigns, and providing chemical biologists with invaluable tools for the development of bioorthogonal reactions. In this context, several examples of the application of this concept in glycobiology and in the study of protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid and even protein-lipid interactions can be found.

Although there are many studies on lipid rafts, the direct observation of lipid rafts is still challenging owing to two critical reasons. One is the lack of an appropriate fluorescent probe mimicking the native behavior of raft lipids; fluorescent labeling often alters the intrinsic disposition of raft lipids. The other is their spatio-temporal stability; the size of lipid rafts is much smaller than the optical resolution of usual microscopy and their lifetime is much shorter than image acquisition duration. These issues are hampering the visualization of lipid rafts. Our review highlights the recent advances in microscopic techniques to visualize the partition and dynamic behavior of SMs, disclosing the detailed structure of lipid rafts. Moreover, we will elucidate the importance of SM-SM interactions in the stabilization of signaling platforms as lipid rafts.",

Novel approaches to combat these drug resistant bacteria are turning out to be crucial. This study aimed to synthesize novel fatty acid based cationic amphiphiles (FCA) that would serve as nano-drug carrier having intrinsic antibacterial activity. Three fatty acids oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid based cationic amphiphiles were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity. The application in the delivery of vancomycin (VCM) was demonstrated using oleic based cationic amphiphilic (OCA). OCA was self-assembled in aqueous media to prepare VCM loaded OCA vesicles. The particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency were found to be 132.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5\u202fnm, 0.167\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02, 18.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2\u202fmV and 61.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.8% respectively. The images from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the vesicles were spherical and bilayered. The release of VCM from OCA vesicles was sustained throughout the studied period of 72\u202fh. From in vitro studies, a significant antibacterial activity was observed for all three FCAs and it was found that, VCM loaded OCA vesicles displayed indifference and synergism against Gram positive methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus respectively (MRSA). In contrast to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of VCM against Gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), the synthesized FCAs were more potent against both the strains, further there was no synergism observed against either of the strains when VCM was encapsulated in OCA vesicles. The synergism against MRSA was further confirmed in in vivo studies using mouse infection model. These findings therefore suggest that, FCAs can make promising nano-carrier systems for the delivery of antibiotics to treat infections caused by multi drug resistant bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Cardiolipins have multiple vital functions within biological cell membranes, most notably in the energy metabolism associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. Considering their essential role, peroxidation of cardiolipins may plausibly have significant effects, as peroxidation is known to alter the functionality of lipid molecules. We used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study how peroxidation of cardiolipin affects the properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane. To this end, we explored what happens when varying fractions of fatty acid chains of cardiolipin are replaced by its four different oxidized products in systems modeling the inner mitochondrial membrane. We found that the oxidation of cardiolipin leads to a conformational change both in the backbone/head group and in chain regions of oxidized cardiolipin molecules. The oxidized groups were observed to shift closer to the membrane\u2013water interface region, where they formed hydrogen bonds with several other groups. Additionally, the conformational change turned out to decrease bilayer thickness, and to increase the area per lipid chain, though these changes were minor. The acyl chain conformational order of unoxidized lipids exposed to interactions with oxidized cardiolipins was increased in carbons 3\u20135 and decreased in carbons 13\u201317 due to the structural reorganization of the cardiolipin molecules. Overall, the results bring up that the conformation of cardiolipin is altered upon oxidation, suggesting that its oxidation may interfere its interactions with mitochondrial proteins and thereby affect cardiolipin-dependent cellular processes such as electron and proton transport.",

     "abstract": "The complex of mitochondrial protein cytochrome c (CytC) with anionic phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) plays a crucial role in the initiation of apoptosis by catalyzing lipid peroxidation in mitochondrial membranes. In our previous papers, we found that CytC and CL mixed in millimolar concentrations form a sediment showing microcrystals composed of nanospheres (Cyt-CL) of 11\u201312 and 8\u202fnm in diameter. The hypothesis was proposed that Cyt-CL, having hydrophobic shell, may appear inside the membrane lipid bilayer in mitochondria and peroxidase membrane phospholipids so initiating the apoptotic cascade. In this work, Cyt-CL complex dissolved in chloroform or hexane was investigated as a model of the complex in mitochondrial membranes. We used dynamic light scattering method to measure the size of the particles. The analysis of particles size distribution of Cyt-CL in chloroform allows to reveal three dominant diameters of 12.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.4, 7.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0, and 4.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fnm. The first two values are closed to those, earlier obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering method in Cyt-CL microcrystals, 11.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0 and 8.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202fnm. CL extracted in chloroform-methanol forms a real solution of particles with diameter of 0.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fnm. In methanol-water phase, CL and CL\u202f+\u202fCytC mixture form particles of 83.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.8 and 71.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.6\u202fnm, respectively. Apparently, cardiolipin in 50% methanol forms single-layer liposomes regardless of the presence of CytC in the medium. Partial unfolding of CytC in the complex was evidenced by (a) appearance of fluorescence of tyrosine and tryptophan residues and (b) disappearance of the absorption band at 699\u202fnm due to breakdown of heme iron \u2013 methionine bond\u202f>\u202fF\u22efS(Met80). In hydrophobic solvent Cyt-CL exhibited quasi-lipoperoxidase and lipoxygenase activity as was shown in kinetic measurements of chemiluminescence enhanced by coumarin C-525, a selective sensitizer of chemiluminescence, associated with reactions of lipid peroxyl radicals.Our data in this model system do not contradict the hypothesis (Vladimirov, Y.A. et al.

     "abstract": "For this study mixtures based on the ceramides [NS] (NS\u202f=\u202fnon-hydroxy-sphingosine) and [AP] (AP\u202f=\u202f\u03b1-hydroxy-phytosphingosine) in a 2:1 and 1:2 ratio, together with cholesterol and lignoceric acid, were investigated. These mixtures are modelling the uppermost skin layer, the stratum corneum. Neutron diffraction, utilizing specifically deuterated ceramide molecules, was used to obtain a maximum amount of experimental detail. Highly detailed molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate even more information from the experimental data.It was possible to observe a single lamellar phase for both systems. They had a lamellar repeat distance of 5.43\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202fnm for the [NS]/[AP] 2:1 and a slightly shorter one of 5.34\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05\u202fnm for the 1:2 system. The structure and water content was uninfluenced by excess humidity. Both the experimental and simulation data indicated slightly tilted ceramides, with their C24 chains overlapping in the lamellar mid-plane. This arrangement is well comparable to systems investigated before. The structure of both systems, except for the differing repeat distance, looks similar at first. However, on a smaller scale there were various distinct differences, demonstrating only low redundancy between the different ceramide species, despite only minor chemical differences. The mainly ceramide [AP] determined 1:2 system has a slightly smaller repeat distance. This is a result of a tighter arrangement of the lipids chain along the bilayer normal and increased overlapping of the long chains in the lamellar middle. For the CER[NS] some novel features could be shown, despite it being the overall most investigated ceramide. These include the low adaptability to changed lateral interactions, leading to an increased chain opening. This effect could explain its low miscibility with other lipids.The investigated model systems allows it to directly compare results from the literature which have used ceramide [NS] to the most recent studies using the phytosphingosine ceramides such as ceramide [AP].",

     "abstract": "Rosuvastatin is a statin used to treat metabolic syndrome conditions, such as hyperlipidemia. It is relatively safe; however, fatal rhabdomyolysis or skeletal myopathy can sometimes occur. Therefore, to investigate the overall effects of rosuvastatin, including lipid lowering and adverse effects, metabolic profiling was performed using metabolomics and lipidomics after rosuvastatin administration. Specifically, the metabolic profiles between healthy subjects and patients with hyperlipidemia were compared and the metabolic changes related to the mechanism of the drug effect were proposed. Healthy volunteers (n\u202f=\u202f32) and hyperlipidemic patients (n\u202f=\u202f14) were orally administered rosuvastatin (20\u202fmg) once a day for 3\u20138 weeks, and plasma and urine were collected. Metabolomics and lipidomics were performed using UHPLC-LTQ/Orbitrap/MS/MS for non-targeted analysis and UHPLC-TQ-MS/MS for targeted analysis. Using non-targeted analysis, we successfully profiled and identified 73 and 87 metabolites in healthy subjects and hyperlipidemia subjects, respectively. Through targeted analysis, we have also quantified 188 metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids. The levels of L-carnitine, diacylglycerol, and acylcarnitines significantly decreased after rosuvastatin administration regardless of the group. The overall levels of fatty acids (FA) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPC) increased, while phosphatidylcholines (PC) decreased only in the patient group. \u03b2-Oxidation decreased overall, while the production of polyunsaturated FA increased only in the hyperlipidemic patients. Using metabolic profiling, we have evaluated the alterations in the biochemical pathways, which may aid in a more detailed understanding of the effect of rosuvastatin. Patient-specific metabolomic and lipidomic profiles may serve as valuable markers for the understanding of the adverse effects associated with statin treatment.",

The stability and compressibility of DPPC monolayers are disrupted by ACCD molecules with short (C12) alkyl chains. These top-heavy amphiphiles (large cone angles) create voids at the interface of the hydrophobic/aqueous layer leading to monolayer expansion and packing efficiency of the aliphatic chains is disrupted. Long-tailed analogues (C16, C18) are cohesively integrated into DPPC monolayers due to their smaller cone angles at the interfacial region and increased hydrocarbon compatibility in the hydrophobic region.

     "abstract": "Oxidised low density lipoprotein (LDL) was considered to be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but the large clinical trials of antioxidants, including the first one using probucol (the PQRST Trial), failed to show benefit and have cast doubt on the importance of oxidised LDL. We have shown previously that LDL oxidation can be catalysed by iron in the lysosomes of macrophages. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effectiveness of antioxidants in preventing LDL oxidation at lysosomal pH and also establish the possible mechanism of oxidation. Probucol did not effectively inhibit the oxidation of LDL at lysosomal pH, as measured by conjugated dienes or oxidised cholesteryl esters or tryptophan residues in isolated LDL or by ceroid formation in the lysosomes of macrophage-like cells, in marked contrast to its highly effective inhibition of LDL oxidation at pH 7.4. LDL oxidation at lysosomal pH was inhibited very effectively for long periods by N,N'-diphenyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, which is more hydrophobic than probucol and has been shown by others to inhibit atherosclerosis in rabbits, and by cysteamine, which is a hydrophilic antioxidant that accumulates in lysosomes. Iron-induced LDL oxidation might be due to the formation of the superoxide radical, which protonates at lysosomal pH to form the much more reactive, hydrophobic hydroperoxyl radical, which can enter LDL and reach its core. Probucol resides mainly in the surface monolayer of LDL and would not effectively scavenge hydroperoxyl radicals in the core of LDL. This might explain why probucol failed to protect against atherosclerosis in various clinical trials. The oxidised LDL hypothesis of atherosclerosis now needs to be re-evaluated using different and more effective antioxidants that protect against the lysosomal oxidation of LDL.",

Mycobacterial infections remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with serious concerns of emergence of multi and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. While significant advances have been made in identifying mycobacterial virulence determinants, the detailed molecular mechanism of internalization of mycobacteria into host cells remains poorly understood. Although several studies have highlighted the crucial role of sphingolipids in mycobacterial growth, persistence and establishment of infection, the role of sphingolipids in the entry of mycobacteria into host cells is not known. In this work, we explored the role of host membrane sphingolipids in the entry of Mycobacterium smegmatis into J774A.1 macrophages. Our results show that metabolic depletion of sphingolipids in host macrophages results in a significant reduction in the entry of M. smegmatis. Importantly, the entry of Escherichia coli into host macrophages under similar conditions remained invariant, implying the specificity of the requirement of sphingolipids in mycobacterial entry. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first report demonstrating the role of host macrophage sphingolipids in the entry of mycobacteria.

A second fatty acid is ester-linked to the 3-hydroxy group of the first fatty acid. Most commonly, ornithine is the headgroup of these lipids, but glycine, serineglycine, glutamine and lysine have also been described in bacteria. Ornithine lipids (OL) can be synthesized by about 50% of the sequenced bacterial species, and several covalent modifications of its basic structure have been described. The OL hydroxylase OlsE is widespread in Rhizobium and Agrobacterium species and is responsible for introducing a hydroxyl group at a hence unknown position within the ornithine headgroup causing the formation of the OL named S2. Using NMR on purified OL S2, we show that the OlsE-mediated hydroxylation takes place at the C-4 position of the ornithine headgroup. Furthermore, we identify a hydroxylase in the genome of Pseudopedobacter saltans, distantly related to OlsE from \u03b1-proteobacteria, able to hydroxylate the headgroup of both ornithine lipids and lysine lipids. A homology search with the amino acid sequence of this hydroxylase allows us to predict that OL headgroup hydroxylation is not restricted to a few \u03b1-proteobacteria, but is apparently also common in many genera belonging to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroidetes (CFB) group of bacteria.",

Paclitaxel is an efficient anticancer drug for the treatment of various cancers. However, paclitaxel has a solubility of 0.5\u202fmg/L in water and a low bioavailability of 6.5%. Moreover, paclitaxel is a substrate for p-glycoprotein, which shows a decreased accumulation of drug within the cancer cell expressed by a p-glycoprotein. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to prepare a paclitaxel-loaded liposome and evaluate the effect of d-\u03b1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) as an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein on the paclitaxel-loaded liposome.

     "abstract": "Niemann-Pick disease type C2 is a lipid storage disorder in which mutations in the NPC2 protein cause accumulation of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYSs). Whether cholesterol delivered by other means to NPC2 deficient cells also accumulates in LE/LYSs is currently unknown. We show that the close cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (DHE), when delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) accumulates in LE/LYSs of human fibroblasts lacking functional NPC2. We measured two different time scales of sterol diffusion; while DHE rich LE/LYSs moved by slow anomalous diffusion in disease cells (D\u202f\u223c\u202f4.6\u221910\u22124\u202f\u03bcm2/sec; \u03b1\u223c0.76), a small pool of sterol could exchange rapidly with D\u202f\u223c\u202f3\u202f\u03bcm2/s between LE/LYSs, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). By quantitative lipid mass spectrometry we found that esterification of 13C-labeled cholesterol but not of DHE is reduced 10-fold in disease fibroblasts compared to control cells. Internalized NPC2 rescued the sterol storage phenotype and strongly expanded the dynamic sterol pool seen in FRAP experiments. Together, our study shows that cholesterol esterification and trafficking of sterols between the PM and LE/LYSs depends on a functional NPC2 protein. NPC2 likely acts inside LE/LYSs from where it increases non-vesicular sterol exchange with other organelles.",

The minimum value for the free energy for GLYP is \u223c\u221260\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121 located at z\u202f=\u202f\u00b11.7\u202fnm (from the lipid bilayer center), and there is almost no maximum at the center of the lipid bilayer. By contrast, the minimum for GLYP2\u2212 is \u223c\u221235\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121 located at z\u202f=\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.4\u202fnm (from the lipid bilayer center), and the maximum reaches \u223c35\u202fkJ\u202fmol\u22121 at the center of the lipid bilayer. Then, different lipid bilayer properties were analyzed for different glyphosate:lipid (G:L) ratios. The mean area per lipid was slightly affected, increasing only 5% (in the presence of glyphosate at high concentrations), which is in agreement with the slight decrease in deuterium order parameters. As for the thickness of the bilayer, it is observed that the state of charge produces opposite effects. On one hand, the neutral state produces an increase in the thickness of the lipid bilayer; on the other, the charged form produces a decrease in the thickness, which not depend linearly on the G:L ratios, either. The orientation of the DPPC head groups is practically unaffected throughout the range of the G:L ratios studied. Finally, the mobility of the lipids of the bilayer is strongly affected by the presence of glyphosate, considerably increasing its lateral diffusion coefficient noteworthy (one order of magnitude), with increasing G:L ratio.",

The edible emulsifier dramatically promotes the catalyzing activity of the metal oxide in the reaction. The loading of the magnesium oxide is as low as 0.1\u202fwt% to phytosterols and far lower than the known ones. As demonstrated by the results of scanning electro-microscopy (SEM), the synergistic effect of emulsifier and magnesium oxide presumably results from elimination of nano-scale interfacial barrier between phytosterols and fatty acids and facilitation of mass transfer of reaction agents.

EmrE transports positively charged aromatic compounds, such as TPP+ and its derivatives. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of EmrE in complex with TPP+, MeTPP+, and MBTPP+ embedded in a membrane. The detailed molecular properties and interactions were analysed for all EmrE-ligand complexes. Our MD results identified that Lys22, Tyr40, Phe44, Trp45, and Trp63 formed potential \u03c0 interactions with all three ligands and further confirmed the essential role of Glu14. Moreover, distance analysis and structural changes in the EmrE translocation pathway suggest that ligand recognition and protein conformational changes depend on the structural properties of the substrate. Analysis of the movement of the ligand in the protein binding site and rotation of the ligand\u2019s aromatic rings confirm that substrates with aromatic moieties, such as MBTPP+, exhibit relatively stable binding to EmrE. Interestingly, the aromatic rings of Tyr40, Phe44, Trp45, and Trp63 underwent parallel movements with the aromatic rings of TPP+. Based on the MD results, we propose that \u03c0 interactions, as well as the mutual rotation of the aromatic rings in the protein and ligand, can be regarded as sources of ligand movement, and thus, the whole complex may work as a \u201cmolecular propeller\u201d.",

The aim of this study is to quantify the difference in hepatic lipid content with metabolic changes during the progression of steatosis by using localized MRS sequence with T2 relaxation time determination. Fatty liver disease was induced in C57BL/6N mice through a high-fat diet (HFD) of pellets containing 60% fat, 20% protein, and 20% carbohydrates. We used stimulated echo acquisition mode (repetition time: 3500\u202fms; mixing time: 10\u202fms; echo time: 20\u202fms) sequence. Using enhanced and mono exponential curve-fitting methods, the lipid relaxation time in mice was estimated at a fixed repetition time of 5000\u202fms and echo time ranging from 20 to 70\u202fms. The calculated lipid contents with incorrect and correct relaxation times were as follows: total saturated fatty acid (4.00\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.90 vs 6.74\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.25, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 at week 0; 15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.94 vs 25.53\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.49, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 at week 4); total unsaturated fatty acid (0.40\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.49 vs 0.56\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.47, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 at week 4; 0.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.26 vs 0.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.21, p\u202f<\u202f0.01 at week 7); total unsaturated bond (0.48\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.52 vs 1.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.58, p\u202f<\u202f0.05 at week 10).

Natural and semi-synthetic phytosterol derivatives characterized by the presence of side-chain oxygenated functions have shown to be able to modulate LXR activity. Here, we describe the efficient synthesis of four stigmastane derivatives, endowed with a hydroxyl group at C24 position, namely (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3\u03b2,24-ols (also referred to as saringosterols, 10a and 10b) and (24R)- and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3\u03b2,24-ols (11a and 11b), starting from the readily available stigmasterol. Thanks to X-ray crystallography the absolute configuration of the newly created chiral centers was definitively assigned for all the four compounds. The subsequent luciferase assays with GAL-4 chimeric receptors evidenced the ability of the two 24(S)-epimers, 10b and 11b, to interact with LXRs, showing the same degree of affinity as (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (1). With regard to the isoform selectivity both the derivatives 10b and 11b showed a preference for LXR\u03b2, up to 4-fold in terms of efficacy for 11b. The gene expression profiling of (24S)-stigmasta-5,28-diene-3\u03b2,24-ol (10a) and (24S)-stigmasta-5-ene-3\u03b2,24-ol (11a) demonstrated the capability of both the compounds to induce the expression of four well-known LXR target genes, such as ABCA1, SREBP1c, FASN, and SCD1 in U937 monocytic cell line, thus supporting the hypothesis they were LXR positive modulators.",

Membrane vesicles composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and cholesterol (C) (0.3C:POPC mole ratio) were prepared and treated with vehicle, EPA, or DHA (1:10\u202fmol ratio to POPC).

Cholesterol is a major component of mammalian cells, where it plays a critical role in membrane permeability, rigidity and dynamics, and contributes to specific membrane structures such as lipid rafts. Cholesterol is the main cargo in low and high-density lipoprotein complexes (i.e. LDL, HDL) and is directly implicated in several pathogenic conditions such as coronary artery disease which leads to 17 million deaths annually. Neutron scattering studies on membranes or lipid-protein complexes exploiting contrast variation have been limited by the lack of availability of fully deuterated biomolecules and especially perdeuterated cholesterol. The availability of perdeuterated cholesterol provides a unique way of probing the structural and dynamical properties of the lipoprotein complexes that underly many of these disease conditions. Here we describe a procedure for in vivo production of perdeuterated recombinant cholesterol in lipid-engineered Pichia pastoris using flask and fed-batch fermenter cultures in deuterated minimal medium. Perdeuteration of the purified cholesterol was verified by mass spectrometry and its use in a neutron scattering study was demonstrated by neutron reflectometry measurements using the FIGARO instrument at the ILL.",

     "abstract": "Entry of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) into living cells by translocating across plasma membranes is an important physiological phenomenon. To elucidate the mechanism of the translocation of CPPs across lipid bilayers, it is essential to reveal its elementary processes. For this purpose, here, we have developed a new method for the continuous, quantitative detection of the entry of CPPs into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), where we investigate the interaction of fluorescent probe-labeled CPPs with single GUVs containing large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and fluorescent probes in their lumens using confocal microscopy. Using this method, we investigated the interaction of carboxyfluorescein (CF)-labeled transportan 10 (CF-TP10) with single GUVs comprised of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) containing LUVs of the same membrane and Alexa Fluor 647 hydrazide (AF647) in their lumens. At low concentrations of CF-TP10, first the fluorescence intensity (FI) of the GUV membrane increased with time, and then after some lag time the FI of the GUV lumen due to CF-TP10 increased continuously with time without leakage of AF647. At higher concentrations of CF-TP10, after the FI of the GUV lumen due to CF-TP10 increased significantly, leakage of AF647 started. These results indicate that CF-TP10 entered the GUV lumen by translocating across the GUV membrane and then bound to the LUVs there without pore formation and that CF-TP10 concentration in the lumen increased with time. The rate of entry of CF-TP10 into GUV lumen increased with CF-TP10 concentration. We discussed the kinetics of entry of CF-TP10 into single GUVs.",

D2O-ESEEM reveals that water exposure of the terminal methyl groups in the interdigitated phase of dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine (DHPC) is comparable to that of the methylene groups at the polar head-group end of the chains. Similarly, an uniform transmembrane polarity profile is obtained from the dependence of the outer 14N-hyperfine splitting on the spin-label position along the chain in frozen interdigitated DHPC dispersions. Two-component conventional EPR spectra of spin labels at the terminal methyl end of the chain reveal that the intermediate gel phase above the pretransition of DHPC contains components in which the lipid chains are interdigitated. The polarity and chain-flexibility profiles in the fluid L\u03b1-phase of DHPC with ether-linked chains are shifted outwards, towards the polar-apolar interface, as compared with that of dihexadecanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with ester-linked chains. Also, the polarity profile of DHPC is shifted upwards, to higher polarities. These differences reflect those in hydrocarbon thickness and area/lipid molecule reported by x-ray diffraction for the L\u03b1-phases of the two lipids.",

Lipid concentration, ethanol content, pH of the aqueous phase, and the time duration of the experiment have little influence on the mean diameter of the vesicles. This simple methodology can be easily carried out with a capillary and a micro-needled syringe and provides a rapid production tool for researchers requiring reproducible liposome suspensions.

In this study, we investigate the effect the amino acid sequence of the lid region on interfacial binding and lid dynamics of TLL. Three TLL variants were investigated, a wild-type variant, a variant containing an esterase lid region (Esterase), and a Hybrid variant, containing both wild-type lid residues and esterase lid residues. Multiple coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the interfacial binding orientation of TLL was significantly affected by the nature of amino acids in the lid region, and atomistic simulations indicated effects on the structural dynamics of the lid itself. The atomistic simulations, as well as steered molecular dynamics simulations, also indicated that the Esterase lid region was less flexible than the wild-type lid region, whereas the Hybrid variant displayed superior lid flexibility and stability in the open conformation both at the interface, and in aqueous solution. Additional experiments performed to investigate the activity and binding behaviour of the lipase variants indicated a slightly higher specific activity for the Hybrid variant compared to the wild-type variant, correlating the observations of increased lid flexibility. Together, these results are in line with previous experimental studies, highlighting the importance of the nature of the amino acid residues within the functional lid region of lipases, particularly regarding interfacial binding orientation, activation, and structural stability.",

In order to understand the structure-function relationships of these enzymes, we report here the recombinant expression in E.coli, the refolding and characterization of His-tagged annular seabream PLA2 (AsPLA2). A single Ni-affinity chromatography step was used to obtain a highly purified recombinant AsPLA2 with a molecular mass of 15\u00a0kDa as attested by gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data.

The enzyme high thermo-activity and thermo-stability make it a potential candidate in various biological applications. The 3D structure models of these enzymes were compared with structures of phylogenetically related pancreatic PLA2. By following these models and utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the resistance of the AsPLA2 at high temperatures was explained. Using the monomolecular film technique, AsPLA2 was found to be active on various phospholipids spread at the air/water interface at a surface pressure between 12 and 25\u00a0dyn\u00a0cm\u22121.

We showed that GPLRP2 hydrolyzes 1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) present in mixed micelles with sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) but not in multilamellar (MLV) and large unilamellar (LUV) vesicles of DPPC. After characterization of these lipid aggregates by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the discriminative recognition of DPPC in DPPC/NaTDC micelles versus MLV and LUV by an inactive variant (S152G) of GPLRP2 to avoid the effect of substrate hydrolysis was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). IR spectra were recorded after hydrogen/deuterium exchange, at pD 6 and various temperatures to study phase transitions. We analyzed the methylene asymmetric stretching (\u03bd(CH2)as), the carbonyl stretching (\u03bd(CO)) and the composite polar head-group vibration bands, first to characterized differences in DPPC micelles and vesicles, and second to estimate the degree of interaction of GPLRP2 S152G with phospholipid. Our results indicate that a significant interaction between GPLRP2 S152G and DPPC is only observed when NaTDC is added to the system to form micelles and this can be explained by the different organization of DPPC in mixed micelles compared to lamellar vesicles (higher hydration of polar head, higher mobility of alkyl chains) that favors GPLRP2 penetration into the phospholipid layer.",

Various micelles of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and lysophosphatidylcholine were prepared with either bile salts (sodium taurodeoxycholate or glycodeoxycholate) or Triton X-100, which are substrate-dispersing agents commonly used for measuring phospholipase activities. PLRP2 displayed a high activity on all phospholipid-bile salt micelles, but was totally inactive on phospholipid-Triton X-100 micelles. These findings clearly differentiate PLRP2 from secreted pancreatic phospholipase A2 which is highly active on both types of micelles. Using an inactive variant of PLRP2, SEC experiments allowed identifying two populations of PLRP2-DPPC-bile salt complexes corresponding to a high molecular weight 1:1 PLRP2-micelle association and to a low molecular weight association of PLRP2 with few monomers of DPPC/bile salts. IR spectroscopy analysis showed how DPPC-bile salt micelles differ from DPPC-Triton X-100 micelles by a higher fluidity of acyl chains and higher hydration/H-bonding of the interfacial carbonyl region. The presence of bile salts allowed observing changes in the IR spectrum of DPPC upon addition of PLRP2 (higher rigidity of acyl chains, dehydration of the interfacial carbonyl region), while no change was observed with Triton X-100. The differences between these surfactants and their impact on substrate recognition by PLRP2 are discussed, as well as the mechanism by which high and low molecular weight PLRP2-DPPC-bile salt complexes may be involved in the overall process of DPPC hydrolysis.",

These approaches only give a partial information on the chemistry of the lipolysis reaction and additional end-point analyses are often required to quantify both residual substrate and lipolysis products. We used transmission infrared (IR) spectroscopy to monitor simultaneously the hydrolysis of phospholipids by guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (GPLRP2) and the release of lipolysis products. The substrate (DPPC, 1,2-Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) was mixed with sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) to form mixed micelles in D2O buffer at pD 6 and 8. After hydrogen/deuterium exchange, DPPC hydrolysis by GPLRP2 (100\u00a0nM) was monitored at 35\u00a0\u00b0C in a liquid cell by recording IR spectra and time-course variations in the CO stretching region. These changes were correlated to variations in the concentrations of DPPC, lysophospholipids (lysoPC) and palmitic acid (Pam) using calibration curves established with these compounds individually mixed with NaTDC. We were thus able to quantify each compound and its time-course variations during the phospholipolysis reaction and to estimate the enzyme activity. To validate the IR analysis, variations in residual DPPC, lysoPC and Pam were also quantified by thin-layer chromatography coupled to densitometry and similar hydrolysis profiles were obtained using both methods. IR spectroscopy can therefore be used to monitor the enzymatic hydrolysis of phospholipids and obtain simultaneously chemical and physicochemical information on substrate and all reaction products (H-bonding, hydration, acyl chain mobility).",

We investigate the effects of a curvature-inducing protein, caveolin-1, on the formation and structure of a spontaneously aggregated triolein (TO) lipid lens in a flat lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A truncated form of caveolin-1 (Cav1) localises on the interface between the spontaneously formed TO aggregate and the bulk bilayer, and thins the bilayer at the edge of the aggregate, which may contribute to lowering the energy barrier for pinching off the aggregate from the host bilayer. Simulations of fully mature LDs do not conclusively establish the optimal localisation of Cav1 in LDs, but when Cav1 is in the LD core, the distribution of both neutral lipids in the LD core, and of phospholipids on the engulfing monolayer are altered significantly.

After washing, the textile swatches as well as cryo-sections of the swatches were imaged using MALDI imaging in positive ion mode at pixel sizes of 15\u201375\u00a0\u03bcm. Similar samples were imaged by DESI-MSI for comparison.Despite the rough surface and non-conductive nature of textile, MALDI imaging of glycerides on textile was readily possible. The results show extensive enzymatic degradation of triglycerides into diglycerides, and images suggest that this degradation takes place in a quite heterogeneous manner as also observed in images of cross-sections. DESI-imaging reveals the same kind of enzymatic degradation, but with a more homogeneous appearance. While the enzymatic degradation is exemplified in a few images, the overall degradations process was monitored by extraction of ion intensities from 298 individual ion masses of mono-, di- and triglycerides and free fatty acids.MALDI imaging of glycerides was possible directly from a textile surface, allowing visualization of the enzymatic degradation of fatty stains on textile during the laundry process. The images showed an inhomogeneous presence of diglycerides after lipase treatment both in planar images of the textile surface as well as in cross-sections suggesting a non-uniform enzyme effect or extraction of the lipase reaction products from the textile.",

     "abstract": "Milk has recently been reported to form complex self-assembled liquid crystalline structures during digestion by lipolytic enzymes. The formation of cubic phases at the endpoint of digestion was of particular interest as this requires a fine balance in self-assembly. This manuscript probes the robustness of the kinetic structural behaviour when milk is subjected to a range of processes that are encountered by milk and/or are relevant to the use of milk in pharmaceutical applications (homogenisation, lyophilisation, freeze-thawing and freeze-drying) using time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS). The nature of the persistent lamellar phase that occurs during digestion is elucidated using SAXS and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the interplay between the formation of structured mesophases and the evolution of particle size during digestion is determined using laser light scattering studies. This closer look at milk lipids during digestion establishes the dependence of the structural behaviour of milk on lipid composition and not processing, and clarifies the phase behaviour and kinetic effects on particle size distribution under lipolytic conditions.",

     "abstract": "The molecular mechanism underlying the action of local anesthetics is still elusive. Phenylethanol (PEtOH) is an ingredient of essential oils with a rose-like odor and has been used as a local anesthetic. In this work, we have explored the effect of PEtOH on thermotropic behavior and organization of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membranes utilizing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our results indicate that the phase transition temperature of DPPC exhibited decrease with increasing PEtOH concentration. This is accompanied by hysteresis (difference in phase transition between the heating and cooling scans). We defined the threshold concentration of PEtOH as the concentration at which the difference in phase transition temperature between the heating and cooling thermograms is maximum. Interestingly, changes in enthalpy, entropy, and full width at half maximum displayed biphasic behavior beyond the threshold concentration of PEtOH. The biphasic change in thermodynamic parameters corresponding to phase transtition, coupled with hysteresis, is indicative of interdigitation in DPPC bilayers. We confirmed this proposition by SAXS measurements which show formation of the interdigitated phase in DPPC bilayers at and above the threshold concentration of PEtOH. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first report describing the interdigitation of membrane bilayers induced by PEtOH. We further show that the formation of interdigitated phase in DPPC bilayers depends on PEtOH concentration and temperature. Our results could be useful in ongoing efforts to address the mechanism of action of local anesthetics in model and biological membranes.",

Fluidity changes of biomimetic lipid membranes upon exposure to CoCl2 and NiCl2 were studied using the fluorescent probe Laurdan, which senses changes in environment polarity. Liposomes were prepared by extrusion in 20\u202fmM HEPES\u202f+\u202f100\u202fmM NaCl at pH 7.4. Additionally, dynamic light scattering was used to monitor metal induced size changes of liposomes composed of: phosphatidic acid (PA), cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylcholine (PC), with saturated and unsaturated acyl chains. Micromolar concentrations of both metals significantly rigidify negatively-charged liposomes and generally increase the melting temperature. Saturated acyl chains showed stronger metal effects in PS and PG, while no clear acyl chain preference was observed in CL and PA systems. The strength of the effect appears to be influenced greatly by both the head group and acyl chain. The rigidifying effects of cobalt were almost always much larger than those of nickel. In addition, size changes and aggregation by both metals was detected in PS or PA liposomes at molar metal/lipid ratios as low as 1/10.",

     "abstract": "Disaccharides play an important role in survival of anhydrobiotic organisms during extreme environmental conditions. A key protection feature is their capability to form the hydrogen bond (HB) network in a similar fashion as the one made by water. Since various ions also affect the HB network in completely hydrated systems, it is of a great interest to understand how they impact preservation when incorporated in a disaccharide network. To address this, we employ a combination of experimental and modeling techniques to study behavior of multilamellar 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes freeze-dried with sucrose in presence of NaCl or NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O at various concentrations (0.01\u20131\u00a0M). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed in order to determine the cooperative unit size (CUS), the number of lipid molecules that constitute a domain of cooperative motion in the liposome, and the melting temperature (Tm). In the absence of salt CUS was estimated to be 122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012, whereas in the presence of NaCl CUS increases more (347\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034 for c\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0M) than for NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O (193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026 for 1\u00a0M). When it comes to Tm, the situation is reversed; NaCl induces increase by about 1\u00a0K, while NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O by about 10\u00a0K. These findings clearly demonstrate how different interaction forces\u2212hydrogen bonding, charge pairing, and van der Waals interactions between acyl chains\u2212affect CUS and Tm. Their interplay and contribution of particular interaction was further analyzed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This analysis demonstrated that the HB network of DMPC and sucrose is partially disrupted in the presence of NaCl ions, and even to a greater extent in the case of NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O ions. Notably, H2PO4\u2212 ions outcompete and replace the sucrose molecules at the DMPC surface, which in turn alters the nature of the DMPC-surrounding interactions, from a weaker HB-dominated to a stronger CP-dominated interaction network.",

Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (eggPC) liposomes (in crystalline liquid state) were prepared in solutions of ascorbic acid (AA) at different concentration levels. On the other hand, liposomes were doped with Annonacin (Ann), a mono-tetrahydrofuran acetogenin (ACG), which is an effective citotoxic substance. While AA pharmacologic effect and action mechanisms are widely known, those of Ann\u2019s are only very recently being studied.Both Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopic techniques were used to study the participation of the main functional groups of the lipid bilayer involved in the membrane-solution interaction. The obtained spectra were comparatively analyzed, studying the spectral bands corresponding to both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic regions in the lipid bilayer. Electrochemical experiments namely; impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltamperometry (CV) were used as the main characterization techniques to analyse stability and structural changes of a model system of supported EggPC bilayer in connection with its interactions with AA and Ann.At high molar ratios of AA, there is dehydration in both populations of the carbonyl group of the polar head of the lipid. On the other hand, Ann promotes the formation of hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups.No interaction between AA and phosphate groups is observed at low and intermediate molar ratios. Ann is expected to be able to induce the dehydration of the phosphate groups without the subsequent formation of H bonds with them.According to the electrochemical analysis, the interaction of AA with the supported lipid membrane does not alter its dielectric properties. This fact can be related to the conservation of structured water of the phosphate groups in the polar heads of the lipid. On the other hand, the incorporation of Ann into the lipid membrane generates an increase in the number of defects while changes the dielectric constant. This, in turn, can be associated with the induced dehydration of the phosphate groups.",

Some brain membrane lipid effects may be mediated via synaptamide. In competition experiments with mouse brain homogenate in vitro, we found that synaptamide was an order-of-magnitude poorer inhibitor of radioactive anandamide hydrolysis than was anandamide itself. Also, enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of synaptamide was observed to occur at a slower rate than for anandamide. We have synthesized synaptamide radiolabeled with carbon-14 in both the ethanolamine ([\u03b1,\u03b2-14C2]synaptamide) and in the DHA ([1-14C]synaptamide) moieties. The brain penetration, distribution, and metabolism of radiolabeled synaptamide were studied in mice in vivo relative to anandamide, DHA, and AA. Brain uptake of labeled synaptamide was greater than for labeled DHA, consistent with previous studies of labeled anandamide and AA in our laboratory. After administering either isotopomer of radiolabeled synaptamide, radiolabeled phospholipids were found in mouse brain. Pretreatment of mice with PF3845, a potent, specific inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), eliminated formation of labeled phospholipids measured after 15\u00a0min, suggesting that synaptamide is hydrolyzed nearly exclusively by FAAH, though it is a poorer substrate for FAAH than anandamide.",

     "abstract": "Deformability is not just a fundamentally interesting vesicle characteristic; it is also the key determinant of vesicle ability to cross the skin barrier; i.e. skin penetrability. Development of bilayer vesicles for drug and vaccine delivery across the skin should hence involve optimization of this property, which is controllable by the concentration of bilayer softeners in or near the vesicle bilayers. To this end, we propose a simple method for quantifying the effect of bilayer softeners on deformability of bilayer vesicles. The method derives the bending rigidity of vesicle bilayers from vesicle size dependence on softener concentration. To exemplify the method, we studied mixtures of soybean phosphatidylcholine with anionic sodium deoxycholate, non-ionic polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan oleyl ester (polysorbate 80), or non-ionic polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether (C18:1EO20, Brij\u00ae 98). With each of the tested bilayer softeners, the bending rigidity of the resulting mixed-amphipat vesicle bilayers decreased quasi-exponentially as the concentration of the bilayer softener increased, as one would expect on theoretical ground. The bilayer bending rigidity reached low values, near the thermal stability limit, i.e. kBT, before vesicle transformation into non-vesicular aggregates began. For a soybean phosphatidylcholine concentration of 5.0\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u22121, the bilayer bending rigidity reached 1.5\u00a0kBT at the total deoxycholate concentration of 4.1\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u22121 and 3.4\u00a0kBT at the total polysorbate 80 concentration of 2.0\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u22121. In the case of C18:1EO20, the bilayer bending rigidity reached 1.5\u00a0kBT at the bilayer surface occupancy \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.1. The dependence of vesicle size on bilayer softener concentration thus reveals vesicle transformation into different aggregate structures (such as mixed micelles with poor skin penetrability) and practically valuable information on vesicle deformability. Our results compare favorably with results of literature measurements. We provide practical guidance on using the new analytical method to optimize deformable vesicle formulations.",

To highlight these features we demonstrate that we can create a phosphoinositide gradient on various length scales, ranging from 2\u00a0mm to 50\u00a0\u03bcm. We further show that a Ca2+ gradient in the aqueous phase above the SLB causes anionic lipid clustering mirroring the cation gradient. We demonstrate this effect for mixed phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate bilayers and fora mixed phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine bilayers. The biomimetic platform can be combined with a Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup, which allows for the convenient observation of the time evolution of the gradient and the interaction of ligands with the lipid bilayer. The method provides unprecedented access to study the dynamics and mechanics of protein-lipid interactions on membranes with micron level gradients, mimicking plasma membrane gradients observed in organisms such as Dictyostelium discodeum and neutrophils.",

Micelle entrapped drug emits in the UV region when it interacts with non-toxic \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD). Inspired by these unique fluorescence/structural switching properties of the anticancer drug, in the present work we have monitored the interplay of the drug between micelles and non-toxic \u03b2-CDs. We have observed that the model membranes formed by micelles differing in their hydrophobic chain length interact with the drug differently. Variation in the surfactant chain length plays an important role for structural switching i.e. in choosing a particular structural form of the drug that will be finally presented to their targets. The present study shows that in case of necessity, the bound drug molecule can be removed from its binding site in a controlled manner by the use of non-toxic \u03b2-CD and it is exploited to serve a significant purpose for the removal of excess/unused adsorbed drugs from the model cell membranes. We believe this kind of \u03b2-CD driven translocation of drugs monitored by fluorescence switching may find possible applications in controlled release of the drug inside cells.",

A library of flipids with various TACH-based headgroups and hydrocarbon tails were designed, prepared, and characterized to systematically elucidate the relationship between their chemical structures and their ability to form and to trigger liposomes. Liposomes (fliposomes) consisting of a flipid, POPC and PEG-ceramide were stable at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 7.4 for up to several months and yet released the encapsulated fluorophore in seconds upon acidification. The colloidal properties and encapsulation efficiencies of the fliposomes depended on the structure features of the flipids such as the polarity of the headgroups and the shape and fluidity of the lipid tails. The pH-triggered release also depended on the flipid structure, where shorter linear tails yielded more efficient release. The release of fliposomes was enhanced at different narrow pH ranges, depending on the basicity of the flipid headgroup, which can be estimated either by calculated pKa or by acid/base titration of the flipids while its conformation is monitored by 1H NMR. The structure-activity relationship of the flipids supports \u201clipid tail conformational shortening\u201d as the mechanism to disrupt lipid membranes and would provide great flexibility in the design of pH-sensitive drug delivery systems.",

The structure of this domain has not yet been elucidated due to its inherent dynamics, but experimental evidence points toward membrane-dependent organization and dynamics. To gain molecular insight into the interaction of the N-terminal domain with the membrane bilayer, we performed a series of microsecond time scale atomistic simulations of the N-terminal domain of CXCR1 in the presence and absence of POPC bilayers. Our results show that the peptide displays a high propensity to adopt a \u03b2-sheet conformation in the presence of the membrane bilayer. The interaction of the peptide with the membrane bilayer was found to be transient in our simulations. Interestingly, a scrambled peptide, containing the same residues in a randomly varying sequence, did not exhibit membrane-modulated structural dynamics. These results suggest that sequence-dependent electrostatics, modulated by the membrane, could play an important role in folding of the N-terminal domain. We believe that our results reinforce the emerging paradigm that cellular membranes could be important modulators of function of G protein-coupled receptors such as CXCR1.",

By assuming the thermodynamic colligative property for the bilayer membrane at low ligand concentrations, the partitioning behavior of these ligands into the DPPC bilayer membrane was considered. It was proved from the differential partition coefficients between two phases that PA has strong affinity with the gel (lamellar gel) phase in a micro-molal concentration range and makes the bilayer membrane more ordered, while HAL has strong affinity with the liquid crystalline phase in a milli-molal concentration range and does the bilayer membrane more disordered. The transfer volumes of both ligands from the aqueous solution to each phase of the DPPC bilayer membrane showed that the preferential partitioning of the PA molecule into the gel (lamellar gel) produces about 20% decrease in transfer volume as compared with the liquid crystalline phase, whereas that of the HAL molecule into the liquid crystalline phase does about twice increase in transfer volume as compared with the gel (ripple gel) phase. Furthermore, changes in thermotropic and barotropic phase behavior of the DPPC bilayer membrane by adding the ligand was discussed from the viewpoint of the ligand partitioning. Reflecting the contrastive partitioning of PA and HAL into the pressure-induced interdigitated gel phase among the gel phases, it was revealed that PA suppresses the formation of the interdigitated gel phase under high pressure while HAL promotes it. These results clearly indicate that each phase of the DPPC bilayer membrane has a potential to recognize various ligand molecules.",

In this case, neutron diffraction together with specifically deuterated ceramide was used as an effective tool to investigate the lamellar and the molecular nanostructure of the mixtures. It could clearly be demonstrated, that both isomers show distinctly different characteristics, even though the variation between both is only a single differently arranged OH-group. The l-ceramide [AP] promotes a crystalline like phase behaviour even if mixed with ceramide [NP], cholesterol and free fatty acids. The d-ceramide [AP] only shows crystalline-like features if mixed only with cholesterol and free fatty acids but adopts a native-like behaviour if additionally mixed with ceramide [NP]. It furthermore demonstrates that the l-ceramide [AP] should not be used for any applications concerning ceramide substitution. It could however possibly serve its own purpose, if this crystalline like behaviour has some kind of positive influence on the SC or can be utilized for any practical applications. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the diastereomers of ceramide [AP] are an attractive target for further research because their influence on the lamellar as well as the nanostructure is exceptionally strong. Additionally, the results furthermore show a very strong influence on hydration of the model membrane. With these properties, the d-ceramide [AP] could be effectively used to simulate native like behaviour even in very simple mixtures and could also have a strong impact on the native stratum corneum as well as high relevance for dermal ceramide substitution.

However, the molecular structure of SC lipids and how molecular configurations influence CWL is poorly understood. Here, the organization and structure of SC lipids extracted from birds were investigated by means of Langmuir films. Properties of lipids from the SC of arid and semi-arid adapted larks, known to have a low CWL, were compared with lipids extracted from the SC of mesic lark species with higher CWL to gain insight into how structure impacts CWL. Film properties were probed with surface pressure-area isotherms, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG). Results indicate organization and ordering of SC lipids in the arid-adapted hoopoe lark was vastly different from all other species, forming a miscible, rigid monolayer, whereas monolayers from semi-arid and mesic species were immiscible and disordered. Probing of interfacial water structure reveals that film morphology determines organization of water molecules near the monolayer; monolayers with a porous morphology had an increased population of water molecules that are weakly hydrogen-bonded. In general, CWL appears related to the miscibility and ordering of lipid components within the SC, as well as the ability of these lipids to interact with water molecules. From a broader perspective, CWL in larks appears linked to both the SC lipid composition and the aridity of the species\u2019 environment.",

Low interfacial tension (IFT) values were obtained by studying intact strain cells grown on water-immiscible hydrocarbons (HC) (Kowalewski et al. (2004), Kowalewski et al. (2005). Further investigations showed that the adaptation mechanism of Dietzia sp. A14101 to toxic water-immiscible HC involved changes both on the level of fatty acids content and in the physical properties of the cellular surface (development of the negative cellular surface charge and an increased in hydrophobicity) (Hvidsten et al., 2015b). However, these changes could not explain the low IFT values observed in earlier studies of this strain. Generally, low IFT imply a production of surface active compounds of low MW that are lipids by structure (Rosenberg and Ron, 1999).In this paper, it is shown that Dietzia sp. A14101 produces a range of glycolipids on all substrates. The amount of trehalose-containing lipids increases when the strain is grown on hydrocarbons. The production peak seems to coincide with the exponential growth phase, and such increased glycolipid synthesis continues throughout the stationary phase. The results indicate that only low amounts of the hydrocarbon substrate is incorporated directly into the glycolipids produced. Most of the hydrocarbon substrate seems to be employed for the biosynthesis of the neutral lipids and higher amounts of biomass were generated on HC substrates compared to incubations on non-HC substrates.The lipid content of the cell was determined as the total lipid extract (TLE), and was further fractionated (SPE). The hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties of the isolated surface active compounds were determined (GC\u2013MS, TLC, DART, LC\u2013MS). The changes in the lipid content during the culture development were monitored by 1D and 2D TLC, emulsification and oil-spreading tests.",

     "abstract": "Dietzia sp. A14101 isolated from an oil reservoir model column was found to induce a strong decrease of the interfacial tension (IFT) in hydrocarbon-water mixtures in the presence of the intact bacterial cells (Kowalewski et al., 2005). The strain was shown to be able to degrade a wide range of hydrocarbon substrates (B\u00f8dtker et al., 2009).Further studies showed that the surface-active compounds tentatively identified as glycolipids were produced by Dietzia sp. A14101 on non- and water-immiscible \u2013hydrocarbon substrates, Part I (Hvidsten et al., 2017). The results suggested that biosurfactant (BS) was a mixture of several isomers. The study presented here is aimed to investigate whether BS are secreted into the aqueous medium, and if so, then at which phase of the culture growth and in which amounts \u2013 the dynamics of the BS release in incubations on water-immiscible hydrocarbons. Two methods of BS extraction from the medium were attempted and compared: a liquid\u2013liquid extraction (LLE) and precipitation by acid. For qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS), surface tension measurements (SFT), emulsification (E24) and oil-spreading tests were employed.The results indicated that BS only partially were secreted into the medium. Detectable amounts of glycolipids in media were first identified during the exponential growth phase. However, only a slight decrease of SFT was observed in the cell-free medium. The emulsification index values of the sampled material were lower than those reported for related strains. The results suggested that most of the BS produced by Dietzia sp. A14101 remains cell-bound during the culture development in a batch mode and only a narrow range of the BS isomers can be detected in small amounts in media.",

In the present study, a homologous series of N-acylglycine alkyl esters (NAGEs) with matched chains were synthesized and characterized. Results of differential scanning calorimetric studies revealed that all NAGEs exhibit a single sharp phase transition and that the transition enthalpy and entropy show a linear dependence on the N-acyl and ester alkyl chain length. The structure of N-myristoylglycine myristyl ester (NMGME), solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showed that the molecule adopts a linear geometry and revealed that the structure of N-myristoyl glycyl moiety in NMGME is identical to that in N-myristoylglycine. The molecules are packed in layers with the polar functional groups of the ester and amide functionalities located at the center of the layer. The crystal packing is stabilized by NH\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the amide CO and NH groups of adjacent molecules as well as by CH\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the amide carbonyl and the methylene CH adjacent to the ester carbonyl of neighboring molecules as well as between ester carbonyl and methylene group of the glycine moiety of adjacent molecules. Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed a linear dependence of the d-spacings on the acyl chain length, suggesting that all NAGEs adopt a structure similar to the packing exhibited in the crystal lattice of NMGME.",

     "abstract": "Heavy water (D2O) affects various functions of cells and living things. In order to gain fundamental insight into the molecular mechanism on biological effects of heavy water, D2O-effects on fully hydrated monoolein (MO) systems were investigated from the structural viewpoints. At room temperature, the MO fully hydrated by pure light water (H2O) forms a bicontinuous cubic (Pn3m) phase, and then, the Pn3m cubic phase transforms into an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase at about 90\u00a0\u00b0C. Temperature-scan X-ray diffraction measurements showed that substitution of D2O for H2O lowers the Pn3m-to-HII phase transition temperature and reduces the lattice constants of both phases. The structural analysis of the Pn3m phase using the diffraction intensity data indicated that D2O reduces the surface occupied area of MO at the interface by 12% in comparison with H2O. This change is probably due to the difference of the strength of hydrogen bond.",

     "abstract": "Styrene-maleic acid copolymers (SMA) have been gaining interest in the field of membrane research due to their ability to solubilize membranes into nanodics. The SMA molecules act as an amphipathic belt that surrounds the nanodiscs, whereby the hydrophobic styrene moieties can insert in between the lipid acyl chains. Here we used SMA variants with different styrene-to-maleic acid ratio (i.e. 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) to investigate how lipid packing in the nanodiscs is affected by the presence of the polymers and how it depends on polymer composition. This was done by analyzing the thermotropic properties of a series of saturated phosphatidylcholines in nanodiscs using laurdan fluorescence and differential scanning calorimetry. In all cases it was found that the temperature of the main phase transition (Tm) of the lipids in the nanodiscs is downshifted and that its cooperativity is strongly reduced as compared to the situation in vesicles. These effects were least pronounced for lipids in nanodiscs bounded by SMA 2:1. Unexpected trends were observed for the calorimetric enthalpy of the transition, suggesting that the polymer itself contributes, possibly by rearranging around the nanodiscs when the lipids adopt the fluid phase. Finally, distinct differences in morphology were observed for nanodiscs at relatively high polymer concentrations, depending on the SMA variant used. Overall, the results suggest that the extent of preservation of native thermodynamic properties of the lipids as well as the stability of the nanodiscs at high polymer concentrations is better for SMA 2:1 than for the other SMA variants.",

Here we report X-ray diffraction data on phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) dispersions forming highly stable Im3m and Pn3m cubic phases at ambient temperature as a result of a temperature cycling through the L\u03b1 \u2212 HII transition and complement the structural characterization of the PE phase transitions with thermodynamic data obtained by differential scanning calorimetry and differential scanning densitometry.

The peroxidation of sterol precursors to cholesterol such as 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and desmosterol as well as their oxysterols has received less attention. The peroxidation of these sterol precursors can become important under circumstances in which genetic conditions or exposures to small molecules leads to an increase of these biosynthetic intermediates in tissues and fluids. 7-DHC, for example, has a propagation rate constant for peroxidation some 200 times that of cholesterol and this sterol is found at elevated levels in a devastating human genetic condition, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). The propagation rate constants for peroxidation of sterol intermediates on the biosynthetic pathway to cholesterol were determined by a competition kinetic method, i.e. a peroxyl radical clock. In this work, propagation rate constants for lathosterol, zymostenol, desmosterol, 7-dehydrodesmosterol and other sterols in the Bloch and Kandutsch\u2013Russell pathways are assigned and these rate constants are related to sterol structural features.

In breast tumors, DDA levels were found to be decreased compared to normal tissues, evidencing a metabolic deregulation of DDA production in cancers. DDA is an amino-oxysterol that contains three protonatable nitrogen atoms. This makes it physico-chemically different from other oxysterols and it therefore requires specific analytical methods We have previously used a two-step method for the quantification of DDA in biological samples: 1) DDA purification from a Bligh and Dyer extract by RP-HPLC using a 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.6\u00a0mm column, followed by 2) nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) fragmentation to analyze the HPLC fraction of interest. We report here the development a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of DDA and its analogues. This new method is fast (10\u00a0min), resolving (peak width <4\u00a0s) and has a weak carryover (<0.01%). We show that this technique efficiently separates DDA from its C17 isomer and other steroidal alkaloids from the same family establishing a proof of concept for the analysis of this family of amino-oxysterols.",

Cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (both are 4-ene-3-ketosteroids) were quantitatively transformed into hydrazones using Girard P reagent after enzymatic oxidation by cholesterol oxidase. Separation was achieved using non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis with UV detection at 280\u00a0nm; the \u201ccharge-tagging\u201d Girard P reagent ensured both charge and chromophore (which are requirements for CE-UV). Excess reagent was also separated from the two analytes, eliminating the need for removal prior to the analysis. The compounds were separated in less than 5\u00a0min with excellent separation efficiency, using separation electrolytes fully compatible with mass spectrometry. The CE-UV method was used to optimize steps for charge-tagging, revealing that the procedure is affected by the analyte/reagent ratio and reaction time, but also the analyte structure.",

     "abstract": "5,6\u03b1-epoxycholesterol (5,6\u03b1-EC) and 5,6\u03b2-epoxycholesterol (5,6\u03b2-EC) are oxysterols involved in the anticancer pharmacology of the widely used antitumor drug tamoxifen. They are both metabolized into cholestane-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol (CT) by the cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase (ChEH) enzyme, and CT is metabolized by an as-yet uncharacterized enzyme into 6-oxo-cholestan-3\u03b2,5\u03b1-diol (OCDO). A recent feasibility study showed that the 5,6-ECs may represent surrogate markers of tamoxifen activity in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine therapy, thus there is a growing interest in their accurate quantification. These oxysterols are usually quantified by gas-liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), using an isotope dilution methodology with the corresponding deuterated oxysterol. This method is considered to be relative quantitative since all of the standards used are deuterated oxysterols, however it is not known whether the preparation of each oxysterol is affected in the same way by the extraction, pre-purification by solid phase extraction (SPE) and trimethylsilylation steps, particularly when using biological samples that contain many other reactive compounds. Thus, in this study we investigated the yield of the 5,6-ECs, CT and OCDO recovery from patient serum samples at different stages of their work-up and trimethylsilylation prior to GC/MS analysis, using [14C]-labeled analogs to follow these oxysterols at each step. We measured a 40 to 60% loss of material for the 5,6-ECs and OCDO, however we also describe the conditions that improved their recovery. Our data also show that the use of deuterated 5,6\u03b1-EC, 5,6\u03b2-EC, CT and OCDO is an absolute requirement for their accurate quantification.",

The present study aims to assess the kinetics of POP formation in six different fat-based products. Vegetable oils and margarines without and with added PS (7.5\u20137.6% w/w) in esterified form were heated in a Petri-dish at temperatures of 150, 180 and 210\u00a0\u00b0C for 8, 12 and 16\u00a0min. PS and POP were analysed using GC-FID and GC\u2013MS-SIM, respectively. Increasing PS content, temperature and heating time led to higher POP formation in all tested fat-based products. PS (either naturally occurring or added) in margarines were less susceptible to oxidation as compared to PS in vegetable oils. The susceptibility of sitosterol to oxidation was about 20% lower than that of campesterol under all the applied experimental conditions. During heating, the relative abundance of 7-keto-PS (expressed as% of total POP) decreased in all the fat-based products regardless of their PS contents, which was accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of 7-OH-PS and 5,6-epoxy-PS, while PS-triols were fairly unchanged. In conclusion, heating time, temperature, initial PS content and the matrix of the fat-based products (vegetable oil vs. margarine) showed distinct effects on POP formation and composition of individual POP formed.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie and mediate the hypercholesterolemia-fostered increased risk for breast cancer and PCa are yet to be determined. The discovery that the most abundant cholesterol oxidized metabolite in the plasma, 27 hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and an agonist of Liver X receptors (LXR) partially fills the void in our understanding and knowledge of the mechanisms that may link hypercholesterolemia to development and progression of breast cancer and PCa. The wide spectrum and repertoire of SERM and LXR-dependent effects of 27-OHC in the context of all facets and aspects of breast cancer and prostate cancer biology are reviewed in this manuscript in a very comprehensive manner. This review highlights recent findings pertaining to the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and delineates the signaling mechanisms involved in the governing of different facets of tumor biology, that include tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as tumor cell invasion, migration, and metastasis. We also discuss the limitations of contemporary studies and lack of our comprehension of the entire gamut of effects exerted by 27-OHC that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of breast cancer and PCa. We unveil and propose potential future directions of research that may further our understanding of the role of 27-OHC in breast cancer and PCa and help design therapeutic interventions against endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer and PCa.",

This degenerative pathology is accompanied by modified levels of oxysterols (oxidative derivatives of cholesterol, implicated in cholesterol metabolism), highlighted in the brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. The pathological accumulation of such derivatives is thought to participate in the onset and progression of the disease through their implication in inflammation, oxidative stress, demyelination and neurodegeneration. In this context, physical exercise is envisaged as a complementary resource to ameliorate therapeutic strategies. Indeed, physical activity exerts beneficial effects on neuronal plasticity, decreases inflammation and oxidative stress and improves blood-brain integrity in extents that could be beneficial for brain health. The present review attempts to summarize the available data on the positive effect of physical exercise to highlight possible links between physical activity and modulation of cholesterol/oxysterol homeostasis in MS.",

We therefore studied the impact of 7KC, 24S-OHC, and C24:0 on 158N murine oligodendrocytes, and determined their impact on K+ homeostasis. The effects of 7KC, 24S-OHC and C24:0 on lipid membrane organization and membrane potential were examined with merocyanine 540 (MC540) and bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiSBAC2(3)), respectively. The intracellular concentration of K+ ([K+]i) was measured by flame photometry and the ratiometric approach using the PBFI\u2013AM fluorescence indicator. To determine the relationships between [K+]i and lipotoxicity, 158N cells were pre-treated with a universal Kv channels blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), without or with 7KC, 24S-OHC or C24:0. Cell adhesion, cell growth, mitochondrial depolarization, cytoplasmic membrane integrity, the presence of SubG1 and the morphological aspect of the nuclei were determined with various microscopy, flow cytometry and biochemistry methods. 7KC, 24S-OHC and C24:0 induced changes in lipid content and polarization of the cytoplasmic membrane. These events were associated with increased [K+]i. Blocking Kv channels with 4-AP exacerbated 7KC-, 24S-OHC- and C24:0-induced cell dysfunction. 4-AP exacerbated loss of cell adhesion and cell growth inhibition, amplified mitochondrial depolarization and cytoplasmic membrane damage, and increased the percentage of SubG1 cells. The positive correlation between [K+]i and cell death supports the potential involvement of K+ in 7KC-, 24S-OHC-, and C24:0-induced cytotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "Increased levels of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), which results mainly from cholesterol auto-oxidation, are often found in the plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and might contribute to activation of microglial cells involved in neurodegeneration. As major cellular dysfunctions are induced by 7KC, it is important to identify molecules able to impair its side effects. Since consumption of olive and argan oils, and fish is important in the Mediterranean diet, the aim of the study was to determine the ability of oleic acid (OA), a major compound of olive and argan oil, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) present in fatty fishes, such as sardines, to attenuate 7KC-induced cytotoxic effects. Since elaidic acid (EA), the trans isomer of OA, can be found in hydrogenated cooking oils and fried foods, its effects on 7KC-induced cytotoxicity were also determined. In murine microglial BV-2 cells, 7KC induces cell growth inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunctions, reactive oxygen species overproduction and lipid peroxidation, increased plasma membrane permeability and fluidity, nuclei condensation and/or fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, which are apoptotic characteristics, and an increased LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, which is a criterion of autophagy. 7KC is therefore a potent inducer of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation\u00a0+\u00a0APOPTOsis\u00a0+\u00a0autoPHAGY) on BV-2 cells. OA and EA, but not DHA, also favor the accumulation of lipid droplets revealed with Masson\u2019s trichrome, Oil Red O, and Nile Red staining. The cytotoxicity of 7KC was strongly attenuated by OA and DHA. Protective effects were also observed with EA. However, 7KC-induced caspase-3 activation was less attenuated with EA. Different effects of OA and EA on autophagy were also observed. In addition, EA (but not OA) increased plasma membrane fluidity, and only OA (but not EA) was able to prevent the 7KC-induced increase in plasma membrane fluidity. Thus, in BV-2 microglial cells, the principal fatty acids of the Mediterranean diet (OA, DHA) were able to attenuate the major toxic effects of 7KC, thus reinforcing the interest of natural compounds present in the Mediterranean diet to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Our results showed that 25-OH exhibited an increasing after UV irradiation, highlighting the pivotal role of this oxysterol in skin degeneration. In our model, 25-OH induced not only caspases-dependent apoptosis associated to granzyme B release but also P2X7 receptor-dependent pyroptosis in skin cells. 25-OH seems to be at the origin of the main toxic pathways responsible for degenerative disorders; therefore, it could be the target of antidegenerative treatments, opening new potential therapeutic strategies.",

Many factors can be included in the etiopathogenesis of all of these multifactorial diseases that involve oxidative stress, inflammation and/or cell death processes, oxysterols, i.e. cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) as well as phytosterol oxidation products (POPs), among others. These oxidized lipids result from either spontaneous and/or enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol/phytosterols on the steroid nucleus or on the side chain and their critical roles in the pathophysiology of the abovementioned diseases has become increasingly evident. In this context, many studies investigated the potential of dietary phytochemicals (polyphenols, carotenoids and vitamins C and E, among others) to protect against oxysterol toxicity in various cell models mimicking pathophysiological conditions.

SSJ/day) on the brain lipidomic profile (fatty acid, sterols, cholesterol oxidation) of rats (non-genetic model) subjected to a high-fat (34% crude fat) dietary regimen. The SSJ did not affect the lipid infiltration (7.7\u20139.3%) and the fatty acid composition of the rat brain, which was mainly composed by unsaturated fatty acids (\u223c\u00a058%); however, the high-fat diet regimen significantly halved linoleic acid (LA). The high-fat diet also decreased (21.13\u00a0mg/g) the level of brain cholesterol with respect to the regular diet (4.5% crude fat) (23.83\u00a0mg/g); however, when the diet was shifted from high-fat to a regular regimen with or without SSJ supplementation, the levels of cholesterol significantly (p <\u00a00.05) increased up to 30.46\u00a0mg/g of brain. The main oxysterols were 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC) and \u03b2-epoxycholesterol (\u03b2-EC). The high-fat diet led to the highest cholesterol oxidation (63.1\u00a0\u03bcg/g), increasing 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) infiltration (0.24\u00a0\u03bcg/g rat brain) through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) compared to the regular diet (0.13\u00a0\u03bcg/g rat brain). On the other hand, when the diet was switched from high-fat to a regular regimen with SSJ supplementation, a significant reduction of 27-HC in the rat brain was found. Although 24-HC did not significantly change (p\u00a0=\u00a00.054), an increasing trend was observed when high-fat diet was supplied. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that SSJ was more active in counteracting cholesterol oxidation when supplied with the high-fat diet, due to inverse correlation with 24(S)-HC and 27-HC; however, further studies are needed to better understand which is the relationship between LA and cholesterol homeostasis in rat brain.",

     "abstract": "Oxysterols are cholesterol oxidation products formed through enzymatic or autoxidation mechanisms. 7-ketocholeterol (7KC) is one of most abundant oxysterols found in atherosclerotic lesions. Its role in atherosclerosis pathogenesis has been broadly studied in a variety of models. The arterial microenvironment is a multicellular dynamic compartment that, among other systemic factors, is continuously stimulated by 7KC. Endothelial cells have a key role on that environment, being in intimate contact with both the blood stream and the vessel wall, the site of disease origin. 7KC has been shown to promote endothelial cell death and/or dysfunction, depending on its concentration. However, its contribution to the cell microenvironment through cell stimulation has not received much attention. Here we applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics followed by bioinformatics workflow to analyze the effect of a non-toxic 7KC concentration on endothelial cell protein expression and secretion in vitro. Trypsin digests were prepared from the secretome of the endothelial cells and from the total cell pellet after 24\u00a0h exposure to 7KC. All samples were analyzed by high resolution and accurate mass nano-LC MS/MS. After database search and statistical analysis, differentially expressed proteins were selected for further studies. Our workflow identified 1805 secreted proteins and 2203 intracellular proteins, and of these, 48 and 53, respectively, were regulated. Regulated proteins upon 7KC exposure are involved in unfolded protein response, vascular homeostasis, and reduced control of angiogenesis. Moreover, blood coagulation was another main pathway regulated through Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI), an antithrombotic agent associated with coronary disease that we found to be more than 2 times downregulated. Taken together, these data show differential endothelial protein regulation and secretion upon 7KC exposure for short time periods under non-toxic conditions. Herewith, these data support the role of 7KC in atherosclerosis pathophysiology and thus reinforce the deleterious effect of endothelial cells stress in the arterial microenvironment.",

However, not much is known on the involvement of gut microbiota in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In addition, the gut microbiota might also be a potential source of plasma oxyphytosterol and oxycholesterol concentrations (oxidation products of plant sterols and cholesterol). Therefore, the aim of this study was to modulate the gut microbiota by antibiotic therapy to investigate effects on parameters reflecting cholesterol metabolism and oxyphytosterol concentrations.A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in which 55 obese, pre-diabetic men received oral amoxicillin (broad-spectrum antibiotic), vancomycin (antibiotic directed against Gram-positive bacteria) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) capsules for 7\u00a0days (1500\u00a0mg/day). Plasma lipid and lipoprotein, non-cholesterol sterol, bile acid and oxy(phyto)sterol concentrations were determined at baseline and after 1-week intervention.Plasma secondary bile acids correlated negatively with cholestanol (marker for cholesterol absorption, r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.367; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and positively with lathosterol concentrations (marker for cholesterol synthesis, r\u00a0=\u00a00.430; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Vancomycin and amoxicillin treatment did not affect markers for cholesterol metabolism, plasma TAG, total cholesterol, LDL-C or HDL-C concentrations as compared to placebo. In addition, both antibiotic treatments did not affect individual isoforms or total plasma oxyphytosterol or oxycholesterol concentrations.Despite strong correlations between plasma bile acid concentrations and cholesterol metabolism (synthesis and absorption), amoxicillin and vancomycin treatment for 7\u00a0days did not affect plasma lipid and lipoprotein, plasma non-cholesterol sterol and oxy(phyto)sterol concentrations in obese, pre-diabetic men.",

It is strongly induced by insulin in vivo in WAT and in vitro in adipocytes.In this study we addressed the function of Angptl8 in adipocytes by its stable lentivirus-mediated knock-down in 3T3-L1 cells, followed by analyses of triglyceride (TG) storage, lipid droplet (LD) morphology, the cellular lipidome, lipolysis, and gene expression.Depletion of Angptl8 did not drastically affect the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells but resulted in a moderate (18\u201319%) reduction of stored TGs. The lipidome analysis revealed a reduction of alkyl- phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) plasmalogens, as well as saturated PCs and PEs. Importantly, the Angptl8 depleted cells displayed enhanced lipolysis as measured by release of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs). Consistently, mRNAs encoding Angptl4 and Leptin, which facilitate lipolysis, as well as Cpt1a, Cpt1b, and Pgc-1\u03b1 involved in FA oxidation, were elevated. The Angptl8 mRNA itself was suppressed by pharmacologic treatments inducing lipolysis: stimulation with the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin.To conclude, knock-down of Angptl8 in adipocytes suggests that the protein acts to inhibit intracellular lipolysis, analogous to its activity in the circulation. Depletion of Angptl8 results in an altered cellular phospholipid composition. The findings identify Angptl8 as a central insulin-regulated controller of adipocyte lipid metabolism.",

PGDs (except dydrogesterone), cortisone and 9-fluorocortisol acetate affected weakly the fluorescence of Trp in buffer solution while they decreased in a dose-dependent manner that of HSA. Their binding constants to HSA were then calculated. Moreover, displacement experiment was performed using bilirubin as a site marker. The binding constant of bilirubin to albumin was determined in the absence and presence of a steroid at a molar ratio steroid to HSA of 1. The results indicate that the steroids bind to HSA at site I in a pocket different from that of bilirubin. Furthermore, the peak positions of amide I and amide II bands of HSA were shifted in the presence of progesterone, dydrogesterone and GCs.

In this study, the interaction of fluoxetine, a well-known selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant and lipid bilayers composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u2032-rac-glycerol) (DPPG) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) was studied from the aspect of electrostatics using second derivative spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to provide insights into the drug behavior. Changing pH from 7.4 to 9.5 to increases the neutral state of fluoxetine, the partitioning of fluoxetine into the zwitterionic DPPC large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) was increased whereas it was reduced into the negatively charged DPPG LUVs. Fluoxetine was found to exhibit a disordering effect on the acyl chains of DPPC and DPPG bilayers upon its partitioning. In addition, increasing concentration of NaCl lessened the binding of fluoxetine into DPPG bilayers due to the reduction in electrostatic attraction between positively charged fluoxetine and negatively charged DPPG LUVs. In addition, the FTIR study revealed that increasing the NaCl concentration could trigger the shift to higher frequency of the CH2 stretching as well as the notable blue shift in the PO2\u2212 regions of DPPG, indicating that fluoxetine had deeper penetration into DPPG LUVs. The differences in the NaCl concentration showed a negligible effect on the incorporation of fluoxetine into the zwitterionic DPPC LUVs. In summary, the electrostatic interaction plays an important role on the partitioning of a cationic amphiphilic SSIR drug into the lipid bilayers and the drug partitioning induces the lipids\u2019 conformational change.

     "abstract": "Polybia-MP1 or simply MP1 (IDWKKLLDAAKQIL-NH2) is a peptide with broad-spectrum bactericidal activity and a strong inhibitory effect against cancer cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of biophysical properties such as membrane texture and film thickness on MP1 interaction with neutral and anionic lipid membranes. For this purpose, we first explored the peptide\u2019s surface behavior. MP1 showed high surface activity, adsorbing onto bare air/aqueous interfaces up to higher surface pressures than the collapse pressure of MP1 Langmuir films. The MP1-lipid membrane interaction was studied using Langmuir phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PS) monolayers as model membrane systems. PS was chosen since this negatively charged lipid was found predominantly on the outer leaflet of tumor cells, and it enhances MP1 activity for PS-containing membranes to a greater extent than for other negatively charged lipids. MP1 incorporated into anionic PS monolayers, which show a liquid-expanded (LE) phase or LE-liquid-condensed (LC) phase coexistence, up to lipid-packing densities higher than those of cell membranes. The mixed lipid/MP1 films were explored by Brewster angle microscopy and atomic force microscopy. MP1 partitioned preferentially into the LE phase state of PS films, and were thus excluded from the coexisting LC phase. This interaction had strong electrostatic bases: in pure water, the lipid-peptide interaction was strong enough to induce formation of reversible lipid-peptide 3D structures associated with the interface. MP1 incorporation into the LE phase was accompanied by a shift of the phase transition pressure to higher values and a thinning of the lipid film. These results showed a clear correlation between peptide penetration capacity and the presence or induction of the thin LE phase. This capacity to regulate membrane physical properties may be of relevance in the binding, incorporation and membrane selectivity of this promising antitumor peptide.",

     "abstract": "Characterizing membrane protein structure and dynamics in the lipid bilayer membrane is very important but experimentally challenging. EPR spectroscopy offers a unique set of techniques to investigate a membrane protein structure, dynamics, topology, and distance constraints in lipid bilayers. Previously our lab demonstrated the use of magnetically aligned phospholipid bilayers (bicelles) for probing topology and dynamics of the membrane peptide M2\u03b4 of the acetyl choline receptor (AchR) as a proof of concept. In this study, magnetically aligned phospholipid bilayers and rigid spin labels were further utilized to provide improved dynamic information and topology of M2\u03b4 peptide. Seven TOAC-labeled AchR M2\u03b4 peptides were synthesized to demonstrate the utility of a multi-labeling amino acid substitution alignment strategy. Our data revealed the helical tilts to be 11\u00b0, 17\u00b0, 9\u00b0, 17\u00b0, 16\u00b0, 11\u00b0, 9\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00b0 for residues I7TOAC, Q13TOAC, A14TOAC, V15TOAC, C16TOAC, L17TOAC, and L18TOAC, respectively. The average helical tilt of the M2\u03b4 peptide was determined to be \u223c13\u00b0. This study also revealed that the TOAC labels were attached to the M2\u03b4 peptide with different dynamics suggesting that the sites towards the C-terminal end are more rigid when compared to the sites towards the N-terminus. The dynamics of the TOAC labeled sites were more resolved in the aligned samples when compared to the randomly disordered samples. This study highlights the use of magnetically aligned lipid bilayer EPR technique to determine a more accurate helical tilt and more resolved local dynamics of AchR M2\u03b4 peptide.",

     "abstract": "Neutron scattering is a powerful tool to study relaxation processes in biological membrane mimics in space and time. Combining different inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering techniques, a large dynamic range can be covered: from atomic to mesoscopic lengths and from femto- to some hundreds of nanoseconds in time. This allows studies on e.g. the diffusion of lipids, the membrane undulation motions, the dispersion of sound waves in membranes as well as the mutual interactions of membrane constituents such as lipids, proteins, and additives.In particular, neutron scattering provides a quite direct experimental approach to the inter-atomic and inter-molecular potentials on length and time scales which are perfectly accessible by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Neutron scattering experiments may thus substantially support the further refinement of biomolecular force fields for MD simulations by supplying structural and dynamical information with high spatial and temporal resolution. In turn, MD simulations support the interpretation of neutron scattering data. The combination of both, neutron scattering experiments and MD simulations, yields an unprecedented insight into the molecular interactions governing the structure and dynamics of biological membranes.This review provides an overview of the molecular dynamics in biological membrane mimics as revealed by neutron scattering. It focuses on the latest findings such as the fundamental molecular mechanism of lateral lipid diffusion as well as the influence of additives and proteins on the short-time dynamics of lipids. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison of recent neutron scattering and MD simulation data with respect to molecular membrane dynamics on the pico- to nanosecond time scale.",

Actually few methods are available to measure this lipase regio-selectivity, moreover they require chiral chromatography analysis or specific derivations which are discontinuous and time consuming. In this study we describe a new, convenient, sensitive and continuous spectrophotometric method to screen lipases regio-selectivity using synthetic triglycerides (TG) containing \u03b1-eleostearic acid (9Z, 11E, 13E-octadecatrienoic acid) either at the sn-1 position [1-\u03b1-eleostearoyl-2,3-octadecyl-sn-glycerol (sn-EOO)] or at the sn-3 position [1,2-octadecyl-3-\u03b1-eleostearoyl-sn-glycerol (sn-OOE)] and coated onto the wells of microtiter plates. A non-hydrolysable ether bond, with a non UV-absorbing alkyl chain, was introduced at the other sn positions to prevent acyl chain migration during TG synthesis or lipolysis. The synthesis of TG containing \u03b1-eleostearic acid was performed from S-glycidol in six steps to obtain sn-EOO and in five steps to sn-OOE. The \u03b1-eleostearic acid conjugated triene constitutes an intrinsic chromophore and, consequently, confers the strong UV absorption properties of this free fatty acid as well as of the TG harboring it. The lipase activity on coated sn-EOO or sn-OOE was measured by the increase in the absorbance at 272\u00a0nm due to the transition of \u03b1-eleostearic acid from the adsorbed to the soluble state. Human and porcine pancreatic lipases, guinea pig pancreatic lipase related protein 2, Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase, Candida antarctica lipase A and Candida antarctica lipase B were all used to validate the assay.

Using this approach the equivalent order of reaction corresponding to the phase transition can be determined alongside the activation energy. The cooperativity of both main transition and pre-transition was shown to be strongly dependent on scanning rate, asymptotically tending to a certain value at high rates, which corresponds to the number of lipid molecules in two concentric layers of hexagonal tiling. Changes in pretransition activation energy are shown to be proportional to changes in the system volume during the pretransition process, while the tail-length dependent part of the main transition activation energy is proportional to the jump in the number of gauche isomers.",

Clinically relevant strains of S. aureus, both methicillin susceptible and resistant, all exhibited increased lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis in response to mild environmental acidity, albeit to differing degrees, from \u223c30% to \u223c55% total phospholipid. Polar lipid extracts from these bacteria were analysed by 31P NMR and reconstituted into vesicles and monolayers, which were characterised by zeta potential measurements and Langmuir isotherms respectively. A combination of increased lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol content and mild environmental acidity were found to synergistically neutralise the charge of the membranes, in one instance altering the zeta potential from \u221256\u00a0mV to +21\u00a0mV, and induce closer packing between the lipids. Challenge of reconstituted S. aureus lipid model membranes by the antimicrobial peptide magainin 2 F5W was examined using monolayer subphase injection and neutron diffraction, and revealed that ionisation of the headgroup \u03b1-amine of lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol at pH 5.5, which reduced the magnitude of the peptide-lipid interaction by 80%, was more important for resisting peptide partitioning than increased lipid content alone. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to how colonising mildly acidic environments such as human mucosa may be facilitated by increased lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis and the implications of this for further biophysical analysis of the role of this lipid in bacterial membranes.",

The question arises as to which specific properties do sterols impart to membranes and to which extent do these properties differ among the different sterols. Using a range of biophysical techniques, including calorimetry, fluorescence microscopy, vesicle-fluctuation analysis, and atomic force microscopy, we have found that fucosterol and desmosterol, found in red and brown macroalgae (seaweeds), similar to cholesterol support liquid-ordered membrane phases and induce coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains in lipid bilayers. Fucosterol and desmosterol induce acyl-chain order in liquid membranes, but less effectively than cholesterol and ergosterol in the order: cholesterol\u00a0>\u00a0ergosterol\u00a0>\u00a0desmosterol\u00a0>\u00a0fucosterol, possibly reflecting the different molecular structure of the sterols at the hydrocarbon tail.",

     "abstract": "Anandamide (AEA) is a ubiquitous lipid that exerts neurotransmitter functions but also controls important biological functions such as proliferation, survival, or programmed cell death. The latter effects are also regulated by ceramide, a lipid enzymatically generated from sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase. Ceramide has been shown to increase the cellular toxicity of AEA, but the mechanisms controlling this potentiating effect remained unclear. Here we have used a panel of in silico, physicochemical, biochemical and cellular approaches to study the crosstalk between AEA and ceramide apoptotic pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that AEA and ceramide could form a stable complex in phosphatidylcholine membranes. Consistent with these data, we showed that AEA can specifically insert into ceramide monolayers whereas it did not penetrate into sphingomyelin membranes. Then we have studied the effects of ceramide on AEA-induced toxicity of human neuroblastoma cells. In these experiments, the cells have been either naturally enriched in ceramide by neutral sphingomyelinase pre-incubation or treated with C2-ceramide, a biologically active ceramide analog. Both treatments significantly increased the cytotoxicity of AEA as assessed by the MTS mitochondrial toxicity assay. This effect was correlated with the concomitant accumulation of natural ceramide (or its synthetic analog) and AEA in the cells. A kinetic study of AEA hydrolysis showed that ceramide inhibited the fatty acid amino hydrolase (FAAH) activity in cell extracts. Taken together, these data suggested that ceramide binds to AEA, increases its half-life and potentiates its cytotoxicity. Overall, these mechanisms account for a functional cross-talk between AEA and ceramide apoptotic pathways.",

The results indicate the broad trend that the tilt modulus for these PC lipids is smaller the closer the temperature is to the main transition temperature. Another trend is that inclusion of tilt raises the value of the bending modulus more for lipids with smaller values of the tilt modulus.

Here, the lipids self-assemble as vesicles when an aqueous phase diffusively replaces the original solvent in a macroscopically stationary (or quiescent) manner. We demonstrate this using phosphatidyl choline lipid\u2013ethanol\u2013water systems, where the average diameter of the liposomes is shown to be intrinsic, in reasonable agreement with the Helfrich's model of the vesicle free energy. The size depends only on the temperature and the lipid type, eliminating dependence on kinetic effects or external forcing normally observed. The method provides the first pure system to study the self-assembly of vesicle-forming surfactants; and with a natural thermodynamic length scale, it may have an implication for the vesicle size selection under pre-biotic conditions.",

     "abstract": "LDL peroxidation plays a major role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. The mechanisms of LDL peroxidation induced by transition metal ions have therefore been studied intensively. It has been proposed that the mechanism involves free radical production that occurs via decomposition of hydroperoxides. This, in turn, requires the cleavage of O\u2013H bonds. Cleavage of O\u2013D bond is slower and comparison of the kinetics in D2O to the kinetics in H2O is therefore a straightforward way to test this aspect of the alleged mechanism. The kinetics of peroxidation exhibit marked deuterium kinetic isotope effects at all the stages of oxidation under all the studied conditions. We found that the rate of propagation of copper-induced peroxidation is a monotonically decreasing function of D2O fraction in D2O/H2O mixtures. The only elementary reaction that involves \u201cexchangeable\u201d hydrogen at this stage is copper-induced decomposition of conjugated hydroperoxides. Therefore, we conclude that the latter step is rate-limiting reaction including cleavage of oxygen-hydrogen bond of hydroperoxide. The lag preceding rapid peroxidation exhibits a biphasic dependence on the fraction of D2O. This may be understood on the basis of the effect of substituting hydrogen atoms by deuterium.

     "abstract": "The fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is important for cellular entry of influenza virus. Previous studies showed that HA fusion peptide assumes a bent structure in membrane environment, which is extremely important for its fusion-promoting activity. In this work, we have measured the organization and dynamics of the tryptophan (Trp14) residue in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to investigate the conformational flexibility of tryptophan in membrane-mimetic environment. The steady state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were employed to investigate the location and rotational flexibility of the tryptophan residue in the SDS micelles. We have calculated the apparent rotational correlation time of Trp14 from the fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence lifetime data, and apparent rotational correlation time shows a substantial increase in presence of SDS. We have further measured the red edge excitation shift (REES) of Trp14 fluorescence in absence and in presence of two different concentrations of SDS. A large magnitude of REES at post-micellar concentration of SDS indicates the polar confined environment of Trp14 residue in the micellar milieu. Taken together, our results confirm that the tryptophan is located in a motionally restricted interfacial region of micelles. The interfacial location and slow dynamics of Trp14 might be important to adopt the appropriate structure of HA fusion peptide in membrane environment.",

We have investigated the effect of methylation of the pyrone moiety on the antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of Arz. This manoeuvre, that left the polyphenolic moiety unscathed, was nevertheless detrimental for antioxidant activity in both the cholesterol thermal degradation- and the Cu2+-induced liposome oxidation assays, providing evidence of structure-activity relationships that go beyond the preservation of the polyphenolic pharmacophore. The antioxidant activity of Arz was retained also in the Fe-NTA model of in vivo oxidative stress, with protective effect on the oxidative degradation of plasmatic lipids, unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Both Arz and methylarzanol (Me-Arz) were devoid of toxic effect on colonic differentiated Caco-2 cells up to 100\u00a0\u03bcM, but significantly reduced cancer Caco-2 cell viability at lower dosages. Arz could also selectively reduce viability of other cancer cell lines, [murine melanoma cells (B16F10 cells), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cells)], suggesting that it can act as a selective modulator of cell processes typical of cancer cells. Taken together, our results qualify Arz as a lead structure for further in vivo investigation of its pharmacological potential.",

Previous work using a quaternary Stratum Corneum (SC) lipid model in bulk suggested the incorporation of isopropyl myristate into the SC lipid matrix, phase separation, and perturbation of the multilamellar lipid assembly. Here, we used 2D Langmuir monolayers of a ternary SC lipid model, containing ceramide AP C18:18, stearic acid and cholesterol in a molar ratio of [1:1:0.7], respectively, to shed light on the mechanism of action of this important lipophilic penetration enhancer. To do so, the synthesis of chain deuterated isopropyl myristate was successfully performed in order to study the different coupling possibilities between the hydrogenated and deuterated IPM and the alkyl chains of the SC molecules. Our results indicate that only a small portion of IPM is able to mix with our SC model leading to a limited fluidizing effect (small increase of the wavenumber of CH2 stretching vibration, increase of the SC layer flexibility), but will be squeezed out at higher lateral pressures. Furthermore, the deuteration of IPM enhances the miscibility with this SC model, probably due to a different coupling between the alkyl chains or the alkyl and deuterated chains. Additionally, using the pure D-form of CER[AP] in the SC model amplifies the obtained results.",

Here, we have designed and realized a capillary sensory platform for the detection of bile acids using liquid crystals (LCs). LC droplets confined in micro-capillaries are homeotropically aligned at the surfactant-packed LC/aqueous interface. However, the competitive adsorption of bile acids disrupts the surfactant packing at this interface and triggers the orientational transition of the LC droplets from homeotropic to planar at the interface, followed by changes in optical images captured by polarized light microscopy. With this sensing system, we could successfully detect three main types of bile acids and further examine the effects of the pH of the solution and chain-length of the surfactant molecules on the detection of bile acids. Interference experiment with ascorbic acid confirms the feasibility of this bile acids detection approach.

The kinetics of hydrolysis was studied by analyzing the ester carbonyl \u03bd(CO) stretching vibration band across the two dimensional (2D) array of molecules at the confined interface. In particular, we demonstrate Triol C16 to form Michaelis-Menten type complex, like that of lipid-substrate analogues, where the Triol C16 head group remained accessible to the catalytic triad of the lipase. The enzyme-induced selective cleavage of the ester bond was spectroscopically monitored by the disappearance of the intense \u03bd(CO) resonance at 1736\u00a0cm\u22121. Consequently, the in situ spectroscopic measurements evidenced selective ester hydrolysis of Triol C16 yielding Tetrol C2OH and Palmitic acid, which remained predominantly in the undissociated form at the interface. The conformation sensitive amide I (majorly \u03bd(CO)) and the interfacial water reorganization suggested 2D ordering of the enzyme molecules following which interfacial reactions were employed towards probing the enzyme kinetics at the air/water interface. The investigation demonstrated further the potential of IRRAS spectroscopy for real-time monitoring the hydrolytic product formation and selectivity at biomimetic interfaces.",

The consequent effect of the polymer-lipid binding on the film properties was studied, with special interest in monolayer dynamics. The results indicate that electrostatic interactions play an important role in polymer-membrane affinity, and that the polymers formed a sub-layer, which increased the shear viscosity of the interface. The interacting polymer, even when it did not penetrate the lipid film, induced a polymer-like behavior of the monolayer regarding its dynamics: the whole film (polymer\u00a0+\u00a0lipid) became very viscous. As a consequence, the dynamic of the membrane was affected, thus inducing changes in the film topography, although the energetics for phase transition and the stability of each phase were modified slightly or not at all.",

The unique functionality of LDL-DHA ultimately relates to the structure of this nanoparticle. To date, however, little is known about the structural organization of this nanoparticle. In this study chemical, spectroscopic and electron microscopy analyses were undertaken to elucidate the structural and molecular organization of LDL-DHA nanoparticles. Unesterified DHA preferentially incorporates into the outer surface layer of LDL, where in this orientation the anionic carboxyl end of DHA is exposed to the LDL surface and imparts an electronegative charge to the nanoparticles surface. This negative surface charge promotes the monodisperse and homogeneous distribution of LDL-DHA nanoparticles in solution. Further structural analyses with cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the LDL-DHA nanostructure consist of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, which is distinctly different from the phospholipid monolayer/apolar core organization of plasma LDL. Lastly, apolipoprotein B-100 remains strongly associated with this complex and maintains a discrete size and shape of the LDL-DHA nanoparticles similar to plasma LDL. This preliminary structural assessment of LDL-DHA now affords the opportunity to understand the important structure\u2013function relationships of this novel nanoparticle.",

The characterization of PL profiles and the development of suitable in vitro maturation (IVM) protocols, that are able to modify membrane\u2019s composition, may result in significant improvements in oocyte developmental potential and cryotolerance. Using soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a model supplement, we evaluated the effect of PL supplementation during IVM on bovine cumulus-oocyte-complex (COC). Substantial changes in the lipid profiles of oocyte membrane were observed and associated with pre-implantation data. The propensity of the PC supplement to become soluble in the maturation medium and/or diffuse into mineral oil was also assessed. Oocytes were matured in TCM without supplementation, i.e. control, (n\u00a0=\u00a0922) or supplemented with 50 or 100\u00a0\u03bcM PC (n\u00a0=\u00a0994). The maturation media and mineral oil pre- and post- IVM, along with control and PC-treated oocytes were then analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and the lipid profiles were compared via principal component analysis (PCA). Soybean PCs are bioavailable and stable in IVM medium; further, PCs did not diffuse to the mineral oil, which also remained unaltered by the metabolism of treated oocytes. PC supplementation at 100\u00a0\u03bcM resulted in substantially greater relative abundances of polyunsatured PL, namely PC (32:1), PC (34:2), PC (36:6), PC (36:4), and PC (38:6), in oocyte membrane. These differences indicated that short-term exposure to the PC supplement could indeed modify the lipid composition of IVM-oocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Membrane incorporation of polyunsaturated molecular species of PC was favored, and does so without compromising the viability of the subsequent embryo in regards to cleavage, blastocyst development and hatching rate. The reported approach will allow for the development of novel strategies to modulate oocyte membrane dynamics and structure.",

By using liquid chromatography electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI\u2013MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with stable isotope feeding experiments with 13C-glucose and 15N-ammonium sulfate, the cerebrosides were determined to be N-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-1-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-4E,8E-sphingadienine, N-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-1-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-4E,8Z-sphingadienine, and N-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-1-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4E,8E-sphingadienine. The cerebrosides are strong amphipathic substances and potential metabolites for regulating difference and symbiosis within the microbial community.",

     "abstract": "In this work surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been used for the investigation of the self-assembled layers of lipid molecules (SALLMs) deposited on the nanostructured Au and Ag surfaces. The SALLMs were prepared from one part of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) and four parts of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) lipids. The synthesis of Au and Ag SERS substrates was based on the direct gold and silver ions reduction onto HF etched silicon wafers. Au SERS substrates were not suitable for the formation of SALLMs because of the inappropriate contact angle of surface. It was found that the formation of the SALLM does not take place on Au SERS substrate. However, it has been shown that the modification of Au SERS substrate with 1-dodecanothiol layer allows building the SALLM on its surface. In the case of Ag SERS substrate, the SALLM was deposited directly on its surface. The SERS spectra of the SALLMs were recorded in the CH stretching (2800\u20133000\u00a0cm\u22121) and the fingerprint (<1.800\u00a0cm\u22121) regions. It has been demonstrated that the SERS spectra of the SALLM recorded on Au substrate differs from that one recorded on Ag SERS substrate. These spectral differences were found to be determined by the different interaction mechanisms of the lipid molecules with nanostructured surfaces.",

     "abstract": "A recently developed membrane mimetic system called styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) or lipodisq nanoparticles has shown to possess significant potential for biophysical studies of membrane proteins. This new nanoparticle system is composed of lipids encircled by SMA copolymers. Previous studies showed that SMA copolymers are capable of extracting membrane proteins directly from their native environments without the assistance of detergents. However, a full structural characterization of this promising membrane mimetic system is still lacking. In this study, the formation of lipodisq nanoparticles was characterized upon addition of the membrane protein KCNE1. Initially, multi-lamellar vesicles (MLVs) containing KCNE1 (KCNE1-MLVs) at a lipid to protein molar ratio of 500/1 were prepared using a standard dialysis method. SMA copolymers were then added to KCNE1-MLVs at a series of lipid to SMA weight ratios to observe the solubilizing property of SMA in the presence of the KCNE1 membrane protein. The solubilizing process of KCNE1-MLVs by SMA copolymers undergoes a transition phase at low SMA concentrations (samples with weight ratios of 1/0.25, 1/0.5, and 1/0.75). More lipodisq nanoparticles were formed at higher SMA concentrations (Samples with weight ratios of 1/1, 1/1.25, and 1/1.5) were directly observed in the corresponding TEM images. A single sharp DLS peak was observed from the sample at the weight ratio of 1/1.5, which indicated the complete solubilization of KCNE1-MLVs. Interestingly, the critical weight ratio for empty MLVs was found to be 1/1.25 previously, which suggested that the presence of KCNE1 makes it more difficult for the solubilizing process of the SMA copolymers. Also, a TEM image of the 1/1.5 sample showed the presence of silky aggregates of excess copolymers. Overall, this study demonstrated the ability of SMA copolymers to form lipodisq nanoparticles in the presence of the membrane protein KCNE1.",

Although MALDI and ESI MS are both widely used, it is so far not clear whether all potential phospholipid oxidation products can be detected by both methods This aspect will be studied here using NaMnO4-oxidized phosphatidylcholine 16:0/18:1 and 16:0/18:2 as simple, but reliable model systems.We will show that chain-shortened products such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids (generated by cleavage at the double bond position) can be easily detected by both ionization methods: without the need of any derivatization. However, primary oxidation products such as hydroperoxides can be predominantly detected by ESI MS while MALDI-TOF MS detects secondary oxidation products derived thereof more sensitively. Potential reasons for these differences will be discussed and put in the context of biological mixture analysis.",

Viral coat proteins are thought to bind the virus to the membrane and actively fuse the viral and cellular membranes together. The actual molecular mechanism of fusion is challenging to visualize, resulting in the use of model systems. Here, the bilayer curvature modifying properties of a synthetic variant of the HIV-1 gp41 fusion peptide with lipid bilayer vesicles composed of a mixture of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) were studied. In 7:3 DMPC:DMPS vesicles made with deuterium-labeled DMPC, the peptide was observed to undergo a concentration-dependent conformational transition between an \u03b1-helix and an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet. Through the use of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and selective deuterium labeling, it was revealed that conformational transition of the peptide is also accompanied by a transition in the structure of the lipid bilayer. In addition to changes in the distribution of the lipid between the leaflets of the vesicle, the SANS data are consistent with two regions having different thicknesses. Of the two different bilayer structures, the one corresponding to the smaller area fraction, being \u223c8% of the vesicle area, is much thicker than the remainder of the vesicle, which suggests that there are regions of localized negative curvature similar to what takes place at the point of contact between two membranes immediately preceding fusion.",

     "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (ATX) is considered as a prototype of cytotoxic bacterial phospholipases C, and is the major virulence factor in C. perfringens-induced gas gangrene. It is known that, depending on the dose, ATX causes membrane disruption and cytolysis or only limited hydrolysis of its substrates. In the latter case, toxin activity leads to the unregulated generation of bioactive lipids that can ultimately induce cell death. We have characterized apoptosis and necrosis in highly ATX-sensitive, ganglioside-deficient cells exposed to different concentrations of ATX and we have studied the lipidomic profile of cells treated with ATX as compared to native cells to detect the main changes in the lipidomic profile and the possible involvement of lipid signals in cell death. ATX causes both apoptosis and necrosis, depending on dose and time. ATX activates cell death, stimulating the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria and the consequent activation of caspases-3. Moreover GM95 cells treated with ATX showed important lipidomic alterations, among them we detected a general decrease in several phospholipid species and important changes in lipids involved in programmed cell death e.g. ceramide. The data suggest two different mechanisms of cell death caused by ATX, one leading to (mainly saturated) glycerophospholipid hydrolysis related to an increase in diacylglycerols and associated to membrane damage and necrosis, and a second mechanism involving chiefly sphingomyelin hydrolysis and generation of proapoptotic lipidic mediators such as ceramide, N-acylethanolamine and saturated non-esterified fatty acids.",

Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that membrane cholesterol plays an important role in the function of the serotonin1A receptor. Our earlier results highlighted several structural features of cholesterol essential for receptor function. In order to explore the importance of the hydroxyl group of cholesterol in the function of the serotonin1A receptor, we utilized cholesterol oxidase to oxidize the hydroxyl group of cholesterol to keto group. Our results show that the oxidation of the hydroxyl group of cholesterol in live cells resulted in enhancement of agonist binding and G-protein coupling to the receptor with no appreciable change in overall membrane order.

Molecular-level details of steroid-phospholipid membranes interactions are scrutinized employing molecular dynamics simulations supported by quantum chemical calculations to assess steroid lipophilicity. Moreover, permeability of both species across membranes is experimentally evaluated by immobilized artificial membrane chromatography. We demonstrate that while there is no significant difference of lipophilicity and membrane permeability between the two steroids, they differ significantly regarding detailed localization in phospholipid membranes. The bulky glutamate moiety of pregnanolone glutamate is flexible and well exposed to the water phase while the sulfate group of pregnanolone sulfate is hidden in the membrane headgroup region. This dissimilarity of behavior in membranes can potentially account for the observed different activities of the two steroids toward membrane-bound N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors.",

Our results conclusively show the capacity of hypotonic gradients to improve the pore forming capacity of rSt I molecules, even in pure DPPC liposomes, rendering pore-formation less dependent on the presence of sphyngomyelin.

Measurements of tryptophan fluorescence in conjunction with circular dichroism showed that SAA (1\u201327) peptide binds to neutral and acidic lysophospholipids, whereas SAA (43\u201363) peptide binds only to acidic lysophospholipids. For both these SAA peptides, binding to lysophospholipids inhibited heparin-induced amyloid-like fibril formation by stabilizing the \u03b1-helical structure. However, acidic lysophospholipids implied a possibility to promote fibril formation of SAA (1\u201327) peptide by themselves.

This interaction is investigated to find out about the folding and unfolding effect of unsaturated fatty acids on the kinase domain structure of hFGFR2b. Recombinant pLEICS-01 vectors, containing the mutated coding region of hFGFR2b, are expressed in the standard Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) host cells and purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. While polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis characterizes the functionality of recombinant protein, its structural changes are studied in the presence and absence of various concentrations of oleic, \u03b1-linolenic and linoleic acids using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Far ultraviolet CD results show that unsaturated fatty acids do not change the secondary structure of the recombinant kinase domain of hFGFR2b. However, chemical denaturation analysis confirms that all three UFAs destabilize the tertiary structure of recombinant protein. A decrease in the fluorescence intensity without any significant red or blue shift (336\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nm) reflects a variation in the tertiary structure of protein. The direct interaction of the studied UFAs with hFGFR2b reduces the conformational stability of their kinase domains.

     "abstract": "Detergents are widely used to solubilize and separate biomembrane components. It is therefore relevant to study and understand the mechanistic details underlying detergent-lipid interactions using biomimetic systems. Here, we have investigated in detail the process of membrane permeabilization and the nature of pores induced by sub-solubilizing concentrations of the detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) in bilayers composed of palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and binary mixtures of these phospholipids with 30 mol% cholesterol (chol). A fluorescence quenching assay was used to evaluate the permeability of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) in the presence of increasing concentrations of TX-100. Confocal microscopy was employed to visualize and quantify the permeability of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to two fluorescent dyes of different sizes in the presence of TX-100. Both methods showed that POPC, POPC/chol and SM membranes become fully permeable at a specific TX-100 concentration, followed by complete (POPC and SM) and partial (POPC/chol) solubilization at a higher detergent concentration. The confocal microscopy experiments revealed that opening of pores occurs as a well-defined event and that for POPC and POPC/chol the pores were initially selective to the small probe and then grew and allowed passage of the larger dye as well. On the other hand, the insoluble SM/chol membranes exhibited only a mild TX-100-induced permeabilization. The membrane edge tension of the liquid phases was measured from the closure rate of macropores induced by electric pulses in GUVs.

     "abstract": "Syntheses and enzymological characterization of fluorogenic substrate probes targeting secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) for detection and quantitative assays are presented. Three fluorogenic phosphatidylcholine analogs PC-1, PC-2, and PC-3 each containing the duo of 7-mercapto-4-methyl-coumarin fluorophore and 2,4-dinitroanaline quencher on either tail were synthesized from (R)-3-amino-1,2-propanediol and R-(-)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol. These small reporter groups are advantageous in preserving natural membrane integrity. Phosphocholine was incorporated into the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone. Acyl amino group at the sn-1 position in PC-1 and PC-2 is meant to block sPLA1. The sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone in PC-1 have a quencher terminated 12-carbon chain and fluorophore terminated 11-carbon chain respectively. PC-2 has a quencher terminated 3-carbon chain at the sn-2 and chain terminating fluorescent reporter at the sn-1 positions. PC-3 resembles PC-1 except for an ester instead of amide at the sn-1 position, because of which it is more similar to natural phospholipids than PC-1. It was designed to elucidate the effect of replacing the ester group with amide by comparing its hydrolysis rate with that of PC-1. Design principles apply to synthesis of other labeled phospholipids. Enzymological characterization using bee-venom sPLA2 was performed by a fatty-acid-binding-protein fluorescence assay and by pH-Stat method in which the amount of fatty acid released by hydrolysis is given by the amount of base required to maintain a constant pH of 8.0. Hydrolytic activity toward PC-1 and PC-3 were each about 238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcmol/mg/min and 537\u00a0\u03bcmol/mg/min on unmodified phospholipid. Ester to amide change did not affect hydrolysis rates. Activity toward PC-2 was about 45-\u03bcmol/mg/min. PC-1 and PC-3 show potential for targeted real-time spectrophotometric assay of sPLA2.",

In the search for sensitive and selective phospholipase assays, we have focused on synthetic FRET (F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer) substrates. This has led to the development of a facile, easily scalable and low cost synthesis of fluorogenic phospholipids featuring the dansyl/dabcyl fluorophore/quencher-pair on the fatty acid \u03c9-position and on the phosphatidylethanolamine head group, respectively. Hence, the two substrates lyso-(dansyl-FA)-GPE-dabcyl (6) and (dansyl-FA)2-GPE-dabcyl (7) were synthesized by a chemoenzymatic strategy, in which preparation of (6) further included a novel selective enzymatic esterification step. As proof of concept, activity of a handful of phospholipases, one from each of the PLA1, PLA2, PLC and PLD classes, were assayed using substrates (6) and (7), and the kinetic parameter kcat/KM was determined. The PLA1 (Lecitase Ultra\u2122) was found to be highly active on both substrates, whereas the PLD (from white cabbage) had no activity, presumably due to steric effects associated with the dabcyl-functionalization of the head group. It was further substantiated that the substrates are specific towards phospholipase activity as the tested lipase (Lipolase\u2122) showed close to zero activity.",

The molecular species of MADAG obtained from digestive glands of the deep-sea squid Berryteuthis magister were identified. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) were applied. The mass spectra of each molecular species contained positive quasi-molecular ion [M+H]+ with fragment ions [M\u2013R\u2032CO2]+, [M\u2013R\u2032\u2032CO2]+, and [M\u2013OR\u2032\u2032\u2032]+, as well as negative cluster ion [M\u00a0+\u00a02H2OH]\u2212 without fragments. The exact masses of the negative ions allowed determination of the molecular formulas and the number of double bonds; the positive fragment ions were used to determine the location of acyl and alkyl groups in MADAG molecules. Ninety molecular species of MADAG were revealed. The regiospecific composition was identified for 72 individual molecular species. Eleven pairs of positional isomers of acyl groups were found. Four molecular ions were produced by a mixture of acyl/alkyl isomers. Most of molecular species contained 16:0e or 18:1e alkyl groups in the sn-1 position, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids mainly esterified the sn-2 position of MADAG from B. magister.

Increased hydrophobicity of the solid support allowed vesicle fusion and the formation of a hybrid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) bilayer, as probed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), contact angle measurements (CA) also by the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

In the present study, we synthesized and characterized a homologous series of NABAs bearing saturated acyl chains (n\u00a0=\u00a08-20) and investigated their supramolecular organization and thermotropic phase behavior. In differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies, most of the NABAs gave one or two minor transitions before the main chain-melting phase transition in the dry state as well as upon hydration with water, but gave only a single transition when hydrated with buffer (pH\u00a07.6). Transition enthalpies (\u0394Ht) and entropies (\u0394St), obtained from the DSC studies showed linear dependence on the chain length in the dry state and upon hydration with buffer, whereas odd-even alteration was observed when hydrated with water. The crystal structures of N-lauroyl-\u03b2-alanine (NLBA) and N-myristoyl-\u03b2-alanine (NMBA) were solved in monoclinic system in the P21/c space group. Both NLBA and NMBA were packed in tilted bilayers with head-to-head (and tail-to-tail) arrangement with tilt angles of 33.28\u00b0 and 34.42\u00b0, respectively. Strong hydrogen bonding interactions between COOH groups of the molecules from opposite leaflets as well as NH\u22efO hydrogen bonds between the amide groups from adjacent molecules in the same leaflet as well as dispersion interactions between the acyl chains stabilize the bilayer structure. The d-spacings calculated from powder X-ray diffraction studies showed odd-even alteration with odd-chain length compounds exhibiting higher values as compared to the even-chain length ones and the tilt angles calculated from the PXRD data are higher for the even chain NABAs. These observations are relevant to developing structure-activity relationships for these amphiphiles and understand how NABAs differ from their homologues and isomers, namely NAGs, NAGABAs, and N-acylalanines.",

In this work, a detailed thermodynamic and structural characterization of a simple model system, which based on a hexadecanol-phospholipid mixture is reported. Langmuir monolayers of binary mixtures of hexadecanol/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) have been studied with thermodynamic parameters and monolayer structure. The extent of the thermodynamic parameters has been evaluated by the direct related parameters, such as mean molecular area, percent of condensation, surface excess Gibbs free energies, isothermal compressibility, interaction energy parameter, activity coefficient and two-dimensional phase diagram. Monolayer film structure has been characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique. Combining thermodynamic and AFM data indicate that there exist repulsive and attractive interactions between the two film forming molecules and the binary films behave as non-ideal mixtures, which can be portrayed by the mole fraction of hexadecanol. At low mole fraction of hexadecanol, the monolayer is phase-separated and the interactions between hexadecanol and DPPE is more repulsive; while the content of hexadecanol up to 0.6, the monolayer becomes miscible and stable, the interaction between different molecules is more attractive. The addition of hexadecanol in the DPPE monolayer clearly affects the lateral organization of membranes and improves its surface tension kinetics. The results discussed in this context will be expected to be potential contribution for exogenous lung surfactant researches.",

A simplified model is discussed, showing practical advantages when fitting the data within the reduced frequency range.

The methodology was tested in samples of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine with different percentiles of cholesterol.

Phenylethanol (PEtOH) is a constituent of essential oils with a pleasant odor and can act as a local anesthetic. In this work, we have explored the effect of PEtOH on the function of the hippocampal serotonin1A receptor, a representative neurotransmitter receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Our results show that PEtOH induces reduction in ligand binding to the serotonin1A receptor due to lowering of binding affinity, along with a concomitant decrease in the degree of G-protein coupling. Analysis of membrane order using the environment-sensitive fluorescent probe DPH revealed decrease in membrane order with increasing PEtOH concentration, as evident from reduction in rotational correlation time of the probe. Analysis of results obtained shows that the action of local anesthetics could be attributed to the combined effects of specific interaction of the receptor with anesthetics and alteration of membrane properties (such as membrane order). These results assume relevance in the perspective of anesthetic action and could be helpful to achieve a better understanding of the possible role of anesthetics in the function of membrane receptors.",

With multilamellar vesicles, the ionic liquids that did not disrupt liposomes decreased the lamellar spacing as a function of concentration. The magnitude of the effect depended on concentration for all studied ionic liquids. Using large unilamellar vesicles, first a slight decrease in the vesicle size, then aggregation of vesicles was observed by DLS for increasing ionic liquid concentrations. At concentrations just below those that caused aggregation of liposomes, large unilamellar vesicles were coated by ionic liquid cations, evidenced by a change in their zeta potential. The ability of phosphonium-based ionic liquids to affect liposomes is related to the length of the hydrocarbon chains in the cation. Generally, the ability of ionic liquids to disrupt liposomes goes hand in hand with inducing disorder in the phospholipid membrane. However, trioctylmethylphosphonium acetate selectively extracted and induced a well-ordered lamellar structure in phospholipids from disrupted cholesterol-containing large unilamellar vesicles.

     "abstract": "Ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) is an important signaling sphingolipid and a metabolite of ceramide. C1P contains an anionic phosphomonoester head group and has been shown to regulate physiological and pathophysiological processes such as cell proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and macrophage chemotaxis. Despite this mechanistic information on its role in intra- and intercellular communication, little information is available on the biophysical properties of C1P in biological membranes and how it interacts with effector proteins. Fluorescently labeled lipids have been a useful tool to understand the membrane behavior properties of lipids such as phosphatidylserine, cholesterol, and some phosphoinositides. However, to the best of our knowledge, fluorescently labeled C1P hasn\u2019t been implemented to investigate its ability to serve as a mimetic of endogenous C1P in cells or untagged C1P in in vitro experiments. Cellular and in vitro assays demonstrate TopFluor-C1P harbors a fluorescent group that is fully buried in the hydrocarbon core and fluoresces across the spectrum of physiological pH values. Moreover, TopFluor-C1P didn\u2019t affect cellular toxicity at concentrations employed, was as effective as unlabeled C1P in recruiting an established protein effector to intracellular membranes, and its subcellular localization recapitulated what is known for endogenous C1P. Notably, the diffusion coefficient of TopFluor-C1P was slower than that of TopFluor-phosphatidylserine or TopFluor-cholesterol in the plasma membrane and similar to that of other fluorescently labeled sphingolipids including ceramide and sphingomyelin. These studies demonstrate that TopFluor-C1P should be a reliable mimetic of C1P to study C1P membrane biophysical properties and C1P interactions with proteins.",

     "abstract": "The Golgi complex constitutes a central way station of the eukaryotic endomembrane system, an intricate network of organelles engaged in control of membrane trafficking and the processing of various cellular components. Previous ideas of compartmental stability within this network are gradually being reshaped by concepts describing a biochemical continuum of hybrid organelles whose constitution is regulated by compartmental maturation. Membrane lipid composition and lipid signaling processes make fundamental contributions to compartmentalization strategies that are themselves critical for organizing cellular architecture and biochemical activities. Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of membrane trafficking through the secretory pathway. They do so by coordinating lipid metabolism with lipid signaling, translating this information to core protein components of the membrane trafficking machinery. In this capacity, PITPs can be viewed as regulators of an essential lipid-protein interface of cisternal maturation. It is also now becoming appreciated, for the first time, that such an interface plays important roles in larger systems processes that link secretory pathway function with cell proliferation.",

The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of the positive control, i.e., 0.1\u00a0mM of cholesterol solubilized in the artificial intestine fluid, was found to be 0.33 (\u00b1\u00a00.17)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0cm/s.

Mean molecular areas obtained from (\u03c0\u2013A) isotherms of mixed PoxnoPC\u2013POPC and PazePC\u2013POPC monolayers revealed different behaviors of these two oxidized lipids: the presence of PoxnoPC in the monolayers induces their expansion, mean molecular areas being higher than those expected in the case of ideal mixtures. PazePC\u2013POPC behave on the whole ideally. This difference can be explained by a different conformation of oxidized lipids. Moreover the carboxylic function of PazePC is protonated under our experimental conditions, as shown by (\u03c0\u2013A) isotherms of PazePC at different pH values. Both oxidized lipids induce also an increase of the monolayer elasticity, PoxnoPC being slightly more efficient than PazePC. These monolayers were transferred from the air\u2013water interface onto mica supports for a study by AFM. AFM images are on the whole homogenous, suggesting the presence of only one lipid phase in both cases. However, in the case of PazePC\u2013POPC monolayers, AFM images show also the presence of areas thicker of 7\u00a0nm to 10\u00a0nm than the surrounding lipid phase, probably due to the local formation of multilayer systems induced by compression.",

     "abstract": "The most abundant ganglioside group in both human milk and bovine milk during the first postnatal week is ganglioside GD3. This group of disialogangliosides forms up to 80% of the total ganglioside content of colostrum. Although dietary gangliosides have shown biological activity such as improvement of cognitive development, gastrointestinal health, and immune function, there is still a gap in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing its uptake and the metabolic processes affecting its bioavailability. The use of isotopically labeled ganglioside to track the bioavailability, absorption, distribution, and metabolism of gangliosides may provide key information to bridge this gap. However, isotope labeledGD3 is not commercially available and its preparation has not been described. We report for the first time the preparation of labeled GD3 with stable isotopes. Using alkaline hydrolysis, we were able to selectively remove both acetyl groups from the tetrasaccharide portion of GD3 without promoting significant hydrolysis of the ceramide portion of the molecule to generate N-deacetyl-GD3 (Neu5\u03b12-8Neu5-GD3). The N-deacetyl-GD3 was then chemoselectively re-acetylated in aqueous medium using deuterated acetic anhydride in the presence of Triton X 100 to produce 2H6-GD3 {GD3[(Neu5Ac-11-2H3)-(Neu5Ac-11-2H3)]}. This method provided 2H6-GD3 with approximately 60% yield. This compound was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS). The oral absorption of the 2H6-GD3 was demonstrated using a Sprague-Dawley weaning rats.

     "abstract": "The interfacial properties of the membrane are exceptionally vital in drug-membrane interaction. They not only select out a particular prototropic form of the drug molecule for incorporation, but are also potent enough to induce structural switchover of these drugs in several cases. In this work, we quantitatively monitored the change in dipolar rearrangement of the micellar interface (as a simplified membrane mimic) by measuring the dielectric constant and dipole potential with the micellization of SDS at pH 3.6. The dielectric constant and dipole potential were measured utilizing the fluorescence of polarity sensitive probe, pyrene and potential-sensitive probe, di-8-ANEPPS, respectively. Our study demonstrates that the change in dipolar rearrangement directly influences the switchover equilibrium between the anionic and neutral from of piroxicam. We have further extended our work to evaluate the effect of hydrophobic chain length of the surfactants on the dipolar rearrangement and its effect on the structural switchover of piroxicam. It is interesting that the extent of switchover of piroxicam is directly correlated with the dipolar rearrangement induced bythe varying hydrophobic chain length of the surfactants. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first report to show the dependence of dipole potential on the hydrophobic chain length of the surfactant and demonstrate that the dipolar rearrangement directly tunes the extent of structural switchover of piroxicam, which was so far only intuitive. We consider that this new finding would have promising implication in drug distribution and drug efficacy.",

     "abstract": "Because of the amphipathicity and conical molecular shape of fatty acids, they can efficiently incorporate into lipid membranes and disturb membrane integrity, chain packing, and lateral pressure profile. These phenomena affect both model membranes as well as biological membranes. We investigated the feasibility of exploiting fatty acids as permeability enhancers in drug delivery systems for enhancing drug release from liposomal carriers and drug uptake by target cells. Saturated fatty acids, with acyl chain length from C8 to C20, were tested using model drug delivery liposomes of 1,2- dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line as a model cell. A calcein release assay demonstrated reduction in the membrane permeability barrier of the DPPC liposomes, proportionally to the length of the fatty acid. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments revealed that C12 to C20 fatty acids can stabilize DPPC liposomal bilayers and induce the formation of large structures, probably due to liposome aggregation and bilayer morphological changes. On the other hand, the short fatty acids C8 and C10 tend to destabilize the bilayers and only moderately cause the formation of large structures. The effect of fatty acids on DPPC liposomes was not completely transferrable to the MCF-7 cell line. Using cytotoxicity assays, the cells were found to be relatively insensitive to the fatty acids at apoptotic sub-millimolar concentrations. Increasing the fatty acid concentration to few millimolar substantially reduced the viability of the cells, most likely via the induction of necrosis and cell lysis. A bioluminescence living-cell-based luciferase assay showed that saturated fatty acids in sub-cytotoxic concentrations cannot reduce the permeability barrier of cell membranes. Our results confirm that the membrane perturbing effect of fatty acids on model membranes cannot simply be carried over to biological membranes of live cells.",

     "abstract": "Applications of solid-state NMR spectroscopy for investigating the influences of lipid-cholesterol interactions on membrane fluctuations are reviewed in this paper. Emphasis is placed on understanding the energy landscapes and fluctuations at an emergent atomistic level. Solid-state 2H NMR spectroscopy directly measures residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) due to individual C\u20132H labeled segments of the lipid molecules. Moreover, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of 13C\u20131H bonds are obtained in separated local-field NMR spectroscopy. The distributions of RQC or RDC values give nearly complete profiles of the order parameters as a function of acyl segment position. Measured equilibrium properties of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids including their binary and tertiary mixtures with cholesterol show unequal mixing associated with liquid-ordered domains. The entropic loss upon addition of cholesterol to sphingolipids is less than for glycerophospholipids and may drive the formation of lipid rafts. In addition relaxation time measurements enable one to study the molecular dynamics over a wide time-scale range. For 2H NMR the experimental spin-lattice (R1Z) relaxation rates follow a theoretical square-law dependence on segmental order parameters (SCD) due to collective slow dynamics over mesoscopic length scales. The functional dependence for the liquid-crystalline lipid membranes is indicative of viscoelastic properties as they emerge from atomistic-level interactions. A striking decrease in square-law slope upon addition of cholesterol denotes stiffening relative to the pure lipid bilayers that is diminished in the case of lanosterol. Measured equilibrium properties and relaxation rates infer opposite influences of cholesterol and detergents on collective dynamics and elasticity at an atomistic scale that potentially affects lipid raft formation in cellular membranes.",

     "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that control the multiple possible modes of protein association with membrane cholesterol are remarkably convergent. These mechanisms, which include hydrogen bonding, CH-\u03c0 stacking and dispersion forces, are used by a wide variety of extracellular proteins (e.g. microbial or amyloid) and membrane receptors. Virus fusion peptides penetrate the membrane of host cells with a tilted orientation that is compatible with a transient interaction with cholesterol; this tilted orientation is also characteristic of the process of insertion of amyloid proteins that subsequently form oligomeric pores in the plasma membrane of brain cells. Membrane receptors that are associated with cholesterol generally display linear consensus binding motifs (CARC and CRAC) characterized by a triad of basic (Lys/Arg), aromatic (Tyr/phe) and aliphatic (Leu/Val) amino acid residues. In some cases, the presence of both CARC and CRAC within the same membrane-spanning domain allows the simultaneous binding of two cholesterol molecules, one in each membrane leaflet. In this review the molecular basis and the functional significance of the different modes of protein-cholesterol interactions in plasma membranes are discussed.",

     "abstract": "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest receptor superfamily in eukaryotic cells. Owing to their seven transmembrane helices, large parts of these proteins are embedded in the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane bilayer. Thus, GPCRs are always in proximity to cholesterol. Some of them are functionally dependent on the specific presence of cholesterol. Over the last years, enormous progress on receptor structures has been achieved. While lipophilic ligands other than cholesterol have been shown to bind either inside the helix bundle or at the receptor-lipid interface, the binding site of cholesterol was either a single transmembrane helix or a groove between two or more transmembrane helices. A clear preference for one of the two membrane leaflets has not been observed. Not surprisingly, many hydrophobic residues (primarily leucine and isoleucine) were found to be involved in cholesterol binding. In most cases, the rough \u03b2-face of cholesterol contacted the transmembrane helix bundle rather than the surrounding lipid matrix. The polar hydroxy group of cholesterol was localized near the water-membrane interface with potential hydrogen bonding to residues in receptor loop regions. Although a canonical motif, designated as CCM site, was detected as a specific cholesterol binding site in case of the \u03b22AR, this site was not found to be occupied by cholesterol in other GPCRs possessing the same motif. Cholesterol-receptor interactions can increase the compactness of the receptor structure and are able to enhance the conformational stability towards active or inactive receptor states. Overall, all current data suggest a high plasticity of cholesterol interaction sites in GPCRs.",

Cholesterol in molar excess of the capacity of these polar bilayer lipids has a high accessibility and fugacity; we call this fraction active cholesterol. This review first considers how active cholesterol serves as an upstream regulator of cellular sterol homeostasis. The mechanism appears to utilize the redistribution of active cholesterol down its diffusional gradient to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it binds multiple effectors and directs their feedback activity. We have also reviewed a broad literature in search of a role for active cholesterol (as opposed to bulk cholesterol or lipid domains such as rafts) in the activity of diverse membrane proteins. Several systems provide such evidence, implicating, in particular, caveolin-1, various kinds of ABC-type cholesterol transporters, solute transporters, receptors and ion channels.

     "abstract": "The rod outer segment (ROS) of retinal photoreceptor cells consists of disk membranes surrounded by the plasma membrane. It is a relatively uncomplicated system in which to investigate cholesterol distribution and its functional consequences in biologically relevant membranes. The light sensitive protein, rhodopsin is the major protein in both membranes, but the lipid compositions are significantly different in the disk and plasma membranes. Cholesterol is high in the ROS plasma membrane. Disk membranes are synthesized at the base of the ROS and are also high in cholesterol. However, cholesterol is rapidly depleted as the disks are apically displaced. During this apical displacement the disk phospholipid fatty acyl chains become progressively more unsaturated, which creates an environment unfavorable to cholesterol. Membrane cholesterol has functional consequences. The high cholesterol found in the plasma membrane and in newly synthesized disks inhibits the activation of rhodopsin. As disks are apically displaced and cholesterol is depleted rhodopsin becomes more responsive to light. This effect of cholesterol on rhodopsin activation has been shown in both native and reconstituted membranes. The modulation of activity can be at least partially explained by the effect of cholesterol on bulk lipid properties. Cholesterol decreases the partial free volume of the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer and thereby inhibits rhodopsin conformational changes required for activation. However, cholesterol binds to rhodopsin and may directly affect the protein also. Furthermore, cholesterol stabilizes rhodopsin to thermal denaturation. The membrane must provide an environment that allows rhodopsin conformational changes required for activation while also stabilizing the protein to thermal denaturation. Cholesterol thus plays a complex role in modulating the activity and stability of rhodopsin, which have implications for other G-protein coupled receptors.",

In an attempt to explain these functions of cholesterol, several models have been put forward about cholesterol\u2019s lateral and transbilayer organization in the PM. In this article, we review imaging techniques developed over the last two decades for assessing the distribution and dynamics of cholesterol in the PM of mammalian cells. Particular focus is on fluorescence techniques to study the lateral and inter-leaflet distribution of suitable cholesterol analogues in the PM of living cells. We describe also several methods for determining lateral cholesterol dynamics in the PM including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single particle tracking (SPT) and spot variation FCS coupled to stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy. For proper interpretation of such measurements, we provide some background in probe photophysics and diffusion phenomena occurring in cell membranes. In particular, we show the equivalence of the reaction-diffusion approach, as used in FRAP and FCS, and continuous time random walk (CTRW) models, as often invoked in SPT studies. We also discuss mass spectrometry (MS) based imaging of cholesterol in the PM of fixed cells and compare this method with fluorescence imaging of sterols. We conclude that evidence from many experimental techniques converges towards a model of a homogeneous distribution of cholesterol with largely free and unhindered diffusion in both leaflets of the PM.",

They differ from cholesterol by the presence of additional polar groups that are typically hydroxyl, keto, hydroperoxy, epoxy, or carboxyl moieties. Under typical conditions, oxysterol concentration is maintained at a very low and precisely regulated level, with an excess of cholesterol. Like cholesterol, many oxysterols are hydrophobic and hence confined to cell membranes. However, small chemical differences between the sterols can significantly affect how they interact with other membrane components, and this in turn can have a substantial effect on membrane properties. In this spirit, this review describes the biological importance and the roles of oxysterols in the human body.

     "abstract": "Ischemic injury is associated with acute myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting and open heart surgery. The timely re-establishment of blood flow is critical in order to minimize cardiac complications. Reperfusion after a prolonged ischemic period, however, can induce severe cardiomyocyte dysfunction with mitochondria serving as a major target of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. An increase in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces damage to mitochondrial respiratory complexes leading to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial membrane perturbations also contribute to calcium overload, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the release of apoptotic mediators into the cytoplasm. Clinical and experimental studies show that ischemic preconditioning (ICPRE) and postconditioning (ICPOST) attenuate mitochondrial injury and improve cardiac function in the context of I/R injury. This is achieved by the activation of two principal cell survival cascades: 1) the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway; and 2) the Survivor Activating Factor Enhancement (SAFE) pathway. Recent data suggest that high density lipoprotein (HDL) mimics the effects of conditioning protocols and attenuates myocardial I/R injury via activation of the RISK and SAFE signaling cascades. In this review, we discuss the roles of apolipoproteinA-I (apoA-I), the major protein constituent of HDL, and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a lysosphingolipid associated with small, dense HDL particles as mediators of cardiomyocyte survival. Both apoA-I and S1P exert an infarct-sparing effect by preventing ROS-dependent injury and inhibiting the opening of the mPTP.",

In this review, we highlight the role of host membrane cholesterol in regulating the entry of intracellular pathogens using insights obtained from work on the interaction of Leishmania and Mycobacterium with host cells. The entry of these pathogens is known to be dependent on host membrane cholesterol. Importantly, pathogen entry is inhibited either upon depletion (or complexation), or enrichment of membrane cholesterol. In other words, an optimum level of host membrane cholesterol is necessary for efficient infection by pathogens. In this overall context, we propose a general mechanism, based on cholesterol-induced conformational changes, involving cholesterol binding sites in host cell surface receptors that are implicated in this process. A therapeutic strategy targeting modulation of membrane cholesterol would have the advantage of avoiding the commonly encountered problem of drug resistance in tackling infection by intracellular pathogens. Insights into the role of host membrane cholesterol in pathogen entry would be instrumental in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to effectively tackle intracellular pathogenesis.",

We show here that PEtOH induces disorder in membranes of all phases (gel/fluid/liquid-ordered). However, the extent of membrane disorder varies in a phase-specific manner. Maximum membrane disordering was observed in gel phase, followed by liquid-ordered membranes. The disordering was minimal in fluid phase membranes.

In the molecular onset of the diseases, soluble peptides adopt conformations that are rich in \u03b2-sheet and ultimately form aggregates.

Furthermore, the interaction of \u03b2-sheet prone model peptides leaves the lipid structure largely unaffected. However, the lipid phase state decides upon the mode of interaction. Peptides insert into liquid-expanded layers and interact only with the head groups of liquid-condensed lipid layers.Using a zoo of complementary techniques and critically examining preparation procedures we are able to obtain an unambiguous picture of peptide binding to membranes.",

The GABAA receptor is activated by the neurotransmitter GABA and is the action site of widely used neurotoxic pesticides. Many compounds that regulate GABAA receptor function interact with membrane lipids, causing changes in their physical properties and consequently, in the membrane dynamic characteristics that modulate receptor macromolecules. In the present study, the biophysical effects of thujone (a gabaergic reference compound) and dihydrocarvone (structurally very similar) were explored by using monomolecular films of DPPC as a model membrane system, to gain insight into membrane-drug interaction. The compression isotherms showed that both ketones expand the DPPC isotherms and increase membrane elasticity. They penetrate the monolayer but their permanence depends on the possibility of establishing molecular interactions with the film component, favored by defects present in the membrane at the phase transition. Finally, by using Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) as a complementary technique for direct visualization of the study films, we found that incorporating ketone seems to reduce molecular repulsion among phospholipid headgroups. Our results reinforce the notion that changes in membrane mechanics may be occurring in the presence of the assayed ketones, suggesting that their interaction with the receptor\u2019s surrounding membrane may modulate or affect its functionality, possibly as part of the mechanism of the bioactivity described for thujone and DHC.",

In this study, we have investigated the stability profiles of EGCG in aqueous solutions using UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. Stability results showed very low stability profile of EGCG at physiological pH with rapid degradation under alkaline conditions. Therefore, we have encapsulated EGCG in solid lipid nanoparticles to increase its stability and evaluated for anticancer activity. The lipid core of nanoparticles not only provides an additional structural reinforcement to the nanoparticle assembly, but also makes it biologically compatible, thereby enabling a stealth vehicle for efficient drug delivery. EGCG loaded nanoparticles (EGCG-SLN) were characterized using dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. EGCG and EGCG-SLN were evaluated for their anticancer activities by cellular proliferation.

FLU-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) interactions in presence and absence of cholesterol (CHO) were investigated as a function of temperature. The changes in upper part of membrane were more pronounced than those in central part of membrane, as indicated by EPR and FTIR. FLU was proposed to incorporate into phospholipid membranes with its triple ring parallel to head group and its chain toward alkyl chain of phospholipids. According to DSC results, the incorporation of 10 mol% FLU into DPPC caused a shoulder in transition peak, suggesting the occurence of a phase separation, and formation of this new phase is still observable in presence of CHO. It is well known that, structure and dynamics of lipids have significant influence on the function of membrane bound proteins, and consecutively their actions. Based upon these, it was proposed that FLU may modify membrane associated receptors and transport proteins, which would form the basis of its clinical efficiency.",

     "abstract": "Sphingolipid metabolism consists of multiple metabolic pathways that converge upon ceramide, one of the key molecules among sphingolipids (SLs). In mammals, ceramide synthesis occurs via N-acylation of sphingoid backbones, dihydrosphingosine (dhSo) or sphingosine (So). The reaction is catalyzed by ceramide synthases (CerS), a family of enzymes with six different isoforms, with each one showing specificity towards a restricted group of acyl-CoAs, thus producing ceramides (Cer) and dihydroceramides (dhCer) with different fatty acid chain lengths. A large body of evidence documents the role of both So and dhSo as bioactive molecules, as well as the involvement of dhCer and Cer in physiological and pathological processes. In particular, the fatty acid composition of Cer has different effects in cell biology and in the onset and progression of different diseases. Therefore, modulation of CerS activity represents an attractive target in biomedical research and in finding new treatment modalities. In this review, we discuss functional, structural and biochemical features of CerS and examine CerS inhibitors that are currently available.",

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids are a class of bioactive lipids, which are key modulators of an increasing number of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes that include cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, stress and inflammatory responses. Sphingomyelin is an important structural component of biological membranes, and one of the end-points in the synthesis of sphingolipids. Mainly synthetized in the Golgi apparatus, sphingomyelin is transported to all other biological membranes. Upon stimulation, sphingomyelin can be hydrolyzed to ceramide by 5 different sphingomyelinases. The diversity and cellular topology of ceramide allow it to exert multiple biologies. Furthermore, ceramide can be metabolized to many other bioactive sphingolipids. Ceramide, coming from sphingomyelin or other complex sphingolipids, can be hydrolyzed to sphingosine, which can easily change cellular localization. In turn, sphingosine can be recycled to ceramide and to sphingomyelin in the endoplasmic reticulum, completing the sphingomyelin cycle. Our understanding of the roles of various sphingolipids in the regulation of different cellular processes has come from studying the enzymes that regulate these sphingolipids, and their manipulation. The use of pharmacologic inhibitors has been critical for their study, as well as being promising bullets for disease treatment. Some of these diseases involving the sphingomyelin cycle include cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis, diabetes and some rare diseases such as Niemann\u2013Pick disease.

Acid ceramidase inhibition sensitizes certain types of cancer to chemo- and radio-therapy and this is suggestive of a role of acid ceramidase inhibitors as chemo-sensitizers which can act synergistically with chemo-therapeutic drugs.

In the present study, we have synthesized and characterized a homologous series of N-acyl-l-alaninols (n\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0\u2212\u00a020). In DSC studies in the dry as well as hydrated states NAAOHs with different chain lengths showed single sharp transitions similar to N-acyl-l-alanines. Transition enthalpies (\u0394Ht) and entropies (\u0394St) of NAAOHs are linearly dependent on the acyl chain length in both dry and hydrated states. Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that the d-spacings of NAAOHs exhibit linear dependence on the chain length and the incremental increase in the d values suggest that they may be packed in a tilted bilayer pattern.

     "abstract": "Hydrogel films possess the ability of retain water and deliver it to a phospholipid bilayer mainly composed by DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine); moisture of the medium favors the stability of an artificial biomembrane when it is subjected to repetitive heating cycles. This hypothesis is valid when the hydrogel film, used as scaffold, present a flat surface morphology and a high ability for water releasing. On the other hand, when the sample presents a wrinkle topography (periodic undulations), free lateral molecular movement of the bilayer becomes lower, disfavoring the occurrence of clear phases/phase transitions according to applied temperature.Hydrogel films were prepared using HEMA (hydroxyethylmetacrylate), different crosslinking agents and initiators. This reaction mixture was spread over hydrophilic silicon wafers using spin coating technique. Resultant films were then exposed to UV light favoring polymeric chain crosslinking and interactions between hydrogel and substrate; this process is also known to generate tensile stress mismatch between different hydrogel strata, producing out-of-plane net force that generate ordered undulations or collapsed crystals at surface level. DPPC bilayers were then placed over hydrogel using Langmuir\u2013Blodgett technique. Surface morphology was detected in order to clarify the behavior of these films. Obtained data corroborate DPPC membrane stability making possible to detect phases/phase transitions by ellipsometric methods and Atomic Force Microscopy due to their high hydration level. This system is intended to be used as biosensor through the insertion of transmembrane proteins or peptides that detect minimal variations of some analyte in the environment; artificial biomembrane stability and behavior is fundamental for this purpose.",

     "abstract": "Dermabacter hominis is a medically important actinobacterial inhabitant of human skin, although it is rarely implicated in infections. The lipid composition of D. hominis is revisited in this study in the context of its natural resistance to daptomycin, an antibiotic whose activity is influenced by membrane lipids. Thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that this species contains phospholipids and glycolipids. Using electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (exact mass) and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, the major phospholipid of D. hominis was identified as plasmanyl-phosphatidylglycerol (pPG), because it presented one alkyl chain and one acyl chain in the glycerol moiety of the molecule. The structure of the major glycolipid (GL1) was studied by combined gas\u2013liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, and was established as galactosyl-\u03b1-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-glucosyl-alkyl-acyl-glycerol. Lipid analyses showed differences between one daptomycin-resistant (DAP-R) strain and one daptomycin-sensitive (DAP-S) strain growing in the presence of the antibiotic: DAP-R tended to accumulate GL1 and to reduce pPG, whereas DAP-S maintained high proportions of pPG. The results demonstrate the existence of ether-linked lipids in D. hominis and reveal a differential distribution of phospholipids and glycolipids according to the sensitivity or resistance to daptomycin, although the mechanism(s) operating in the resistance to the antibiotic remain(s) to be elucidated.",

     "abstract": "We used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of asymmetric transbilayer distribution of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids on the structure of a protein on the membrane surface and subsequent protein\u2013lipid interactions. Our simulation systems consisted of an amyloidogenic, beta-sheet rich dimeric protein (D42) absorbed to the phosphatidylcholine (PC) leaflet, or protein-contact PC leaflet, of two membrane systems: a single-component PC bilayer and double PC/PS bilayers. The latter comprised of a stable but asymmetric transbilayer distribution of PS in the presence of counterions, with a 1-component PC leaflet coupled to a 1-component PS leaflet in each bilayer. The maximally asymmetric PC/PS bilayer had a non-zero transmembrane potential (TMP) difference and higher lipid order packing, whereas the symmetric PC bilayer had a zero TMP difference and lower lipid order packing under physiologically relevant conditions. Analysis of the adsorbed protein structures revealed weaker protein binding, more folding in the N-terminal domain, more aggregation of the N- and C-terminal domains and larger tilt angle of D42 on the PC leaflet surface of the PC/PS bilayer versus the PC bilayer. Also, analysis of protein-induced membrane structural disruption revealed more localized bilayer thinning in the PC/PS versus PC bilayer. Although the electric field profile in the non-protein-contact PS leaflet of the PC/PS bilayer differed significantly from that in the non-protein-contact PC leaflet of the PC bilayer, no significant difference in the electric field profile in the protein-contact PC leaflet of either bilayer was evident. We speculate that lipid packing has a larger effect on the surface adsorbed protein structure than the electric field for a maximally asymmetric PC/PS bilayer. Our results support the mechanism that the higher lipid packing in a lipid leaflet promotes stronger protein\u2013protein but weaker protein\u2013lipid interactions for a dimeric protein on membrane surfaces.",

As such, a family of cationic lipids are described which undergo a permanent switch in charge upon exposure to 365\u00a0nm ultraviolet (UV) light to enable the capture of negatively charged nucleic acids within the self-assembled supramolecular structure of the lipids and subsequent release of these macromolecules upon exposure to UV light and disruption of the assemblies.

The photolysis of the NPE protected lipid is measured as a function of time, and the resulting changes in net molecular charge are observed using zeta potential analysis for each head group and chain length combination.

However, there is a lack of consensus on the mechanism for such regulation. We have previously shown that the function of an important neuronal receptor, the serotonin1A receptor, is modulated by cholesterol in hippocampal membranes. With an overall objective of addressing the role of membrane physical properties in receptor function, we measured the viscosity of hippocampal membranes of varying cholesterol content using a meso-substituted fluorophore (BODIPY-C12) based on the BODIPY probe. BODIPY-C12 acts as a fluorescent molecular rotor and allows measurement of hippocampal membrane viscosity through its characteristic viscosity-sensitive fluorescence depolarization. A striking feature of our results is that specific agonist binding by the serotonin1A receptor exhibits close correlation with hippocampal membrane viscosity, implying the importance of global membrane properties in receptor function. We envision that our results are important in understanding GPCR regulation by the membrane environment, and is relevant in the context of diseases in which GPCR signaling plays a major role and are characterized by altered membrane fluidity.",

     "abstract": "Oral administration is the most convenient way of all the drug delivery routes. Orally administered bioactive compounds must resist the harsh acidic fluids or enzyme digestion in stomach, to reach their absorbed destination in small intestine. This is the case for silibinin, a drug used to protect liver cells against toxins that has also been demonstrated in vitro to possess anti-cancer effects. However, as many other drugs, silibinin can degrade in the stomach due to the action of the gastric fluid. The use of pH-sensitive self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (pH-SNEDDS) could overcome the drawback due to degradation of the drug in the stomach while enhancing its solubility and dissolution rate.In this paper we have investigated pH-sensitive self-nanoemulsifying formulations containing silibinin as model drug. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams have been constructed in order to identify the self-emulsification regions under different pH. Solubility of silibinin in selected formulations has been assessed and stability of the pure drug and of the silibinin loaded pH-SNEDDS formulations in simulated gastric fluid had been compared. Droplet size of the optimized pH-SNEDDS has been correlated to pH, volume of dilution medium and silibinin loading amount. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) studies have shown that emulsion droplets had spherical shape and narrow size distribution. In vitro drug release studies of the optimal pH-SNEDDS indicated substantial increase of the drug release and release rate in comparison to pure silibinin and to the commercial silibinin tablet. The results indicated that pH-SNEDDS have potential to improve the biopharmaceutics properties of acid-labile lipophilic drugs.",

Consumption of trans unsaturated lipids has been shown to have a negative influence on human health; in particular, the risk of cardiovascular disease is higher when the amount of trans unsaturated lipids in the diet is elevated. In this study, we first performed quantum mechanical calculations to specifically and accurately parameterize cis and trans mono-unsaturated lipids and subsequently validated the newly derived parameter set. Then, we carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayers composed of cis or trans unsaturated lipids with and without cholesterol. Our results show that trans mono-unsaturated chains are more flexible than cis mono-unsaturated chains due to lower barriers for rotation around the single bonds next to the trans double bond than those next to the cis double bond. In effect, interactions between cholesterol and trans unsaturated chains are stronger than cis unsaturated chains, which results in a higher ordering effect of cholesterol in trans unsaturated bilayers.",

     "abstract": "We have carried out a comparative differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) study of the effects of cholesterol (C) and the eight most physiologically relevant oxysterols on the thermotropic phase behavior of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer membranes. The structures of these oxysterols differ from that of C by the presence of additional hydroxyl, keto or epoxy groups on the steroid ring system or by the presence of a hydroxyl group in the alkyl side chain. In general, the progressive incorporation of these oxysterols reduces the temperature, cooperativity and enthalpy of the pretransition of DPPC to a greater extent than C, indicating that their presence thermally destabilizes and disorders the gel states of DPPC bilayers to a greater extent than C. Similarly, the incorporation of these oxysterols either increases the temperature of the broad component of the main phase transition to a smaller extent than C or actually decreases it. Again, this indicates that the presence of these compounds is less effective at thermally stabilizing and ordering the sterol-rich domains of DPPC bilayers than is C itself. Moreover, the incorporation of these oxysterols decrease the cooperativity and enthalpy of the main phase transition of DPPC to a smaller extent than C, indicating that they are somewhat less miscible in fluid DPPC bilayers than is C. Particularly notable in this regard is 25-hydroxycholesterol, which exhibits a markedly reduced miscibility in both gel and fluid DPPC bilayers compared to C itself. In general, the effectiveness of these oxysterols in stabilizing and ordering DPPC bilayers decreases as their rate of interbilayer exchange and the polarity of the oxysterol increases. We close by providing a tentative molecular explanation for the results of our DSC studies and of those of previous biophysical studies of the effects of various oxysterol on lipid bilayer model membranes.",

Charged micelles offer a convenient model system in which structural transitions can be suitably induced by increasing the ionic strength of the medium. In this paper, we have explored sphere-to-rod transition in charged micelles of SDS and CTAB by monitoring micellar dipole potential using the dual wavelength ratiometric approach utilizing the potential-sensitive membrane probe di-8-ANEPPS. Our results show that micellar dipole potential is sensitive to sphere-to-rod transition in charged micelles. Micellar dipole potential exhibited increase with increasing ionic strength (salt), irrespective of the nature of micellar charge, implying considerable dipolar reorganization underlying structural transitions. We interpret the increase in dipole potential due to sphere-to-rod transition because of an increase in the population of confined (nonrandom) dipoles induced by micellar organizational change. This is due to the fact that dipole potential arises due to the nonrandom arrangement of micellar dipoles and water molecules at the micelle interface. Our results constitute one of the first reports describing drastic dipolar reorganization due to micellar shape (and size) change. We envision that dipole potential measurements could provide novel insights into micellar processes that are associated with dipolar reorganization.",

     "abstract": "In a previous study, we proposed characterizing the typically observed kinetic profiles of transition metal ion-induced lipid peroxidation in terms of a limited number of characteristic time-points. These time-points can be derived from experimental time-dependencies and be presented in terms of rate constants and concentrations as calculated based on mechanistic considerations. The critical part of that analysis was that we had to assume that the experimental system behaves as if it is homogeneous, i.e., as if the reaction occurs in a solution. In spite of the uncertainties due to the latter assumption, we obtained a reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the theoretically predicted dependencies, which supports our theoretical treatment. Yet, several previous findings could not have been explained in terms of our (\u2018quasi-homogeneous\u2019) model, indicating that the model is valid not under all conditions. One example is that under certain conditions, rapid peroxidation occurs prior to complete consumption of LDL-associated tocopherol. This can be attributed to compartmentalization of residual tocopherol, namely, after the onset of propagation, part of the LDL particles contain tocopherol, whereas in the other, tocopherol-depleted particles, the PUFA may undergo rapid LOOH-accelerated peroxidation only if they contain at least two hydroperoxides molecules per particle. In the present investigation, we show that the results of all our kinetic studies can be understood if we consider compartmentalization. Specifically, for any given composition of the particles (LDL and/or HDL), the kinetic results may be governed by the distribution and rate of exchange of antioxidants and hydroperoxides between particles. Our analysis is of special importance for systems containing more than one population of lipoprotein particles.",

     "abstract": "In response to increases in ambient temperature (Ta), many animals increase total evaporative water loss (TEWL) through their skin and respiratory passages to maintain a constant body temperature, a response that compromises water balance. In birds, cutaneous water loss (CWL) accounts for approximately 65% of TEWL at thermoneutral temperatures. Although the proportion of TEWL accounted for by CWL decreases to only 25% at high Ta, the magnitude of CWL still increases, suggesting changes in the barrier function of the skin. The stratum corneum (SC) is composed of flat, dead cells called corneocytes embedded in a matrix of lipids, many of which arrange in layers called lamellae. The classes of lipids that comprise these lamellae, and their attendant physical properties, determine the rate of CWL. We measured CWL at 25, 30, 35, and 40\u00a0\u00b0C in House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) caught in the winter and summer, and in sparrows acclimated to warm and cold lab environments. We then used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to measure lipid\u2013lipid and lipid\u2013water interactions in the SC under different conditions of temperature and hydration, and correlated these results with lipid classes in the SC. As CWL increased at higher temperatures, the amount of gauche defects in lipid alkyl chains increased, indicating that lipid disorder is partially responsible for higher CWL at high temperatures. However, variation in CWL between groups could not be explained by the amount of gauche defects, and this remaining variation may be attributed to greater amounts of cerebrosides in birds with low CWL, as the sugar moieties of cerebrosides lie outside lipid lamellae and form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules.",

     "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is accompanied by the release of surface material containing phospholipids (PL), free cholesterol (FC) and apolipoproteins, E (apoE) and Cs (apoCII, apoCIII). The released molecules are accepted by high density lipoprotein (HDL), and new HDL-sized apoE-containing particles are also generated. A decrease in the number of HDL particles or abnormalities in their structure is associated with unfavourable changes in the features of VLDL remnants. Phosphatidylcholine liposomes (PC-L) can also act as acceptors of surface material components released from lipoproteins. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of liposomes on compositional changes of VLDL during its LPL-mediated lipolysis.VLDL isolated from human sera was incubated with LPL (LPL:VLDLTAG; 24\u00a0\u03bcg/ml:90\u00a0mg/dl) and/or PC-L (VLDLPL:PC-LPL; 1:30 weight ratio). After incubation (2\u00a0h, 37\u00a0\u00b0C) VLDL was separated from other reaction products, and VLDL lipid and apolipoprotein content were analysed. Newly generated HDL-sized apoE-containing lipoproteins were separated by two-dimensional non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGGE).The reaction of VLDL with PC-L in the presence or absence of LPL significantly affected the VLDL composition. The ratio of core (TAG\u00a0+\u00a0cholesteryl ester) to surface (PL\u00a0+\u00a0FC) lipids in VLDL decreased 1.8-fold with PC-L, 1.2-fold with LPL and 3-fold with PC-L\u00a0+\u00a0LPL. The reaction with PC-L and PC-L\u00a0+\u00a0LPL caused a 3.7-fold and 3.2-fold decrease of apoCs/apoE average weight ratio, respectively. Compositional changes in VLDL under the influence of PC-L were accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of VLDL lipolysis and the generation of apoE-containing HDL-sized particles, heterogeneous in size (from \u223c9 to \u223c18.8\u00a0nm) and mobility (\u03b3 and pre\u03b2).We conclude that PL-rich particles, similarly to HDL, promote the release of surface material components from VLDL during LPL-mediated lipolysis and positively influence VLDL features which can facilitate VLDL metabolism. Such PC-L activity may impact on its antiatherogenic properties.",

The compounds containing cyclic disulfide group may be used as molecular anchors for phospholipid bilayers. Anchoring occurs through the insertion of the cholesterol moiety into the hydrophobic slab of the phospholipid layer, while the surface density of anchor molecules may be adjusted using disulfides terminated spacers. Five ethylene oxide segments between the disulfide group and the cholesteryl provide hydration of the layer separating solid support and model membrane. Another group of cholesterol derivatives described in this work contains either fluorescence probe or electroactive functional groups. We demonstrated the practical utility of these compounds for visualization of cholesterol extraction from and loading to tBLMs. We demonstrated that electroactive group containing cholesterol derivatives can be reconstituted either into vesicles or tBLMs. In both cases an electrochemical signal can be generated on electrodes from these probes. In general, the newly synthesized compound may be utilized in a variety of applications involving tethered bilayer systems and vesicles.",

Treatment of differentiated U937 macrophage-like cells with 77-6 but not 56-5 enhanced IL-1\u03b2 release; either alone or in the presence of LPS. The stimulatory effect of sphingosine or 77-6 on LPS-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 release was reduced by pretreatment of cells with the caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, thereby indicating a role for the inflammasome. The enhancement of LPS-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 release in response to sphingosine, but not 77-6, was reduced by pretreatment of cells with the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA074Me, indicating a role for lysosomal destabilization in the effect of sphingosine. Administration of 56-5 to mice increased disease progression in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model and this was associated with a considerable increase in the infiltration of CD4+ T-cells, CD11b+ monocytes and F4/80+ macrophages in the spinal cord. 56-5 and 77-6 were without effect on the degradation of myc-tagged sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 receptor in CCL39 cells. Therefore, the effect of 56-5 on EAE disease progression is likely to be independent of the inflammasome or the sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 receptor. However, 56-5 is chemically similar to platelet activating factor and the exacerbation of EAE disease progression might be linked to platelet activating factor receptor signaling.",

     "abstract": "Cholesterol is an abundant and important lipid component of cellular membranes. Analysis of cholesterol transport and diffusion in living cells is hampered by the technical challenge of designing suitable cholesterol probes which can be detected for example by optical microscopy. One strategy is to use intrinsically fluorescent sterols, as dehydroergosterol (DHE), having minimal chemical alteration compared to cholesterol but giving low fluorescence signals in the UV region of the spectrum. Alternatively, one can use dye-tagged cholesterol analogs and in particular BODIPY-cholesterol (BChol), whose synthesis and initial characterization was pioneered by Robert Bittman. Here, we give a general overview of the properties and applications but also limitations of BODIPY-tagged cholesterol probes for analyzing intracellular cholesterol trafficking. We describe our own experiences and collaborative efforts with Bob Bittman for studying diffusion in the plasma membrane (PM) and uptake of BChol in a quantitative manner. For that purpose, we used a variety of fluorescence approaches including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and its imaging variants, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP). We also describe pulse-chase studies from the PM using BChol in direct comparison to DHE. Based on the gathered imaging data, we present a two-step kinetic model for sterol transport between PM and recycling endosomes. In addition, we highlight the suitability of BChol for determining transport of lipoprotein-derived sterol using electron microscopy (EM) and show that this approach ideally complements fluorescence studies.",

In this review, we discuss the introduction of BODIPY-labeled sterol and sphingolipid analogs into mammalian cells via high- or low-density lipoproteins, and the novel findings made by using this strategy. Lipoprotein mediated delivery favors endocytic uptake and initial incorporation of the lipid into membranes of the endosomal compartments. This routing can therefore highlight physiological mechanisms of lipid entry into and exit from the endo-lysosomal membrane system. The underlying principles are of key importance for instance in controlling plasma cholesterol levels and in the development and regression of lysosomal lipid storage diseases.

Some of those studies have used cyclodextrins e.g., to modulate the lipid phase. However, the role of the fluorescence moiety of analogs for the interaction between cyclodextrins and fluorescent lipids has not been investigated so far in detail. Therefore, in the present study the interaction of various fluorescent phospholipid analogs with methylated \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b3- cyclodextrins was investigated. The analogs differed in their structure, in the length of the fatty acyl chain, in the position of the fluorescence group, and in the attached fluorescence moiety (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD) or dipyrrometheneboron difluoride (BODIPY)). In aqueous buffer, cyclodextrins bind fluorescent lipids disturbing the organization of the analogs. When incorporated into lipid vesicles, analogs are selectively extracted from the membrane upon addition of cyclodextrins. The results show that the interaction of cyclodextrins with fluorescent phospholipids depends on the cyclodextrin species, the fluorescence moiety and the phospholipid structure. The presented data should be of interest for studies using fluorescent phospholipids and cyclodextrins, since the interaction between the fluorescence group and the cyclodextrin may interfere with the process(es) under study.",

Alterations in the lipid tails or other portions of CD1d-presented glycolipid ligands can bias the iNKT response towards production of predominantly Th1 or Th2 associated cytokines. However, the mechanism accounting for this structure-activity relationship remains controversial. The Th1-biasing glycolipids have been found to consistently form complexes with CD1d that preferentially localize to plasma membrane cholesterol rich microdomains (lipid rafts), whereas CD1d complexes formed with Th2-biasing ligands are excluded from these microdomains. Here we show that neutralization of endosomal pH enhanced localization of CD1d complexes containing Th2-biasing glycolipids to plasma membrane lipid rafts of antigen presenting cells (APC). Transfer of APCs presenting these \u201cstabilized\u201d CD1d/\u03b1GC complexes into mice resulted in immune responses with a more prominent Th1-like bias, characterized by increased NK cell transactivation and interferon-\u03b3 production.

Understanding the precise mechanisms by which C1P exerts its biological effects has been possible using specific photosensitive caged C1P analogues synthesized by Robert Bittman\u2019s group. These compounds are cell permeable, bypass cell plasma membrane receptors, and can be released into the cytosol upon light irradiation, thereby allowing precise determination of the intracellular mechanisms of actions of C1P.

In one C1P derivative the cage was 7-(N,N-diethylamino)coumarin (DECM-C1P) while in the other it was a 4-bromo-5-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzhydryl moiety (BHNB-C1P). The uncaging process released C1P in the cytosol, and this was accompanied by stimulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and production of low levels of reactive oxygen species. However, intracellular accumulation of C1P did not affect chemotaxis. The caged C1P analogues allowed distinction between the extracellular events evoked by C1P, as for example through interaction with a putative cell-surface receptor, from its intracellular effects.",

We previously demonstrated the potent barrier-enhancing effects of related compounds sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), the pharmaceutical agent FTY720, and its analog (S)-FTY720 phosphonate (Tys) in models of inflammatory lung injury. In this study, we characterize additional novel FTY720 analogs for their potential to reduce vascular leak as well as utilize them as tools to better understand the mechanisms by which this class of agents modulates permeability. Transendothelial resistance (TER) and labeled dextran studies demonstrate that (R)-methoxy-FTY720 ((R)-OMe-FTY), (R)/(S)-fluoro-FTY720 (FTY-F), and \u03b2-glucuronide-FTY720 (FTY-G) compounds display in vitro barrier-enhancing properties comparable or superior to FTY720 and S1P. In contrast, the (S)-methoxy-FTY720 ((S)-OMe-FTY) analog disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity in TER studies in association with actin stress fiber formation and robust intracellular calcium release, but independent of myosin light chain or ERK phosphorylation. Additional mechanistic studies with (R)-OMe-FTY, FTY-F, and FTY-G suggest that lung EC barrier enhancement is mediated through lipid raft signaling, Gi-linked receptor coupling to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation events, and S1PR1-dependent receptor ligation. These results provide important mechanistic insights into modulation of pulmonary vascular barrier function by FTY720-related compounds and highlight common signaling events that may assist the development of novel therapeutic tools in the prevention or reversal of the pulmonary vascular leak that characterizes ARDS.",

     "abstract": "A ceramide commonly found in mammalian cells, C16-ceramide (N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine), is capable of forming large, protein-permeable channels in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). However, C16-ceramide is unable to permeabilize the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. This specificity is unexpected considering that ceramide forms channels in simple phosphoglycerolipid membranes. Synthetic analogs of C16-ceramide with targeted changes at each of the functional regions of the molecule including methylation, altered hydrocarbon chain length, and changes in the stereochemistry, were tested to probe the role of ceramide\u2019s molecular features on its ability to form channels in these two different membrane types. The ability to permeabilize the MOM was relatively insensitive to modifications of the various functional groups of ceramide whereas the same modifications resulted in plasma membrane permeabilization (a gain of function rather than a loss of function). Some analogs (ceramine, NBD-labeled ceramide, C18,1 ceramide) gained another function, the ability to inhibit cytochrome oxidase. The gain of deleterious functions indicates that constraints on the structure of ceramide that is formed by the cell's synthetic machinery includes the avoidance of deleterious interactions. We propose that the specific structure of ceramide limits the size of its interactome (both proteins and lipids) thus reducing the likelihood of unwanted side effects.",

Their activity was first evaluated in M. smegmatis against their parental 2-alkynoic acids, as well as isoniazid, a first-line antituberculosis drug. The introduction of additional unsaturation or heteroatoms into the carbon chain enhanced the antimycobacterial activity of longer chain alkynoic acids (more than 19 carbons long). In contrast, although the modification of the carboxylic group did not improve the antimycobacterial activity, it significantly reduced the toxicity of the compounds against eukaryotic cells. Importantly, 4-(alkylthio)but-2-ynoic acids, had better bactericidal activity than the parental 2-alkynoic acids and on a par with isoniazid against the slow-grower Mycobacterium bovis BCG.

In contrast, chlorambucil, a drug in clinical use for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia reacts with nucleophiles within the major groove of DNA, leading to apoptosis. We hypothesized that hybrid molecules that combine apoptosis-dependent and apoptosis-independent mode of actions in a single molecule may lead to enhanced antitumor activity. Here, we describe the antitumor activities of chlorambucil-linked glucosamine-derived glycerolipid hybrids and investigate the role of the chlorambucil moiety and the effect of cationic charge on the hybrid molecule. Three hybrids and two control GAELs were synthesized and their activities against breast (JIMT1, MDA-MB-231, BT474), pancreas (MiaPaCa2) and prostate (DU145, PC3) cancer cell lines were determined using MTS assay. Hybrid 3 displayed the most potent activity on DU145 at CC50 of 6.0\u00a0\u03bcM while hybrid 4 displayed the best activity on JIMT1 at 7.5\u00a0\u03bcM. Hybrid 5 exhibited no activity at the highest concentration tested (CC50 >20\u00a0\u03bcM), underscoring the significance of the cationic charge at C-2 position as previously reported. Although chlorambucil (2) itself showed very little activity against all the six cell lines (CC50 >150\u00a0\u03bcM), GAELs 6 and 7 which lack the chlorambucil moiety were consistently less active than 3 and 4, suggesting that the chlorambucil moiety contributes to the overall activity. The hybrids were however not as active as the parent GAEL 1 against MiaPaCa2 whereas 6 restored activity comparable to 1.",

     "abstract": "Cardiolipin (CL) is a phospholipid with many unique characteristics. CL is synthesized in the mitochondria and resides almost exclusively within the mitochondrial inner membrane. Unlike most phospholipids that have two fatty acyl chains, CL possesses four fatty acyl chains resulting in unique biophysical characteristics that impact several biological processes including membrane fission and fusion. In addition, several proteins directly bind CL including proteins within the electron transport chain, the ADP/ATP carrier, and proteins that mediate mitophagy. Tafazzin is an enzyme that remodels saturated fatty acyl chains within CL to unsaturated fatty acyl chains, loss of function mutations in the TAZ gene encoding tafazzin are causal for the inherited cardiomyopathy Barth syndrome. Cells from Barth syndrome patients as well as several models of Barth have reduced mitochondrial functions including impaired electron transport chain function and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mitochondria in cells from Barth syndrome patients, as well as several model organism mimics of Barth syndrome, are large and lack cristae consistent with the recently described role of CL participating in the generation of mitochondrial membrane contact sites. Cells with an inactive TAZ gene have also been shown to have a decreased capacity to undergo mitophagy when faced with stresses such as increased ROS or decreased mitochondrial quality control.

Tryptophan residues were introduced at positions 16, 20 or 24, all in helix 1 as it may play a critical role in the initial steps of lipid binding. Steady-state fluorescence analysis showed that each tryptophan displayed unique properties, indicating different environments both in lipid-free as in lipid-bound states, and demonstrating potential for use in lipid binding analysis. While \u03b1-helical contents of wild-type and the tryptophan variant proteins were similar, W20- and W24-apoLp-III displayed increased protein stability. These variants were significantly slower in their ability to convert phosphatidylcholine vesicles into discoidal lipoproteins, which was employed as a measure for lipid binding. In contrast, W16-apoLp-III displayed decreased protein stability but an order of magnitude higher rate of discoidal lipoprotein formation. This demonstrates an inverse correlation between protein stability and the ability to convert vesicles in discoidal lipoproteins. The most stable W20-apoLp-III variant displayed comprised LDL binding capabilities, indicating a partial loss of function.

     "abstract": "In this study, the interaction between soy isoflavone genistein and asolectin liposomes was investigated by monitoring the effects of isoflavone on lipidic hydration, mobility, location and order. These properties were analyzed by the following techniques: horizontal attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (HATR-FTIR), low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-field 31P NMR, zeta potential, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. The antioxidant and antitumoral activities of the genistein liposomal system were also studied. The genistein saturation concentration in ASO liposomes corresponded to 484\u00a0\u03bcM. HATR\u2013FTIR results indicated that genistein influences the dynamics of the lipidic phosphate, choline, carbonyl and acyl chain methylenes groups. At the lipid polar head, HATR\u2013FTIR and 31P NMR results showed that the isoflavone reduces the hydration degree of the phosphate group, as well as its mobility. Genistein ordered the lipid interfacial carbonyl group, as evidenced by the HATR\u2013FTIR bandwidth analysis. This ordering effect was also observed in the lipidic hydrophobic region, by HATR\u2013FTIR, NMR, DSC and turbidity responses. At the saturation concentration, liposome-loaded genistein inhibits the lipid peroxidation induced by hydroxyl radical in 90.9%. ASO liposome-loaded genistein at 100\u00a0\u03bcM decreased C6 glioma cell viability by 57% after 72\u00a0h of treatment. Results showed an increase of the genistein in vitro activities after its incorporation in liposomes. The data described in this work will contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between genistein and a natural-source membrane and of its influence on isoflavone biological activities. Furthermore, the antitumoral results showed that genistein-based liposomes, which contain natural-sourced lipids, may be promising as a drug delivery system to be used in the glioma therapy.",

     "abstract": "The anthropogenic mobilization of mercury and cadmium into the biosphere has led to an increased and ineludible entry of these metals into biological systems. Here we discuss the impact of Hg(II) and Cd(II) on lipid model systems and human erythrocytes from a biophysical perspective. After a brief introduction to their implications on human health, studies that have investigated the effects of Hg(II) and Cd(II) on lipid model systems and human erythrocytes are discussed. In terms of lipids as toxicological target sites, predominantly variations in lipid head groups have been the source of investigation. However, as research in this field progresses, the effects of Hg(II) and Cd(II) on other structural features, such as acyl chain length and unsaturation, and other important lipid components and complex biomimetic lipid mixtures, will require further examinations.This review provides an analysis of what has been learned collectively from the diverse methodologies and experimental conditions used thus far. Consequently, there is a need for more comprehensive and thorough investigations into the effects of Hg(II) and Cd(II) on lipid membranes under consistent experimental conditions such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, and choice of lipid model system.",

Physicochemical characterization of this lipoprotein is still controversial, which therefore makes it difficult to take a mechanistic approach to its atherogenicity. We thus conducted investigation of time-dependent changes in chemical compositions and alternation of physical properties of LDL in detail during its oxidation induced by human embryonic endothelial cells and copper ions. The oxidation caused hydrolysis of glycerolipids being demonstrated as decrease of triglyceride and choline-phospholipid and increase of lysophosphatidylcholine. Fragmentation of apoB was also induced while over-all protein components stayed with the particles. The density of the particles continuously shifted to higher fractions for all the particles to reach d\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.044 after 10\u00a0h incubation. The average diameter of LDL, however, decreased from 28.1\u00a0nm to 25.6\u00a0nm by 5\u00a0h and increased to 27.1\u00a0nm towards 20\u00a0h incubation with the increase of discoid particles. These dynamic changes can be interpreted by losing fatty acyl group from the core lipid components perhaps due to oxidative degradation and by increase of surface lysophosphatidylcholine to cause remodeling of the particles.",

The existence of this type of signaling platforms was traditionally associated with eukaryotic membranes because prokaryotic cells were considered too simple organisms to require a sophisticated organization of their signaling networks. However, the research that have been performed during last years have shown that bacteria organize many signaling transduction processes in Functional Membrane Microdomains (FMMs), which are similar to the lipid rafts that are found in eukaryotic cells. The current knowledge of the existence of FMMs in bacteria is described in this review and the specific structural and biological properties of these membrane microdomains are introduced. The organization of FMMs in bacterial membranes reveals an unexpected level of sophistication in signaling transduction and membrane organization that is unprecedented in bacteria, suggesting that bacteria as more complex organisms than previously considered.",

In this paper, an introduction to lipid diversity in biology and a mini-review on how molecular simulations have been used to model biological membranes (primarily limited to one to three lipid types in most simulation-based models) is provided, which motivates the use of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the effect of lipid diversity on properties of realistic membrane models of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As an example, cytoplasmic membrane models of Escherichia coli were developed at different stages of the colony growth cycle (early-log, mid-log, stationary and overnight). The main difference between lipid compositions at each stage was the concentration of a cyclopropane-containing moiety on the sn-2 lipid acyl chain (cyC17:0). Triplicate MD simulations for each stage were run for 300\u00a0ns to study the influence of lipid diversity on the surface area per lipid, area compressibility modulus, deuterium order parameters, and electron density profiles. The overnight stage (also known as the death stage) had the highest average surface area per lipid, highest rigidity, and lowest bilayer thickness compare to other stages of E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. Although bilayer thickness did depend on the growth stage, the changes between these were small suggesting that the hydrophobic core of transmembrane proteins fit well with the membrane in all growth stages. Although it is still common practise in MD simulations of membrane proteins to use simple one- or two-component membranes, it can be important to use diverse lipid model membranes when membrane protein structure and function are influenced by changes in lipid membrane composition.",

These domains preferentially recruit membrane proteins and lipids to facilitate their interactions and thereby regulate transmembrane signaling and cellular homeostasis. The functionality of raft domains is intrinsically dependent on their selectivity for specific membrane components; however, while the physicochemical determinants of raft association for lipids are known, very few systematic studies have focused on the structural aspects that guide raft partitioning of proteins. In this review, we describe biophysical and thermodynamic aspects of raft-mimetic liquid ordered phases, focusing on those most relevant for protein partitioning. Further, we detail the variety of experimental models used to study protein-raft interactions. Finally, we review the existing literature on mechanisms for raft targeting, including lipid post-translational modifications, lipid binding, and transmembrane domain features. We conclude that while protein palmitoylation is a clear raft-targeting signal, few other general structural determinants for raft partitioning have been revealed, suggesting that many discoveries lie ahead in this burgeoning field.",

These organizing principles are important for protein localization and function as well as cellular signaling. However, the mechanisms and biophysical basis of lipid raft formation, structure, dynamics and function are not clearly understood. One key question, which we focus on in this review, is how lateral organization and leaflet compositional asymmetry are coupled. Detailed information elucidating this question has been sparse because of the small size and transient nature of rafts and the experimental challenges in constructing asymmetric bilayers. Resolving this mystery will require advances in both experimentation and modeling. We discuss here the preparation of model systems along with experimental and computational approaches that have been applied in efforts to address this key question in membrane biology.

Despite the hydrophobicity of this segment and the fact that the lipid substrate is also hydrophobic, removal of this hydrophobic segment by truncating the protein at the amino terminus has no effect on its enzymatic activity.The amino acid sequence of the catalytic segment of DGK\u03f5 is highly homologous to that of a bacterial DGK, DgkB. This has allowed us to predict a conformation of DGK\u03f5 based on the known crystal structure of DgkB.An important property of DGK\u03f5 is that it is specific for diacylglycerol species containing an arachidonoyl group. The region of DGK\u03f5 that interacts with this group is found within the accessory domain of the protein and not in the active site nor in the hydrophobic amino terminus.

In this study, we characterize additional novel FTY720 analogs for their potential to reduce vascular leak as well as utilize them as tools to better understand the mechanisms by which this class of agents modulates permeability.

In contrast, the (S)-methoxy-FTY720 ((S)-OMe-FTY) analog disrupts lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity in TER studies in association with actin stress fiber formation and robust intracellular calcium release, but independent of myosin light chain or ERK phosphorylation. Additional mechanistic studies with (R)-OMe-FTY, FTY-F, and FTY-G suggest that lung EC barrier enhancement is mediated through lipid raft signaling, Gi-linked receptor coupling to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation events, and S1PR1-dependent receptor ligation. These results provide important mechanistic insights into modulation of pulmonary vascular barrier function by FTY720-related compounds and highlight common signaling events that may assist the development of novel therapeutic tools in the prevention or reversal of the pulmonary vascular leak that characterizes ARDS.",

     "abstract": "New amphiphilic pyridine derivatives containing dodecyloxycarbonyl substituents at positions 3 and 5 and cationic moieties at positions 2 and 6 have been designed and synthesised. Compounds of this type can be considered as synthetic lipids. The corresponding 1,4-dihydropyridine (1,4-DHP) derivatives have earlier been proposed as a promising tool for plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery in vitro. In this work studies of the self-assembling properties of amphiphilic pyridine derivatives leading to the formation of liposomes, determination of particle size, zeta-potential and critical micelle concentration (CMC) with dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements are described. Furthermore, thermal analysis of pyridine derivatives was performed using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) as well as the ability to deliver the pEGFP-C1 plasmid DNA (that encodes GFP reporter) into the Baby hamster kidney-derived (BHK-21) cell line was used for evaluation of gene delivery properties. We have revealed that the new pyridine derivatives possessed self-assembling properties which were proved by formation of nanoparticles with the average size from 115 to 743\u00a0nm, the zeta-potentials in the range of 48\u201379\u00a0mV and CMC values in the range of 2\u201367\u00a0\u03bcM. DTA data showed that all processes were endothermic for all compounds. Additionally, we established that among the tested pyridines the representatives with N-methylpyrrolidinium or pyridinium moieties as cationic head-group at the positions 2 and 6 possessed higher pEGFP-C1 transfection activity into the BHK-21 cell line. Nevertheless, the obtained results indicated that correlation of the physicochemical, structural properties and gene delivery activities of the tested compounds were not completely elucidated yet. On the other hand, the synthesised pyridines as possible metabolites of promising delivery systems on the 1,4-DHP core possessed lower pDNA transfection activity than the corresponding 1,4-DHP amphiphiles.",

     "abstract": "The membrane pacemaker hypotheses of metabolism and aging are distinct, but interrelated hypotheses positing that increases in unsaturation of lipids within membranes are correlated with increasing basal metabolic rate and decreasing longevity, respectively. The two hypotheses each have evidence that either supports or contradicts them, but consensus has failed to emerge. In this review, we identify sources of weakness of previous studies supporting and contradicting these hypotheses and suggest different methods and lines of inquiry. The link between fatty acyl composition of membranes and membrane-bound protein activity is a central tenet of the membrane pacemaker hypothesis of metabolism, but the mechanism by which unsaturation would change protein activity is not well defined and, whereas fatty acid desaturases have been put forward by some as the mechanism behind evolutionary differences in fatty acyl composition of phospholipids among organisms, there have been no studies to differentiate whether desaturases have been more affected by natural selection on aging and metabolic rate than have elongases or acyltransferases. Past analyses have been hampered by potentially incorrect estimates of the peroxidizability of lipids and longevity of study animals, and by the confounding effect of phylogeny. According to some authors, body mass may also be a confounding effect that should be taken into account, though this is not universally accepted. Further research on this subject should focus more on mechanisms and take weaknesses of past studies into account.",

Stimulation of iNKT cells by glycolipid antigens can induce strong immune responses in vivo, with rapid production of a wide variety of cytokines including those classically associated with either T helper type 1 (Th1) or type 2 (Th2) responses. Alterations in the lipid tails or other portions of CD1d-presented glycolipid ligands can bias the iNKT response towards production of predominantly Th1 or Th2 associated cytokines. However, the mechanism accounting for this structure\u2013activity relationship remains controversial. The Th1-biasing glycolipids have been found to consistently form complexes with CD1d that preferentially localize to plasma membrane cholesterol rich microdomains (lipid rafts), whereas CD1d complexes formed with Th2-biasing ligands are excluded from these microdomains. Here we show that neutralization of endosomal pH enhanced localization of CD1d complexes containing Th2-biasing glycolipids to plasma membrane lipid rafts of antigen presenting cells (APC). Transfer of APCs presenting these \u201cstabilized\u201d CD1d/\u03b1GC complexes into mice resulted in immune responses with a more prominent Th1-like bias, characterized by increased NK cell transactivation and interferon-\u03b3 production.

In this work, we show that the process of micelle formation from monomers for a representative variety of detergents is associated with dipolar rearrangement. We monitor the dipolar reorganization upon micellization as a change in dipole potential, measured by the dual wavelength ratiometric approach utilizing the potential-sensitive membrane probe di-8-ANEPPS. We further utilized this phenomenon to estimate the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of a variety of detergents. CMC determined by this method are in overall agreement with the literature values of CMC for these detergents. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first report showing dipolar reorientation during micellization.

The purpose of the present investigation was to explore changes in lipid components occurring in human carcinoma HeLa cells when exposed to short-term treatments (2 and 4\u00a0h) with monoolein-based cubosomes stabilized by Pluronic F108 (MO/PF108). A combination of TLC and reversed-phase HPLC with DAD and ELSD detection was performed to analyze cell total fatty acid profile and levels of phospholipids, free cholesterol, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters. The treatments with MO/PF108 cubosomes, at non-cytotoxic concentration (83\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of MO), affected HeLa fatty acid profile, and a significant increase in the level of oleic acid 18:1 n-9 was observed in treated cells after lipid component saponification. Nanoparticle uptake modulated HeLa cell lipid composition, inducing a remarkable incorporation of oleic acid in the phospholipid and triacylglycerol fractions, whereas no changes were observed in the cellular levels of free cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate. Moreover, cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and lipid droplet content were assessed on cubosome-treated cells with an alternative technique using Nile red staining. A significant increase in the amount of the intracellular membranes and mostly in the cytoplasmic lipid droplets was detected, confirming that monoolein-based cubosome treatment influences the synthesis of intracellular membranes and accumulation of lipid droplets.",

Although neurodegenerative disorders are associated with increased oxidative stress and lipid oxidation, the connection between oxidative stress and glycosphingolipid modification has been scarcely addressed.In this study, we aimed to characterize the structural changes caused by the hydroxyl radical to GalCer and LacCer molecular species using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2013MS and MS/MS) and high performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MSn). ESI\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS spectra of 24:1GalCer and 24:1LacCer after free radical oxidation showed the formation of new species, which were identified as keto, hydroxyl and hydroperoxy derivatives, arising from modification in the mono unsaturated fatty acyl chain. Formation of ceramide and oxidized ceramides was also observed as a result of 24:1GalCer and 24:1LacCer radical oxidation. 24:1GlcCer (glucosylceramide) was detected after LacCer oxidation, probably due to oxidative cleavage of lactosyl moiety. This study shows that glycosphingolipids are prone to radical induced oxidation, which can be one of the causes of the increased ceramides content and pro apoptotic events during oxidative conditions and neurodegeneration. This MS study will support the future identification of oxidized galactosyl- and lactosylceramide species in sphingolipidomic studies applied to biological samples related with oxidative conditions.",

At OA:Mb ratio\u00a0<\u00a04:1, OA perturbs selectively the 8-heme methyl signal, consistent with a local and specific fatty acid-protein interaction. As OA:Mb ratio increases from 4:1 to 40:1, all hyperfine shifted MbCN signals decrease, consistent with a non-selective, global perturbation of the protein. The pH titration analysis indicates that the observed OA methylene signal in the presence of Mb reflects a non-specific interaction and does not originate from a shift in the lamella\u2013micelle equilibrium.

Our DSC results indicate that the incorporation of all three sterols produces comparable decreases in the temperature of the pretransition of DPPC, but CHOL decreases its cooperativity and enthalpy more strongly than 7DHC and especially DES. These findings indicate that all three sterols decrease the thermal stability of gel phase DPPC bilayers but that 7DHC and especially DES are less miscible in them. However, the incorporation of CHOL and DES produce comparable increases in the temperature of the broad component of the main phase transition of DPPC while 7DHC decreases it, but again CHOL produces greater decreases in its cooperativity and enthalpy then 7DHC and especially DES. These results indicate that CHOL and DES stabilize the sterol-rich domains of fluid DPPC bilayers, but that 7DHC and especially DES are less miscible in them. Our FTIR spectroscopic results indicate that CHOL increases the rotational conformational order of fluid DPPC bilayers to a somewhat and markedly greater degree than DES and 7DHC, respectively, consistent with our DSC findings. Our spectroscopic results also indicate that although all three sterols produce comparable degrees of H-bonding (hydration) of the DPPC ester carbonyl groups in fluid bilayers, CHOL is again found to be fully soluble in gel state DPPC bilayers at low temperatures, whereas 7DHC and especially DES are not. In general, we find that 7DHC and DES incorporation produce considerably different effects on DPPC bilayer membranes. In particular, the presence of an additional double bond at C7 or C24 produces a marked reduction in the ability of 7DHC to order fluid DPPC bilayers and in the miscibility of DES in such bilayers, respectively. These different effects may be the biophysical basis for the reduction of these double bonds in the last steps of CHOL biosynthesis, and for the deleterious biological effects of the accumulation of these sterols in vivo.",

HVA states that cells maintain membrane order (frequently discussed in terms of membrane fluidity or viscosity) within tight conditions in response to environmental induced changes in membrane lipid composition. In this article we use data driven modelling to investigate membrane order, using methodology we previously developed to investigate another theory of phospholipid homeostasis, the intrinsic curvature hypothesis. A set of coarse-grain parameters emerge from our model which can be used to deconstruct the relative contribution of each component membrane phospholipid to net membrane order. Our results suggest, for the membranes in the mammalian cells we have studied, that a ratio control function can be used to model membrane order. Using asynchronous cell lines we quantify the relative contribution of around 130 lipid species to net membrane order, finding that around 16 of these phospholipid species have the greatest effect in vivo. Then using lipidomic data obtained from partially synchronised cultures of HeLa cells we are able to demonstrate that these same 16 lipid species drive the changes in membrane order observed around the cell cycle. Our findings in this study suggest, when compared with our previous work, that cells maintain both membrane order and membrane intrinsic curvature within tight conditions.",

This phase separation process indicates that lipid molecules, such as sphingolipid and cholesterol, are intermixed. When saturated phospholipid is used instead of sphingolipid, small Lo domains are formed. Cholesterol is harder to incorporate with domains of saturated phospholipid than that of sphingolipid. This technique is very useful for observation of lipid\u2013lipid interactions.",

     "abstract": "The lysophosphatidylcholine analogue edelfosine is a potent antitumor and antiparasitic drug that targets cell membranes. Previous studies have shown that edelfosine alters membrane domain organization inducing internalization of sterols and endocytosis of plasma membrane transporters. These early events affect signaling pathways that result in cell death. It has been shown that edelfosine preferentially partitions into more rigid lipid domains in mammalian as well as in yeast cells. In this work we aimed at investigating the effect of edelfosine on membrane domain organization using monolayers prepared from whole cell lipid extracts of cells treated with edelfosine compared to control conditions. In Langmuir monolayers we were able to detect important differences to the lipid packing of the membrane monofilm. Domain formation visualized by means of Brewster angle microscopy also showed major morphological changes between edelfosine treated versus control samples. Importantly, edelfosine resistant cells defective in drug uptake did not display the same differences. In addition, co-spread samples of control lipid extracts with edelfosine added post extraction did not fully mimic the results obtained with lipid extracts from treated cells. Altogether these results indicate that edelfosine induces changes in membrane domain organization and that these changes depend on drug uptake. Our work also validates the use of monolayers derived from complex cell lipid extracts combined with Brewster angle microscopy, as a sensitive approach to distinguish between conditions associated with susceptibility or resistance to lysophosphatidylcholine analogues.",

A14101 has been studied to investigate how qualitative and semi-quantitative information on fatty acids correlates with the ability of this strain to access and utilize a wide range of water-immiscible HC-substrates by modifying the FA content and thus also the properties of the cellular membrane. After incubation on different substrates and media, the profiles of fatty acids (FA) were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). The equivalent chain length (ECL) index calibration system was employed to identify FA. The effect of each substrate on the cell surface charge and on the hydrophobicity of the cellular membrane was also investigated. The results indicate that the variation of the content of saturated fatty acids (SAT-FA) versus mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) was found to be the most pronounced while branched FA exhibited much less variation in spite of different substrate regimes. The regulation of the ratio of SAT-FA and MUFA seems to be coupled with the regulation of the charge and hydrophobicity of the outer cellular surface. The exposure to a water immiscible substrate led to the development of the negative cellular surface charge, production of carotenoid-type pigments and increased hydrophobicity of the cellular surface. The specific aspects of the adaptation mechanism could have implications for bioremediation and/or (M)EOR applications",

     "abstract": "The genus Pseudomonas is one of the most heterogeneous groups of eubacteria, presents in all major natural environments and in wide range of associations with plants and animals. The wide distribution of these bacteria is due to the use of specific mechanisms to adapt to environmental modifications. Generally, bacterial adaptation is only considered under the aspect of genes and protein expression, but lipids also play a pivotal role in bacterial functioning and homeostasis. This review resumes the mechanisms and regulations of pseudomonal glycerophospholipid synthesis, and the roles of glycerophospholipids in bacterial metabolism and homeostasis. Recently discovered specific pathways of P. aeruginosa lipid synthesis indicate the lineage dependent mechanisms of fatty acids homeostasis. Pseudomonas glycerophospholipids ensure structure functions and play important roles in bacterial adaptation to environmental modifications. The lipidome of Pseudomonas contains a typical eukaryotic glycerophospholipid \u2013 phosphatidylcholine \u2013, which is involved in bacteria\u2013host interactions. The ability of Pseudomonas to exploit eukaryotic lipids shows specific and original strategies developed by these microorganisms to succeed in their infectious process. All compiled data provide the demonstration of the importance of studying the Pseudomonas lipidome to inhibit the infectious potential of these highly versatile germs.",

     "abstract": "Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) are a unique form of dietary fat that have a wide range of health benefits. They are molecules with a glycerol backbone esterified with medium chain (6\u201312 carbon atoms) fatty acids on the two outer (sn-1 and sn-3) and the middle (sn-2) positions. During lipid digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic lipase stereoselectively hydrolyses the ester bonds of these triglycerides on the sn-1 and sn-3 positions resulting in sn-2 monoglyceride and fatty acids as major products. However, the sn-2 monoglycerides are thermodynamically less stable than their sn-1/3 counterparts. Isomerization or fatty acid migration from the sn-2 monoglyceride to sn-1/3 monoglyceride may occur spontaneously and would lead to glycerol and fatty acid as final products. Here, tricaprin (C10) with selectively deuterated fatty acid chains was used for the first time to monitor chain migration and the stereoselectivity of the pancreatic lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of ester bonds. The intermediate and final digestion products were studied using NMR and mass spectrometry under biologically relevant conditions. The hydrolysis of the sn-2 monocaprin to glycerol and capric acid did not occur within biologically relevant timescales and fatty acid migration occurs only in limited amounts as a result of the presence of undigested diglyceride species over long periods of time in the digestion medium. The slow kinetics for the exchange of the sn-2 fatty acid chain and the stereoselectivity of pancreatic lipase on MCTs is relevant for industrial processes that involve enzymatic interesterification and the production of high-value products such as specific structured triacylglycerols, confectionery fats and nutritional products.",

Wrinkled hydrogels films were used to maintain a moist environment in order to enhance DPPC bilayer stability. Polymer mixtures were prepared using HEMA (as a base monomer) and DEGDMA, PEGDA575, PEGDA700 or AAm (as crosslinking agents); a thermal initiator was added to obtain a final pre-hydrogel (oligomer) with an adequate viscosity for thin film formation. This mixture was deposited as wrinkled film/fibers over hydrophilic silicon wafers using an electrospinning technique. Later, these samples were exposed to UV light to trigger photopolymerization, generating crosslinking bonds between hydrogel chains; this process also generated remnant surface stresses in the films that favored wrinkle formation. In the cases where DEGDMA and AAm were used as crosslinking agents, HEMA was added in higher amounts. The resultant polymer film surface showed homogenous layering with some small isolated clusters. If PEGDA575/700 was used as the crosslinking agent, we observed the formation of polymer wrinkled thin films, composed by main and secondary chains (with different dimensions). Moreover, water absorption and release was found to be mediated through surface morphology, ordering and film thickness.The thermal behavior of biomembranes was examined using ellipsometry techniques under controlled heating cycles, allowing phases and phase transitions to be detected through slight thickness variations with respect to temperature. Atomic force microscopy was used to determinate surface roughness changes according to temperature variation, temperature was varied sufficiently for the detection and recording of DPPC phase limits. Contact angle measurements corroborated and quantified system wettability, supporting the theory that wrinkled hydrogel films act to enhance DPPC bilayer stability during thermal cycles.",

Both phytohormones stimulate the activity of both plant sPLA2 using DLPC/Triton mixed micelles as substrate.To elucidate the mechanism of action of the phytohormones, we showed that both auxins are able to self-penetrate lipid monolayers and cause an increment in surface pressure and an expansion of lipid/phytohormone mixed interfaces.

     "abstract": "Knowledge of the plasma lipid composition is essential to clarify the specific roles of different lipid species in various pathophysiological processes. In this study, we developed an analytical strategy combining high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) and off-line coupling with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) to determine the composition of plasma and major lipoproteins at two levels, lipid classes and lipid species. We confirmed the suitability of MALDI-TOF/MS as a quantitative measurement tool studying the linearity and repeatability for triglycerides (TG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Moreover, data obtained with this method were correlated with other lipid classes and species measurements using currently available technologies. To establish the potential utility of our approach, human plasma very low density- (VLDL), low density- (LDL) and high density- (HDL) lipoproteins from 10 healthy donors were separated using ultracentrifugation, and compositions of nine lipid classes, cholesteryl esters (CE), TG, free cholesterol (FC), PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI), sulfatides (S), PC, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM), analyzed. In total, 157 lipid species in plasma, 182 in LDL, 171 in HDL, and 148 in VLDL were quantified. The lipidomic profile was consistent with known differences in lipid classes, but also revealed unexpected differences in lipid species distribution of lipoproteins, particularly for LPC and SM.

The molecular mechanism involved in the internalization of mycobacteria is poorly understood. In this work, we have explored the role of host membrane cholesterol in the entry of the avirulent surrogate mycobacterial strain Mycobacterium smegmatis into THP-1 macrophages. Our results show that depletion of host membrane cholesterol using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin results in a significant reduction in the entry of M. smegmatis into host cells. More importantly, we show that the inhibition in the ability of M. smegmatis to enter host macrophages could be reversed upon replenishment of membrane cholesterol. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first report showing that membrane cholesterol replenishment can reverse the inhibition in the entry of mycobacteria into host cells. In addition, we demonstrate that cholesterol complexation using amphotericin B (without physical depletion) is sufficient to inhibit mycobacterial entry. Importantly, we observed a significant reduction in mycobacterial entry upon enrichment of host membrane cholesterol. Taken together, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that an optimum host plasma membrane cholesterol is necessary for the entry of mycobacteria.

These oxPL are components of oxidized low density lipoprotein. They are cytotoxic in cells of the arterial wall thus playing an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. The toxic lipid effects include inflammation and under sustained exposure apoptosis. The aim of this study was to find out whether such toxic effects, especially apoptosis, are also elicited by oxPL in melanocytic cells in order to assess their potential for therapeutic intervention.FACS analysis after staining with fluorescent markers was performed to identify the mode of lipid-induced cell death. Activation of sphingomyelinase which generates apoptotic ceramide was measured using an established fluorescence assay. Ceramide profiles were determined by mass spectrometry.We found that 50\u00a0\u03bcM POVPC induce cell death in human melanoma cells isolated from different stages of tumor progression but affect primary human melanocytes to a much lesser extent. In contrast, 50\u00a0\u03bcM PGPC was only apoptotic in two out of four cell lines used in this study. The toxicity of both compounds was associated with efficient lipid uptake into the tumor cells and activation of acid sphingomyelinase. In several but not all melanoma cell lines used in this study, activation of the sphingomyelin degrading enzyme correlated with an increase in the concentration of the apoptotic mediator ceramide. The individual patterns of the newly formed ceramide species were also cell line-specific.PGPC and POVPC may be considered potential drug candidates for topical skin cancer treatment.

     "abstract": "We present the results of a comparative differential calorimetric and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study of the effect of cholesterol and five analogues on the thermotropic phase behaviour and organization of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer membranes. These sterols/steroids differ in both the nature and stereochemistry of the polar head group at C3 (\u03b2-OH, \u03b1-OH or CO) and in the presence or absence of a double bond in ring B and in the orientation of rings A and B. The \u03945 sterols/steroid have a trans rather than a cis ring A/B junction, and the concentration of these compounds required to abolish the DPPC pretransition, inversely related to their relative ability to disorder gel state DPPC bilayers, decreases in the order \u03b2-OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1-OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO. However, in the saturated ring junction-inverted (cis) series, these concentrations are much more similar, regardless of polar head group chemical structure. Similarly, the residual enthalpy of the DPPC main phase transition at 50\u00a0mol% sterol/steroid, which is inversely related to the miscibility of these compounds in fluid DPPC bilayers, also increases in the order \u03b2-OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1-OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO, but this effect is attenuated in the saturated series with an inverted ring A/B orientation. Moreover, replacement of the double bond at C5\u2013C6 with a saturated linkage and inversion of the ring A/B junction reduces both sterol/steroid solubility and the ability to order the hydrocarbon chains of fluid DPPC molecules all cases. Thus, the characteristic effects of sterols/steroids on fluid lipid bilayers are generally optimal when an OH group rather than CO group is present at C3, and when this OH group is in the equatorial (\u03b2) orientation, and when the orientation of the ring A/B fusion is trans rather than cis. Overall, these results demonstrate that variations in the saturation and stereochemistry of the steroid ring system influence the effect of variations in the nature and stereochemistry of the polar headgroup at C3 on the physical properties of phospholipid bilayers and vice versa. Moreover, the presence of a single double bond specifically at \u03945 is required to maximize sterol solubility in fluid DPPC bilayers.",

     "abstract": "Click-based reactions were conducted at the surface of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) to provide onto-vesicle chemistry with efficient innovative ready-for-use tools. For that purpose, four amphiphilic molecules were designed to insert into bilayers while presenting a reactive functional head. In this manner, a dioleylglycero-ethoxy-ethoxy-ethoxy-ethanamine (DOG-PEG4-NH2) was chosen as a common platform while the reactive amine head was converted into several electrophilic functions. Thus, two dioleylglycerol-based cyclooctyne anchors were prepared: cyclooct-1-yn-3-glycolic acid-based anchor (DOG-COA) and 1-fluorocyclooct-2-ynecarboxylic acid-based anchor (DOG-FCOA). The last one differed from the first one in that a fluorine atom reinforces the electrophilic properties of the unsaturated bond. In addition, a third dioleylglycerol-based triphenylphosphine (DOG-PPh3) was synthesized for the first time. These three innovative amphiphilic anchors were designed to react with any azide-based biomolecule following copper-free Huisgen 1,4-cycloaddition and Staudinger ligation, respectively. A fourth anchor bearing a 3,4-dibromomaleimide ring (DOG-DBM) was also unprecedentedly synthesized, to be further substituted by two thiols. Model reactions conducted in solution with either model biotinyl azide or model biotinyl disulfide gave good to total conversions and excellent isolated yields. The four new anchors were inserted into SUVs whose formula is classically used in in vivo biology. Stability and surface overall electrostatic charge were in the expected range and constant over the study. Then, the functionalized liposomes were ligated to biotin-based reagents and the experimental conditions were finely tuned to optimize the conversion. The biotinyl liposomes were demonstrated functional and totally accessible in an affinity test based on biotin scaffold quantification. Finally, DOG-FCOA\u2019s reactivity was confronted to that of DOG-DBM in a \u2018one-pot\u2019 orthogonal reaction. (Biotin-S)2 and TAMRA-N3 (tetramethylcarboxyrhodamine azide) were successively conjugated to the liposome suspension in a successful manner. These data implement and reinforce the interest of bioorthogonal click-like reactions onto lipid nanoparticles.",

     "abstract": "Desmosterol is a direct biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol in Bloch biochemical pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and differs with cholesterol only by a double bond in carbon 24. In this study, we aimed to research for the first time comparative effects of cholesterol and its precursor desmosterol on dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) by utilizing Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Our DSC studies reveal that with the addition of increasing desmosterol and cholesterol concentrations into pure DPPC MLVs, the pretransition disappears, the main phase transition shifts to lower temperatures and then disappears. While the main phase transition is abolished at 25\u00a0mol% concentration of desmosterol, this disappearance of the main phase transition occurs at cholesterol concentration above 30\u00a0mol%. Our FTIR studies show that both desmosterol and cholesterol decrease the order in the gel phase, whereas they increase it in the liquid crystalline phase. Importantly, we found that the effect of desmosterol on membrane order is weaker than that of cholesterol in both phases. Moreover, desmosterol and cholesterol increase the dynamics of DPPC membranes in the gel phase, while they decrease it in the liquid crystalline phase. Both sterols also induce a decrease in the wavenumber values of the CO stretching and PO2\u2212 antisymmetric double stretching bands of DPPC both in the gel and liquid crystalline phases, which points out hydrogen bonding in between the hydroxyl group of both sterols and the carbonyl and phosphate groups of DPPC membranes.",

On the other hand, small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) prepared by sonication are almost osmotically insensitive. LUVs water transport, both in hypo- and hyper-osmotic conditions, takes place faster than calcein ejection towards the external solvent. Similarly, response to a hypotonic imbalance is faster than that associated to a hypertonic stress. This difference is particularly noticeable for the increase in calcein fluorescence intensity and can be related to the large reorganization of the bilayer needed to form pores and/or to adsorb the dye to the inner leaflet of the vesicle after water efflux. Conversely, addition of SM to the vesicles barely modify the rate of calcein permeation across the bilayer.",

Change in the temperatures of main transition of the lipid/alkane mixtures against the length of added alkanes depends largely on the headgroup. Theoretical analysis of the change of the temperature of transition indicates that the headgroup dependence is dominantly originated in the strong dependence of total enthalpy on the headgroups. The results of X-ray diffraction show that the enthalpic stabilization due to enhanced packing of acyl chains of the lipid by alkanes in the gel phase causes the headgroup-dependent change in the phase transition behavior. The enhanced packing in the gel phase also leads to easy emergence of the subgel phase with very short relaxation time at room temperature in the DMPE-based bilayers.",

SPM/PC ratio was higher in the ABCA1-mediated HDL than ABCA7-mediated HDL likely being related to their cholesterol content, while it was less than the ratio in the cell membrane in either case. Molecular species composition of hydrocarbon chain moiety in each phospholipid in the HDL largely reflected that in the cells the lipoprotein originated in, without remarkable difference between ABCA1 and ABCA7. Further analysis, however, revealed apparent preference for the molecules with shorter hydrocarbon chain length for both PC and SPM in their relative incorporation into HDL by ABCA1 and ABCA7. Likewise, it was in favor for less-unsaturated hydrocarbon chains of PC while this preference was not apparent for SPM.

In addition, at least 9 other very structurally different fatty acids have been shown to be \u03946- or even \u03948-desaturated by the FADS2 protein. A better characterization of the substrate specificity of this enzyme is therefore needed. By using commercial cis9-18:1 and chemically synthesized cis12- and cis15-18:1 (sharing the n-6 double bond with 18:2 n-6 and the n-3 double bond with 18:3 n-3, respectively), we tried to decrypt the fatty acid structure driving the FADS2 substrate affinity. We first showed that both recombinant and native rat FADS2 were able to \u03946-desaturate not only the cis9- but also the cis12- and cis15-18:1 isomers. Next, the inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of each 18:1 isomer was investigated in vitro on the \u03946-desaturation of \u03b1-linolenic acid. At equimolar inhibitor/substrate ratio (60\u00a0\u03bcM), the cis9-18:1 exhibited a significantly higher inhibition (25%) than the cis12- (8%) and cis15-18:1 (5%). This study shows that a single cis double bond in 12- or 15-position in 18:1 is enough to make them low \u03946-desaturable substrates. If a preexisting cis9-double bond is not absolutely required for the \u03946-desaturation of octadecenoic acids, its presence is however crucial to explain the higher enzyme affinity. Compared with oleic acid, the additional presence of a cis12-double bond in linoleic acid increased its inhibitory effect on the \u03946-desaturation of \u03b1-linolenic acid at low concentration (30\u00a0\u03bcM) but not at higher concentrations (60 and 120\u00a0\u03bcM). In this classification of the decreasing impact of the double bond when it comes closer to the methyl end of octadecenoic acids, the cis11-18:1 (cis-vaccenic acid) should be considered apart since it is itself not \u03946-desaturated but still a good competitive inhibitor of the \u03b1-linolenic acid \u03946-desaturation.",

However, the lipid bilayer models are often simple and the acquired results with these models may not provide all pertinent information related to a real cell membrane. In this work, we use sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to study molecular-level interactions between the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) MSI-594, ovispirin-1 G18, magainin 2 and a simple 1,2-dipalmitoyl-d62-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (dDPPG)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) bilayer. We compared such interactions to those between the AMPs and a more complex dDPPG/Escherichia coli (E. coli) polar lipid extract bilayer. We show that to fully understand more complex aspects of peptide\u2013bilayer interaction, such as interaction kinetics, a heterogeneous lipid composition is required, such as the E. coli polar lipid extract. The discrepancy in peptide\u2013bilayer interaction is likely due in part to the difference in bilayer charge between the two systems since highly negative charged lipids can promote more favorable electrostatic interactions between the peptide and lipid bilayer. Results presented in this paper indicate that more complex model bilayers are needed to accurately analyze peptide\u2013cell membrane interactions and demonstrates the importance of using an appropriate lipid composition to study AMP interaction properties.",

Specifically, CL and CL linoleic (18:2\u03c96) content are known to be positively associated with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. However, this association has not been examined in skeletal muscle. In this study, rats were fed high-fat diets with a naturally occurring gradient in linoleic acid (coconut oil [CO], 5.8%; flaxseed oil [FO], 13.2%; safflower oil [SO], 75.1%) in an attempt to alter both mitochondrial CL fatty acyl composition and COX activity in rat mixed hind-limb muscle. In general, mitochondrial membrane lipid composition was fairly resistant to dietary treatments as only modest changes in fatty acyl composition were detected in CL and other major mitochondrial phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). As a result of this resistance, CL 18:2\u03c96 content was not different between the dietary groups. Consistent with the lack of changes in CL 18:2\u03c96 content, mitochondrial COX activity was also not different between the dietary groups. However, correlational analysis using data obtained from rats across the dietary groups showed a significant relationship (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.21). Specifically, our results suggest that CL 18:2\u03c96 content may positively influence mitochondrial COX activity thereby making this lipid molecule a potential factor related to mitochondrial health and function in skeletal muscle.",

     "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can reduce the efficiency and increase the energy consumption of Na+/K+-ATPase pump and mitochondrial electron transport chain by promoting Na+ and H+ membrane permeability, respectively. In skeletal muscle, the sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps are major contributors to resting metabolic rate. Whether DHA can affect SERCA efficiency remains unknown. Here, we examined the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with DHA would reduce Ca2+ transport efficiency of the SERCA pumps in skeletal muscle. Total lipids were extracted from enriched sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes that were isolated from red vastus lateralis skeletal muscles of rats that were either fed a standard chow diet supplemented with soybean oil or supplemented with DHA for 8 weeks. The fatty acid composition of total SR membrane lipids and the major phospholipid species were determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). After 8 weeks of DHA supplementation, total SR DHA content was significantly elevated (control, 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0% vs. DHA, 9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7%; weight percent of total fatty acids) while total arachidonic acid was reduced (control, 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4% vs. DHA-fed, 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2). Similar changes in these fatty acids were observed in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol, altogether indicating successful incorporation of DHA into the SR membranes post-diet. As hypothesized, DHA supplementation reduced SERCA Ca2+ transport efficiency (control, 0.018\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0002 vs. DHA-fed, 0.014\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0009) possibly through enhanced SR Ca2+ permeability (ionophore ratio: control, 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 vs. DHA-fed, 2.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3).

SLNs were evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. Shape and surface morphology of the SLNs confirmed spherical shape of nanoparticles when investigated under a transmission electron microscope. Complete encapsulation of drug in the nanoparticles was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The drug release study confirmed prolonged release from the SLNs following Higuchi release kinetics with R2 value of 0.995 where as pure drug suspension exhibited faster drug release following zero order release kinetics with R2 value of 0.992. Stability study confirmed that SLNs were stable for 3 months at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, in vitro skin distribution studies showed presence of significant amount of FA on the epidermal layer of skin when treated with FA loaded SLNs suspension while plain FA suspension showed minimum amount of FA in the epidermis and dermis. Moreover, selective accumulation of FA in the epidermis might eliminate adverse side effects associated with systemic exposure.

     "abstract": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to quantify the ion mixture effect of seawater (SW), particularly the contribution of Mg2+ and Ca2+ as dominant divalent cations, on the thermotropic phase behaviour of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-posphocholine (DMPC) bilayers. The changed character of the main transition at 24\u00a0\u00b0C from sharp to gradual in films and the 1\u00a0\u00b0C shift of the main transition temperature in dispersions reflect the interactions of lipid headgroups with the ions in SW. Force spectroscopy was used to quantify the nanomechanical hardness of a DMPC supported lipid bilayer (SLB). Considering the electrostatic and ion binding equilibrium contributions while systematically probing the SLB in various salt solutions, we showed that ionic strength had a decisive influence on its nanomechanics. The mechanical hardness of DMPC SLBs in the liquid crystalline phase linearly increases with the increasing fraction of all ion-bound lipids in a series of monovalent salt solutions. It also linearly increases in the gel phase but almost three times faster (the corresponding slopes are 4.9\u00a0nN/100\u00a0mM and 13.32\u00a0nN/100\u00a0mM, respectively). We also showed that in the presence of divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) the bilayer mechanical hardness was unproportionally increased, and that was accompanied with the decrease of Na+ ion and increase of Cl\u2212 ion bound lipids. The underlying process is a cooperative and competitive ion binding in both the gel and the liquid crystalline phase. Bilayer hardness thus turned out to be very sensitive to ionic strength as well as to ionic composition of the surrounding medium. In particular, the indicated correlation helped us to emphasize the colligative properties of SW as a naturally occurring complex ion mixture.",

In the present report, we extend our earlier study of the rate of Schiff base formation in dimyristoyl PE/atheronal A binary mixtures to the more biologically relevant case in which varying amounts of cholesterol are also present. Using optical spectroscopy to monitor reaction kinetics, we demonstrate that the presence of cholesterol reduces the accessibility of the aldehyde moiety of the atheronal A to the free headgroup amine. We also find that the presence of atheronal A promotes the early onset of cholesterol crystallization in the ternary mixtures, perhaps with the Schiff base serving as a site for heterogeneous nucleation.",

     "abstract": "A detailed molecular description of the mechanism of action of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine (AQ) is still an open issue. To gain further insights on that, we studied the interactions of AQ with lipid model membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPS) by spin labeling electron spin resonance (ESR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Both techniques indicate a coexistence of an ordered DPPS-rich domain with a disordered DPPC-rich domain in the binary DPPC/DPPS system. We found that AQ slightly lowered the melting transition temperatures associated to both domains and significantly increased the enthalpy change of the whole DPPC/DPPS phase transition. DSC and ESR data also suggest that AQ increases the number of DPPC molecules in the DPPC-rich domains. AQ also causes opposing ordering effects on different regions of the bilayer: while the drug increases the ordering of the lipid acyl chains from carbon 7 to 16, it decreases the order parameter of the lipid head group and of carbon 5. The gel phase was mostly affected by the presence of AQ, suggesting that AQ is able to influence more organized lipid domains. Moreover, the effects of AQ and cholesterol on lipid acyl chain ordering and mobility were compared at physiological temperature and, in a general way, they are similar. Our results suggest that the quinoline ring of AQ is located completely inside the lipid bilayers with its phenol ring and the tertiary amine directed towards the head group region. The nonspecific interaction between AQ and DPPC/DPPS bilayers is a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.",

Another possible cause is using an incomplete theory to interpret the data. Adding a tilt term to the theory clearly does not affect the value obtained from the shape analysis method. It is shown that a tilt term, using a value of the modulus K\u03b8 indicated by simulations, theory, and estimated from order parameters obtained from NMR and from the wide angle X-ray method, should also not affect the value obtained using the micromechanical manipulation method, although it does require a small correction when determining the value of the area compressibility modulus KA.

     "abstract": "A fluid lipid membrane transmits stresses and torques that are fully determined by its geometry. They can be described by a stress- and torque-tensor, respectively, which yield the force or torque per length through any curve drawn on the membrane's surface. In the absence of external forces or torques the surface divergence of these tensors vanishes, revealing them as conserved quantities of the underlying Euler\u2013Lagrange equation for the membrane's shape. This review provides a comprehensive introduction into these concepts without assuming the reader's familiarity with differential geometry, which instead will be developed as needed, relying on little more than vector calculus. The Helfrich Hamiltonian is then introduced and discussed in some depth. By expressing the quest for the energy-minimizing shape as a functional variation problem subject to geometric constraints, as proposed by Guven (2004), stress- and torque-tensors naturally emerge, and their connection to the shape equation becomes evident. How to reason with both tensors is then illustrated with a number of simple examples, after which this review concludes with four more sophisticated applications: boundary conditions for adhering membranes, corrections to the classical micropipette aspiration equation, membrane buckling, and membrane mediated interactions.",

     "abstract": "Biological membranes are complex structures whose mechanics are usually described at a mesoscopic level, such as the Helfrich bending theory. In this article, we present the phase-field methods, a useful tool for studying complex membrane problems which can be applied to very different phenomena. We start with an overview of the general theory of elasticity, paying special attention to its derivation from a molecular scale. We then study the particular case of membrane elasticity, explicitly obtaining the Helfrich bending energy. Within the framework of this theory, we derive a phase-field model for biological membranes and explore its physical basis and interpretation in terms of membrane elasticity. We finally explain three examples of applications of these methods to membrane related problems. First, the case of vesicle pearling and tubulation, when lipidic vesicles are exposed to the presence of hydrophobic polymers that anchor to the membrane, inducing a shape instability. Finally, we study the behavior of red blood cells while flowing in narrow microchannels, focusing on the importance of membrane elasticity to the cell flow capabilities.",

     "abstract": "The presence of coupled modes of membrane motion in closed shells is extensively predicted by theory. The bilayer structure inherent to lipid vesicles is suitable to support hybrid modes of curvature motion coupling membrane bending with the local reorganization of the bilayer material through relaxation of the dilatational stresses. Previous experiments evidenced the existence of such hybrid modes facilitating membrane bending at high curvatures in lipid vesicles [Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda, R., Arriaga, L.R., Mell, M., Moleiro, L.H., L\u00f3pez-Montero, I., Monroy, F., 2009. Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 128201.]. For lipid bilayers that are able to undergo intermonolayer sliding, the experimental fluctuation spectra are found compatible with a bimodal schema. The usual tension/bending fluctuations couple with the hybrid modes in a mechanical interplay, which becomes progressively efficient with increasing vesicle radius, to saturate at infinity radius into the behavior expected for a flat membrane. Grounded on the theory of closed shells, we propose an approximated expression of the bimodal spectrum, which predicts the observed dependencies on the vesicle radius. The dynamical features obtained from the autocorrelation functions of the vesicle fluctuations are found in quantitative agreement with the proposed theory.",

     "abstract": "The role of lipid composition as a regulator or mediator of processes that take place in biological membranes is a very topical question, and important insights can be gained by studying in vitro model lipid mixture systems. A particular question is the coupling of local curvature to the local phases in membranes of mixed composition. Working with an experimental system of giant unilamellar vesicles of ternary composition, the curvature is imposed by approaching the membrane to a topographically (on the micron scale) patterned surface. Performing experiments, we show that domains of the more disordered phase localise preferentially to regions of higher curvature. We characterise and discuss the strength of this \u201ccaging\u201d behaviour. In future, the setup we discuss here could prove useful as a platform to localise domains rich in membrane proteins, or to promote the onset of biochemical processes at specific locations. Finally, we note that the methods developed here could have also applications in bio-sensing, as a similar but metal coated topography can sustain plasmonic resonances.",

Our simulations consist of several thousand phospholipids modeled with the coarse grained MARTINI forcefield covering timescales of tens of microseconds. We employ Voronoi and Delaunay constructions to quantify local compositions in an attempt to identify coexistence regions with the liquid ordered (Lo) phase. We combine this analysis with the chain order parameter and in plane pair correlation functions and propose a phase coexistence diagram for the DPPC/CHOL mixture. We find stable liquid ordered phases Lo for high cholesterol content (40\u201350%). At these concentrations the cholesterol molecules arrange themselves in linear clusters. Our simulations provide evidence for coexistence between the Lo and gel phases at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the transition from the liquid disordered phase to the Lo phase is continuous and coexistence is not observed. The lipid molecules dynamics depends strongly on temperature and cholesterol concentration. At 323\u00a0K and short times, t\u00a0\u223c\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcs the lipid molecules\u2019 feature an anomalous sub-diffusive behavior with the mean square displacement (MSD) scaling as \u223ct1/2. The characteristic time needed to reach the diffusive regime MSD \u223ct, increases with the cholesterol content, reaching 0.2\u00a0\u03bcs for 40% cholesterol content.

     "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanism of the interaction of amphipathic and antimicrobial peptides with membranes is of fundamental interest, especially because of the potential of amphipathic peptides as therapeutics. The most studied amphipathic peptides in this context are certainly melittin, magainin and alamethicin, of which melittin is the only one to exhibit a powerful hemolytic and therefore toxic action. Herein we study the effect of the antimicrobial but hemolytic peptide melittin on the bending elasticity of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). The results are compared to the effects of non-hemolytic amphipathic peptides such as alamethicin. We found that monomeric melittin acts very differently on the membrane mechanical properties. Strikingly, the difference is the most pronounced for low peptide concentrations, relevant for the hemolytic action. This gives some insight into the subtle nature of this peptide\u2013membrane interaction. Furthermore, the results show that bending elasticity measurements might be a sensitive way to distinguish between lytic and non-lytic antimicrobial peptides.",

Due to the time- and length-scale on which these processes occur, computational methods have proven to be an especially useful tool in their study. With their help, a number of interesting findings about the shape of fusion intermediates could be obtained, and novel hypotheses about the mechanism of topological changes and the involvement of peptides therein were suggested. In this work, we try to present a summary of these developments together with some hitherto unpublished results, featuring, among others, the shape of stalks and fusion pores, possible modes of action of the influenza HA fusion peptide and the SNARE protein complex, the mechanism of supported lipid bilayer formation by vesicle spreading, and the free energy and transition pathway of the fusion process.",

Peripheral membrane proteins generally control membrane remodeling during fission. Local membrane stresses, reflecting molecular geometry of membrane-interacting parts of these proteins, sum up to produce the key membrane geometries of fission: the saddle-shaped neck and hour-glass hemifission intermediate. Here, we review the fundamental principles behind the translation of molecular geometry into membrane shape and topology during fission. We emphasize the central role the membrane insertion of specialized protein domains plays in orchestrating fission in vitro and in cells. We further compare individual to synergistic action of the membrane insertion during fission mediated by individual protein species, proteins complexes or membrane domains. Finally, we describe how local geometry of fission intermediates defines the functional design of the protein complexes catalyzing fission of cellular membranes.",

The model, in contrast to previous ones that consider proteins only as passive elements affecting the lipid distribution, describes the system including three terms: the dynamic interactions between protein monomers, the interactions between lipid components, and a mixed term considering protein\u2013lipid interactions. It is used to explain experimental results performed on a well-defined system in which a self-aggregating soluble bacterial cytoskeletal protein polymerizes on a lipid bilayer containing two lipid components. All the elements considered in a previously described protein model, including torsion of the monomers within the filament, are needed to account for the observed filament shapes. The model also points out that lipid segregation can affect the length and curvature of the filaments and that the dynamic behavior of the lipids and proteins can have different time scales, giving rise to memory effects. This simple model that considers a dynamic protein assembly on a fluid and active lipid surface can be easily extended to other biologically relevant situations in which the interplay between protein and lipid aggregation is needed to fully describe the system.",

The goal of the present review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the structure, lipid\u2013protein interactions and mechanical features of surfactant membranes and films and how these properties correlate with surfactant biological function inside the lungs. Surfactant mechanical properties can be severely compromised by different agents, which lead to surfactant inhibition and ultimately contributes to the development of pulmonary disorders and pathologies in newborns, children and adults. A detailed comprehension of the unique mechanical and rheological properties of surfactant layers is crucial for the diagnostics and treatment of lung diseases, either by analyzing the contribution of surfactant impairment to the pathophysiology or by improving the formulations in surfactant replacement therapies.

     "abstract": "The interactions between cholesterol and other membrane molecules determine important membrane properties. It was shown that even small changes in the molecular structure of cholesterol have a crucial influence on these interactions. We recently reported that in addition to alterations in the tetracyclic ring structure, the iso-branched side chain of cholesterol also has a significant impact on membrane properties (Scheidt et al., 2013). Here we used synthetic cholesterol analogs to investigate the influence of an unbranched aliphatic side chain of different length. The 2H NMR order parameter of the phospholipid chains and therefore the molecular packing of the phospholipid molecules shows a significant dependence on the sterol\u2019s alkyl side chain length, while, membrane permeation studied by a dithionite ion permeation assay and lateral diffusion measured by 1H MAS pulsed field gradient NMR are less influenced. To achieve the same molecular packing effect similar to that of an iso-branched aliphatic side chain, a longer unbranched side chain (n-dodecyl instead of n-octyl) at C17 of cholesterol is required. Obviously, sterols having a branched iso-alkyl chain with two terminal methyl groups exhibit altered cholesterol\u2013phospholipid interactions compared to analogous molecules with a straight unbranched chain.",

In agreement with previously published experimental data, we found the lowest membrane affinity for the charged molecules and a moderate affinity for zwitterionic and polar molecules. The affinity can be ranked as follows: ACH\u2013GLU\u00a0<<\u00a0GABA\u00a0<\u00a0GLY\u00a0<<\u00a0GABAneu\u00a0<<\u00a0GOL. The latter three penetrated the bilayer at most with the deepest location being close to the glycerol backbone of the phospholipids. Even at that position, these solutes were noticeably hydrated and carried \u223c30\u201380% of the bulk water along. The mobility of hydration water at the solute is also affected by the penetration into the bilayer. Two time scales of exchanging water molecules could be determined. In the bulk phase, the hydration layer contains \u223c20% slow exchanging water molecules which increases 2\u20133 times as the solutes entered the bilayer. Our results indicate that there is no intermediate exchange of slow moving water molecules from the solutes to the lipid atoms and vice versa. Instead, the exchange relies on the reservoir of unbounded (\u201cfree\u201d) water molecules in the interfacial bilayer region. Results from the equilibrium simulations are in good agreement with the results from umbrella sampling simulations, which were conducted for the four naturally occurring NTs. Free energy profiles for ACH and GLU show a minimum of \u223c2\u20133\u00a0kJ/mol close to the bilayer interface, while for GABA and GLY, a minimum of respectively \u223c2\u00a0kJ/mol and \u223c5\u00a0kJ/mol is observed when these NTs are located in the vicinity of the lipid glycerol backbone. The most important interaction of NTs with the bilayer is the charged amino group of NTs with the lipid phosphate group.",

They are highly lipophilic and thus present in some seed oils used for human consumption as well as being increasingly common in aquaculture diets due to inclusion of vegetable oils. Cytotoxic effects of PAHs have been thought to be partly due to a membrane perturbing effect of these compounds. A series of studies were here performed to examine the effects of three different PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene) with different molecular sizes (two, three and five rings, respectively) and fat solubility (Kow 3.29, 4.53 and 6.04, respectively) on membrane models. The effects of PAHs on liquid\u2013liquid phase coexistence in solid-supported lipid bilayers (dioleoylphosphocholine:dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine:cholesterol) were assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Benzo[a]pyrene had a slight affinity for the liquid-ordered phase, but there were no effects of adding any of the other PAHs on the number or size of the liquid domains (liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered). Benzo[a]pyrene and phenanthrene, but not naphthalene, lowered the transition temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy (\u0394H) characterising the transition from the solid to the liquid-crystalline phase in DPPC vesicles. The membrane effects of the PAH molecules are likely related to size, with bigger and more fat-soluble molecules having a fluidising effect when embedded in the membrane, possibly causing some of the observed toxic effects in fish exposed to these contaminants.",

Cholesterol, an essential lipid in higher eukaryotic membranes, has previously been shown to increase membrane dipole potential. In this work, we explored the effect of stereoisomers of cholesterol, ent-cholesterol and epi-cholesterol, on membrane dipole potential, monitored by the dual wavelength ratiometric approach utilizing the probe di-8-ANEPPS. Our results show that cholesterol and ent-cholesterol share comparable ability in increasing membrane dipole potential. In contrast, epi-cholesterol displays a slight reduction in membrane dipole potential. Our results constitute the first report on the effect of stereoisomers of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential, and imply that an extremely subtle change in sterol structure can significantly alter the dipolar field at the membrane interface. These results assume relevance in the context of differential abilities of these stereoisomers of cholesterol in supporting the activity of the serotonin1A receptor, a representative G protein-coupled receptor. The close correlation between membrane dipole potential and receptor activity provides new insight in receptor-cholesterol interaction in terms of stereospecificity.

Using the Fenton reaction and physiological saline, chlorinated oxidation products such as chlorohydrins are also readily available. Additionally, it will be shown that preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a convenient but simple method to isolate the individual oxidation products in reasonable yields and high purities: all relevant products could be successfully identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and the amounts of the oxidized products determined by a simple colorimetric assay.",

We aimed to compare (i) the basal oxidative status of LDL in arterial and venous blood and (ii) the susceptibility of arterial and venous LDL to oxidation. The basal oxidative status of LDL was determined by measuring lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) concentrations, plasma levels of auto-antibodies against oxidized LDL, and by measuring oxidation-specific epitopes on LDL particles. The oxidizability of arterial vs. venous LDL (catalyzed by copper) was estimated by monitoring the time-course of conjugated dienes formation. Interestingly, we found the same basal oxidative status of LDL in arterial and venous plasma. LPO concentrations and levels of auto-antibodies against oxidized LDL were similar in arterial and venous plasma and amounts of oxidation-specific epitopes were similar on the respective LDL particles. Moreover, we found similar susceptibilities of arterial and venous LDL to (copper-mediated) oxidation. Lag-times until the onset of conjugated diene formation were slightly shorter in arterial compared to venous LDL in the presence of 5\u00a0\u03bcM, but not in the presence of 1\u00a0\u03bcM CuCl2. Additionally, we found significantly higher levels of the atherogenic lipoprotein(a) in arterial plasma.

The present study initiates a comparable study of bioliposomes and erythrocyte ghosts. This required the 13C NMR characterization of these systems for the first time, and further involved a determination of the signals of three doubly 13C-labeled intercalants, in particular, n-ketophosphatidylcholines where n\u00a0=\u00a04, 8 and 12. This study reveals that DMPC liposomes, bioliposomes and erythrocyte ghosts, with all their structural differences, are not radically different from the perspective of polarity gradient. Any differences observed reflect the additives often naturally present in these lipid systems.",

     "abstract": "The secondary process of lipid peroxidation produces some toxic aldehydes. Since this process takes place via free radical reaction in lipophilic circumstances, \u03b1-tocopherol would suppress the formation of such aldehydes by trapping free-radical intermediates. This study reports the effect of \u03b1-tocopherol on the hemin-catalyzed decomposition of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-sn-phosphatidylcholine 13-hydroperoxide (PLPC-OOH) in micelles and liposomes. PLPC-OOH and \u03b1-tocopherol were reacted with hemin in micelles, and the reaction products were characterized to be 1-palmitoyl-2-(\u03b1-tocopheroxy-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoyl)-3-sn-phosphatidylcholines (T-epoxyPLPC) and known compounds, 1-palmitoyl-2-[(8a-dioxy-\u03b1-tocopherone)-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoyl]-3-sn-phosphatidylcholines (TOO-epoxyPLPC) and \u03b1-tocopherol dimer. The hemin-catalyzed decomposition of PLPC-OOH in micelles produced hexanal as one of secondary aldehydic products. \u03b1-Tocopherol suppressed the formation of hexanal, and \u03b1-tocopherylquinone, \u03b1-tocopherol dimer, TOO-epoxyPLPC, and T-epoxyPLPC were detected during the reaction. In liposomes, \u03b1-tocopherol could partially suppress the formation of hexanal, and the main products were TOO-epoxyPLPC and \u03b1-tocopherol dimer. The results indicate that \u03b1-tocopherol may suppress the formation of hexanal by trapping the epoxyperoxyl and epoxyalkyl radicals derived from PLPC-OOH.",

     "abstract": "Most cells carry a negative electric charge. It produces a potential difference across the membrane, which regulates voltage-sensitive ion transport and ATP synthesis in mitochondria. The negative charge comes partly from an excess of negative ions in the cell interior (Donnan potential) and partly from ionized groups on the membrane (surface potential). In this work we propose some important modifications to the existing theory of membrane potential. First, we calculate the concentration profile of intracellular positive ions and derive a simple equation to assess the submembrane depletion of positive ions that gives rise to the Donnan potential. The extent of depletion varies with potential, which may provide a regulatory mechanism for ion pumps and channels. Next we consider the surface component of the potential and note that the standard Gouy\u2013Chapman theory has been developed for planar membranes, whereas real cell membranes have a closed geometry. In this case, charges on the membrane surface are not expected to generate fields extending into the cell interior. This fact calls for reinterpretation of some theoretical points as well as experimental data. In particular, the experimentally demonstrated electrostatic attraction between cationic proteins and the negative membrane must now be explained without invoking intracellular fields, and we suggest a new mechanism that can account for this interaction.",

     "abstract": "The development of \u201cmolecular rulers\u201d would allow one to quantitatively locate the penetration depth of intercalants within lipid bilayers. To this end, an attempt was made to correlate the 13C NMR chemical shift of polarizable \u201creporter\u201d carbons (e.g., carbonyls) of intercalants within DMPC liposomal bilayers \u2013 with the polarity it experiences, and with its Angstrom distance from the interface. This requires families of molecules with two \u201creporter carbons\u201d separated by a known distance, residing at various depths/polarities within the bilayer. For this purpose, two homologous series of dicarbonyl compounds, methyl n-oxooctadecanoates and the corresponding n-oxooctadecanoic acids (n\u00a0=\u00a04\u201316), were synthesized. To assist in assignment and detection several homologs in each system were prepared 13C-enriched in both carbonyls. Within each family, the number of carbons and functional groups remains the same, with the only difference being the location of the second ketone carbonyl along the fatty acid chain. Surprisingly, the head groups within each family are not anchored near the lipid\u2013water interface, nor are they even all located at the same depth. Nevertheless, using an iterative best fit analysis of the data points enables one to obtain an exponential curve. The latter gives substantial insight into the correlation between polarity (measured in terms of the Reichardt polarity parameter, ET(30)) and penetration depth into the liposomal bilayer. Still missing from this curve are data points in the moderate polarity range.",

An iterative best fit analysis of the data points revealed an exponential correlation between ET(30) micropolarity and the penetration depth (in \u00c5) into the liposomal bilayer. However, this study is still incomplete, since the plot lacks data points in the important area of moderately polarity, i.e., in the ET(30) range of 51\u201345.5\u00a0kcal/mol. To correct this lacuna, a family of ketophospholipids was prepared in which the above n-oxooctadecanoic acids were attached to the sn-2 position of a phosphatidylcholine with a palmitic acid chain at sn-1. To assist in assignment and detection several derivatives were prepared 13C-enriched in both carbonyls. The various homologs were intercalated into DMPC liposomes and give points specifically in the missing area of the previous polarity\u2013penetration correlation graph. Interestingly, the calculated exponential relationship of the complete graph was essentially the same as that calculated in the companion paper based on the methyl n-oxooctadecanoates and the corresponding n-oxooctadecanoic acids alone. The polarity at the midplane of such DMPC systems is ca. 33\u00a0kcal/mol and is not expected to change very much if we extend the lipid chains. This paper concludes with a chemical ruler that maps the changing polarity experienced by an intercalant as it penetrates the liposomal bilayer.",

Unlike Nile Red, NR12S enjoys unique orientation and location in the membrane, and is localized exclusively in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer. By analysis of membrane depth using the parallax approach, we show that the fluorescent group in NR12S is localized at the membrane interface, a region characterized by slow solvent relaxation. Our results show that NR12S exhibits REES (red edge excitation shift), consistent with its interfacial localization. More interestingly, REES of NR12S displays sensitivity to the membrane phase. In addition, fluorescence emission maximum, anisotropy, and lifetime of NR12S are dependent on the membrane phase. We envision that NR12S may prove to be a useful probe in future studies of complex natural membranes.",

The stretched bilayers were simulated by constant NPZA||T MD simulations with various constant areas. The effects of the cholesterol concentration on pore formation are examined in terms of the critical areal strain where the pore is formed, the processes of pore formation, and the change in molecular orientation of the DPPC molecules by analyzing the order parameters and radial distribution functions of the DPPC molecules. With increasing cholesterol concentration, the critical areal strain initially increases, peaks at 40\u00a0mol%, and then decreases, which agrees well with the available experimental data. For the bilayers containing cholesterol, DPPC molecules become disordered at low areal strains, whereas the order slightly increases when the areal strain exceeds a certain value depending on the cholesterol concentration. For 40\u00a0mol% cholesterol, the two monolayers in the bilayer interpenetrate under high areal strains, inducing an increase of the order parameters and the peak positions of the radial distribution function compared with their states at low areal strains, indicating the formation of an interdigitated gel-phase-like structure. The transient increasing of the order of the molecular orientations may inhibit water penetration into the bilayer, resulting in increased critical areal strain in the phospholipid/cholesterol bilayers.",

In order to understand the role of different liposome components, especially perifosine, in transendothelial transport the physical characteristics of liposome membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol, as a main lipid constituents, and variable amount of helper lipids: dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and alkylphospholipid perifosine.For this purpose, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) with computer aided EPR spectra simulation and fluorescence polarization spectroscopy were used to investigate how different membrane components influence membrane characteristics and the release of liposome entrapped substances. Beside methylester of palmitic acid with nitroxide group at different position on acyl chain usually used for such studies, the spin labeled and fluorescent labeled analog of perifosine were introduced.OPP increases membrane fluidity of liposomes as well as the release of liposome encapsulated content. The release of neutral molecules increases with OPP concentration, while the release of charged molecules is about an order of magnitude slower. Optimal OPP concentration, for release of charged molecules, is about 15\u00a0mol%.These results are one step further toward the conclusion that the lysolipid-containing liposomes could be promising trans endothelial delivery system, since lysolipids, such as OPP, open tight cellular barriers, as was published before, and in the same time induce the release of liposome encapsulated content at physiological temperature, as shown here. Since many drug delivery systems are being developed, which mainly exploit the transcellular route of delivery through barrier-forming cells, we hope that the uniqueness of lysolipid-containing liposomes, exploiting the paracellular route, and thus avoiding efflux transporters, will foster further research in formulating other lysolipid-containing liposomes as drug delivery systems.",

This allowed calculation of apparent surface Gibbs energy (further in the paper termed as \u2018surface free energy\u2019) of the monolayers according to the theoretical approach developed by Chibowski (contact angle hysteresis model, CAH). Then, based on the surface free energy values, the molar interaction Gibbs energy of the lipid molecules with the given probe liquid was evaluated. These values correlate with the values of excess area, interpreted as an indicator of the condensing effect of cholesterol on phospholipid monolayers at the air\u2013water interface. The results indicate that the thermodynamic parameters of interactions depend on the monolayer composition and the probe liquid used to their determination. Changes of the parameters are discussed in relation to the monolayer packing, ordering, tilting of the molecules, and properties of the probe liquids as well.",

     "abstract": "Bcl-2 family proteins are involved in cell homeostasis, where they regulate cell death. Some of these proteins are pro-apoptotic and others pro-survival. Moreover, many of them share a similar domain composition with several of the so-called BH domains, although some only have a BH3 domain. A C-terminal domain is present in all the multi-BH domain proteins and in some of the BH3-only ones. This C-terminal domain is hydrophobic or amphipathic, for which reason it was thought when they were discovered that they were membrane anchors. Although this is indeed one of their functions, it has since been observed that they may also serve as regulators of the function of some members of this family, such as Bax. They may also serve to recognize the target membrane of some of these proteins, which only after an apoptotic signal, are incorporated into a membrane. It has been shown that peptides that imitate the sequence of C-terminal domains can form pores and may serve as a model to design cytotoxic molecules.",

     "abstract": "Planar solid supported lipid membranes that include an intervening bovine serum albumen (BSA) cushion can greatly reduce undesirable interactions between reconstituted membrane proteins and the underlying substrate. These hetero-self-assemblies reduce frictional coupling by shielding reconstituted membrane proteins from the strong surface charge of the underlying substrate, thereby preventing them from strongly sticking to the substrate themselves. The motivation for this work is to describe the conditions necessary for liposome adsorption and bilayer formation on these hetero-self-assemblies. Described here are experiments that show that the state of BSA is critically important to whether a lipid bilayer is formed or intact liposomes are adsorbed to the BSA passivated surface. It is shown that a smooth layer of native BSA will readily promote lipid bilayer formation while BSA that has been denatured either chemically or by heat will not. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy was used to characterize the surfaces of native, heat denatured, and chemically reduced BSA. The mobility of several zwitterionic and negatively charged lipid combinations has been measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). From these measurements diffusion constants and percent recoveries have been determined and tabulated. The effect of high concentrations of beta-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) on liposome formation as well as bilayer formation was also explored.",

     "abstract": "Lipoxygenase/hydroperoxide lyase mediated transformations convert polyunsaturated fatty acids into various oxylipins. First, lipoxygenases catalyze fatty acid oxidation to fatty acid hydroperoxides. Subsequently, breakdown reactions result in a wide array of metabolites with multiple physiological and ecological functions. These fatty acid transformations are highly diverse in marine algae and play a crucial rule in e.g., signaling, chemical defense, and stress response often mediated through polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs). In this study, green tide-forming macroalgae of the genius Ulva (Chlorophyta) were collected at various sampling sites in the lagoon of the Ria Formosa (Portugal) and were surveyed for PUAs. We demonstrated that sea-lettuce like but not tube-like morphotypes produce elevated amounts of volatile C10-polyunsaturated aldehydes (2,4,7-decatrienal and 2,4-decadienal) upon tissue damage. Moreover, morphogenetic and phylogenetic analyses of the collected Ulva species revealed chemotaxonomic significance of the perspective biosynthetic pathways. The aldehydes are derived from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with 20 or 18 carbon atoms including eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3), arachidonic acid (C20:4 n-6), stearidonic acid (C18:4 n-3), and \u03b3-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-6). We present first evidences that lipoxygenase-mediated (11-LOX and 9-LOX) eicosanoid and octadecanoid pathways catalyze the transformation of C20- and C18-polyunsaturated fatty acids into PUAs and concomitantly into short chain hydroxylated fatty acids.",

These sterols/steroids differ in both the nature and stereochemistry of the polar head group at C3 (\u03b2OH, \u03b1OH or CO) and in the position(s) of the double bond(s). In the \u03945 sterols/steroid series, the concentration of these compounds required to abolish the DPPC pretransition, inversely related to their relative ability to disorder gel state DPPC bilayers, decreases markedly in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO. However, in the \u03944,6 series, these concentrations are similar, regardless of polar head group chemical structure. Similarly, the residual enthalpy of the DPPC main phase transition at 50\u00a0mol% sterol/steroid, which is inversely related to the miscibility of these compounds in the DPPC bilayer, also increases in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO, but this effect is attenuated in the \u03944,6 series. In the two pairs of sterol epimers, the \u03944,6 compounds exhibit a greater decrease in the temperature and enthalpy of both the pretransition and the main phase transition, whereas the opposite result is observed in the ketosteroid pair. Similarly, the ability of these compounds to order the DPPC hydrocarbon chains decreases in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO in both series of compounds, but in the two pairs of sterol epimers, hydrocarbon chain ordering is greater for the \u03945 than the \u03944,6 sterols, whereas the opposite is the case for the steroid pair. Thus, the characteristic effects of sterols/steroids on fluid lipid bilayers are optimal when an OH group rather than CO group is present at C3, and when this OH group is in the equatorial orientation. We suggest that the presence of keto\u2013enol tautomerism in the conjugated \u03944,6 ketosteroid may provide additional H-bonding opportunities to adjacent DPPC molecules in the bilayer, which results in more cholesterol-like effects.",

     "abstract": "Cardiolipin (CL) is a unique anionic, dimeric phospholipid found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is essential for the function of numerous enzymes that are involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. While the role of cardiolipin in apoptosis is well established, its involvement in necrosis is enigmatic. In the present study, KCN-induced necrosis in U937 cells was used as an experimental model to assess the role of CL in necrosis. KCN addition to U937 cells induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, while the antioxidants inhibited necrosis, indicating that ROS play a role in KCN-induced cell death. Further, CL oxidation was confirmed by the monomer green fluorescence of 10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO) and by TLC. Utilizing the red fluorescence of the dimeric NAO, redistribution of CL in mitochondrial membrane during necrosis was revealed. We also showed that the catalytic activity of purified adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase complex, known to be modulated by cardiolipin, decreased following KCN treatment. All these events occurred at an early phase of the necrotic process prior to rupture of the cell membrane. Furthermore, CL-deficient HeLa cells were found to be resistant to KCN-induced necrosis as compared with the wild type cells. We suggest that KCN, an effective reversible inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase and thereby of the respiratory chain leads to ROS increase, which in turn oxidizes CL (amongst other membrane phospholipids) and leads to mitochondrial membrane lipid reorganization and loss of CL symmetry. Finally, the resistance of CL-deficient cells to necrosis further supports the notion that CL, which undergoes oxidation during necrotic cell death, is an integral part of the milieu of events taking place in mitochondria leading to membrane disorganization and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

For temperatures through the gel phase of DPPC multilayers, the CW-EPR spectra show that an increase of HgCl2 content in the dispersion medium slightly increases the rotational mobility of 5-PCSL and markedly restricts the motion of 16-PCSL. Mercury chloride at 100\u00a0mM (HgCl2/lipid molar ratio\u00a0=\u00a02:1) removes the gradient of increasing mobility along the chain found in DPPC bilayers in the gel phase. In contrast, HgCl2 does not influence the DPPC chain flexibility profile in the fluid phase. It also suppresses the pre-transition and moderately downshifts the main transition temperature of DPPC membranes. These findings indicate that HgCl2 affects the lipid chain packing of DPPC bilayers and are consistent with the induction of an interdigitated gel phase. Further, D2O-electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy indicates that in the interdigitated phase a higher water permeation is favored at any chain position and the sigmoidal transmembrane water accessibility profile of DPPC bilayers is abolished. Accordingly, the positional dependence of 14N-hyperfine splitting, 2Azz, shows that the typical hydrophobic barrier of DPPC is significantly altered in the interdigitated phase and all the segments of the lipid chains result to be in a more polar environment.",

This excipient mainly contains dibehenin (\u223c50%), tribehenin (\u223c30%) and monobehenin (20%). It appeared clearly that the mixture polymorphism did not result from a simple addition of the individual behavior. Indeed, the solid state organization of this excipient strongly depended on the presence of the third main component, monobehenin, into the mixture. Furthermore, a threshold ratio of monobehenin, at least 10%, must be reach in order to obtain the typical structural organization (co-existence of \u03b1/sub-\u03b1 subcells) and thermal behavior (solid\u2013solid transition and melting) of Compritol\u00ae.

     "abstract": "Anionic lipids act as signals for the recruitment of proteins containing cationic clusters to biological membranes. A family of anionic lipids known as the phosphoinositides (PIPs) are low in abundance, yet play a critical role in recruitment of peripheral proteins to the membrane interface. PIPs are mono-, bis-, or trisphosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PI) yielding seven species with different structure and anionic charge. The differential spatial distribution and temporal appearance of PIPs is key to their role in communicating information to target proteins. Selective recognition of PIPs came into play with the discovery that the substrate of protein kinase C termed pleckstrin possessed the first PIP binding region termed the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Since the discovery of the PH domain, more than ten PIP binding domains have been identified including PH, ENTH, FYVE, PX, and C2 domains. Representative examples of each of these domains have been thoroughly characterized to understand how they coordinate PIP headgroups in membranes, translocate to specific membrane docking sites in the cell, and function to regulate the activity of their full-length proteins. In addition, a number of novel mechanisms of PIP-mediated membrane association have emerged, such as coincidence detection\u2013specificity for two distinct lipid headgroups. Other PIP-binding domains may also harbor selectivity for a membrane physical property such as charge or membrane curvature. This review summarizes the current understanding of the cellular distribution of PIPs and their molecular interaction with peripheral proteins.",

     "abstract": "Phosphoinositide lipids (PIPns) control numerous critical biological pathways, typically through the regulation of protein function driven by non-covalent protein\u2013lipid binding interactions. Despite the importance of these systems, the unraveling of the full scope of protein\u2013PIPn interactions has represented a significant challenge due to the massive complexity associated with these events, including the large number of diverse proteins that bind to these lipids, variations in the mechanisms by which proteins bind to lipids, and the presence of multiple distinct PIPn isomers. As a result of this complexity, global methods in which numerous proteins that bind PIPns can be identified and characterized simultaneously from complex samples, which have been enabled by key technological advancements, have become popular as an efficient means for tackling this challenge. This review article provides an overview of advancements in large-scale methods for profiling protein\u2013PIPn binding, including experimental methods, such as affinity enrichment, microarray analysis and activity-based protein profiling, as well as computational methods, and combined computational/experimental efforts.",

     "abstract": "Membrane-targeting proteins are crucial components of many cell signaling pathways, including the secretion of insulin. Granuphilin, also known as synaptotagmin-like protein 4, functions in tethering secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis. Granuphilin docks to insulin secretory vesicles through interaction of its N-terminal domain with vesicular Rab proteins; however, the mechanisms of granuphilin plasma membrane targeting and release are less clear. Granuphilin contains two C2 domains, C2A and C2B, that interact with the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. The goal of this study was to determine membrane-binding mechanisms, affinities, and kinetics of both granuphilin C2 domains using fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. Results indicate that both C2A and C2B bind anionic lipids in a Ca2+-independent manner. The C2A domain binds liposomes containing a physiological mixture of lipids including 2% PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity (apparent K d ,PIP x of 2\u20135\u00a0nM), and binds nonspecifically with moderate affinity to anionic liposomes lacking phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIPx) lipids. The C2B domain binds with sub-micromolar affinity to liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2 but does not have a measurable affinity for background anionic lipids. Both domains can be competed away from their target lipids by the soluble PIPx analog inositol-(1,2,3,4,5,6)-hexakisphosphate (IP6), which is a positive regulator of insulin secretion. Potential roles of these interactions in the docking and release of granuphilin from the plasma membrane are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Polyphosphoinositides (PPI) and in particular PI(4,5)P2, are among the most highly charged molecules in cell membranes, are important in many cellular signaling pathways, and are frequently targeted by peripheral polybasic proteins for anchoring through electrostatic interactions. Such interactions between PIP2 and proteins containing polybasic stretches depend on the physical state and the lateral distribution of PIP2 within the inner leaflet of the cell's lipid bilayer. The physical and chemical properties of PIP2 such as pH-dependent changes in headgroup ionization and area per molecule as determined by experiments together with molecular simulations that predict headgroup conformations at various ionization states have revealed the electrostatic properties and phase behavior of PIP2-containing membranes. This review focuses on recent experimental and computational developments in defining the physical chemistry of PIP2 and its interactions with counterions.Ca2+-induced changes in PIP2 charge, conformation, and lateral structure within the membrane are documented by numerous experimental and computational studies. A simplified electrostatic model successfully predicts the Ca2+-driven formation of PIP2 clusters but cannot account for the different effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on PIP2-containing membranes. A more recent computational study is able to see the difference between Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding to PIP2 in the absence of a membrane and without cluster formation. Spectroscopic studies suggest that divalent cation- and multivalent polyamine-induced changes in the PIP2 lateral distribution in model membrane are also different, and not simply related to the net charge of the counterion. Among these differences is the capacity of Ca2+ but not other polycations to induce nm scale clusters of PIP2 in fluid membranes. Recent super resolution optical studies show that PIP2 forms nanoclusters in the inner leaflet of a plasma membrane with a similar size distribution as those induced by Ca2+ in model membranes. The mechanisms by which PIP2 forms nanoclusters and other structures inside a cell remain to be determined, but the unique electrostatic properties of PIP2 and its interactions with multivalent counterions might have particular physiological relevance.",

     "abstract": "Local accumulation of phosphoinositides (PIPs) is an important factor for a broad range of cellular events including membrane trafficking and cell signaling. The negatively charged phosphoinositide headgroups can interact with cations or cationic proteins and this electrostatic interaction has been identified as the main phosphoinositide clustering mechanism. However, an increasing number of reports show that phosphoinositide-mediated signaling events are at least in some cases cholesterol dependent, suggesting other possible contributors to the segregation of phosphoinositides. Using fluorescence microscopy on giant unilamellar vesicles and monolayers at the air/water interface, we present data showing that cholesterol stabilizes fluid phosphoinositide-enriched phases. The interaction with cholesterol is observed for all investigated phosphoinositides (PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3) as well as phosphatidylinositol. We find that cholesterol is present in the phosphoinositide-enriched phase and that the resulting phase is fluid. Cholesterol derivatives modified at the hydroxyl group (cholestenone, cholesteryl ethyl ether) do not promote formation of phosphoinositide domains, suggesting an instrumental role of the cholesterol hydroxyl group in the observed cholesterol/phosphoinositide interaction. This leads to the hypothesis that cholesterol participates in an intermolecular hydrogen bond network formed among the phosphoinositide lipids. We had previously reported that the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bond network between the phosphoinositide lipids leads to a reduction of the charge density at the phosphoinositide phosphomonoester groups (Kooijman et al., 2009). We believe that cholesterol acts as a spacer between the phosphoinositide lipids, thereby reducing the electrostatic repulsion, while participating in the hydrogen bond network, leading to its further stabilization. To illustrate the effect of phosphoinositide segregation on protein binding, we show that binding of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN to PI(5)P and PI(4,5)P2 is enhanced in the presence of cholesterol. These results provide new insights into how phosphoinositides mediate important cellular events.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is an important signaling lipid and plays a crucial role in a wide variety of cellular processes by interacting with protein targets and localizing proteins at the plasma membrane. These interactions are strongly influenced by the lateral distribution of PI(4,5)P2 as well as its ionization state. The characterization of the PI(4,5)P2 ionization state provides important information about how PI(4,5)P2 interacts with other membrane resident or associated chemical species. In this study we have used solid-state MAS 31P NMR to investigate the interactions of PI(4,5)P2 with potential cluster promoting agents, divalent cations and cholesterol. Both Ca2+ and cholesterol were found previously to promote formation of local PI(4,5)P2 clusters in vitro. The NMR approach allows us to probe independently the ionization state of PI(4,5)P2 two phosphomonoester groups. We investigated mixed phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PI(4,5)P2 multilamellar vesicles in the presence of micro and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+. We found that both cations lead to an increased downfield chemical shift of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphomonoester peaks, indicating an increased ionization in the presence of the divalent cations. Ca2+ has a much larger effect on PI(4,5)P2 as compared to Mg2+ at similar concentrations. Physiological concentrations of Ca2+ are significantly lower than those found for Mg2+ and the comparison of the PI(4,5)P2 ionization in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at physiological concentrations resulted in similar charges of the phosphomonoester groups for both cations. PI(4,5)P2 was also examined with vesicles containing cholesterol since cholesterol has been shown to promote PI(4,5)P2 clustering. In the presence of 40\u00a0mol% cholesterol, the PI(4,5)P2 phosphomonoester 31P NMR peaks shifted slightly downfield, indicating a small increase in charge. Previously published data suggest that PI(4,5)P2 is capable of forming an intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bond network, which leads to a reduction of the charge at the phosphomonoester groups through dissipation of the charge across the bilayer/water interface. We hypothesize that cholesterol participates in this intermolecular hydrogen bond network, resulting in a stabilization of PI(4,5)P2 enriched domains due an increased spacing between the PI(4,5)P2 headgroup. We also examined the cumulative effects of cholesterol combined with the divalent cations, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), separately. The combination of cholesterol and divalent cations results in an additive effect on PI(4,5)P2 ionization, while the effect of cholesterol on PI(4,5)P2 ionization is reduced in the presence of PE or PI.",

     "abstract": "Trehalose lipids are bacterial biosurfactants which present interesting physicochemical and biological properties. These glycolipids have a number of different commercial applications and there is an increasing interest in their use as therapeutic agents. The amphiphilic nature of trehalose lipids points to the membrane as their hypothetical site of action and therefore the study of the interaction between these biosurfactants and biological membranes is critical. In this study, we examine the interactions between a trehalose lipid (TL) from Rhodococcus sp. and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) membranes at low ionic strength, by means of differential scanning calorimetry, light scattering, fluorescence polarization and infrared spectroscopy. We describe that there are extensive interactions between TL and DMPG involving the perturbation of the thermotropic intermediate phase of the phospholipid, the destabilization and shifting of the DMPG gel to liquid crystalline phase transition to lower temperatures, the perturbation of the sample transparency, and the modification of the order of the phospholipid palisade in the gel phase. We also report an increase of fluidity of the phosphatidylglycerol acyl chains and dehydration of the interfacial region of the bilayer. These changes would increase the monolayer negative spontaneous curvature of the phospholipid explaining the destabilizing effect on the intermediate state exerted by this biosurfactant. The observations contribute to get insight into the biological mechanism of action of the biosurfactant and help to understand the properties of the intermediate phase display by DMPG at low ionic strength.",

     "abstract": "Fusion peptides comprise conserved hydrophobic domains absolutely required for the fusogenic activity of glycoproteins from divergent virus families. After 30 years of intensive research efforts, the structures and functions underlying their high degree of sequence conservation are not fully elucidated. The long-hydrophobic viral fusion peptide (VFP) sequences are structurally constrained to access three successive states after biogenesis. Firstly, the VFP sequence must fulfill the set of native interactions required for (meta) stable folding within the globular ectodomains of glycoprotein complexes. Secondly, at the onset of the fusion process, they get transferred into the target cell membrane and adopt specific conformations therein. According to commonly accepted mechanistic models, membrane-bound states of the VFP might promote the lipid bilayer remodeling required for virus-cell membrane merger. Finally, at least in some instances, several VFPs co-assemble with transmembrane anchors into membrane integral helical bundles, following a locking movement hypothetically coupled to fusion-pore expansion. Here we review different aspects of the three major states of the VFPs, including the functional assistance by other membrane-transferring glycoprotein regions, and discuss briefly their potential as targets for clinical intervention.",

Because of some unique features of SLNs such as their unique size dependent properties it offers possibility to develop new therapeutics. A common denominator of all these SLN-based platforms is to deliver drugs into specific tissues or cells in a pathological setting with minimal adverse effects on bystander cells. SLNs are capable to incorporate drugs into nanocarriers which lead to a new prototype in drug delivery which maybe used for drug targeting. Hence solid lipid nanoparticles hold great promise for reaching the goal of controlled and site specific drug delivery and hence attracted wide attention of researchers. This review presents a broad treatment of targeted solid lipid nanoparticles discussing their types such as antibody SLN, magnetic SLN, pH sensitive SLN and cationic SLN.",

They include loss of important mitochondrial functions, such as the ability to maintain calcium homeostasis and to generate ATP, as well as mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling. Moreover, the lipidic component of mitochondrial membranes undergoes important alterations in composition and distribution, which have turned out to be relevant regulatory events for the proteins involved in apoptotic mitochondrial damage.",

     "abstract": "Ladderanes, which are multiple fused cyclobutane rings, are unique structures available only in nature. Anammox bacteria produce ladderane phospholipids during their life cycle, but the synthesis mechanism still remains a mystery. The function of ladderane lipids in the membrane is unclear as well. According to previous speculations, ladderane moieties of the bilayer might decrease permeability for certain molecules, which should not diffuse out of the compartment enclosed by the ladderane-containing membrane. We report the first atomistic-precision molecular dynamics simulations of bilayers containing ladderane lipids. The structural and thermodynamics differences among (1) pure ladderane containing bilayer, (2) POPC bilayer, and (3) their equimolar mixture are discussed. Potentials of mean force are reported for the translocation of a hydrazine molecule through all investigated bilayers. All bilayers offer a potential energy barrier to hydrazine. Contrary to expectations, the presence of the ladderane lipids somewhat lowers the barrier for translocation of hydrazine. We conclude that the presence of ladderane phospholipids in anammox bacteria does not serve as a barrier to hydrazine. It may serve as a barrier to larger and noxious intermediates in the anammox reaction, or, the true mission of ladderane lipids must be located in a different plane.",

However, dynamic properties of niosomes have not been studied extensively. In this study we used electron spin resonance (ESR) technique to measure the membrane fluidity of niosomes. In parallel with phospholipid liposomes, the ESR spectra of 5- and 16-doxyl stearate in niosomes of sorbitan monostearate (Span 60) and sorbitan monooleate (Span 80) showed that motion of the spin label was more restricted at the region near the headgroup than near the bilayer center. Cholesterol increased fluidity of Span 60 niosomes whereas it decreased fluidity of Span 80 niosomes. Dicetyl phosphate added at 10\u00a0mol% concentration as a stabilizer had a minimal effect on the membrane fluidity throughout the bilayer. We also used ESR technique to monitor the hydration-induced transformation of Span 60 proniosome gel to niosome and showed that the niosome prepared by hydration of proniosome gel was identical to the niosome obtained from a thin film hydration method. Finally the ESR spectra of Span niosomes were compared with those of polysorbate (Tween) niosomes and polyethoxy fatty ether (Brij) niosomes. Tween niosomes had a bulky headgroup and were much less rigid than Span niosomes. This effect of headgroup size on fluidity was also manifest in Brij niosomes where fluidity increased with the number of ethoxy units in the polyethoxy headgroup.",

In particular, we focus on the use of fluorescence microscopy and micropipet manipulation techniques to study composition\u2013structure\u2013property materials relationships of free-standing lipid bilayer membranes. Because their size (\u223c5\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm diameter) that is well above the resolution limit of regular light microscopes, GUVs are suitable membrane models for optical microscopy and micromanipulation experimentation. For instance, using different fluorescent reporters, fluorescence microscopy allows strategies to study membrane lateral structure/dynamics at the level of single vesicles of diverse compositions. The micropipet manipulation technique on the other hand, uses Hoffman modulation contrast microscopy and allows studies on the mechanical, thermal, molecular exchange and adhesive-interactive properties of compositionally different membranes under controlled environmental conditions. The goal of this review is to (i) provide a historical perspective for both techniques; (ii) present and discuss some of their most important contributions to our understanding of lipid bilayer membranes; and (iii) outline studies that would utilize both techniques simultaneously on the same vesicle thus bringing the ability to characterize structure and strain responses together with the direct application of well-defined stresses to a single membrane or observe the effects of adhesive spreading. Knowledge gained by these studies has informed several applications of lipid membranes including their use as lung surfactants and drug delivery systems for cancer.",

From the temperature dependencies of the molecular volumes of DOPC and CnNO their coefficients of isobaric thermal expansivities in the investigated temperature interval were obtained. The VCnNO volumes of CnNO incorporated into DOPC bilayers showed linear dependencies on the CnNO alkyl chain length at all measured temperatures. This allowed to calculate the component volume of the CnNO methylene group ( V CH 2 ) at several temperatures and its coefficient of isobaric thermal expansivity. Using the assumption that the component volume of the CnNO methyl group V CH 3 = 2 V CH 2 we also calculated the component volume and the coefficient of isobaric thermal expansivity of the hydrophilic group of CnNO (VNO).

One of the three characteristic mycolate types, the keto-mycolic acids, behaves very differently from either \u03b1-mycolic acids or methoxy-mycolic acids, suggesting a distinct biological role.

     "abstract": "One of the factors promoting oxidative/halogenating modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is myeloperoxidase (MPO). We have shown previously that MPO binds to the LDL surfaces. The LDL\u2013MPO complex is uncoupled in the presence of peptide EQIQDDCTGDED that corresponds to a fragment of apoB-100 (445\u2013456). In this paper we studied how this peptide, as well as inhibitors and modulators of halogenating activity of MPO such as ceruloplasmin (CP), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) and thiocyanate (SCN\u2212) affect the accumulation of cholesterol and its esters in monocytes/macrophages after incubation with LDL subjected to different kinds of MPO-dependent oxidative/halogenating modification. In the presence of H2O2 and halides MPO causes stronger proatherogenic modification of LDL than exogenous reactive halogen species (HOCl and HOBr). Both monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages, and neutrophils secrete MPO in response to the presence of damaged LDL. The peptide EQIQDDCTGDED preventing interaction between MPO and LDL reduces the uptake of modified LDL and MPO by monocytes/macrophages and thus precludes the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Our results indicate that binding to MPO is important for LDL to become modified and acquire proatherogenic properties. The peptide EQIQDDCTGDED, CP, ABAH, and SCN\u2212 can play the role of anti-atherogenic factors reducing the deleterious effect of catalytically active MPO on LDL and accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages.",

The overall role and involvement of cardiolipin oxidation (CLox) products in major intracellular signaling as well as extracellular inflammatory and immune responses have been established. However, identification of individual peroxidized molecular species in the context of their ability to induce specific biological responses has not been yet achieved. This is due, at least in part, to technological difficulties in detection, identification, structural characterization and quantitation of CLox associated with their very low abundance and exquisite diversification. This dictates the need for the development of new methodologies for reliable, sensitive and selective analysis of both CLox.

Here, we estimated the turnover of select molecular species of CL in mammalian cell cultures and compared it to the turnover of other lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol. Cells were labeled with myristic acid, 9,10-2H2-oleic acid, or d-[U-13C6]-glucose and analyzed by mass spectrometry at different time points of pulse-chase experiments. The turnover of glycerol groups was monitored by specific isotopologues that carried 13C primarily in the glycerol carbons, whereas the turnover of acyl groups was monitored by molecular species that carried myristoyl or 2H2-oleoyl groups. We found that the turnover of CL, but not of mitochondrial PC and PE, was substantially slower than the turnover of other cellular phospholipids. In dioleoyl-PC and dioleoyl-PE, the acyl turnover was faster than the glycerol turnover, indicating continuous deacylation and reacylation of the oleoyl residues. In contrast, the acyl turnover was similar to the glycerol turnover in tetraoleoyl-CL, suggesting that oleoyl remodeling did not take place continuously in endogenous CL. We conclude that CL, once assembled in mitochondrial membranes, remains largely inert to degradation and acyl remodeling.",

Post-synthesis, cardiolipin undergoes acyl chain remodeling, requiring additional trafficking steps, before it achieves its final distribution within both mitochondrial membranes. This process is regulated at several points via multiple independent mechanisms.

The mitochondrial signature phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) plays a central role in formation and stability of respiratory SCs from yeast to man. Studies in yeast mutants in which the CL level can be regulated displayed a direct correlation between CL levels and SC formation. Disease states in which CL levels are reduced also show defects in SC formation. Three-dimensional density maps of yeast and bovine SCs by electron cryo-microscopy show gaps between the transmembrane-localized interfaces of individual complexes consistent with the large excess of CL in SCs over that integrated into the structure of individual respiratory complexes. Finally, the yeast SC composed of Complex III and two Complexes IV was reconstituted in liposomes from purified individual complexes containing integrated CLs. Reconstitution was wholly dependent on inclusion of additional CL in the liposomes. Therefore, non-integral CL molecules play an important role in SC formation and may be involved in regulation of SC stability under metabolic conditions where CL levels fluctuate.",

Insertion of the protein into membranes, insertion of CL acyl chains into the protein interior, and extensive unfolding of cyt c after adsorption to the membrane have been proposed as possible modes for interaction of cyt c with CL. Dissociation of Met80 is accompanied by opening of the heme crevice and binding of another heme ligand. Fluorescence studies have revealed conformational heterogeneity of the lipid-bound protein ensemble with distinct polypeptide conformations that vary in the degree of protein unfolding.

     "abstract": "Cardiolipins (CLs) are important biologically for their unique role in biomembranes that couple phosphorylation and electron transport like bacterial plasma membranes, chromatophores, chloroplasts and mitochondria. CLs are often tightly coupled to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The first step in understanding the interaction of CL with proteins is to obtain the pure CL structure, and the structure of mixtures of CL with other lipids. In this work we use a variety of techniques to characterize the fluid phase structure, material properties and thermodynamics of mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with tetramyristoylcardiolipin (TMCL), both with 14-carbon chains, at several mole percentages. X-ray diffuse scattering was used to determine structure, including bilayer thickness and area/lipid, the bending modulus, KC, and SXray, a measure of chain orientational order. Our results reveal that TMCL thickens DMPC bilayers at all mole percentages, with a total increase of \u223c6\u00a0\u00c5 in pure TMCL, and increases AL from 64\u00a0\u00c52 (DMPC at 35\u00a0\u00b0C) to 109\u00a0\u00c52 (TMCL at 50\u00a0\u00b0C). KC increases by \u223c50%, indicating that TMCL stiffens DMPC membranes. TMCL also orders DMPC chains by a factor of \u223c2 for pure TMCL. Coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations confirm the experimental thickening of 2\u00a0\u00c5 for 20\u00a0mol% TMCL and locate the TMCL headgroups near the glycerol-carbonyl region of DMPC; i.e., they are sequestered below the DMPC phosphocholine headgroup. Our results suggest that TMCL plays a role similar to cholesterol in that it thickens and stiffens DMPC membranes, orders chains, and is positioned under the umbrella of the PC headgroup. CL may be necessary for hydrophobic matching to inner mitochondrial membrane proteins. Differential scanning calorimetry, SXray and CGMD simulations all suggest that TMCL does not form domains within the DMPC bilayers. We also determined the gel phase structure of TMCL, which surprisingly displays diffuse X-ray scattering, like a fluid phase lipid. AL\u00a0=\u00a040.8\u00a0\u00c52 for the \u00bdTMCL gel phase, smaller than the DMPC gel phase with AL\u00a0=\u00a047.2\u00a0\u00c52, but similar to AL of DLPE\u00a0=\u00a041\u00a0\u00c52, consistent with untilted chains in gel phase TMCL.",

Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of POPC\u2013Chol and CLA-Chol mixtures at various Chol concentrations are employed within a recently developed and validated computational methodology (Khelashvili et al., 2013) that calculates from MD trajectories the bending rigidity (KC) for these systems. We have found that the addition of 30% Chol stiffens POPC lipid membranes much more significantly (2.3-fold) than it does C9T11 (1.5-fold) or T10C12 (1.75-fold) lipid bilayers. Extensive comparative structural analysis of the simulated mixtures supports a molecular mechanism for the differential effects of cholesterol, whereby the sterol molecules tilt more significantly in CLA membranes where they also insert deeper inside the hydrocarbon core. The observed distinct arrangement of Chol molecules in CLA and POPC bilayers, in turn, is dictated by the interplay between the specific location of the trans double bond in the two CLA lipid isomers and the preferential interaction of the rigid Chol ring with the saturated segments of the lipid tails. The simulations and analysis described in this paper provide novel insights into the specific modes of molecular interaction in bilayers composed of mixtures of Chol and unsaturated lipids that drive emergent macroscopic properties, such as the membrane's bending modulus.",

In the paper we determined the effect of phloretin and 6-ketocholestanol (dipole potential modifying agents) on the membrane hydration and efficiency of the trans-membrane water flow. The dynamics of water molecules within the lipid bilayer interface was evaluated using solvent relaxation method, whereas the osmotically induced trans-membrane water flux was estimated with the stopped-flow method using the liposome shrinkage kinetics. The presence of phloretin or 6-ketocholestanol resulted in a change of both, the interfacial hydration level and osmotically driven water fluxes. Specifically, the presence of 6-ketocholestanol reduced the amount and mobility of water in the membrane interface. It also slows the osmotically induced water flow. The interfacial hydration change caused by phloretin was much smaller and the effect on osmotically induced water flow was opposite to that of 6-ketocholestanol.",

Membrane fluidity was assessed through the anisotropy measurements using the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Though the interaction of both the types of nanoparticles reduced the membrane fluidity, the results were more pronounced in the negatively charged liposomes encapsulated with positively charged iron oxide nanoparticles due to strong electrostatic attractions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results also confirmed the presence of significant quantity of positively charged iron oxide nanoparticles in negatively charged liposomes. Through thermally induced shape fluctuation measurements of the giant liposomes, a considerable reduction in the bending elasticity modulus was observed for cobalt ferrite nanoparticles. The experimental results were supported by the simulation studies using modified Langevin\u2013Poisson\u2013Boltzmann model.",

To avoid possible artifacts, such investigations must be based on the time course of peroxidation (i.e. on kinetic studies). To be able to compare complex kinetic profiles, it is important to characterize them in terms of mechanistically meaningful and experimentally unequivocal parameters.In this review, we characterize the typically observed continuous kinetic profiles in terms of a limited number of characteristic time-points (both commonly used and additional time-points and their combinations) that can be derived from experimental time-dependencies. The meaning of each of the experimentally observed characteristic parameters is presented in terms of rate constants and concentrations, derived on the basis of mechanistic considerations. Theoretical expressions for these characteristic parameters are based on a model that includes both the inhibited peroxidation and the uninhibited peroxidation occurring after consumption of the antioxidant(s).

Free-radical fragmentation is typical for the lipids containing a hydroxyl group in \u03b2-position with respect to an ester or amide bond. The present study has been undertaken to investigate free-radical transformations of phospholipids in model membranes containing lipids able to undergo fragmentation in their polar part. Liposomes from egg yolk lecithin containing saturated or monounsaturated glycero- and sphingolipids were subjected to the action of an HO* \u2013 generating system \u2013 Fe2+(Cu2+)/H2O2/Asc, and the POL products were investigated. In parallel with this, the effects of monoacylglycerols and scavengers of reactive species on Fe2+(Cu2+)/H2O2/Asc \u2013 mediated free-radical fragmentation of phosphatidylglycerols were studied. Hydroxyl-containing sphingolipids and glycerolipids, which undergo free-radical fragmentation under such conditions, manifested antioxidant properties in the model membranes. In the absence of HO groups in the lipid structure, the effect was either pro-oxidant or neutral. Monoacylglycerols slowed down the rate of both peroxidation in the hydrophobic part and free-radical fragmentation in the hydrophilic part of phospholipid membrane. Scavengers of reactive species inhibited the fragmentation of phosphatidylglycerol substantially. Thus, the ability of hydroxyl-containing lipids to undergo free-radical fragmentation in polar part apparently makes a substantial contribution to the mechanism of their protector action.",

     "abstract": "We study how lipid probes based on pyrene-labeling could be designed to minimize perturbations in lipid bilayers, and how the same design principles could be exploited to develop probes which gauge lipid dynamics primarily within a single lipid monolayer or between them. To this end, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to consider membranes where pyrene moieties are attached to lipid acyl chains in varying positions. We find that in a DOPC bilayer the conformational ordering of lipids around di-pyrenyl-PC probes is altered to a largely similar extent regardless of where the pyrene moiety is attached to the hydrocarbon chain. This is in contrast to saturated membranes, where pyrene-induced perturbations have been observed to be more prominent. Meanwhile, the formation of pyrene dimers depends on the linkage point between pyrene and its host lipid. Membrane-spanning dimers between lipids in different membrane leaflets are observed only if the pyrene moiety is attached to the latter half of the acyl chain. A seemingly minor change to link pyrene to an acyl chain that is two carbons shorter leads to a situation where membrane-spanning dimers are no longer observed. Further, simulations suggest that formation of dimers is a slow process, where the rate is limited by both lateral diffusion and the dimerization process once the two probes are neighbors to one another. Typical lifetimes of pyrene dimers turn out be of the order of nanoseconds. The results are expected to pave the way for designing ways to consider experimentally topics such as intraleaflet lateral diffusion, motion of lipids within and between membrane domains, and membrane domain registration across bilayers.",

Glycerophosphatidylcholine and glycerophosphatidylethanolamine with alk(en)yl ether residues in the sn-1 position and unsaturated long chained fatty acyl residues in sn-2 position were identified as the most prominent polar lipids.

The analysis of molecular species composition subsequent to the incorporation of exogenous [14C]-octadecadienoic acid suggests two pathways for incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into glycerophosphatidylcholine: (1) de novo synthesis of glycerophosphatidylcholine via the CDP-choline pathway and (2) reacylation of lysophosphatidylcholine via an acyltransferase.",

Also, we noted an increase in brightness of the labeled PIP2 particles with increasing labeled PIP2 molar fraction. Together with the observed change in LAURDAN GP with increasing molar fraction of unlabeled PIP2, these results demonstrate the presence of PIP2 enriched clusters that are smaller than the resolution limit of the fluorescent microscope. In addition, we report the presence of a hypsochromic shift of the fluorescence for the BODIPY labeled lipids that we attributed to clustering.

These sterols/steroids differ in both the nature and stereochemistry of the polar head group at C3 (\u03b2OH, \u03b1OH or CO) and in the position of the double bond (C4\u2013C5 in ring A or C5\u2013C6 in ring B). In the three \u03945 sterols/steroid series, the concentration of these compounds required to abolish the DPPC pretransition, inversely related to their relative ability to disorder gel state DPPC bilayers, decreases in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO and these differences in concentration are significant. However, in the \u03944 series, these concentrations are more similar, regardless of polar head group nature or stereochemistry. Similarly, the residual enthalpy of the main phase transition of DPPC at 50\u00a0mol.% sterol/steroid, which is inversely related to the miscibility of these compounds in the DPPC bilayer, also increases in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO, but this effect is attenuated in the \u03944 as opposed to the \u03945 series. Both of these results indicate that the presence of a double bond at C4\u2013C5 in ring A, as compared to a C5\u2013C6 double bond in ring B, reduces the effect of variations in the structure of the polar group at C3 on the properties of the host DPPC bilayer. The movement of the double bond from C5 to C4 in the two sterol pairs results in a greater decrease in the temperature and enthalpy of both the pretransition and the main phase transition, whereas the opposite result is observed in the ketosteroid pair. Similarly, the ability of these compounds to order the DPPC hydrocarbon chains decreases in the order \u03b2OH\u00a0>\u00a0\u03b1OH\u00a0>\u00a0CO in both series of compounds, but in the two sterol pairs, hydrocarbon chain ordering is greater for the \u03945 than the \u03944 sterols, whereas the opposite is the case for the steroid pair. All of these results indicate that the typical effects of sterols/steroids in increasing the packing density and thermal stability of fluid lipid bilayers are optimal when an OH group rather than CO group is present at C3, and that this OH group is more effective in the equatorial rather than the axial orientation. We can explain all of our sterol results by noting that the shift of the double bond from \u03945 to \u03944 introduces of a bend in ring A, which in turn destroys the coplanarity of the steroid fused ring system and reduces the goodness of sterol packing in the host DPPC bilayer. However, this conformational change should also occur in the ketosteroid pair, yet our experimental results indicate that the presence of the \u03944 double bond is less disruptive than a double bond at \u03945. We suggest that the presence of keto-enol tautomerism in the conjugated \u03944 ketosteroid, but not in the nonconjugated \u03945 compound, may provide additional H-bonding opportunities to adjacent DPPC molecules in the bilayer, which can overcome the unfavourable conformational change in ring A induced by the \u03944 double bond.",

Trapped oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) in the subendothelial matrix is taken up by macrophage and leads to foam cell generation creating the first step in atherosclerosis development. Many researchers have studied LDL oxidation using in vitro cell-induced LDL oxidation model. The present study provides a kinetic model for LDL oxidation in intima layer that can be used in modeling of atherosclerotic lesions development. This is accomplished by considering lipid peroxidation kinetic in LDL through a system of elementary reactions. In comparison, characteristics of our proposed kinetic model are consistent with the results of previous experimental models from other researches. Furthermore, our proposed LDL oxidation model is added to the mass transfer equation in order to predict the LDL concentration distribution in intima layer which is usually difficult to measure experimentally. According to the results, LDL oxidation kinetic constant is an important parameter that affects LDL concentration in intima layer so that existence of antioxidants that is responsible for the reduction of initiating rates and prevention of radical formations, have increased the concentration of LDL in intima by reducing the LDL oxidation rate.",

     "abstract": "The lipid membrane not only provides a rich interface with an array of receptor signaling complexes with which a cell communicates, but it also serves as a source of lipid derived bioactive molecules. In pathologic conditions of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with activation of oxidative stress, unsaturated phosphatidyl cholines overlooking a luminal space undergo oxidation leading to generation of fragmented phospholipids such as 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysoPC), or 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) full length oxygenation products (oxPAPC). Using Langmuir monolayers as models of the lipid bilayer, we evaluated the propensity of these phospholipids to solubilize from the cell membrane. The results suggest that lysoPC is rapidly released as it is produced, while oxPAPC has a longer membrane bound lifetime. After being released from cell membranes, these oxidized phospholipids exhibit potent agonist-like effects on neighboring cells. Therefore, we correlate the presence of the two phospholipid groups with the onset and resolution of increased vascular leakiness associated with ALI through testing their effect on vascular endothelial barrier integrity. Our work shows that cells respond differently to these two groups of products of phosphatidyl choline oxidation. LysoPC disrupts cell\u2013cell junctions and increases endothelial permeability while oxPAPC enhances endothelial barrier. These data suggest a model whereby rapid release of lysoPC results in onset of ALI associated vascular leak, and the release of a reserve of oxPAPC as oxidative stress subsides restores the vascular barrier properties.",

The organization of the bilayers in the presence of ethanol, described previously, is now observed to be a general effect of short chain alcohols. Evidence is presented for tilting of the acyl chains with respect to the bilayer normal in the presence of ethanol or propanol. However, the different chain lengths of the alcohols, and isomeric form, influence the thermal stability of the ordered gel to different extents. This behavior is unlike that of the gel state phosphatidylcholine analog which, in the presence of short chain alcohols, undergoes hydrocarbon chain interdigitation.

We then estimated the apoptosis by Morphological observation and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. We also used Western blot analysis to assess the expression of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2 proteins and the activation of Akt/p-Akt and ER\u03b1/p-ER\u03b1. Propylpyrazole-triol (PPT), a selective ER\u03b1 agonist was used to confirm the induction of apoptosis by c9, t11 CLA may relate to ER\u03b1-mediated pathway.In CLA-treated RL 95-2 cells, we found that c9, t11-CLA inhibited viability and trigged apoptosis, as judged from nuclear morphology and flow cytometric analysis. The expression of caspase-3 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were significant increased, but no obvious change was observed about Akt and p-Akt in c9, t11-CLA-treated cells. However, the expression of total ER\u03b1 level in RL 95-2 cells-treated with c9, t11-CLA was unchanged, while in the concentration of 80\u00a0mM, c9, t11-CLA down-regulated the protein expression level of p-ER\u03b1.

Several independent studies in murine and cell-based models of scrapie have highlighted the presence of a link between prion generation and lipid alterations; yet, no data on natural disease are available. In this study we investigated levels of total lipids and cholesterol as well as profiles of fatty acids in brain homogenates from symptomatic and asymptomatic scrapie-infected sheep vs. healthy sheep, all belonging to the same flock. Lipid extracts were analyzed by means of gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Data of fatty acids were submitted to multivariate statistical analysis to give a picture of the brain lipid profiles of sheep. Interestingly, results revealed abnormalities in the brain fatty acid unsaturation of infected/symptomatic animals. Significant reduction of monoene 18:1 n-9 was detected in brain lipids from infected/symptomatic sheep, as compared to healthy and infected/asymptomatic animals, and this alteration occurred in combination with a significant increase in 18:0 level. The unsupervised Principal Component Analysis showed that infected/symptomatic and healthy sheep samples lie in two different regions of the plot, infected/asymptomatic lie mostly next to healthy. The increase of cerebral saturated fatty acids provides a rough indication of presumed alterations in lipid raft domains of nervous cells during scrapie, suggesting that they may exist in a notable viscous liquid-ordered state. Such physicochemical alteration would have a profound impact on the raft thermodynamic properties, its spatial organization, and signal transduction, all potentially relevant for prion generation.",

The ozonolysis was conducted till a molar ratio O3/CC\u00a0\u2248\u00a01 when the exothermal reaction spontaneously went to completion. A specific thermochemical calculation on ethyl oleate ozonation has been made to determine the theoretical heat of the ozonization reaction using the group increment approach. A linear relationship was found both in the integrated absorptivity of the ozonide infrared band at 1110\u00a0cm\u22121 and the ozonolysis time as well as the thermal decomposition enthalpy of the ozonides and peroxides formed as a result of the ozonation. The DSC decomposition temperature of ozonated ethyl oleate occurs with an exothermal peak at about 150\u2013155\u00a0\u00b0C with a decomposition enthalpy of 243.0\u00a0kJ/mol at molar ratio O3/CC\u00a0\u2248\u00a01. It is shown that the decomposition enthalpy of ozonized ethyl oleate is a constant value (\u2248243\u00a0kJ/mol) at any stage of the O3/CC once an adequate normalization of the decomposition enthalpy for the amount of the adsorbed ozone is taken into consideration. The decomposition enthalpy of ozonized ethyl oleate was also calculated using a simplified thermochemical model, obtaining a result in reasonable agreement with the experimental value.",

Antiproliferative activity of each individual product from digestion (1-O-octadecyl-2-butyroilglycerol; 1-O-octadecyl glycerol; butyric acid) was also performed. The impact of solubilization of lipid products within micellar structures was also tested. The 1-O-octadecyl glycerol was the most active compound, followed by 1-O-octadecyl-2-butyroilglycerol, D-SCAKG and butyric acid. The 1-O-octadecyl glycerol and butyric acid were the only molecules that showed antiproliferative effect in absence of micelles. Digested D-SCAKG was 4-fold more effective than non-digested D-SCAKG.

As summary, the synthetic D-SCAKG seems to be an interesting antitumoral lipid against colonocytes, especially after previous intestinal digestion, and mainly due to the synergism of the major products, namely 1-O-octadecyl-2-butyroilglycerol and 1-O-octadecyl glycerol.

The behavior of SLN gel on rat skin was evaluated in vitro using Franz diffusion cells to determine the skin permeation and penetration characteristics, in vivo on mice to determine the skin tolerance by histopathological examinations.

MLX-SLN gel with nanometric particle size exhibited the controlled release abilities and simultaneously the potential to transport the drug to various skin layers. SLN gel displayed viscoelastic properties with predominantly elastic behavior and exhibited plastic flow. Biophysical studies elucidated the interaction between the SLN gel and stratum corneum (SC) lipids, and proposed the lipid bilayer fluidization as the possible mechanism for the increased penetration of meloxicam into skin. The nano-gel system showed marked anti-inflammatory activity and excellent skin tolerability.

In this study molecular dynamics simulation was performed on oleic acid/oleate bilayers with the oleate concentration varying from 40 to 70\u00a0mol%. All the bilayers reached an equilibrium and stayed stable during a 40\u00a0ns simulation. Area per lipid increased with mol% of oleate probably due to charge repulsion between anionic oleate molecules. Oleate was pulled out toward the aqueous phase so that the carboxyl groups of oleic acid and oleate were separated by 0.392\u00a0nm in the bilayer of oleic acid/oleate 1:1. Water concentration at the depth of carboxyl group of oleate was five times as high as that of oleic acid. Number of hydrogen bonds between oleic acid and oleate was small in contrast to a proposal that it is an important factor for the bilayer stability. However there was an extensive array of hydrogen bonds between the lipids and water molecules. Acyl chain order was within a normal range for a lipid bilayer but lateral diffusion was an order of magnitude faster in oleic acid/oleate bilayer than in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer.

     "abstract": "The compound 2,6-diisopropylphenol (Propofol, PRF) is widely used for inducing general anesthesia, but the mechanism of PRF action remains relatively poorly understood at the molecular level. This work examines the possibility that a potential mode of action of PRF is to modulate the lipid order in target membranes. The effect on monolayers and bilayers of dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (DPPC) was probed using Langmuir monolayer isotherms, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Increasing amounts of PRF in a DPPC monolayer causes a decrease in isothermal compressibility modulus at the phase transition. A partition constant for PRF in DPPC liposomes on the order of K\u00a0\u2248\u00a01500\u00a0M\u22121 was found, and the partitioning was found to be enthalpy-driven above the melting temperature (Tm). A decrease in Tm with PRF content was found whereas the bilayer melting enthalpy \u0394Hm remains almost constant. The last finding indicates that PRF incorporates into the membrane at a depth near the phosphatidylcholine headgroup, in agreement with our MD-simulations. The simulations also reveal that PRF partitions into the membrane on a timescale of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcs and has a cholesterol-like ordering effect on DPPC in the fluid phase. The vertical location of the PRF binding site in a bacterial ligand-gated ion channel coincides with the location found in our MD-simulations. Our results suggest that multiple physicochemical mechanisms may determine anesthetic potency of PRF, including effects on proteins that are mediated through the bilayer.",

The major products were ketodienes, epoxyalcohols, hemiacetals and decadienals.

The products were separated by HPLC. The cyclopentenone fractions were collected and analyzed by GC\u2013MS. Trans-10-oxo-PEA (Me) and 10-oxo-9(13)-PEA (Me) were formed during the thermal conversion of 9-hydroperoxide (Me ester). Similarly, the cyclopentenones trans-12-oxo-PEA (Me) and 12-oxo-9(13)-PEA (Me) were detected after the heating of 13-hydroperoxide (Me ester). Thermal formation of cyclopentenones can be considered as a biomimetic model of AOS pathway, providing new insights into the mechanisms of allene oxide formation and cyclization.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, multi-lipid bicellar systems have emerged as promising membrane models. The fast orientational diffusion and magnetic alignability made these systems very attractive for NMR investigations. However, their alignment was so far achieved with a strong magnetic field, which limited their use with other methods that require macroscopic orientation. Recently, it was shown that bicelles could be aligned also by shear flow in a Couette flow cell, making it applicable to structural and biophysical studies by polarized light spectroscopy. Considering the sensitivity of this lipid system to small variations in composition and physicochemical parameters, efficient use of such a flow-cell method with coupled techniques will critically depend on the detailed understanding of how the lipid systems behave under flow conditions. In the present study we have characterized the flow alignment behavior of the commonly used dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine/dicaproyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC/DHPC) bicelle system, for various temperatures, lipid compositions, and lipid concentrations. We conclude that at optimal flow conditions the selected bicellar systems can produce the most efficient flow alignment out of any lipid systems used so far. The highest degree of orientation of DMPC/DHPC samples is noticed in a narrow temperature interval, at a practical temperature around 25\u00a0\u00b0C, most likely in the phase transition region characterized by maximum sample viscosity. The change of macroscopic orientation factor as function of the above conditions is now described in detail. The increase in macroscopic alignment observed for bicelles will most likely allow recording of higher resolution spectra on membrane systems, which provide deeper structural insight and analysis into properties of biomolecules interacting with solution phase lipid membranes.",

Hcf106 has been shown biochemically to insert spontaneously into thylakoid membranes; however, how this occurs is not understood. To investigate how Hcf106 inserts itself into the membrane unassisted, solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the membrane activity of the TMD. A synthetic peptide of the Hcf106 TMD was incorporated into multilamellar vesicles made of 100% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC) or 85%:15% ratio with monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (POPC/MGDG) to probe peptide\u2013lipid interaction. Solid-state 31P NMR and 2H NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to reveal peptide perturbations of the phospholipid membranes. Changes in spectral lineshape, chemical shift anisotropy width, 31P T1 relaxation time and SCD order parameters demonstrated that the Hcf106 TMD peptide interacted with the phospholipids. Furthermore, the comparison between POPC and POPC/MGDG multilamellar vesicles indicated that lipid bilayer composition affected the peptide\u2013lipid interaction with the peptide interacting preferentially with vesicles that more closely mimic the thylakoid.",

Analysis of surface pressure-molecular area isotherms in mixed monolayers of THs with either DPPC or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) at air\u2013water interface indicated a reduction in molecular area for THs/lipid mixtures at all surface pressures.

They may exert physicochemical actions affecting biomembrane rigidity because cholesterol is one of the major components of cell membranes. We investigated the distribution of isomeric ChOOHs in heterogeneous cell membranes with different lipid profiles using mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells as a model of the dermis. Before and after UVA irradiation in the presence of hematoporphyrin, cell membranes were partitioned to microdomains (lipid rafts and caveolae) containing a higher amount of cholesterol and non-microdomains (containing a lower amount of cholesterol) by ultracentrifugation. By a combination of diphenylpyrenylphosphine-thin-layer chromatography blotting analyses and gas chromatography\u2013electron ionization-mass spectrometry/selected ion monitoring analyses, ChOOH isomers were determined as their trimethylsilyloxyl derivatives. Cholesterol 5\u03b1-, 7\u03b1- and 7\u03b2-hydroperoxide were found as isomeric ChOOHs before irradiation. The amounts of the three ChOOH isomers increased significantly after photoirradiation for 2\u00a0h. No difference was observed between microdomains and non-microdomains with regard to the ratio of the amounts of isomeric ChOOHs to that of cholesterol, suggesting that these ChOOH isomers were distributed equally in both parts depending on cholesterol content. When cells were treated with a purified mixture of ChOOH isomers, cell membranes incorporated ChOOHs into microdomains as well as non-microdomains evenly. Cellular matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity was elevated by treatment with the purified mixture of ChOOH isomers. These results strongly suggest that ChOOHs accumulate in cell membranes irrespective of the heterogeneous microstructure and promote MMP activity if dermal cells are exposed to photodynamic actions.",

These carriers have some benefits such as increased drug stability, high drug payload, the incorporation of lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, and no biotoxicity. Therefore, due to the cost-efficient, proportionally increasable, and reproducible preparation of SLN/NLC and the avoidance of organic solvents used, the warm microemulsion quenching method was selected from among several preparation methods for development in this research.To prepare the warm O/W microemulsion, lipids (distearin, stearic acid, beeswax, triolein alone or in combination with others) were melted at a temperature of 65\u00a0\u00b0C. After that, different ratios of Tween60 (10\u201322.5%) and glyceryl monostearate (surfactant and co-surfactant) and water were added, and the combination was stirred. Then, 1-butanol (co-surfactant) was added dropwise until a clear microemulsion was formed and titration continued to achieve cloudiness (to obtain the microemulsion zone). The warm o/w microemulsions were added dropwise into 4\u00a0\u00b0C water (1:5 volume ratio) while being stirred at 400 or 600\u00a0rpm. Lipid nanosuspensions were created upon the addition of the warm o/w microemulsion to the cold water. The SLN were obtained over a range of concentrations of co-surfactants and lipids and observed for microemulsion stability (clearness). For selected preparations, characterization involved also determination of mean particle size, polydispersity and shape. According to the aim of this study, the optimum formulations requiring the minimum amounts of 1-butanol (1.2%) and lower temperatures for creation were selected. Mono-disperse lipid nanoparticles were prepared in the size range 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nm to 124\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021\u00a0nm according to a laser diffraction particle size analyzer and transmission electron microscopy. This method for preparing lipid nanoparticles by warm o/w microemulsion quenching was found to be more cost efficient and proportionally increasable in comparison with other preparation methods such as high pressure homogenization. These lipid nanoparticles, due to the combination of hard lipids with soft and/or liquid lipids, become good candidates for a wide range of medicaments as carriers for pharmaceutical and medicinal purposes.",

Each lipase was immobilized by three different protocols: hydrophobic adsorption, anionic exchange and multipoint covalent attachment. The highest synthetic yields were obtained with CALB adsorbed on hydrophobic supports (e.g., the commercial derivative Novozym 435).

Raman spectra contain characteristics of both lipids and cholesterol, liposomes do not change their initial phase state after drying.

The biosurfactant has an amphiphilic molecular structure, similar to that of ursodeoxycholate from bear gallbladder. Micelle formation from hyodeoxycholate was studied at 308.2\u00a0K using pyrene fluorescence probe to determine critical micelle concentrations (cmc) at various NaCl concentrations. The change in the fluorescence spectrum peak ratios with NaHDC concentration indicated two steps for bile salt aggregation. The first step was the formation of small micelles (cmc) at 5\u00a0mM, and the second step was the formation of stable aggregates at 14\u00a0mM in aqueous solution. The aggregation of hyodeoxycholate, analyzed using the stepwise association model, was found to grow its aggregation number from 4 to 7 with increasing concentration. The aggregation number in aqueous solution was also confirmed by the static light scattering method. The average measured aggregation number of the micelles was 6.7. The micellar size was relatively small as measured by either method, but it was covered by general aggregation number of human bile salts. The degree of counterion binding to the micelles, determined using a sodium ion-selective electrode, was ca. 0.5 for the NaHDC micelles. This value was relatively high among typical bile salts. Moreover, the solubilization capacity of the NaHDC micelles was assessed using cholesterol. It became clear that NaHDC micelles hardly solubilized cholesterol compared to typical human bile salts. The maximum solubilization by NaHDC was equivalent only to that by sodium ursodeoxycholate",

This method has been suggested, among other applications, for in situ synthesis of liposomes as drug delivery capsules. However, the mechanism that leads to a specific size selection of the liposomes in solution based self-assembly in general, and in flow-focussing microfluidic devices in particular, has so far not been established. Here we report two aspects of this problem. A simple and easily fabricated device for the synthesis of monodisperse unilamellar liposomes in a co-axial flow-focussing microfluidic geometry is presented. We also show that the size of liposomes is dependent on the extent of micro-convective mixing of the two miscible phases. Here, a viscosity stratification induced hydrodynamic instability leads to a gentle micro-mixing which results in larger liposome size than when the streams are mixed turbulently. The results are in sharp contrast to a purely diffusive mixing in macroscopic laminar flow that was believed to occur under these conditions. Further precise quantification of the mixing characteristics should provide the insights to develop a general theory for size selection for the class of ethanol injection methods. This will also lay grounds for obtaining empirical evidence that will enable better control of liposome sizes and for designing drug encapsulation and delivery devices.",

Although the substitution of terminal CF3 group for CH3 in OA had no effect on monolayer stability, further fluorination led to a gradual increase in monolayer stability at 25\u00a0\u030aC. Surface pressure\u2013area isotherm revealed that partially fluorinated OA analogs form more expanded monolayers than OA at low surface pressures, and that the monolayer behavior of OA analogs with the even-carbon numbered fluorinated chain is almost the same as that of OA upon monolayer compression, whereas the behavior of OA analogs with the odd-carbon numbered fluorinated chain significantly differs from that of OA. These results indicate: (i) the terminal short part (at least C2 residue) in OA predominantly determines the liquid-expanded monolayer stability; (ii) the molecular packing state of OA may be perturbed by the substitution of a short odd-carbon numbered fluorinated chain; (iii) hence, OA analogs with even-carbon numbered chain are considered to be preferable as hydrophobic building blocks for the synthesis of fluorinated phospholipids.",

In this review we have summarized our present knowledge of the biomedical potential of the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-HDA) and 2-octadecynoic acid (2-ODA) together with several mechanistic pieces of work attesting to the fact that these compounds, and their metabolites, are good fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitors. The antiprotozoal activity of 2-HDA and 2-ODA against Leishmania donovani and Plasmodium falciparum, parasites responsible for visceral leishmaniasis and malaria, respectively, is also reviewed. The evidence obtained so far supports the fact that these fatty acids are good inhibitors of the L. donovani DNA topoisomerase IB enzyme (LdTopIB) and the potency of LdTopIB inhibition is chain length dependent. We also demonstrate the generality of the antiprotozoal activity of 2-HDA and 2-ODA against P. falciparum, and review our present knowledge of their inhibition of key P. falciparum enzymes such as PfFabZ, PfFabG, and PfFabI together with some possible modes of inhibition. Recent research by our group has also demonstrated that 2-ODA displays antineoplastic activity, specifically against the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which is a cell death mechanism principally associated to necrosis. This is the first comprehensive review of the medicinal chemistry of this interesting group of acetylenic fatty acids.",

     "abstract": "Peripheral membrane proteins bound to lipids on bilayer surfaces play central roles in a wide array of cellular processes, including many signaling pathways. These proteins diffuse in the plane of the bilayer and often undergo complex reactions involving the binding of regulatory and substrate lipids and proteins they encounter during their 2D diffusion. Some peripheral proteins, for example pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, dock to the bilayer in a relatively shallow position with little penetration into the bilayer. Other peripheral proteins exhibit more complex bilayer contacts, for example classical protein kinase C isoforms (PKCs) bind as many as six lipids in stepwise fashion, resulting in the penetration of three PKC domains (C1A, C1B, C2) into the bilayer headgroup and hydrocarbon regions. A molecular understanding of the molecular features that control the diffusion speeds of proteins bound to supported bilayers would enable key molecular information to be extracted from experimental diffusion constants, revealing protein\u2013lipid and protein\u2013bilayer interactions difficult to study by other methods. The present study investigates a range of 11 different peripheral protein constructs comprised by 1\u20133 distinct domains (PH, C1A, C1B, C2, anti-lipid antibody). By combining these constructs with various combinations of target lipids, the study measures 2D diffusion constants on supported bilayers for 17 different protein\u2013lipid complexes. The resulting experimental diffusion constants, together with the known membrane interaction parameters of each complex, are used to analyze the molecular features correlated with diffusional slowing and bilayer friction. The findings show that both (1) individual bound lipids and (2) individual protein domains that penetrate into the hydrocarbon core make additive contributions to the friction against the bilayer, thereby defining the 2D diffusion constant. An empirical formula is developed that accurately estimates the diffusion constant and bilayer friction of a peripheral protein in terms of its number of bound lipids and its geometry of penetration into the bilayer hydrocarbon core, yielding an excellent global best fit (R2 of 0.97) to the experimental diffusion constants. Finally, the observed additivity of the frictional contributions suggests that further development of current theory describing bilayer dynamics may be needed. The present findings provide constraints that will be useful in such theory development.",

A significant number of mammalian phospholipases comprise a family of secreted PLA2 enzymes, found in specific tissues and cellular locations, exhibiting unique enzymatic properties and distinct biological functions. Development of new real-time spectrofluorimetric PLA2 assays should facilitate the kinetic characterization and mechanistic elucidation of the isozymes in vitro, with the potential applicability to detect and measure catalytic PLA2 activity in tissues and cellular locations. Here we report a new synthesis of double-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs with chain-terminal reporter groups including coumarin fluorophores for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based kinetic studies of PLA2 enzymes. The use of coumarin derivatives as fluorescent labels provides reporter groups with substantially decreased size compared to the first generation of donor\u2013acceptor pairs of fluorescent phospholipids. The key advantage of the design is to interfere less with the physicochemical properties of the acyl chains, thereby improving the substrate quality of the synthetic probes. In order to assess the impact of the fluorophore substituents on the catalytic hydrolysis and on the phospholipid packing in the lipid\u2013water interface of the assay, we used the experimentally determined specific activity of bee-venom phospholipase A2 as a model for the secretory PLA2 enzymes. Specifically, the rate of PLA2 hydrolysis of the coumarin labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs was less than three times slower than the natural substrate dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) under the same experimental conditions. Furthermore, variation of the mole fraction of the synthetic phosphatidylcholine vs. that of the natural DPPC substrate showed nearly ideal mixing behavior in the phospholipid\u2013surfactant aggregates of the assay. The synthesis provides a rapid and efficient method for preparation of new synthetic phosphatidylcholines with the desired target structures for enzymatic and physicochemical studies.",

We have investigated the dependence of bicellar properties on sialic acids using monosialo1 (GM1), disialo1b (GD1b) and trisialo1a (GT1a) gangliosides incorporated in phospholipid bicelles. TEM, AFM and DLS show that increasing numbers of sialic acid moieties per ganglioside results in an increase in bicelle size. DPH fluorescence anisotropy results suggest that with incorporation of gangliosides in bicelles the orientational order of the hydrocarbon chains increases. Fluorescence anisotropy was used to explore the effect of gangliosides on lateral phase separation in ganglioside enriched bicelles. GM1 and GT1a exhibited a low Tm melting domain (DMPC rich) and a high Tm melting domain (ganglioside rich). For GD1b containing bicelles, no significant phase separation was observed, suggesting a single homogeneous phase.

Studies of live cells and model membranes have yielded mechanisms responsible for the formation, growth, and maintenance of nanoscopic heterogeneities, although the existence and mechanisms that give rise to these heterogeneities remain controversial. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a tool ideally suited to interrogate lateral heterogeneity in model membranes, primarily due to its unique spatial resolution (i.e., ~5\u2013100\u00a0nm) and its ability to resolve structure with minimal perturbation to the membrane. In this review we examine several methods used to analyze the SANS signal arising from freely suspended unilamellar vesicles containing lateral heterogeneity. Specifically, we discuss an analytical model for a single, round domain on a spherical vesicle. We then discuss a numerical method that uses Monte Carlo simulation to describe systems with multiple domains and/or more complicated morphologies. Also discussed are several model-independent approaches that are sensitive to membrane heterogeneity.

This is for instance the case when discussing differences between the molecular behaviour under hydrostatic or hydration pressure, e.g. to characterise the structural and thermodynamic conditions that hold for the different theoretical approaches proposed in the literature.The stability of phospholipid aggregates in aqueous solutions is determined by a balance of attractive end repulsive forces as well as entropic and energetic interactions. The pressure-dependent variation of the frequency of molecular vibrations determined by FTIR spectroscopy might be an appropriate tool to study the nature of these interactions as well as of conformational changes for various degrees of hydrations. The paper reports preliminary results for the stretching and bending vibration of the CH2 groups that are mainly situated in the hydrocarbon chains. In a hydration range of about 2 water molecules per lipid in the case of DOPC and 6 water molecules for POPC, the pressure-dependent vibrations in the liquid crystalline phase change between red shift and blue shift. A further interesting parameter is the onset pressure for the correlation field splitting. It increases with dehydration, and it is assumed that the correlation field splitting does not only depend on the disorder related to the gauche conformer population in the hydrocarbon chains but also on the chain tilt in the gel phase.",

In order to assess if interactions between these inorganic pollutants and erythrocyte biomembranes may contribute to their chronic toxicity, we have used a Langmuir trough to probe the effect of HgCl2 and CdCl2 on the packing and elasticity properties of biomimetic lipid monolayers using different lipid mixtures. These lipid films were deposited at room temperature on a biologically relevant subphase (1\u00a0mM phosphate, 100\u00a0mM NaCl at pH 7.4) in the absence and presence of 100\u00a0\u03bcM HgCl2, CdCl2 and 1:1 mixtures thereof. The interactions of heavy metals with the lipids were monitored as changes in the surface pressure (\u03c0)\u2013area (A) isotherms. In addition, metal induced changes to the elastic properties of the model systems were analyzed by area and compressibility data of phosphatidylcholine (PC) systems containing 0, 15, 30, 45 and 100% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS). These mixtures revealed changes in lateral lipid packing as indicated by area expansion as well as enhanced film rigidity. The results demonstrate that both heavy metals affected the various lipid matrices, but metal mixtures showed the strongest impact. Based on these data, the adverse interaction of Hg2+ and Cd2+ with lipid bilayer membranes is identified as a feasible mechanism by which these toxic metals exert toxicity in mammalian cells. Interestingly, these metal interactions were found to depend on the lipid composition.",

The goal of our study was to quantitatively evaluate the melting characteristics of human meibum and model lipid mixtures using differential scanning microcalorimetry. Standard calorimetric parameters, e.g. changes in calorimetric enthalpy, transition temperatures Tm, cooperativity of melting, etc. were assessed. We found that thermotropic behavior of meibum resembled that of relatively simple mixtures of unsaturated wax esters, but showed a lower change in calorimetric enthalpy, which can be indicative of a looser packing of lipids in meibum compared with pure standards and their simple mixtures. The cooperativity of melting of meibomian lipids was comparable to that of an equimolar mixture of four oleic-acid based wax esters. We demonstrated that the phase transitions in meibum start at about 10\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C and end at 35\u201336\u00a0\u00b0C, with Tm being about 30\u00a0\u00b0C.

The solutions decay in a non-monotonic fashion with one single observable minimum. A solution for planar geometry may either be explicitly constructed or obtained by letting the radius of the cylinder go to infinity. In dimensionless units the initial derivative of the thickness profile is universal and equal to \u2212 1 / 2 . In physical units, the derivative depends on the size of the hydrophobic mismatch as well as the membrane correlation length and will usually be fairly small but clearly non-zero. The line tension between the protein inclusion and a fluid phase membrane will depend on the hydrophobic mismatch and be of the order of 10\u00a0pN (larger for the gel phase).

     "abstract": "The signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) is believed to interact specifically with membrane-bound globular proteins through a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bond formation known as the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch. PA, which adjusts its protonation state according to the ambient pH, is able to regulate protein binding under physiological conditions in a pH-dependent manner. We investigate the question to what extent the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch contributes to the pH-sensitivity of protein binding. To this end, we propose a theoretical model for the adsorption of a basic protein on a zwitterionic membrane that contains phosphatidic acid as a minor component. Our model is based on an extended continuum Poisson\u2013Boltzmann approach that accounts for zwitterionic lipids, the protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of PA, and the lateral mobility of the lipids in the membrane. The electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch enters as an additional non-electrostatic attractive interaction of deprotonated PA with basic protein residues. For a generic model protein we calculate the adsorption free energy and its pH-dependence. Our results suggest that the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch not only increases the affinity between PA and the protein but also its sensitivity with respect to changes in pH. That is, the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch helps enabling the membrane to use physiological pH changes in order to trigger protein adsorption/desorption.",

Among the assumptions underlying this use is that all relevant protein\u2013lipid interactions can be included in the continuum representation of the protein\u2013bilayer interactions through the physical parameters determined for protein-free bilayers and the choice of boundary conditions at the protein/bilayer interface. To better understand this assumption, we review the general structure of CEMs, examine how different choices of boundary conditions and physical moduli profiles alter the predicted bilayer thickness profiles around gramicidin A (gA) and mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), respectively, and compare these profiles with those obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the profiles differ qualitatively in the first lipid shell around the channels, indicating that the CEMs do not capture accurately the consequences of the protein-induced local changes in lipid bilayer dynamics. Therefore, one needs to be careful when interpreting the results of CEM-based analyses of lipid bilayer-membrane protein interactions.",

     "abstract": "Many observations of the role of the membrane in the function and organization of transmembrane (TM) proteins have been explained in terms of hydrophobic mismatch between the membrane and the inserted protein. For a quantitative investigation of this mechanism in the lipid\u2013protein interactions of functionally relevant conformations adopted by a multi-TM segment protein, the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), we employed a novel method, Continuum-Molecular Dynamics (CTMD), that quantifies the energetics of hydrophobic mismatch by combining the elastic continuum theory of membrane deformations with an atomistic level description of the radially asymmetric membrane\u2013protein interface from MD simulations. LeuT has been serving as a model for structure\u2013function studies of the mammalian neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), such as the dopamine and serotonin transporters, which are the subject of intense research in the field of neurotransmission. The membrane models in which LeuT was embedded for these studies were composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid, or 3:1 mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) lipids. The results show that deformation of the host membrane alone is not sufficient to alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch at specific residues of LeuT. The calculations reveal significant membrane thinning and water penetration due to the specific local polar environment produced by the charged K288 of TM7 in LeuT, that is membrane-facing deep inside the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane. This significant perturbation is shown to result in unfavorable polar\u2013hydrophobic interactions at neighboring hydrophobic residues in TM1a and TM7. We show that all the effects attributed to the K288 residue (membrane thinning, water penetration, and the unfavorable polar\u2013hydrophobic interactions at TM1a and TM7), are abolished in calculations with the K288A mutant. The involvement of hydrophobic mismatch is somewhat different in the functionally distinct conformations (outward-open, occluded, inward-open) of LeuT, and the differences are shown to connect to structural elements (e.g., TM1a) known to play key roles in transport. This finding suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for the enhanced transport activity observed for the K288A mutant, suggesting that the unfavorable hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic interactions hinder the motion of TM1a in the functionally relevant conformational transition to the inward-open state. Various extents of such unfavorable interactions, involving exposure to the lipid environment of adjacent hydrophobic and polar residues, are common in multi-segment transmembrane proteins, and must be considered to affect functionally relevant conformational transitions.",

Binding of the synthetic agonist UK432097 disrupts hydrogen bonding between Trp129 and Ser47, which activates the rotameric dynamics of Trp129 and disrupts the interaction with one of the two cholesterols. We also investigate the effect of four thermostabilizing mutations, three of which are located on helix two. The conformational stability of helix two has been proposed to be sensitive to interaction with cholesterol in the CCM, suggesting a mechanism for the thermostabilization.

This bundle forms the ligand binding pocket into which ligands are commonly thought to enter via the extracellular milieu. This ligand approach direction makes sense for GPCRs that have small positively charged ligands, such as the beta-2-adrenergic or the dopamine D2 receptor. However, there is a growing sub-group of Class A GPCRs that bind lipid-derived endogenous ligands, such as the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors (with endogenous ligands, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) and sn-2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG)) and the S1P1\u20135 receptors (with endogenous ligand, sphingosine-1-phosphate). Even the widely studied Class A GPCR, rhodopsin, binds a highly lipophillic chromophore (11-cis-retinal). For these receptors, ligand approach from the extracellular milieu has seemed unlikely given that the ligands of these receptors readily partition into lipid or are actually synthesized in the lipid bilayer. The recent X-ray-crystal structure of the sub-type 1 sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P1) provides important information on the key structural variations that may be the hallmarks for a Class A GPCR that binds lipid-derived ligands. These include an extracellular domain that is closed off to the extracellular milieu and the existence of an opening between transmembrane helices that may serve as a portal for ligand entry via the lipid bilayer. This review examines structural aspects that the cannabinoid receptors may share with the S1P1 receptor based upon sequence homology. This review also examines experimental and simulation results that suggest ligand entry via a lipid portal is quite likely for this emerging sub-group.",

Here, we conduct six 500-ns simulations of a system with >600,000 atoms to investigate the spontaneous self assembly of dodecylphosphocholine detergent around multiple molecules of the integral membrane protein PagP. This detergent formed equatorial micelles in which acyl chains surround the protein's hydrophobic belt, confirming existing models of the detergent solvation of membrane proteins. In addition, unexpectedly, the extracellular and periplasmic apical surfaces of PagP interacted with the headgroups of detergents in other micelles 85 and 60% of the time, respectively, forming complexes that were stable for hundreds of nanoseconds. In some cases, an apical surface of one molecule of PagP interacted with an equatorial micelle surrounding another molecule of PagP. In other cases, the apical surfaces of two molecules of PagP simultaneously bound a neat detergent micelle. In these ways, detergents mediated the non-specific aggregation of folded PagP. These simulation results are consistent with dynamic light scattering experiments, which show that, at detergent concentrations \u2265600\u00a0mM, PagP induces the formation of large scattering species that are likely to contain many copies of the PagP protein.

Based on simulations of an asymmetric bacterial ion channel in a POPC bilayer, we demonstrate how 3D-resolved pressure can probe for both short-range and long-range effects from the protein on the membrane environment. We also show how surface tension is a sensitive metric for inter-leaflet equilibrium and can be used to detect even subtle imbalances between bilayer leaflets in a membrane-protein simulation. Since surface tension is known to modulate the function of many proteins, this effect is an important consideration for predictions of ion channel function.

Specifically, we link \u03c7 with other structural, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties of cholesterol-containing lipid membranes, and delineate how this useful parameter can be obtained from the sterol tilt probability distributions derived from relatively small-scale unbiased MD simulations. We demonstrate how the tilt modulus quantitatively describes the aligning field that sterol molecules create inside the phospholipid bilayers, and we relate \u03c7 to the bending rigidity of the lipid bilayer through effective tilt and splay energy contributions to the elastic deformations. Moreover, we show how \u03c7 can conveniently characterize the \u201ccondensing effect\u201d of cholesterol on phospholipids. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of this cholesterol aligning field to the proper folding and interactions of membrane peptides.

     "abstract": "Liposomes required for drug delivery are commonly obtained by extrusion of phospholipid vesicle suspensions through track-etched membranes. The effects of trans-membrane pressure, membrane pore size and bilayer composition on extruded liposome size are well-studied. Vesicle suspensions used in these extrusion studies are highly polydisperse, ranging from 20\u00a0nm to 100\u00a0\u03bcm. Vesicle sub-populations smaller than membrane pore size do not undergo extrusion-mediated size reduction and contribute significantly to the mean radius of extruded liposomes. In the present work, giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are isolated by subjecting electroformed vesicle suspensions to low-pressure filtration. The isolated GUVs are extruded through track-etched polycarbonate membranes with pore radii ranging from 25 to 200\u00a0nm. We show that, when vesicles larger than the membrane pore size are extruded, the minimum attainable value of mean radius of resulting liposomes is independent of initial vesicle size as well as the number of extrusion cycles. We also show that bilayer composition significantly influences the extruded liposome size. These results provide new insights into the possible mechanisms of vesicle size reduction during extrusion process.",

     "abstract": "Membrane lipid composition and morpho-functional parameters were investigated in circulating cells of the edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) affected by disseminated neoplasia (neoplastic cells) and compared to those from healthy cockles (hemocytes). Membrane sterol levels, phospholipid (PL) class and subclass proportions and their respective fatty acid (FA) compositions were determined. Morpho-functional parameters were evaluated through total hemocyte count (THC), mortality rate, phagocytosis ability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both morpho-functional parameters and lipid composition were profoundly affected in neoplastic cells. These dedifferentiated cells displayed higher THC (5\u00d7), mortality rate (3\u00d7) and ROS production with addition of carbonyl cyanide m-chloro phenylhydrazone (1.7\u00d7) but lower phagocytosis ability (\u00bd\u00d7), than unaffected hemocytes. Total PL amounts were higher in neoplastic cells than in hemocytes (12.3 and 5.1\u00a0nmol\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-6 cells, respectively). However, sterols and a particular subclass of PL (plasmalogens; 1-alkenyl-2-acyl PL) were present in similar amounts in both cell type membranes. This led to a two times lower proportion of these membrane lipid constituents in neoplastic cells when compared to hemocytes (20.5% vs. 42.1% of sterols in total membrane lipids and 21.7% vs. 44.2% of plasmalogens among total PL, respectively). Proportions of non-methylene interrupted FA- and 20:1n-11-plasmalogen molecular species were the most impacted in neoplastic cells when compared to hemocytes (\u2153\u00d7 and \u00bc\u00d7, respectively). These changes in response to this leukemia-like disease in bivalves highlight the specific imbalance of plasmalogens and sterols in neoplastic cells, in comparison to the greater stability of other membrane lipid components.",

The products were resolved by HPLC and the regio and stereo-chemistry of the transformations were determined through a combination of 1H NMR and GC\u2013MS analysis of dimethoxypropane derivatives. Four trihydroxy isomers were identified upon mild acid hydrolysis of 9S,10S-trans-epoxy-11E-13S-hydroxyoctadecenoate: 9S,10R,13S, 9S,12R,13S, 9S,10S,13S and 9S,12S,13S-trihydroxy-octadecenoic acids, in the ratio 40:26:22:12.

Escherichia coli contains a small archetypal inner membrane multidrug resistance protein, EmrE, that must multimerize to be functional but this multimerization is difficult to demonstrate in vivo. We studied three major E. coli lipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin) that varied in head group structure, acyl chain length and saturation. These were investigated both in the presence and absence of EmrE to determine which lipid(s) EmrE influenced most strongly. Langmuir monolayers and Brewster angle microscopy demonstrated that varying each head group, acyl chain length and saturation contributed to differences in membrane packing and affected lipid\u2013protein associations. Long unsaturated anionic lipids were influenced most strongly by EmrE. Shorter acyl chains initiated string-like formations of EmrE clusters, whereas longer chains contributed to enhance protein clustering. Longer partially unsaturated acyl chains in phosphatidylglycerol showed a significant surface pressure decrease in the presence of the protein, indicating that the monolayer was destabilized. Interestingly, longer unsaturated chains of cardiolipin formed the most stable monolayer in the presence of EmrE. These studies indicate cardiolipin acyl chains that hydrophobically match protein helical lengths stabilize EmrE structural forms.",

The ability of the cyclic cationic antimicrobial peptide arenicin, Ar-1, and its novel and highly efficient linear derivative, C/S-Ar-1, to interact with 2D model membranes (POPC, DPPC, POPG, and DPPG) has been studied. Different phospholipid monolayers at the air\u2013buffer interface, as simple and easy to manipulate models of the membrane surface, were used for these studies. The equilibrium adsorption pressure of both peptides depends on the charge of the lipid head group as well as on the lipid packing density (the largest value is observed for POPG). Only in the case of DPPG, the original Ar-1 penetrates much faster into the DPPG monolayer compared to the linear derivative C/S-Ar-1. Additionally, C/S-Ar-1 has been injected under lipid layers compressed to different starting pressures. In this way, the maximum insertion pressure (MIP) has been determined. Only for the negatively charged POPG, the MIP is clearly above the commonly accepted membrane pressure values, whereas they are between 30 and 34\u00a0mN/m for the zwitterionic lipids and the condensed DPPG. The results point to the importance of the membrane charge and fluidity. Electrostatic interactions can be clearly enhanced by hydrophobic ones.",

     "abstract": "Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) is an active participant of inflammation. The enzyme destroys bacterial cell wall and induces production of biologically active lipid mediators. It is involved in various pathological processes and high serum content and activity of sPLA2-IIA are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Study of sPLA2-IIA regulation is of great physiological and clinical importance and is necessary for better understanding of mechanisms underlying inflammation. Another major participant of inflammatory response is the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which is secreted by neutrophils in the focus of inflammation and catalyzes formation of HOCl and HOBr. Both halogenated (chloro- and bromohydrins) and oxidized lipids are formed due to interaction between HOCl and HOBr with unsaturated bonds of phospholipid acyl chains. Previously we showed that oxidized phospholipids stimulate sPLA2-IIA activity. In this study we examined the effects of chloro- and bromohydrins of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) on sPLA2-IIA activity.In contrast to POPC, chloro- and bromohydrins of POPC (POPC-Cl and POPC-Br, respectively) were not hydrolyzed by sPLA2-IIA. In addition, phospholipids which are sPLA2-IIA substrates, were not cleaved by the enzyme in the presence of POPC-Cl and POPC-Br. Halogenohydrins of POPC prevented the activity of both purified and serum sPLA2-IIA. Blocking effects of POPC-Cl and POPC-Br were abolished by increased concentrations of phospholipid-substrate.These results suggest that halogenated phospholipids formed in MPO-dependent reactions can be considered as a new class of biologically active compounds potentially capable of regulating sPLA2-IIA activity in the areas of inflammation and producing the effects opposite to those of oxidized phospholipids. Control over sPLA2-IIA can be useful in the therapy of diseases involving systemic inflammation.",

In accordance with chemical analysis of cholesterol level, the total cellular signal of this probe was decreased to half. Distribution of lifetime (\u03c4tot) values of 22-NBD-cholesterol, however, when screened over the whole cell area indicated no significant difference between control (\u03c4tot\u00a0=\u00a04.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ns) and \u03b2-CDX-treated (\u03c4tot\u00a0=\u00a04.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0ns) cells.

     "abstract": "The molecular mechanism of ethanol and its effects on neurological function is far from clear. In this study, we investigate the effects of ethanol on various structural and dynamical properties of mixed bilayers consisting of different ratios of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol that are typical constituents of neural cell membranes (Calderon et al., 1995) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The bilayer properties such as thickness, hydrophobic chain order, and diffusive motion of individual lipids as well collective properties like lateral pressure profiles are affected by the presence of ethanol molecules. The simulations show that the percentage of cholesterol present in the bilayers significantly affects the depth of penetration of ethanol molecules. In particular, presence of very high concentration of cholesterol molecules enhances the rigidity of the bilayer and renders them resistant to the penetration of the ethanol molecules, consistent with experiments. Ethanol molecules compete with cholesterol molecules for hydrogen bonding and disrupt cholesterol\u2013lipid interactions, especially those between SM and cholesterol. Ethanol molecules also affect the lateral pressure profiles in the bilayer systems. These results may have implications in understanding the general anesthetic mechanism and role played by cholesterol on partitioning of such anesthetic/alcohol molecules into cell membranes.",

Moreover, the aggregates/droplets appear enriched in the hydrolytic enzyme PlcHR2. At a final stage GUVs containing the enzyme-enriched droplets disintegrate and vanish from the microscope field.

     "abstract": "Lateral diffusion is a fundamental property of biological membrane components, important for a host of biomembrane functions. Although long studied, novel aspects of the relationship between the structure of membrane components and their lateral diffusion properties continue to emerge. NMR-based lateral diffusion measurements are complicated by the spectral broadening arising from the slow anisotropic motions in membranes. Nevertheless, both pulsed field gradient (PFG) and exchange spectroscopy (EXSY) methods can be adapted to permit NMR measurements of lateral diffusion in membranes. These variously will be described in overview, highlighting advantages and limitations of each, but with particular emphasis on results from our laboratory using 1H PFG NMR measurements in magnetically aligned bicelles and 31P CODEX (Centreband-Only-Detection-of-Exchange) measurements in spherical phospholipid vesicles.",

     "abstract": "Lipid composition and properties play an important role in many cellular properties such as fusion of vesicles to cell membranes, an essential process for exocytosis. Using a model system composed of artificial vesicles (liposomes) and artificial membranes (planar lipid bilayers), we observed that fusion is significantly affected by the lipid phase of the planar membrane. To determine the effect of lipid phases on fusion rates, we utilized the nystatin/ergosterol fusion assay and stimulated fusion with an osmotic gradient. Phase of the planar membrane was altered by changing cholesterol or temperature while the vesicular lipids were held constant. Liquid disordered (Ld or L\u03b1) planar membranes were formed from phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine with unsaturated acyl chains. Addition of cholesterol shifts these membranes to the liquid ordered (Lo) phase and increases liposome fusion. Planar membranes in the L\u03b1 phase were also made from dipalmitoylphoshatidylcholine (DPPC) above the transition temperature (Tm) of 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C. Decreasing the temperature below Tm shifts these membranes into the ripple phase (P\u03b2\u2032) and also increases liposome fusion. The cholesterol and temperature data are consistent with the hypothesis that fusion is promoted in membranes that have greater exposure of their lipid tails or in membranes which can form leaflet domains with negative curvature. The data are not consistent with the hypothesis that lipid mismatch drives fusion.",

The formation of C18:2-9t,12t had two barriers; the first of which was the formation of C18:2-9c,12t or C18:2-9t,12c. Zero-point energy corrections of each isomer was calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G** level. The intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRCs) were obtained to examine the transition states and intermediates.

Additionally, electrochemical measurements comprising membrane potential and diffusive permeability were carried out to detect modifications in transport properties of the cuticle as the fruit primary protective membrane. It has been found that low dose \u03b3-irradiation causes some textural changes on the surface but no significant chemical modification. Texture modification is found to be due to a partial removal of outermost (epicuticular) waxes which is accompanied by mild changes of electrochemical parameters such as the membrane fixed charge, cation transport number and salt permeability.

The Langmuir isotherms show formation of monolayers by all three molecules. However, the isotherms for mixed monolayers suggest that two components are largely immiscible to the mixing lipid.

A combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmittance spectrophotometry was used. Small amounts of F-DPPC increase the pretransition temperature (Tp) between the interdigitated gel phase (L\u03b2I) and the ripple gel phase (P\u03b2\u2032). There are some signs of immiscibility where the non-interdigitated lipid is present in the phase diagram. However, at around 20\u00a0mol.% F-DPPC, the pretransition merges with the main transition and is no longer detectable as a separate entity. Additionally, the Tm hysteresis increases steadily with higher mole fractions of F-DPPC. These results support that incorporating F-DPPC progressively stabilizes the L\u03b2I phase of DHPC until the membrane is fully interdigitated below the main transition temperature (Tm). The mixtures of F-DPPC and DHPC are miscible once the membrane is entirely interdigitated in the gel phase. Therefore, the ability of both lipids to interdigitate is an important factor controlling gel phase miscibility. Our results also demonstrate that the gel phase behavior of DHPC is highly sensitive to changes in its environment.",

     "abstract": "Highly charged vesicles of the saturated anionic lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) in low ionic strength medium exhibit a very peculiar thermo-structural behavior. Along a wide gel\u2013fluid transition region, DMPG dispersions display several anomalous characteristics, like low turbidity, high electrical conductivity and viscosity. Here, static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS) were used to characterize DMPG vesicles at different temperatures. Similar experiments were performed with the largely studied zwitterionic lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). SLS and DLS data yielded similar dimensions for DMPC vesicles at all studied temperatures. However, for DMPG, along the gel\u2013fluid transition region, SLS indicated a threefold increase in the vesicle radius of gyration, whereas the hydrodynamic radius, as obtained from DLS, increased 30% only. Despite the anomalous increase in the radius of gyration, DMPG lipid vesicles maintain isotropy, since no light depolarization was detected. Hence, SLS data are interpreted regarding the presence of isotropic vesicles within the DMPG anomalous transition, but highly perforated vesicles, with large holes. DLS/SLS discrepancy along the DMPG transition region is discussed in terms of the interpretation of the Einstein\u2013Stokes relation for porous vesicles. Therefore, SLS data are shown to be much more appropriate for measuring porous vesicle dimensions than the vesicle diffusion coefficient. The underlying nanoscopic process which leads to the opening of pores in charged DMPG bilayer is very intriguing and deserves further investigation. One could envisage biotechnological applications, with vesicles being produced to enlarge and perforate in a chosen temperature and/or pH value.",

AFM has proved an invaluable technique for visualizing the topographic characteristics of phospholipid monolayers and bilayers, such as roughness, height or laterally segregated domains.

     "abstract": "The line tension (\u03bb) in biphasic membranes has been determined in monolayers and bilayers using a variety of techniques. In this work we present a novel approach to the determination of \u03bb in monolayers with liquid/liquid phase coexistence, overcoming several of the drawbacks of current techniques. Using our method, we determined the line tension of liquid/liquid phases in binary mixtures of different lipids and a molecule similar to cholesterol but less oxidizable. We analyzed the effect of the hydrocarbon chain length and the polar head-group of the non-sterol lipid and found the latter to exert much more influence than the former. The presence of PE led to high \u03bb values, PG to low values and PS and PC to intermediate values. The line tension showed a strong correlation with the critical packing parameter of the phospholipid. The spontaneous curvature displayed by the phases constituted by a particular lipid appears to be an important parameter for determining the line tension in mixed films.",

     "abstract": "This work presents a biophysical study on the interactions of a monorhamnolipid (monoRL) produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa MA01 with model phosphatidylcholine membranes. The molecular characterization of the biological activities, including the modulation of phospholipid membranes structure, of this monoRL biosurfactant is of importance for the validation of this particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain as a useful biosurfactant producer. The marked amphiphilic structure of monoRL is expected to result in strong interactions with the phospholipid constituents of membrane bilayers. Incorporation of monoRL into DMPC completely abolished the pretransition, and the main gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition was progressively broadened and shifted to lower temperatures, as observed by differential scanning calorimetry. Partial phase diagrams for DPPC and DSPC indicated near-ideal behavior. However, the DMPC diagram indicated fluid phase immiscibility. X-ray diffraction showed and apparent increase in d-value for DPPC containing monoRL, which might be the result of an effective increase in the bilayer thickness, or in the thickness of the hydration layer between bilayers. FTIR indicated that interaction of monoRL with the phospholipid acyl chains did not result in a large additional disordering of the acyl chain region of the fluid bilayer. Analysis of the CO stretching band of DPPC indicated an important effect of monoRL on the interfacial region of phosphatidylcholine bilayers, which might contribute to explain some of the biological activities of this glycolipid.",

A kinetic model was derived from a simple mechanistic scheme, in which initiation is due to hydroperoxides decomposition, whereas propagation results from the abstraction of the most labile hydrogen and termination results only from the bimolecular combination of peroxyl radicals. Analysis of induction period duration indicated that hydroperoxides mainly decompose by a bimolecular process. The model well predicts the main features of the experimental chemiluminescence curves.

We report here on a sensitive, high-throughput and reliable cell-based method to separately measure each SMS activity and to screen for SMS-specific inhibitors, using HPLC and fluorescent ceramide (Cer) analogs. We isolated SMS-null cells and stably transfected them with SMS1 or SMS2. Using these cells, individual SMS activities could be measured separately. Fluorescent Cer, SM, and glucosylceramide analogs could be separated within 4\u00a0min by HPLC using an NH2 column. SMS activities of SMS1- or SMS2-expressing cells seeded in a single well of a 96-well plate could be measured using HPLC and fluorescent Cer analogs. This method clearly demonstrated that treatment of the cells with their respective siRNA or D609, an inhibitor of SMS, resulted in a significant decrease in each SMS activity.

Recent studies clearly indicate that amyloid cytotoxicity is provoked by a continuum of cross-\u03b2-sheet aggregates including mature fibrils. In view of the possible diversity of cytotoxicity mechanisms, the present study addressed the question of whether protein conversion into amyloid fibrils can modify its competitive membrane adsorption behavior. Using a combination of resonance energy transfer, dynamic light scattering and fluorescence quenching techniques, the competitive binding of either monomeric or polymerized lysozyme, and cytochrome c to the model lipid membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine mixtures with varying proportions of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin has been studied. The ability of fibrillar lysozyme to induce dissociation of cytochrome c from the membrane binding sites proved to be markedly stronger than that of its monomeric counterpart, with desorption process displaying cooperativity features upon increasing the charge of lipid bilayer. The decreased efficiency of tryptophan fluorescence quenching by acrylamide and short-wavelength shift of emission maximum observed upon membrane binding of lysozyme fibrils were rationalized in terms of fluorophore transfer into interfacial bilayer region. It is hypothesized that electrostatic interactions play predominant role in determining the lipid-associating and competitive abilities of fibrillar lysozyme.",

In the present paper, the transphosphatidylation reaction catalyzed by phospholipase D (PLD) from Streptomyces sp. has been proven as an alternative enzyme-assisted strategy for the synthesis of new CL analogs. The formation of this type of compounds from phosphatidylcholine was compared for a series of N- and C2-substituted ethanolamine derivatives as well as non-charged alcohols such as glycerol and ethylene glycol. The rapid exchange of the choline head group by ethanolamine derivatives having a low molecular volume (diethanolamine and serinol) gave rise to an efficient production of the corresponding CL analogs. In contrast, the yields were comparably low in the reaction with bulky nitrogenous acceptor alcohols (triethanolamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tetrakis(hydroxyethyl)ammonium) or the non-charged alcohols. Therefore, a strong dependence of the conversion of the monophosphatidyl to the diphosphatidyl compound on steric parameters and the head group charge was concluded.

In this work, we studied the mixing behavior of C10:0 Cer, which has the N-acyl chain shorter than that of the sphingosine acyl chain and displays an expanded to condensed phase transition at 25\u00a0mN\u00a0m\u22121 at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, with ceramides N-acylated with longer fatty acyl chains C12:0, C14:0 and C18:0. The N-acyl chain length determined the miscibility of ceramides in Langmuir monolayers, as it was ascertained by the dependence of the mean molecular area, perpendicular dipole moment, surface topography and film thickness with the mixture composition. We found that, as the hydrophobic mismatch in ceramides increased complete miscibility, partial or complete immiscibility can occur.",

     "abstract": "Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are widely used as model systems to study both, lipid and membrane protein behavior. During their preparation by the commonly applied electroformation method, a number of issues must be considered to avoid the production of artifacts due to a poor lipid hydration and protein degradation. Here we focus on the effect of preparation temperature on GUVs composed of the most commonly used domain-forming mixture dioleoylelphospatidylcholine/shingomyelin/cholesterol (DOPC/SM/chol) (2/2/1). Lower production temperatures are generally preferable when aiming at a functional reconstitution of proteins into the membrane. On the other hand, lower growth temperature is suspected to alter the lipid composition and the yield of phase-separating vesicles. By confocal imaging, we find that vesicles prepared significantly above and below the melting temperature Tm have the same overall morphology, similar size distributions of vesicles and a similar area coverage by liquid-ordered (Lo) domains. However, a large population analysis indeed reveals a different overall yield of phase-separating vesicles. Two-focus scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements did not show any divergence of lipid analog mobility in (Lo) and (Ld) phases in vesicles prepared at different temperatures, indicating that the lowered growth temperature did not influence the lipid organization within the two phases. Moreover, the expected advantages of lower preparation temperature for proteo-GUVs could be exemplified by the reconstitution of voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) into DOPC/SM/chol GUVs, which aggregates at high, but not at low preparation temperatures.",

     "abstract": "Peroxidation of lipids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid residues (PUFA) of phospholipids and cholesterol esters, is a process of marked implications: it shortens the shelf-life of food and drugs, it causes fragmentation of DNA, it damages cellular membranes and it promotes the genesis of many human diseases. Much effort is therefore devoted to a search for \u201cpotent antioxidants\u201d, both synthetic and from natural sources, mostly plants.This, in turn, requires a reliable, simple, preferably high throughput assay of the activity of alleged antioxidants. The most commonly used assays are based on measurements of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of a solution, as evaluated either by determining the rate of oxidation of the antioxidant or by measuring the protection of an easily determined indicator against oxidation by the antioxidants.The commonly used assays utilized for ranking antioxidants share three common problems:(i) They usually evaluate the effects of those antioxidants that quench free radicals, which constitute only a part of the body's antioxidative network, in which enzymes play the central role. (ii) Both the capacity and potency of antioxidants, as obtained by various methods, do not necessarily correlate with each other. (iii) Most estimates are based on methods conducted in solution and are therefore not necessarily relevant to processes that occur at the lipid\u2013water interfaces in both membranes and micro emulsions (e.g. lipoproteins).Given this \u201cstate of art\u201d, many researchers, including us, try to develop a method based on the formation of hydroperoxides (LOOH) upon peroxidation of PUFA in lipoproteins or in model membranes, such as liposomes. In these systems, as well as in lipoproteins, the most apparent effect of antioxidants is prolongation of the lag time preceding the propagation of a free radical chain reaction. In fact, under certain conditions both water soluble antioxidants (e.g. vitamin C and urate) and the lipid soluble antioxidant tocopherol (vitamin E), promote or even induce peroxidation.Based on the published data, including our results, we conclude that terms such as \u2018antioxidative capacity\u2019 or \u2018antioxidative potency\u2019 are context-dependent. Furthermore, criteria of the efficacy of antioxidants based on oxidation in solution are not necessarily relevant to the effects of antioxidants on peroxidation in biological systems or model lipid assemblies, because the latter processes occur at water/lipid interfaces.We think that evaluation of antioxidants requires kinetic studies of the biomarker used and that the most relevant characteristic of \u2018oxidative stress\u2019 in the biological context is the kinetics of ex vivo peroxidation of lipids. We therefore propose studying the kinetics of lipid-peroxidation in the absence of the studied antioxidant and in its presence at different antioxidant concentrations. These protocols mean that antioxidants are assayed by methods commonly used to evaluate oxidative stress. The advantage of such evaluation is that it enables quantization of the antioxidants\u2019 efficacy in a model of relevance to biological systems. In view of the sensitivity of the lag time preceding peroxidation, we propose studying how much antioxidant is required to double the lag observed prior to rapid peroxidation. The latter quantity (C2lag) can be used to express the strength of antioxidants in the relevant system (e.g. LDL, serum or liposomes).",

Accordingly, the extent of variation in tetraether structures revealed by the work should direct more informative interpretations of lipid profiles in the future.

In addition, these reactions are interacted and influenced by various impact factors such as frying oil type, frying conditions (time, temperature, fryer, etc.) and fried material type. Based on the published literatures, three main organic chemical reaction mechanisms namely hemolytic, heterolytic and concerted reaction were identified and supposed to elucidate the complex chemical alterations during deep-fat frying.

     "abstract": "Lipid peroxidation is a common feature of many chemical and biological processes, and is governed by a complex kinetic scheme. A fundamental stage in kinetic investigations of lipid peroxidation is the accurate determination of the rate of peroxidation, which in many instances is heavily reliant on the method of finite differences. Such numerical approximations of the first derivative are commonly employed in commercially available software, despite suffering from considerable inaccuracy due to rounding and truncation errors. As a simple solution to this, we applied three empirical sigmoid functions (viz. the Prout\u2013Tompkins, Richards & Gompertz functions) to data obtained from the AAPH-mediated peroxidation of aqueous linoleate liposomes in the presence of increasing concentrations of Trolox, evaluating the curve fitting parameters using the widely available Microsoft Excel Solver add-in. We have demonstrated that the five-parameter Richards\u2019 function provides an excellent model for this peroxidation, and when applied to the determination of fundamental rate constants, produces results in keeping with those available in the literature. Overall, we present a series of equations, derived from the Richards\u2019 function, which enables direct evaluation of the kinetic measures of peroxidation. This procedure has applicability not only to investigations of lipid peroxidation, but to any system exhibiting sigmoid kinetics.",

Given the purity of the currently commercially available synthetic and isolated natural lipids, we have observed that determination of the dry weight of lipid stock solutions provides the fastest, most accurate, and generic method to assay their concentrations. The protocol described here takes advantage of the high resolution and accuracy obtained by modern weighing technology. We assayed by this technique the concentrations of a number of phosphatidylcholine samples, with different degrees of acyl chain saturation and length, and in different organic solvents. The results were compared with those from Bartlett assay, 31P NMR, and Langmuir compression isotherms. The data obtained show that the gravimetric assay yields lipid concentrations with a resolution similar or better than obtained by the other techniques.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is an important lipidic signaling molecule that is involved in a broad range of cellular processes. Its interaction with proteins and its lateral distribution are governed by the ionization state of the phosphomonoester groups and its ability to form intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study we have investigated the ionization state of PI(4,5)P2 in ternary lipid vesicle systems that contain in addition to PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylcholine (PC) either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol (PI). In the presence of PE we find an increased ionization of PI(4,5)P2, which can be attributed to increased deprotonation due to hydrogen bond formation between PE and the PI(4,5)P2 phosphomonoester groups. However, the effect of PE on PI(4,5)P2 ionization is significantly smaller than it had been found previously for phosphatidic acid in the presence of PE (Kooijman et al., 2005). The reduced impact of PE on PI(4,5)P2 ionization can be attributed to competing intramolecular hydrogen bond formation between the phosphomonoester groups and neighboring hydroxyl groups. It is noteworthy that the presence of PE affects more strongly the ionization of the 5-phosphate group than that of the 4-phosphate, suggesting that the interaction of PE with the 5-phosphate is stronger. In PI(4,5)P2/PS/PC lipid vesicles, the presence of PS was expected to yield an increased protonation of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphomonoester groups due to a decreased interfacial pH as a result of the increased negative interfacial charge. However, the effect of PS on PI(4,5)P2 ionization is only minor, potentially suggesting that PS and PI(4,5)P2 are demixed. The PI(4,5)P2/PI/PC vesicle system was characterized by a surprising mixing behavior that has potentially far reaching consequences: fluorescence microscopy measurements of giant unilammellar vesicles composed of PI(4,5)P2/PI/PC at physiological concentrations show that PI and PI(4,5)P2 form macroscopic, fluid phase domains in contact with a fluid PC rich phase (fluid/fluid demixing). Despite the fact that PI and PI(4,5)P2 co-localize, the effect of PI on PI(4,5)P2 ionization behavior is only noticeable above pH 7. Apparently two opposing effects lead to the observed behavior: Due to the presence of the anionic PI, the interfacial pH drops, which is expected to lead to an enhanced protonation of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphomonoester groups. In turn, hydrogen bond formation between PI and PI(4,5)P2 would lead to the opposite, i.e. increased deprotonation of the phosphomonoester group. Apparently these two effects compensate each other for pH values smaller than about 7, while for higher pH values the increased interfacial pH in the presence of PI has a stronger impact than PI/PI(4,5)P2 hydrogen bond formation. The cooperative formation of PI/PI(4,5)P2 mixed domains has potentially important ramifications for the spatial organization of phosphoinositide mediated signaling events.",

Recently, it was shown that \u03b2-CD covalently coupled to fluorescent dextran polymers accumulates in cholesterol-enriched lysosomal storage organelles of human fibroblasts (Rosenbaum et al., 2010). By employing a methyl-\u03b2CD tagged with fluorescein (FM\u03b2CD), we have characterized the cellular trafficking of the CD in mammalian cell lines and its distribution into the endocytic compartments within the first minutes following addition to cells. FM\u03b2CD enters mammalian cells via endocytosis. The colocalization of FM\u03b2CD with transferrin-containing endosomes and the inhibition of FM\u03b2CD internalization by chlorpromazine or by an antisense RNA against clathrin heavy chain indicate that FM\u03b2CD is taken up via receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis. These results not only highlight the possibility of using CDs to target drugs intracellularly, but also warn about potential unwanted effects on cell physiology other than cholesterol extraction/loading at high concentrations, high temperatures and prolonged incubation times.",

Several enzymes have been proposed to participate in acyl remodeling of cardiolipin. In order to compare the effect of these enzymes, we determined the pattern of cardiolipin molecular species in Drosophila strains with specific enzyme deletions, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with internal standards. We established the linear range of the method for cardiolipin quantification, determined the relative signal intensities of several cardiolipin standards, and demonstrated satisfying signal-to-noise ratios in cardiolipin spectra from a single fly. Our data demonstrate changes in the cardiolipin composition during the Drosophila life cycle. Comparison of cardiolipin spectra, using vector algebra, showed that inactivation of tafazzin had a large effect on the molecular composition of cardiolipin, inactivation of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 had a small effect, whereas inactivation of acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin-acyltransferase and of the trifunctional enzyme did not affect the cardiolipin composition.",

     "abstract": "The resistance of a lipid bilayer with respect to a bending deformation generally depends on the presence of membrane additives such as sterols, cosurfactants, peptides, and drugs. As a consequence, the partitioning of membrane additives into liposomes becomes selective with respect to liposome size; i.e., membrane rigidification depletes the membrane additives in the smaller (more strongly curved) liposomes. We have measured this liposome size-selective partitioning for two membrane additives \u2013 cholesterol and the porphyrin-based photosensitizer temoporfin \u2013 using asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) of liposomes and radioactive labeling of the membrane additive and lipid. The method yields either the molar cholesterol-to-lipid or the temoporfin-to-lipid ratio as a function of liposome size, from which we calculate the corresponding change of the membrane bending stiffness. For small unilamellar fluid-phase liposomes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), we find that cholesterol rigidifies the host membrane in a manner consistent with previously reported measurements. In contrast, temoporfin softens this membrane. Partitioning results for gel-phase liposomes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) are also curvature-sensitive but cannot be interpreted on the basis of the bending stiffness alone.",

Feruloyl di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol was assessed for its ability to serve as an antioxidant for preventing the oxidation of its \u03b3-linolenoyl polyunsaturated fatty acyl groups in model membrane phospholipid vesicles. The molecule was incorporated into single-lamellar vesicles comprised of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Feruloyl di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol was found to be highly resistant to 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-initiated oxidation in comparison to di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol. Analysis of the individual fatty acyl chains indicated that degradation of \u03b3-linolenoyl groups from feruloyl di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol proceeded much more slowly than loss of the entire molecule, indicating that the feruloyl moiety was preferentially oxidized. In vesicles incorporating di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol and an equal amount (5\u00a0mol% each) feruloyl dioleoylglycerol, the extent of \u03b3-linolenoyl protection was not as great as when the \u03b3-linolenoyl groups were molecularly combined with a ferulate group. These findings indicate that the ferulate group of feruloyl di-\u03b3-linolenoylglycerol expresses intramolecular antioxidant activity.

MagI peptide was immobilized on gold electrode via a self-assembling monolayer obtained from liposomes and liposomes covered by Synp. MagI induces pores in the supported lipid membranes, which are reflected in an increased amperometric-response and also a decreased electron-transfer resistance (RCT). In addition, MagI showed a significant interaction with the PL-Synp-modified gold electrode, but MagI showed a reliable contact with the PL-modified gold electrode, leading to a decrease in the relative resistance charge transfer value of \u221217.38%. Our results demonstrated that Synp acts as a membrane sealant after exposure of the lipid membrane to MagI.

The probes have been used previously to study cholesterol-enriched domains, but their photophysical properties in erg-enriched membranes have not been characterized.N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-DPPE) presents modest blue-shifts upon erg addition, and the changes in the fluorescence lifetime are mainly due to differences in the efficiency of its fluorescence dynamic self-quenching. However, the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of NBD-DPPE presents well-defined values in each lipid phase.N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Rhod-DOPE) presents a close to random distribution in erg-rich membranes. There are no appreciable spectral shifts and the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy presents complex behavior, as a result of different photophysical processes. The probe is mostly useful to label ld domains in yeast membranes.4-(2-(6-(Dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-pyridinium (di-4-ANEPPS) is an electrochromic dye with excitation spectra largely insensitive to the presence of erg, but presenting a strong blue-shift of its emission with increasing concentrations of this sterol. Its partition coefficient is favorable to lo domains in POPC/erg mixtures. Although the fluorescence properties of di-4-ANEPPS are less sensitive to erg than to chol, in both cases the fluorescence lifetime responds monotonically to sterol mole fraction, becoming significantly longer in the presence of sterol as compared to pure POPC or DPPC bilayers. The probe displays a unique sensitivity to sterol\u2013lipid interaction due to the influence of hydration and H-bonding patterns at the membrane/water interface on its fluorescence properties. This makes di-4-ANEPPS (and possibly similar probes) potentially useful in the study of erg-enriched domains in more complex lipid mixtures and in the membranes of living yeast cells.",

     "abstract": "Liposomes have been an excellent option as drug delivery systems, since they are able of incorporating lipophobic and/or lipophilic drugs, reduce drug side effects, increase drug targeting, and control delivery. Also, in the last years, their use reached the field of gene therapy, as non-viral vectors for DNA delivery. As a strategy to increase system stability, the use of polymerizable phospholipids has been proposed in liposomal formulations. In this work, through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) of spin labels incorporated into the bilayers, we structurally characterize liposomes formed by a mixture of the polymerizable lipid diacetylenic phosphatidylcholine 1,2-bis(10,12-tricosadiynoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DC8,9PC) and the zwitterionic lipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), in a 1:1 molar ratio. It is shown here that the polymerization efficiency of the mixture (c.a. 60%) is much higher than that of pure DC8,9PC bilayers (c.a. 20%). Cationic amphiphiles (CA) were added, in a final molar ratio of 1:1:0.2 (DC8,9PC:DMPC:CA), to make the liposomes possible carriers for genetic material, due to their electrostatic interaction with negatively charged DNA. Three amphiphiles were tested, 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimetylammonium-propane (DOTAP), stearylamine (SA) and trimetyl (2-miristoyloxietyl) ammonium chloride (MCL), and the systems were studied before and after UV irradiation. Interestingly, the presence of the cationic amphiphiles increased liposomes polymerization, MCL displaying the strongest effect. Considering the different structural effects the three cationic amphiphiles cause in DC8,9PC bilayers, there seem to be a correlation between the degree of DC8,9PC polymerization and the packing of the membrane at the temperature it is irradiated (gel phase). Moreover, at higher temperatures, in the bilayer fluid phase, more polymerized membranes are significantly more rigid. Considering that the structure and stability of liposomes at different temperatures can be crucial for DNA binding and delivery, we expect the study presented here contributes to the production of new carrier systems with potential applications in gene therapy.",

     "abstract": "Camellia seed oil is one of most important edible oil, rich in oleic acid and contains many natural antioxidants with various biological activities. During preparation of foods or storage camellia oil oxidizes by the auto-oxidation and produce oxidized compounds. Traditional analytical techniques like FFA, POV are used for the determination of oxidation and adulteration of oils and fats. These methods were rarely able to detect the oxidized compounds produced and extent of oxidation. This paper presents the uses of liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013ESI-MS) for the analysis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) composition and evaluation of auto-oxidation and oxidation products of camellia seed oil. The camellia oil was auto-oxidized for 12 months at room temperature. The TAGs were identified from their characteristics fragmentations such as protonated molecular ion, ammonium and sodium adducts, diacylglycerols, epoxy-diacylglycerols fragments and mono-acylglycerol fragments in ESI-MS mass spectra. HPLC\u2013ESI-MS data revealed the separation and identification of 15 TAGs. The major TAGs separated and identified in camellia seed oil were POO, OOO, OLO, PLO/POL, OLL, SOO, ALO and OLLn. The auto-oxidation studies revealed a total loss of LnLLn, LnOLn, LLLn and OLLn amounting about 13.5% total oxidation. The auto-oxidation products were epoxy hydroperoxides, epoxy epidioxides, and mono-epoxides. It was observed that these were characteristic compounds produced in high oleic oils.",

     "abstract": "In this work we examine the interaction between the 13-residue cationic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) tritrpticin (VRRFPWWWPFLRR, TRP3) and model membranes of variable lipid composition. The effect on peptide conformational properties was investigated by means of CD (circular dichroism) and fluorescence spectroscopies. Based on the hypothesis that the antibiotic acts through a mechanism involving toroidal pore formation, and taking into account that models of toroidal pores imply the formation of positive curvature, we used large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) to mimic the initial step of peptide-lipid interaction, when the peptide binds to the bilayer membrane, and micelles to mimic the topology of the pore itself, since these aggregates display positive curvature. In order to more faithfully assess the role of curvature, micelles were prepared with lysophospholipids containing (qualitatively and quantitatively) head groups identical to those of bilayer phospholipids. CD and fluorescence spectra showed that, while TRP3 binds to bilayers only when they carry negatively charged phospholipids, binding to micelles occurs irrespective of surface charge, indicating that electrostatic interactions play a less predominant role in the latter case. Moreover, the conformations acquired by the peptide were independent of lipid composition in both bilayers and micelles. However, the conformations were different in bilayers and in micelles, suggesting that curvature has an influence on the secondary structure acquired by the peptide. Fluorescence data pointed to an interfacial location of TRP3 in both types of aggregates. Nevertheless, experiments with a water soluble fluorescence quencher suggested that the tryptophan residues are more accessible to the quencher in micelles than in bilayers. Thus, we propose that bilayers and micelles can be used as models for the two steps of toroidal pore formation.",

Using a surface force balance, we have measured the normal and shear interactions as a function of surface separation between layers of hydrogenated soy phophatidylcholine (HSPC) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) adsorbed from dispersion, at both pure water and physiologically high salt concentrations of 0.15\u00a0M NaNO3. Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy shows each surface to be coated by a close-packed HSPC-SUV layer with an over-layer of liposomes on top. The shear forces reveal strikingly low friction coefficients down to 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 in pure water system or 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 in the 150\u00a0mM salt system, up to contact pressures of at least 12\u00a0MPa (pure water) or 6\u00a0MPa (high salt), comparable with those in the major joints. This low friction is attributed to the hydration lubrication mechanism arising from rubbing of the highly hydrated phosphocholine-headgroup layers exposed at the outer surface of each liposome, and provides support for the conjecture that phospholipids may play a significant role in biological lubrication.",

     "abstract": "A range of evidence from animal, clinical and epidemiological studies indicates that highly polyunsaturated acyl chains play important roles in development, cognition, vision and other aspects of neurological function. In a number of these studies n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) appear to be more efficacious than n6 PUFAs. In a previous study of retinal rod outer segments obtained from rats raised on either an n3 adequate or deficient diet, we demonstrated that the replacement of 22:6n3 by 22:5n6 in the n3 deficient rats led to functional deficits in each step in the visual signaling process (Niu et al., 2004). In this study, we examined rhodopsin and phosphodiesterase function and acyl chain packing properties in membranes consisting of phosphatidylcholines with sn-1\u00a0=\u00a018:0, and sn-2\u00a0=\u00a022:6n3, 22:5n6, or 22:5n3 in order to determine if differences in function are due to the loss of one double bond or due to differences in double bond location. At 37\u00a0\u00b0C the n6 lipid shifted the equilibrium between the active metarhodopsin II (MII) state and inactive metarhodopsin I (MI) state towards MI. In addition, 22:5n6 reduced the rates of MII formation and MII-transducin complex formation by 2- and 6-fold, respectively. At a physiologically relevant level of rhodopsin light stimulation, the activity of phosphodiesterase was reduced by 50% in the 22:5n6 membrane, relative to either of the n3 membranes. Activity levels in the two n3 membranes were essentially identical. Ensemble acyl chain order was assessed with time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the membrane probe diphenylhexatriene (DPH). Analysis in terms of the orientational distribution of DPH showed that acyl chain packing in the two n3 membranes is quite similar, while in the 22:5n6 membrane there was considerably less packing disorder in the bilayer midplane. These results demonstrate that the n3 bond configuration uniquely optimizes the early steps in signaling via a mechanism which may involve acyl chain packing deep in the bilayer.",

The results show that cationic carbosilane dendrimers interact both with liposomes and lipid monolayers. Interactions were stronger for negatively charged membranes and high concentration of dendrimers. In liposomes interactions were studied by measuring fluorescence anisotropy changes of fluorescent labels incorporated into the bilayer. An increase in fluorescence anisotropy was observed for both fluorescent probes when dendrimers were added to lipids that means the decreased membrane fluidity. Both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of liposome bilayers became more rigid. This may be due to dendrimers\u2019 incorporation into liposome bilayer. For higher concentrations of both dendrimers precipitation occurred in negatively charged liposomes. NN16 dendrimer interacted stronger with hydrophilic part of bilayers whereas BDBR0011 greatly modified the hydrophobic area. Monolayers method brought similar results.

They are commonly used in vitro and in vivo as a nucleic acid delivery system. Our study aims are to investigate how DOTAP-based cationic liposomes, which vary in their helper lipid (cholesterol or DOPE) and in media of different ionic strengths affect the degree, mode of association and degree of condensation of pDNA. This was determined by ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis, methods based on different physical principles. In addition, the degree of pDNA condensation was also determined using the ethidium bromide (EtBr) intercalation assay.The results suggest that for cationic lipid compositions (DOTAP/DOPE and DOTAP/cholesterol), 1.5\u00a0M NaCl, but not 0.15\u00a0M NaCl, both prevent lipoplex formation and/or induce partial dissociation between lipid and DNA of preformed lipoplexes. The higher the salt concentration the greater is the similarity of DNA condensation (monitored by EtBr intercalation) between lipoplex DNA and free DNA. As determined by ultracentrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis, 30\u201390% of the DNA is uncondensed.SDS below its critical micellar concentration (CMC) induced \u201cde-condensation\u201d of DNA without its physical release (assessed by ultracentrifugation) for both DOTAP/DOPE and DOTAP/cholesterol lipoplexes. As was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis SDS induced release of 50\u201360% of DNA from the DOTAP/cholesterol lipoplex but not from the DOTAP/DOPE lipoplex.This study shows that there are conditions under which DNA is still physically associated with the cationic lipids but undergoes unwinding to become less condensed.

We will discuss how thermal ablation can also be used to improve overall intratumoral drug accumulation and nanoparticle content release.

Later, a self-assembling pro-nano lipospheres (PNL) encapsulation system was developed for oral drug delivery. Lipospheres have several advantages over other delivery systems, such as better physical stability, low cost of ingredients, ease of preparation and scale-up, high dispersibility in an aqueous medium, high entrapment of hydrophobic drugs, controlled particle size, and extended release of entrapped drug after administration, from a few hours to several days.This review article focuses on updated information on several aspects of lipospheres and PNL, including preparation techniques, physicochemical properties and in vitro evaluation methods. Additionally, it covers lipospheres and PNL utilization for oral, ocular, and parenteral delivery, with special attention to unique considerations and aspects for each route of administration.",

Therefore in this study, SLNs and NLCs loaded fluconazole (FLZ) were prepared by solvent diffusion method in an aqueous system and characterized for different parameters. In addition, antifungal activity was carried out on experimentally induced cutaneous candidiasis in immunosuppressed albino rats. The results showed that SLNs and NLCs represent the respective mean particle sizes of approx. 178 and 134\u00a0nm with encapsulation efficiency of 75.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.94% and 81.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.89%, respectively. The skin-retention studies of FLZ from in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed significantly higher accumulation of drug in the case of NLCs formulation. The in vivo cumulative amount of FLZ retention from NLCs was more than 5-fold that of the plain solution, while it was 3.3-fold more in the case of an equivalent-dose application in the form of SLNs at 12\u00a0h after administration. The antifungal study also confirmed the maximum therapeutic efficacy of NLCs, as the lowest number of cfu/ml was recorded. It can be concluded from this study that NLCs provide a good skin targeting effect and may be a promising carrier for topical delivery of FLZ offering the sustained release and maintain the localized effect, resulting in an effective treatment of a life-threatening cutaneous fungal infection.",

     "abstract": "Sphingolipid metabolites have become recognized for their participation in cell functions and signaling events that control a wide array of cellular activities. Two main sphingolipids, ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, differentiation, angiogenesis, stress responses, protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and intracellular trafficking. Ceramide and S1P often exert opposing effects on cell survival, ceramide being pro-apoptotic and S1P generally promoting cell survival. Therefore, the conversion of one of these metabolites to the other by sphingolipid enzymes provides a vast network of regulation and provides a useful therapeutic target.Here we provide a survey of the current knowledge of the roles of sphingolipid metabolites in cancer and in lipid storage disease. We review our attempts to interfere with this network of regulation and so provide new treatments for a range of diseases. We synthesized novel analogs of sphingolipids which inhibit the hydrolysis of ceramide or its conversion to more complex sphingolipids. These analogs caused elevation of ceramide levels, leading to apoptosis of a variety of cancer cells. Administration of a synthetic analog to tumor-bearing mice resulted in reduction and even disappearance of the tumors. Therapies for sphingolipid storage diseases, such as Niemann\u2013Pick and Gaucher diseases were achieved by two different strategies: inhibition of the biosynthesis of the substrate (substrate reduction therapy) and protection of the mutated enzyme (chaperone therapy). Sphingolipid metabolism was monitored by the use of novel fluorescent sphingolipid analogs.The results described in this review indicate that our synthetic analogs could be developed both as anticancer drugs and for the treatment of sphingolipid storage diseases.",

Our experiments show that in contrast to MLVs, a single-pass extrusion of GUVs through track-etched polycarbonate membranes at moderate pressure differences is sufficient to produce small liposomes having low polydispersity index. Moreover, we observe that the drug encapsulating potential of extruded liposomes obtained from GUVs is significantly higher compared to liposomes prepared by extrusion of MLVs. Furthermore, our experiments carried out for varying membrane pore diameters and extrusion pressures suggest that the size of extruded liposomes is a function of the velocity of GUV suspensions in the membrane pore.",

Based on calibration with fluorescent latex beads, the size resolution was between about 500 and 1000\u00a0nm. Caelyx, just as structurally matched empty liposomes (Doxebo) produced dot plots clearly distinguishable from background, suggesting the presence of SVS in the above size region. A comparison of gated areas on the scattergrams obtained for different Caelyx preparations showed differences between current and expired samples, implying that SVS formation may be storage-time-dependent. Incubation of doxorubicin with Doxebo in a free drug and lipid concentration range that corresponds to that in Caelyx also led to varying SVS patterns, raising the possibility that free doxorubicin in Caelyx might contribute to SVS formation. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis of liposomes following gaiting and sorting of >500\u00a0nm particles from Caelyx confirmed the presence of SVS, providing independent evidence for their stable existence. Based on a rough estimation, the amount of SVS in Caelyx is some 60 billionth part of all liposomes. These observations raise the possibility that the presence of an exceedingly small fraction of >500\u00a0nm particles may be an intrinsic property of PEGylated small unilamellar liposomes, and that the described FACS analysis may be developed further as a quality assay for liposomal homogeneity.",

Screening and characterization of these ubiquitous, therapeutically potent polyphenolic compounds require a clear understanding regarding their binding and possible locations in membranes, as well as quantitative estimates of relevant parameters such as partition coefficients, antioxidant and radical scavenging capacities. In this article we present perspectives emphasizing novel uses of the exquisitely sensitive \u2018two color\u2019 intrinsic fluorescence of plant flavonoids (which arise due to highly efficient photoinduced excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) reactions) to explore their binding to model biomembranes consisting of phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Extension of such studies to natural biomembranes of relevant interest is also exemplified. Spectrophotometric assays reveal that typical mono- as well as poly-hydroxy substituted flavonoids have remarkable inhibitory actions on lipid peroxidation, and are significantly more potent antioxidants (2.5\u20134 times higher) compared to the reference compound Trolox (an water soluble derivative of vitamin E).

Such transition can be conveniently induced in charged micelles by increasing ionic strength of the medium. Shape changes have recently been shown to result in altered packing and lowering of micellar polarity. As a consequence of reduced polarity, the ionization states of micelle-bound molecules vary in micelles of different shape. The changes in micellar organization and dynamics due to structural transition can be effectively monitored utilizing the red edge excitation shift (REES). These changes are influenced by the position (location) of the probe in the micelle, i.e., the region of the micelle being monitored. Changes in organization and dynamics of probes and peptides upon structural transition are discussed with representative examples. We envisage that the reduction in micellar polarity and tighter packing upon structural transition represent important factors in the incorporation of drugs in micelles (nano-carriers), since micellar polarity plays a crucial role in the incorporation of drugs.",

Their structures were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as by means of electrospray ionization-linear ion-trap mass spectrometry with negative-ion detection. Upon collision-induced dissociation, structurally informative product ions were observed. Using a triple-stage quadrupole instrument, selected reaction monitoring analyses by monitoring characteristic transition ions allowed the achievement of a highly sensitive and specific assay. This method was used to determine whether the 3-sulfates of the bile acid\u2013GSH conjugates (BA\u2013GSH) were formed when BA\u2013GSH were incubated with a rat liver cytosolic fraction to which 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate had been added. The S-acyl linkage was rapidly hydrolyzed to form the unconjugated bile acid. A little sulfation of the GSH conjugates occurred, but greater sulfation at C-3 of the liberated bile acid occurred. Sulfation was proportional to the hydrophobicity of the unconjugated bile acid. Thus GSH conjugates of bile acids as well as their C-3 sulfates if formed in vivo are rapidly hydrolyzed by cytosolic enzymes.",

     "abstract": "The lamellar to inverse hexagonal phase transition of lipids is much studied as a model for understanding cellular processes such as membrane fusion and pore formation. Much remains unknown, including a theoretical understanding and a definitive value of the phase transition temperature for DEPE, as literature values vary over 10\u00a0\u00b0C. Avrami theory has been commonly used to analyze phase transition kinetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, Avrami theory has not been used to analyze the lamellar to inverse hexagonal transition in lipids until now. We used laser light scattering to measure phase transition temperature of the lipid DEPE (1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine) and found it to be 61.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b0C. We found the hysteresis, |Tmeasured\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Tequilibrium|, scaled as r\u03b2, where r is the ramp rate and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02. This is the same power law behavior found by others for an isomer of DEPE known as DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3 ethanolamine); however, DEPE exhibits roughly half the hysteresis of DOPE. An analysis of DEPE kinetics yields Avrami exponents ranging from 1 to 7, suggesting the transition propagates one dimensionally and is initiated by a widely varying nucleation rate.",

     "abstract": "Solid-state NMR spectroscopic techniques provide valuable information about the structure, dynamics and topology of membrane-inserted polypeptides. In particular antimicrobial peptides (or \u2018host defence peptides\u2019) have early on been investigated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and many technical innovations in this domain have been developed with the help of these compounds when reconstituted into oriented phospholipid bilayers. Using solid-state NMR spectroscopy it could be shown for the first time that magainins or derivatives thereof exhibit potent antimicrobial activities when their cationic amphipathic helix is oriented parallel to the bilayer surface, a configuration found in later years for many other linear cationic amphipathic peptides. In contrast transmembrane alignments or lipid-dependent tilt angles have been found for more hydrophobic sequences such as alamethicin or \u03b2-hairpin antimicrobials. This review presents various solid-state NMR approaches and develops the basic underlying concept how angular information can be obtained from oriented samples. It is demonstrated how this information is used to calculate structures and topologies of peptides in their native liquid-disordered phospholipid bilayer environment. Special emphasis is given to discuss which NMR parameters provide the most complementary information, the minimal number of restraints needed and the effect of motions on the analysis of the NMR spectra. Furthermore, recent 31P and 2H solid-state NMR measurements of lipids are presented including some unpublished data which aim at investigating the morphological and structural changes of oriented or non-oriented phospholipids. Finally the structural models that have been proposed for the mechanisms of action of these peptides will be presented and discussed in view of the solid-state NMR and other biophysical experiments.",

The studied monolayer was single-component saturated phospholipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) transferred onto mica surface. When the time of the contact angle measurements is prolonged in these systems, some changes in the DPPC layer structure occur due to the contact with probing liquid, especially water, which is reflected in the changes of measured contact angle. Generally, with increasing time of the droplet contact with DPPC monolayer the contact angle decreases. Some correlation between the contact angle decrease and molecular rearrangements of initially hydrophobic DPPC monolayer is observed if it comes into contact with water. On the other hand, the contact angle completed within the first few seconds can faithfully reflect the original structure of the layer, and thus its energetic state, because during this time the structure changes are insignificant. Basing on the measured contact angles the monolayer's apparent surface free energy and its components, corresponding to different contact times of the droplets, were calculated. These results are helpful for better characterization of the processes taking place in the phospholipid layers being in contact with polar (water and formamide) and nonpolar (diiodomethane) liquids.",

Fluorescent probes have been used to detect and characterize these membrane lateral heterogeneities. However, a comprehensive understanding of the link between the probes\u2019 fluorescence features and membrane lateral organization can only be achieved if their photophysical properties are thoroughly defined. In this work, a systematic characterization of N-(lyssamine Rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylehanolamine (Rhod-DOPE) absorption and fluorescence behavior in gel, liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) model membranes was performed. In agreement with a previous study, it was found that Rhod-DOPE fluorescence lifetimes present a strong sensitivity to lipid phases, becoming significantly shorter in lo membranes as the probe membrane concentration increases. The sensitivity of Rhod-DOPE absorption and fluorescence properties to the membrane phase was further explored. In particular, the fluorescence lifetime sensitivity was shown to be a consequence of the enhanced Rhod-DOPE fluorescence dynamic self-quenching, due to the formation of probe-rich membrane domains in these condensed phases that cannot be considered as typical probe aggregates, as excitonic interaction is not observed.

Natural product curcumin is known to interact with PKC isoforms through the C1 domain and modulate PKC activity. The reported results demonstrate that the symmetric curcumin molecule might act as two separate units during its recognition of C1 domains. To understand the importance of the two halves of curcumin in PKC binding and to develop effective PKC regulators, we synthesized a series of alkyl cinnamates (1\u20138), characterized absorption and fluorescence properties and measured binding affinities with the C1b subdomains of PKC isoforms. The binding parameters of the monomeric compounds and liposomes containing compounds confirmed their interaction with the C1b subdomains of PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b8. The molecular docking analysis with PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b8 C1b subdomains revealed that the alkyl cinnamates form hydrogen bond with the backbone of the protein at the same binding site as that of diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. The results show that the alkyl cinnamates bind to the activator binding site of PKCs and both methoxy and hydroxyl groups play important roles in the binding process.",

We obtained 200 continuous-wave ESR spectra from glycerophospholipid spin-labels labeled at the 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, and 16 carbon positions of the 2nd acyl chain, a sphingomyelin spin-label labeled at the 14 carbon position of the amide-linked acyl chain, a headgroup-labeled glycerophospholipid, a headgroup-labeled sphingomyelin, and the cholesterol analogue spin-label cholestane all within multi-lamellar vesicle suspensions at room temperature. The spectra were analyzed using the MOMD (microscopic-order macroscopic-disorder) model to provide the rotational diffusion rates and order parameters which characterize the local molecular dynamics in these phases. The analysis also incorporated the known critical point and invariant points of the neighboring three-phase triangle along the coexistence curve. The variation in the molecular dynamic structures of coexisting Lo and Ld compositions as one moves toward the critical point is discussed.

Traditional lipoprotein separation techniques either by ultra-centrifugation or by liquid chromatography methods have their disadvantages in both lipoprotein separation and lipids component quantification. In this study we used small volume needing size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography to separate different lipoprotein subclasses in 50\u00a0\u03bcL serum. And lipids contents, such as cholesterol, cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol, were measured by using two different fluorescence-based lipid detection methods. With this method, very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein could be easily separated, and follow-up lipid detection was completed by simple kinds of reactions. Serum lipoprotein and lipids profiling from C57BL/6 mice (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and human (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were analyzed. The elution profiles of five individuals were highly reproducible, and there were lipoprotein and lipids distribution variations between C57BL/6 mice and human beings. In conclusion, this method which combined small volume needing size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography and fluorescence-based lipids measurement, provided a simple, efficient, integrity and reproducible procedure for determining serum lipoprotein and lipids profiles in micro-liter scale levels.

We show that below the bilayer melting temperature, A\u03b2 monomers adsorb to, and assemble on, the surface of DPPC bilayers to form layers that grow laterally and normal to the bilayer plane. Above the bilayer melting temperature, we observe protofibril formation. In contrast, in DOPC bilayers, A\u03b2 monomers exhibit a detergent-like action, forming defects in the bilayer structure.

We have examined the effects of introducing cholesterol to F-DPPC and 1:1 F-DPPC/DPPC membranes using a combination of DSC, optical density, fluorescence intensity and polarization, 31P NMR, and X-ray diffraction techniques. Cholesterol increases the fluidity of the gel phase, broadens the main transition, and decreases the main transition enthalpy. However, these results also reveal that there is an unusually large degree of phase coexistence between the L\u03b2I and non-interdigitated gel phases when cholesterol is added. Cholesterol encourages this phase segregation by partitioning into the thicker non-interdigitated domains. At higher cholesterol concentrations, the majority or all of the L\u03b2I phase of F-DPPC and 1:1 F-DPPC/DPPC is eliminated and is replaced by a non-interdigitated liquid-ordered (lo) phase with properties similar to DPPC/cholesterol. Consequently, cholesterol mitigates the influence the CF moiety has on the thermodynamic phase behavior of F-DPPC.

The multi-functional agent \u03b1-lipoic acid offers numerous beneficial effects to oxidatively stressed tissues. \u03b1-Lipoic acid was enzymatically incorporated into a triglyceride in conjunction with oleic acid, creating lipoyl dioleoylglycerol, and chemically reduced to form dihydrolipoyl dioleoylglycerol. The triglyceride forms of lipoic acid stabilized dioleoylphosphatidylcholine unilamellar liposomal vesicles, as judged by calcein\u2013cobalt leakage. Stabilization resulted from increased packing density of phospholipid acyl chains. Scavenging activity against the 2,2\u2032-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) radical was monitored by oxidation of 4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoic acid (C11-Bodipy). Dihydrolipoyl dioleoylglycerol in vesicles demonstrated strong antioxidant capacity in comparison to the conventional Trolox standard. Fluorescence quenching measurements indicated the lipoyl moiety of dihydrolipoyl dioleoylglycerol is positioned near the vesicle aqueous/lipid boundary. Treatment of intact vesicles with a nonpenetrating sulfhydryl reagent indicated that 80% of the dihydrolipoyl dioleoylglycerol was available for reaction. Molecular modeling of lipoyl dioleoylglycerol and dihydrolipoyl dioleoylglycerol in a phospholipid layer confirmed the existence of an extended configuration for the molecules that accounts for the interfacial location of the lipoyl moiety, which may allow the antioxidant to readily react with radical species approaching membranes from the aqueous phase.",

     "abstract": "Aqueous dispersions of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), at low ionic strength, display uncommon thermal behavior. Models for such behavior need to assign a form to the lipid aggregate. Although most studies accept the presence of lipid vesicles in the lipid gel and fluid phases, this is still controversial. With electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of spin labels incorporated into DMPG aggregates, quantification of [14C]sucrose entrapped by the aggregates, and viscosity measurements, we demonstrate the existence of leaky vesicles in dispersions of DMPG at low ionic strength, in both gel and fluid phases of the lipid. As a control system, the ubiquitous lipid dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) was used. For DMPG in the gel phase, spin labeling only indicated the presence of lipid bilayers, strongly suggesting that DMPG molecules are organized as vesicles and not micelles or bilayer fragments (bicelles), as the latter has a non-bilayer structure at the edges. Quantification of [14C]sucrose entrapping by DMPG aggregates revealed the presence of highly leaky vesicles. Due to the short hydrocarbon chains (14C atoms), DMPC vesicles were also found to be partially permeable to sucrose, but not as much as DMPG vesicles. Viscosity measurements, with the calculation of the intrinsic viscosity of the lipid aggregate, showed that DMPG vesicles are rather similar in the gel and fluid phases, and quite different from aggregates observed along the gel\u2013fluid transition. Taken together, our data strongly supports that DMPG forms leaky vesicles at both gel and fluid phases.",

The stronger oxidation conditions increased the number of LaPP, but also oxidized the added peptide Ac-PAAPAAPAPAEXTPV-OH (X\u00a0=\u00a0Cys, His or Lys) very quickly, especially under Fenton conditions. Thus, PLPC was oxidized by milder conditions (air or Cu(I)), incubated with the peptide and the peptide modifications were then analyzed by nano-RPC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS. Ten LaPP-derived peptide modifications were identified at lysine, whereas nine products were identified for cysteine and only three for histidine.

     "abstract": "Signaling lipids control many of the most important biological pathways, typically by recruiting cognate protein binding targets to cell surfaces, thereby regulating both their function and subcellular localization. A critical family of signaling lipids is that of the phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PIPns), which is composed of seven isomers that vary based on phosphorylation pattern. A key protein that is activated upon PIPn binding is Akt, which then plays important roles in regulating the cell cycle, and is thus aberrant in disease. Characterization of protein\u2013PIPn binding interactions is hindered by the complexity of the membrane environment and of the PIPn structures. Herein, we describe two rapid assays of use for characterizing protein\u2013PIPn binding interactions. First, a microplate-based binding assay was devised to characterize the binding of effectors to immobilized synthetic PIPn headgroup-biotin conjugates corresponding to all seven isomers. The assay was implemented for simultaneous analysis of Akt-PH domain, indicating PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 as the primary ligands. In addition, density-dependant studies indicated that the amount of ligand immobilized on the surface affected the amplitude of protein binding, but not the affinity, for Akt-PH. Since the PIPn ligand motifs used in this analysis lack the membrane environment and glycerolipid backbone, yet still exhibit high-affinity protein binding, these results narrow down the structural requirements for Akt recognition. Additionally, binding detection was also achieved through microarray analysis via the robotic pin printing of ligands onto glass slides in a miniaturized format. Here, fluorescence-based detection provided sensitive detection of binding using minimal amounts of materials. Due to their high-throughput and versatile attributes, these assays provide invaluable tools for probing and perturbing protein\u2013membrane binding interactions.",

Monolayer isotherms demonstrated protein insertion into the lipid monolayer. Subsequently, Brewster angle microscopy was applied to image domains in lipid matrices and lipid\u2013protein mixtures. The images showed a concentration dependent impact of the protein on lipid domain size and shape and more interestingly distinct coexisting protein clusters. Whereas lipid domains varied in size (14\u201347\u00a0\u03bcm), protein clusters exhibited a narrow size distribution (2.6\u20134.8\u00a0\u03bcm) suggesting a non-random process of cluster formation. A 3-D display clearly indicates that these proteins clusters protrude from the membrane plane. These data demonstrate distinct co-existing lipid domains and membrane protein clusters as the monofilm is being compressed and illustrate the significant mutual impact of lipid\u2013protein interactions on lateral membrane architecture.",

The assays uses C17-sphinganine-1-phosphate as substrate and the aldehyde product, pentadecanal, is quantified as its pentafluorobenzyloxime derivative by GC/MS. Derivatization of pentadecanal is performed as a one-step reaction, and the oxime product is directly injected for GC/MS analysis without any further purification. Acquisition in selected ion monitoring mode allows very high sensitivity, with a limit of detection of 281\u00a0fmol. The assay is linear with both protein concentration and incubation time up to 20\u00a0\u03bcg and 40\u00a0min, respectively. The Km value obtained (6\u00a0\u03bcM) is similar to that for the natural substrate sphingosine-1-phosphate.

For mixtures with 40\u201345\u00a0mole% of SA, the domain shape changes from flower-like to circular domains. In this work, we carried out a detailed study of the driving force for the shape change. We find that it is related to the domain density which, in turn, is driven by the domain nucleation process and thus by oversaturation of the system leading to phase segregation. This could be a way of self-regulating the local electrostatics and mechanical properties in membrane surfaces with segregated phase domains.",

Under the normal condition water molecules are stored mainly in the corneocytes. When the water content increased, from the small-angle X-ray diffraction of the human stratum corneum we obtained the swelling behavior of the short lamellar lipid structure as a result of incorporating a very small amount of water into water layers between neighboring the lipid bilayers, and its diffraction peak width became narrow and turned to wide at the water content of 20\u201330\u00a0wt%. In addition as evidence for uptake of water in the corneocytes, we observed the structural modification of soft keratins in the corneocytes from the medium-angle X-ray diffraction. Based upon these results we propose that the water content in the human stratum corneum is regulated to be at 20\u201330\u00a0wt% so as to stabilize the short lamellar structure in the intercellular lipid matrix.",

Negative excess hydration (dehydration) was found for almost all hydration degrees investigated. This behaviour is explained by the formation of an inner salt between the dipoles of phospholipid and surfactant headgroups that show a reverse sequence of partial charges with respect to the hydrocarbon backbone. The formation of an inner-salt most probably reduces potential water binding sites. Moreover, NMR data suggest that the incorporation of the zwitterionic surfactant into the phospholipid membrane is correlated with reorientation of the phosphate axis towards the membrane director as well as with reduced lateral and wobbling diffusion.",

These lipids have an inverted headgroup orientation as compared to naturally occurring phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids; the cationic group is anchored at the membrane interface, while the anionic group extends into the aqueous phase. AQ lipids preferentially interact with highly polarizable anions (ClO4\u2212) over less polarizable ions (Cl\u2212), in accord with the Hofmeister series, as measured by the change in zeta potential of AQ liposomes. Conversely, AQ lipids have a weaker association with calcium than do PC lipids. The transition temperatures (Tm) of the AQ lipids are similar to the Tm observed with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids of the same chain length. AQ lipids form large lipid sheets after heating and sonication; however, in the presence of cholesterol (Chol), these lipids form stable liposomes that encapsulate carboxyfluorescein. The AQ:Chol liposomes retain their contents in the presence of serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, and when injected intravenously into mice, their organ biodistribution is similar to that observed with PC:Chol liposomes. AQ lipids demonstrate that modulating the headgroup charge orientation significantly alters the biophysical properties of liposomes.

     "abstract": "We used a model intestinal solution to understand the mechanisms of cholesterol lowering by the addition of plant sterols. The experimental results of the competitive solubilization of cholesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol in vitro give useful information about these mechanisms. The states of the model intestinal solution as a solubilizer were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) by changing the number of components, and the bile salt and phosphatidylcholine concentrations. There were aggregates of different sizes: liposomes and mixed micelles depending on their components and concentrations. The maximum solubilization of cholesterol increased from 0.2\u00a0mM to 1.3\u00a0mM when adding fatty compounds in the pure bile salts system, which is almost the same as the full components model intestinal solution. Therefore, an excessive intake of fatty compounds may also increase cholesterol absorption in vivo. Even if the components of the model intestinal solution were modified from the standard condition, there were not remarkable differences in the selectivity of cholesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol in competitive solubilization. With the addition of \u03b2-sitosterol, the maximum solubilization of cholesterol decreases to almost half of that in the system with only cholesterol, except for PC-rich systems. In general, the different structures of aggregates considerably influence the maximum solubilization of sterols but not the selectivity of cholesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol in the competitive solubilization. The Gibbs energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) of the solubilization of \u03b2-sitosterol showed a more negative value than cholesterol by \u22124 to \u22126\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121, which indicates that \u03b2-sitosterol is energetically favored relative to cholesterol in the model intestinal solution, regardless of the different systems.",

In the present work, we studied the effect of soy PI on physical properties of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes such as phase state of lipid bilayer, lipid packing and phase properties using multiple orthogonal biophysical techniques. The 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylamino naphthalene (Laurdan) fluorescence studies showed that presence of PI induces the formation of fluid phases in DMPC. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature dependent fluorescence anisotropy measurements, and generalized polarization values for Laurdan showed that the presence of as low as 10\u00a0mol% of PI induces substantial broadening and shift to lower temperature of phase transition of DMPC. The fluorescence emission intensity of DPH labeled, PI containing DMPC lipid bilayer decreased possibly due to deeper penetration of water molecules in lipid bilayer. In order to further delineate the effect of PI on the physico chemical properties of DMPC is due to either significant hydrophobic mismatch between the acyl chains of the DMPC and that of soy PI or due to the inositol head group, we systematically replaced soy PI with PC species of similar acyl chain composition (DPPC and 18:2 (Cis) PC) or with diacylglycerol (DAG), respectively. The anisotropy of PC membrane containing soy PI showed largest fluidity change compared to other compositions. The data suggests that addition of PI alters structure and dynamics of DMPC bilayer in that it promotes deeper water penetration in the bilayer, induces fluid phase characteristics and causes lipid packing defects that involve its inositol head group.",

Using the lipid molecular volume from densitometry, it is then possible to obtain the bilayer thickness and hence, from the lamellar repeat spacing, the water layer thickness and degree of hydration of the lipid polar groups. This is done here by using the available data for bilayer-forming diacyl and dialkyl glycosylglycerols, and for certain glycosphingolipids. The lamellar crystalline phases of these glycolipids are largely anhydrous, and the degree of hydration of the lamellar gel phases is much lower than that of the corresponding phosphoglycerolipid gel phases. A point of current uncertainty is whether the chains in the gel phases of diacyl glycoglycerolipids are appreciably tilted, unlike their dialkyl counterparts.",

The primary thermal parameters (crystallization and melting temperatures) obtained from the DSC of the symmetrical molecules correspond well with the carbon numbers of the JLEs. However, the data also suggests that carbon number is not the only factor since the symmetry of the molecule also plays a significant role in the phase behavior. Overall, the JLEs show very little polymorphic activity at the experimental conditions used, suggesting that they are likely to transform the same way during melting as well as crystallization, a characteristic which may be useful in designing new waxes and lubricants. The XRD data clearly show that the solid phase in all samples consists of a mixture of a \u03b2-phase and a \u03b2\u2032-phase; fully distinguishable by their characteristic diffraction peaks. Subtle differences between the subcell patterns and phase development of the samples were observed. Different layering of the samples was also observed, understandably because of the chain length differences between the compounds. The long spacings were perfectly linearly proportional to the number of carbon atoms. The length of the ester layers with n carbon atoms can be calculated by a formula similar to that used for the layers in linear alkane molecules.",

     "abstract": "Cell-penetrating peptides are arginine- and lysine-rich cationic peptides that can readily enter cells not only by themselves but also carrying other macromolecular cargos. In fact, we have reported that polycationic polymer such as poly-l-lysine (PLL) and poly-l-arginine (PLA) translocate through negatively charged phospholipid liposome membranes. In this work, we made a comparative study of the interaction of PLL or PLA with lipid membranes consisting of negatively charged phospholipids to understand the role of basic amino acid residue (i.e. arginine and lysine) in the membrane-penetrating activity of polypeptides. PLA and PLL translocated into giant unilamellar vesicle composed of soybean phospholipids. \u03b6-potential and turbidity measurements demonstrated the electrostatic binding of PLL and PLA to large unilamellar vesicle (LUV). Fluorescence studies using membrane probes revealed that the binding of PLA and PLL to LUV affects the hydration and packing of the membrane interface region, in which the membrane insertion of PLA appeared to be greater than PLL. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the enthalpy of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition for dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol vesicle was greatly reduced by binding of PLL and PLA, in which the reduction is much larger in PLA than in PLL. Circular dichroism measurements in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol/water mixture or in the presence of LUV indicated that the propensity of PLA to form \u03b1-helical structure is greater than PLL. Consistently, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that there is greater \u03b1-helical structure in PLA bound to LUV compared to PLL, which has much less ordered structure. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry measurements demonstrated that the contribution of enthalpy to the energetics of binding to LUV is two-fold larger in PLA than in PLL. These results suggest that the stronger interaction of arginine residue with negatively charged phospholipid membranes compared to lysine residue appears to facilitate the conformational change in cationic polypeptide and its insertion into lipid membrane interior.",

The details of the phase transformation paths were obtained using the heating cycles of two sets of experiments: (a) cooling rate was varied and heating rate fixed and (b) cooling rate was fixed and heating rate varied. Kinetic effects were manifest in all measured properties, underscoring the complexity of the phase transformation paths for each TAG, and the intricate thermodynamics\u2013molecular relationships. For the first time, XRD data obtained for SSS, PSS and PPS TAGs, cooled at rates higher than 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C/min, suggested the formation of a transient structure similar to the so-called \u03b12-phase which has been observed in mixed saturated\u2013unsaturated TAGs quenched from the melt. The more stable phases (\u03b2\u2032 in PSS and PPS, and \u03b2 in SSS) were only observed for cooling rates lower than 1.0\u00a0\u00b0C/min. The kinetic and thermodynamic differences observed in the crystallization, structure and melting of SSS, PSS and PPS are proposed to be mainly due to the disturbances introduced at the \u201cterrace\u201d level via methyl-end group interactions, i.e., the missing of two or four CH2 groups compared to SSS. The symmetrical SSS with a relatively flat \u201cterrace\u201d crystallizes preferably in the most stable \u03b2-form. Two missing CH2 groups at the sn-1 position (PSS) introduces enough structural disturbances to promote the relative prevalence and persistence of the \u03b2\u2032-phase, and four missing CH2 groups at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (PPS) is relatively too large of a disturbance and therefore favors the \u03b1-form.",

Even though peptide-induced destabilization has been investigated extensively, little is known about the peptide side-chain and backbone orientation with respect to the bilayer that may contribute to a molecular understanding of the peptide-induced membrane perturbations.The main objective of this work is to provide a detailed description of the orientation of arginine peptides in the lipid bilayer of PC and negatively charged PG liposomes using ATR-IR spectroscopy and molecular modeling, and to relate these orientational preferences to lipid bilayer destabilization.Molecular modeling showed that above the transition temperature arginine side-chains are preferentially solvent-directed at the PC/water interface whereas several arginine side-chains are pointing towards the PG hydrophobic core. IR dichroic spectra confirmed the orientation of the arginine side chains perpendicular to the lipid\u2013water interface. IR spectra shows an randomly distributed backbone that seems essential to optimize interactions with the lipid membrane. The observed increase of permeation to a fluorescent dye is related to the peptide induced-formation of gauche bonds in the acyl chains. In the absence of hydrophobic residues, insertion of side-chains that favors phosphate/guanidium interaction is another mechanism of membrane permeabilization that has not been further analyzed so far.",

In this study, we analysed a series of extracellular lipid-related metabolites produced by the fungus and found that a wide variety of ceriporic acids and fatty acids, including those with odd-numbered and very long-chains, were produced in wood meal cultures. Two new ceriporic acids, (R)-3-[(Z)-tetradec-7-enyl]-itaconic acid (ceriporic acid E) and (R)-3-[(Z)-tetradec-5-enyl]-itaconic acid (ceriporic acid F), were for the first time identified by dimethyl disulfide derivatisation, followed by GC/EI-MS, 1H and homonuclear J-resolved 2D NMR and feeding experiments with [13C-U] glucose coupled with multiple-stage mass spectrometry. In separation by GC and LC, a reversed correlation of elution sequences between a nonpolar GC column and an ODS-LC column for cis and trans isomers of \u03c97 and \u03c99 lipids was found, and the elution of new metabolites was in accordance with the prevailing theory. The biosynthetic precursors of ceriporic acid F can be proposed as oxaloacetate and 16:1\u03947-CoA. Because fatty acids biosynthesised from 16:1\u03947-CoA have been reported for only a limited number of organisms, the highly individual structure of ceriporic acid F is highlighted.",

Kinetic phase diagrams were experimentally determined from the DSC heating thermograms and analyzed using a thermodynamic model to account for non-ideality of mixing. The kinetic phase diagram presented a typical eutectic behavior with a eutectic point at the 0.5PSS mixture with a probable precipitation line from 0.5PSS to 1.0PSS, regardless of the rate at which the sample was cooled. The eutectic temperature decreased only slightly with increasing cooling rate. PSS has a strong effect on the physical properties of the PSS\u2013SSS mixtures. In fact, the overall phase behavior of the PSS\u2013SSS binary system was determined, for a very large part, by the asymmetrical TAG. Moreover, PSS is a key driver of the high stability observed in crystal growth, polymorphism and phase development. Levels as low as 10% PSS, when cooled slowly, and 30% when cooled rapidly, were found to be sufficient to suppress the effect of thermal processing.",

Here, we report an efficient and novel method to simultaneously manufacture and incorporate super-paramagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (efficient target finder in the presence of external magnetic field) into the liposome's interior and its bilayer. In this technique, we use electric field to control the formation of liposomes and the incorporation of iron oxide nanoparticles.

To understand the unique wood-decaying mechanism, we surveyed the oxidized derivatives of ceriporic acids (alk(en)ylitaconic acids) produced by C. subvermispora using high-resolution liquid chromatography multiple-stage mass spectrometry (HR-LC/MSn). The analysis of the precursor and product ions from the extract suggested that an epoxidized derivative of ceriporic acid is produced by the fungus. To identify the new metabolite, an authentic compound of ceriporic acid epoxide was synthesized in vitro by reacting (R)-3-[(Z)-hexadec-7-enyl]-itaconic acid (ceriporic acid C) with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The precursor and product ions from the natural metabolite and authentic epoxide were identical and distinguishable from those of hydroxy and hydroperoxy derivatives after reduction with NaBD4. Feeding experiments with [U-13C]-glucose, 99% and the subsequent analyses of the first and second generation product ions demonstrated that the oxidized ceriporic acid was (R)-3-(7,8-epoxy-hexadecyl)-itaconic acid.

Our results show that large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of either the phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) or of 1:1 (mole ratio) DOPC and the fatty acid, oleic acid (OA), cause a three-fold increase in Vmax, depending on the lipid concentration and vesicle composition, but no change in Km. Further studies show lipids do not reverse the allosteric inhibitory effects of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) on BsPFK. SDS/PAGE studies do not show significant binding of the BsPFK tetramer to the surface of the phospholipid vesicles, suggesting that modulation of catalytic activity is due to binding of lipid monomers.

The results show that liposomes were the dominant aggregates in all the samples studied.

The peroxidation of linoleic acid (LA) in the absence and presence of Cu(II) ion\u2013ascorbate combinations was investigated in aerated and incubated emulsions at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 7. LA peroxidation induced by copper(II)\u2013ascorbic acid system followed first order kinetics with respect to hydroperoxides concentration. The extent of copper-initiated peroxide production in a LA system assayed by ferric thiocyanate method was used to determine possible antioxidant and prooxidant activities of the added flavonoids. The effects of three different flavonoids of similar structure, i.e. quercetin (QR), morin (MR) and catechin (CT), as potential antioxidant protectors were studied in the selected peroxidation system. The inhibitive order of flavonoids in the protection of LA peroxidation was: morin\u00a0>\u00a0catechin\u00a0\u2265\u00a0quercetin, i.e. agreeing with that of formal reduction potentials versus NHE at pH 7, i.e. 0.60, 0.57 and 0.33\u00a0V for MR, CT, and QR, respectively. Morin showed antioxidant effect at all concentrations whereas catechin and quercetin showed both antioxidant and prooxidant effects depending on their concentrations. The structural requirements for antioxidant activity in flavonoids interestingly coincide with those for Cu(II)-induced prooxidant activity, because as the reducing power of a flavonoid increases, Cu(II)\u2013Cu(I) reduction is facilitated that may end up with the production of reactive species. The findings of this study were evaluated in the light of structure\u2013activity relationships of flavonoids, and the results are believed to be useful to better understand the actual conditions where flavonoids may act as prooxidants in the preservation of heterogeneous food samples containing traces of transition metal ions.",

It is the intent of this investigation to correlate these interactions with the observed potency and selectivity against several different strains of bacteria. The CD spectra of these compounds in the presence of zwitterionic DPC micelles and anionic SDS micelles are very different indicating that these compounds adopt different conformations on binding to the surface of anionic and zwitterionic membrane models. These compounds also exhibited very different CD spectra in the presence of zwitterionic POPC and anionic mixed 4:1 POPC/POPG SUVs and LUVs, indicating the formation of different conformations on interaction with the two membrane types. This observation is also supported by ITC and calcein leakage data. ITC data suggested these peptides interact primarily with the surface of zwitterionic LUVs and was further supported by fluorescence experiments where the interactions do not appear to be concentration dependent. In the presence of anionic membranes, the interactions appear more complex and the calorimetric and fluorescence data both imply pore formation is dependent on peptide concentration.

Based on the observed differences in the mechanisms of interactions with zwitterionic and anionic LUVs these AMPs are potential candidates for further drug development.",

     "abstract": "Although much progress has been achieved in the development of cancer therapies in recent decades, problems continue to arise particularly with respect to chemotherapy due to resistance to and low specificity of currently available drugs. Host defense peptides as effector molecules of innate immunity represent a novel strategy for the development of alternative anticancer drug molecules. These cationic amphipathic peptides are able to discriminate between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells interacting specifically with negatively charged membrane components such as phosphatidylserine (PS), sialic acid or heparan sulfate, which differ between cancer and non-cancer cells. Furthermore, an increased number of microvilli has been found on cancer cells leading to an increase in cell surface area, which may in turn enhance their susceptibility to anticancer peptides. Thus, part of this review will be devoted to the differences in membrane composition of non-cancer and cancer cells with a focus on the exposure of PS on the outer membrane. Normally, surface exposed PS triggers apoptosis, which can however be circumvented by cancer cells by various means.Host defense peptides, which selectively target differences between cancer and non-cancer cell membranes, have excellent tumor tissue penetration and can thus reach the site of both primary tumor and distant metastasis. Since these molecules kill their target cells rapidly and mainly by perturbing the integrity of the plasma membrane, resistance is less likely to occur. Hence, a chapter will also describe studies related to the molecular mechanisms of membrane damage as well as alternative non-membrane related mechanisms. In vivo studies have demonstrated that host defense peptides display anticancer activity against a number of cancers such as e.g. leukemia, prostate, ascite and ovarian tumors, yet so far none of these peptides has made it on the market. Nevertheless, optimization of host defense peptides using various strategies to enhance further selectivity and serum stability is expected to yield novel anticancer drugs with improved properties in respect of cancer cell toxicity as well as reduced development of drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "Oxidation processes of lipids are of paramount interest from many viewpoints. For instance, oxidation processes are highly important under in vivo conditions because molecules with regulatory functions are generated by oxidation of lipids or free fatty acids. Additionally, many inflammatory diseases are accompanied by lipid oxidation and, therefore, oxidation products are also useful disease (bio)markers. Thus, there is also considerable interest in methods of (oxidized) lipid analysis.Nowadays, soft ionization mass spectrometric (MS) methods are regularly used to study oxidative lipid modifications due to their high sensitivities and the extreme mass resolution. Although electrospray ionization (ESI) MS is so far most popular, applications of matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) MS are increasing. This review aims to summarize the so far available data on MALDI analyses of oxidized lipids. In addition to model systems, special attention will be paid to the monitoring of oxidized lipids under in vivo conditions, particularly the oxidation of (human) lipoproteins. It is not the aim of this review to praise MALDI as the \u201cbest\u201d method but to provide a critical survey of the advantages and drawbacks of this method.",

Two isomers of CLA, that differ only in the location of cis and trans double bonds, are found to have distinct and different biological effects. The cis 9 trans 11 (C9T11) isomer is believed to have anti-carcinogenic effects, while the trans 10 cis 12 (T10C12) isomer is believed to be associated with anti-obesity effects. In this paper we extend earlier molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pure CLA\u2013phosphatidylcholine bilayers to investigate the comparative effects of cholesterol on bilayers composed of the two respective isomers. Simulations of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers in which the sn-2 chains contained one of the two isomers of CLA were performed in which, for each isomer, the simulated bilayers contained 10% and 30% cholesterol (Chol). From MD trajectories we calculate and compare structural properties of the bilayers, including areas per molecule, thickness of bilayers, tilt angle of cholesterols, order parameter profiles, and one and two-dimensional radial distribution function (RDF), as functions of Chol concentration. While the structural effect of cholesterol is approximately the same for both isomers, we find differences at an atomistic level in order parameter profiles and in two-dimensional radial distribution functions.",

     "abstract": "Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-labeling methods make it possible not only to discriminate the cholesterol bilayer domain (CBD) but also to obtain information about the organization and dynamics of cholesterol molecules in the CBD. The abilities of spin-label EPR were demonstrated for Chol/POPC (cholesterol/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine) membranes, with a Chol/POPC mixing ratio that changed from 0 to 3. Using the saturation-recovery (SR) EPR approach with cholesterol analogue spin labels, ASL and CSL, and oxygen or NiEDDA relaxation agents, it was confirmed that the CBD was present in all membrane suspensions when the mixing ratio exceeded the cholesterol solubility threshold (CST). Conventional EPR spectra of ASL and CSL in the CBD were similar to those in the surrounding POPC bilayer (which is saturated with cholesterol), indicating that in both domains, cholesterol exists in the lipid-bilayer-like structures. The behavior of ASL and CSL (and, thus, the behavior of cholesterol molecules) in the CBD was compared with that in the surrounding POPC-cholesterol domain (PCD). In the CBD, ASL and CSL molecules are better ordered than in the surrounding PCD. This difference is small and can be compared to that induced in the surrounding domain by an \u223c10\u00a0\u00b0C decrease in temperature. Thus, cholesterol molecules are unexpectedly dynamic in the CBD, which should enhance their interaction with the surrounding domain. The polarity of the water/membrane interface of the CBD is significantly greater than that of the surrounding PCD, which significantly enhances penetration of the water-soluble relaxation agent, NiEDDA, into that region. Hydrophobicity measured in the centers of both domains is similar. The oxygen transport parameter (oxygen diffusion-concentration product) measured in the center of the CBD is about ten times smaller than that measured in the center of the surrounding domain. Thus, the CBD can form a significant barrier to oxygen transport. The results presented here point out similarities between the organization and dynamics of cholesterol molecules in the CBD and in the surrounding PCD, as well as significant differences between CBDs and cholesterol crystals.",

     "abstract": "It is now well established that dietary lipids are incorporated into macrophage and T-cell membrane microdomains, altering their structure and function. Within cell membranes, there are specific detergent-resistant domains in which key signal transduction proteins are localized. These regions are classified as \u201clipid rafts\u201d. Rafts are composed mostly of cholesterol and sphingolipids and therefore do not integrate well into the fluid phospholipid bilayers causing them to form microdomains. Upon cell activation, rafts compartmentalize signal-transducing molecules, thus providing an environment conducive to signal transduction. In this review, we discuss recent novel data describing the effects of n\u22123 PUFA on alterations in the activation and functions of macrophages and T-cells. We believe that the modifications in these two disparate immune cell types are linked by fundamentally similar changes in membrane lipid composition and transmembrane signaling functions. We conclude that the outcomes of n\u22123 PUFA-mediated immune cell alterations may be beneficial (e.g., anti-inflammatory) or detrimental (e.g., loss of microbial immunity) depending upon the cell type interrogated.",

There has been intense interest in characterizing the \u201cstem cell niche\u201d in recent years and an emerging consensus that stem cells are located in regions of low oxygen tension and probably well-isolated from the blood supply.We report here the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to monitor changes in the composition and saturation degree of choline phospholipids of hematopoietic progenitor (FDCPmix) cells under standard nutrient-rich culture conditions and at low oxygen and low glucose concentrations.

     "abstract": "Mixtures of ceramides with other lipids in the presence of water are key components of the structure of the lipid matrix of the stratum corneum and are involved in lateral phase separation processes occurring in lipid membranes. Besides their structural role, ceramides are functional for cell signaling and trafficking. We elected, as our object of study, a mixture of N-hexadecanoylceroyl-d-erythro-sphyngosine, C16-Cer, with cholesterol, Ch, in a molar proportion 54:46 in excess water to which palmitic acid, PA, is added in varying amounts. The chosen C16-Cer:Ch proportion replicates the relative abundance of ceramides and cholesterol found in the stratum corneum lipid matrix. For each lipidic composition, we identify the phases in equilibrium and study the thermotropism of the system, using differential scanning calorimetry and temperature-dependent small and wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction. Since the molecular aggregation of the system and its mesoscopic properties are affected by the degree of protonation of the PA, we explore mixtures with several PA contents at two extreme pH values, 9.0 and 4.0. A specific C16-Cer:Ch:PA composition forms at pH 9.0 a lamellar crystalline aggregate, to which we attribute the stoichiometry C16-Cer5Ch4PA2, that melts at 88\u201390\u00a0\u00b0C to give a HII phase. For pH values at which there is partial or total protonation of PA another LC C16-Cer:Ch (2:3) stoichiometric aggregate is observed, identical to that previously reported for C16-Cer:Ch mixtures (Souza et al., 2009, J. Phys. Chem. B, 113, 1367\u20131375), coexisting with a lamellar fluid phase. For pH 4.0 and 7.0, the existing lamellar liquid crystalline converts into a isotropic fluid phase at high temperatures. It is also found that the miscibility of PA in the C16-Cer:Ch mixture at pH 4.0 does not exceed ca. 18\u00a0mol%, but for pH 9.0 no free PA is detected at least until 60\u00a0mol%.",

     "abstract": "Water-dilutable microemulsions were prepared and loaded with two types of omega-3 fatty acid esters (omega-3 ethyl esters, OEE; and omega-3 triacylglycerides, OTG), each separately and together with ubiquinone (CoQ10). The microemulsions showed high and synergistic loading capabilities. The linear fatty acid ester (OEE) solubilization capacity was greater than that of the bulky and robust OTG.The location of the guest molecules within the microemulsions at any dilution point were determined by electrical conductivity, viscosity, DSC, SAXS, cryo-TEM, SD-NMR, and DLS.We found that OEE molecules pack well within the surfactant tails to form reverse micelles that gradually, upon water dilution, invert into bicontinuous phase and finally into O/W droplets. The CoQ10 increases the stabilization and solubilization of the omega-3 fatty acid esters because it functions as a kosmotropic agent in the micellar system. The hydrophobic and bulky OTG molecule strongly interferes with the tail packing and spaces them significantly \u2013 mainly in the low and medium range water dilutions. When added to the micellar system, CoQ10 forms some reverse hexagonal mesophases. The inversion into direct micelles is more difficult in comparison to the OEE system and requires additional water dilution. The OTG with or without CoQ10 destabilizes the structures and decreases the solubilization capacity since it acts as a chaotropic agent to the micellar system and as a kosmotropic agent to hexagonal packing. These results explain the differences in the behavior of these molecules with vehicles that solubilize them in aqueous phases.Temperature disorders the bicontinuous structures and reduces the supersaturation of the system containing OEE with CoQ10; as a result CoQ10 crystallization is retarded.",

     "abstract": "Cholesteryl esters (CE) are not generally abundant but are ubiquitous in living organisms and have markedly different properties from cholesterol because of their acyl chain. The miscibility/immiscibility of CE with biological lipid structures is a key property for their functions. In this work we study the solubility of cholesteryl oleate (ChO) in a model of the stratum corneum lipid matrix composed of ceramide C16, cholesterol and palmitic acid in excess water. Experiments were done in conditions of fully ionized (pH\u00a0=\u00a09.0) and fully neutralized fatty acid (pH\u00a0=\u00a04.0), and differential scanning calorimetry of the ternary mixtures with added ChO at pH\u00a0=\u00a09.0 clearly displayed a main transition with the same maximum temperature, peak shape, and enthalpy, suggesting that ChO was excluded from the remaining lipids. This technique is not conclusive at pH\u00a0=\u00a04.0 because the transitions of the lipid matrix and ChO overlap. The insolubility of ChO at both pH values is supported by X-ray diffraction. Adding the ceramide:cholesterol:fatty acid lipid mixture to ChO did not change the X-ray pattern of the mixture nor that of the ChO. To supplement the above physical techniques, we applied 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy with C-13 carbonyl-labeled ChO. A single 13C carbonyl peak from the ChO at 171.5\u00a0ppm was observed, indicating exposure to only one environment. The chemical shift was identical to pure ChO below and above the temperature of isotropic liquid formation. Taken together, our results lead to the conclusion that the solubility of ChO is negligible in the ceramide:cholesterol:fatty acid lipid mixture.",

Our results demonstrate that the modulation of membrane curvature in these systems depends not only on the nature of the sterol, but also on the acyl chain composition of the phospholipids used.

     "abstract": "Melatonin and its structural analogues display antioxidant activity in vivo but their activity in model membranes is not very well known. In this study, we have investigated the antioxidant capacity of melatonin and structural analogues on Fe2+-initiated peroxidation of sonicated liposomes made of retinal lipids. The indoleamines were evaluated against butylated hydroxitoluene (BHT) which was chosen as a reference standard because of its high antioxidant capacity. After the addition of Fe2+ as initiator of lipid peroxidation, quick production of conjugated dienes was observed. With addition of increasing concentrations of BHT the start of the reaction was delayed and initial reaction rates were lower. However, this reduction was not proportional to the increase in concentration. The start of the reaction and initial reaction rates were not modified in the presence of melatonin and its structural analogues. The formation of TBARS started immediately after the addition of Fe2+. The increase in the concentration of BHT avoided the emergence of TBARS. Changes were not observed in the presence of melatonin or structural analogues. Retinal lipids showed a high content of docosahexaenoic (22: 6 \u03944,7,10,13,16,19) acid, characteristic of this tissue. A little bit of that fatty acid was lost when sonicated liposomes were prepared with these retinal lipids. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) diminished significantly after incubation of liposomes with Fe2+ during 1\u00a0h. BHT preserved PUFAs whereas melatonin and its related indoleamines did not. These data reinforce the hypothesis that melatonin and structural analogues do not possess antioxidant properties per se in this liposomal model system.",

     "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is increasingly used to characterize (phospho)lipids. However, quantitative MALDI data are often questioned because ion suppression may occur if mixtures are analyzed. Therefore, relative (but no absolute) data are normally derived from the MALDI mass spectra of lipid mixtures. We are particularly interested in the phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine (PC/LPC) ratio because it seems to represent a suitable measure of the inflammatory activity. In this study, different parameters affecting the achievable accuracy of the MALDI-TOF MS determination of the PC/LPC ratio are compared. It will be shown that particularly the applied laser fluence as well as the used solvents influence the accuracies. Using artificial lipid mixtures it will be demonstrated that the PC/LPC ratio can be determined with an accuracy of about \u00b110% making the MALDI assay comparable to established methods. Finally, it will be shown that the optimized conditions are also useful to determine the PC/LPC ratios in human seminal plasma.",

     "abstract": "Oxysterols are present in mammalian brain at ng/g\u2013\u03bcg/g levels while cholesterol is present at the mg/g level. This makes oxysterol analysis of brain challenging. In an effort to meet this challenge we have developed, and validated, an isolation method based on solid phase extraction and an analytical protocol involving oxidation/derivatisation (i.e., charge-tagging) followed by nano-flow liquid chromatography (nano-LC) combined with tandem mass spectrometry utilising multi-stage fragmentation (MSn). The oxidation/derivatisation method employed improves detection limits by two orders of magnitude, while nano-LC\u2013MSn provides separation of isomers and allows oxysterol quantification. Using this method 13 different oxysterols have been identified in rat brain including 24S-hydroxycholesterol, 24S,25-epoxycholesterol and 7\u03b1,26-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one. The level of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in rat brain was determined to be 20.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0\u03bcg/g and quantitative estimates were made for the other oxysterols identified. The presence of a large excess of cholesterol over oxysterol in brain raises the problem of autoxidation during sterol isolation and sample preparation. Thus, in parallel to identification studies, the degree of cholesterol autoxidation occurring during sterol isolation and analysis has been evaluated with the aid of [2H7]-labelled cholesterol and cholesterol autoxidation products identified.",

     "abstract": "High dose daily intake of plant sterols decreases the uptake of cholesterol in the intestine by competitive mechanisms and thus leads to reduced serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol. By this, the commercialization of plant sterol enriched \u2018functional food\u2019 products is rapidly increasing. Subjects using these kinds of diet present a duplication of their serum plant sterol levels after long-term intake. In analogy to cholesterol, plant sterols such as campesterol and sitosterol can be oxidized to oxyphytosterols and these may counteract the primary anti-atherosclerotic action of cholesterol lowering. In order to investigate the whole spectrum of the consequences following high plant sterol intake a highly sensitive and specific isotope dilution gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry method for the analysis of 7-oxygenated campesterol/sitosterol in trace amounts in human serum is presented in this paper. The validation was based on limits for detection and quantification, recovery, precision and minimization of autoxidation during work-up. Our results show an overall coefficient of variation \u226410% for the precision. The lowest limits for detection and quantification for 7\u03b1-hydroxy-campesterol were 7\u00a0pg/mL and 23\u00a0pg/mL, respectively. Data for overall sum recovery ranged from 92% to 115%. We practically used this method for analysis of oxyphytosterols simultaneously with plant sterol concentrations in serum from healthy volunteers. Sixteen subjects were treated with plant sterol enriched margarine (3\u00a0g/day) for 28\u00a0days. The results showed a significant increase of the oxyphytosterol 7\u03b2-hydroxy-sitosterol from 1.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54 (before intake) to 2.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.24\u00a0ng/mL (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD; +86.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) after intake of the margarine. There was a highly significant correlation between the serum levels of campesterol and the sum of 7-oxygenated campesterol (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.915; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and sitosterol and the sum of 7-oxygenated sitosterol (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.915; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We can conclude from this study that the analytic method is well suited for detection of OPS, even at trace amounts.",

     "abstract": "Tamoxifen is one of the major drugs used for the hormonotherapy of estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. However, its therapeutic efficacy can be limited by acquired resistance and tumor recurrence can occur after several years of treatment. Tamoxifen is known as the prototypical modulator of estrogen receptors, but other targets have been identified that could account for its pharmacology. In particular, tamoxifen binds with high affinity to the microsomal antiestrogen binding site (AEBS) and inhibits cholesterol esterification at therapeutic doses. We have recently shown that the AEBS was a hetero-oligomeric complex composed of 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u0394(8)-\u0394(7)-isomerase and 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u0394(7)-reductase, that binds different structural classes of ligands, including selective estrogen receptor modulators, several sigma receptor ligands, poly-unsaturated fatty acids and ring B oxysterols. We established a link between the modulation of cholesterol metabolism by tamoxifen and other AEBS ligands and their capacity to induce breast cancer cell differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, we showed that the AEBS carries out cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase activity and established that cholesterol-5,6-epoxide hydrolase is a new target for tamoxifen and other AEBS ligands. Finally in this review, we report on recent data from the literature showing how the modulation of cholesterol and oxysterol metabolism can be linked to the antitumor and chemopreventive properties of tamoxifen, and give new perspectives to improve the clinical outcome of the hormonotherapy of breast cancers.",

     "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and diabetes mellitus and statin treatment affect cholesterol metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate markers of cholesterol metabolism and determine their relationship with CVD in patients without diabetes mellitus who were not receiving statin treatment.In addition to conventional CVD risk factors, plasma levels of campesterol and sitosterol (indicators of cholesterol absorption) and lathosterol (an indicator of cholesterol synthesis) were determined in 835 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography. Coronary artery disease was evaluated by coronary angiograms, carotid atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease were assessed by Doppler ultrasound, and cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks were identified by medical history.After excluding patients with known diabetes mellitus and those receiving statin treatment, 177 patients were included in the analysis. Compared to patients without CVDs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111), patients with concomitant CVDs (n\u00a0=\u00a066) had a reduced lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio (1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 vs. 1.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and an increased campesterol-to-cholesterol ratio (1.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04 vs. 1.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that enhanced absorption and reduced synthesis of cholesterol is associated with CVD development. Logistic regression analysis including all established cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, total cholesterol, arterial hypertension, body mass index and smoking) revealed that campesterol and the campesterol-to-cholesterol ratio were significant predictors of concomitant CVD in this patient population.In patients without diabetes mellitus, markers of enhanced cholesterol absorption were a strong predictor for concomitant CVD.",

     "abstract": "Cholesterol has many functions, including those that affect biophysical properties of membranes, and is a precursor to hormone synthesis. These actions are governed by enzymatic pathways that modify the sterol nucleus or the isooctyl tail. The addition of oxygen to the cholesterol backbone produces its derivatives known as oxysterols. In addition to having an enzymatic origin, oxysterols can be formed in the absence of enzymatic catalysis in a pathway usually termed \u201cautoxidation,\u201d which has been known for almost a century and observed under various experimental conditions. Autoxidation of cholesterol can occur through reactions initiated by free radical species, such as those arising from the superoxide/hydrogen peroxide/hydroxyl radical system and by non-radical highly reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen, HOCl, and ozone. The susceptibility of cholesterol to non-enzymatic oxidation has raised considerable interest in the function of oxysterols as biological effectors and potential biomarkers for the non-invasive study of oxidative stress in vivo.",

Foam cells are formed by cellular uptake and storage of atherogenic lipoproteins, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL). Dissection of oxLDL- and eLDL-induced cellular phenotypes indicates that these two LDL-modifications are coupled with two fundamentally different cellular responses in macrophages. Oxidized LDL preferentially up-regulates scavenger receptors required for its internalization, induces preferential lipid storage in the acidic compartment resembling drug-induced endolysosomal phospholipidosis, parallel with increased cellular content of the endolysosomal signature lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate, pro-apoptotic signalling and appearance of ceramide-enriched surface membrane microdomains. By contrast, challenge of macrophages by eLDL leads to expanded cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-enriched surface membrane microdomains, up-regulation of diverse pattern recognition receptors required for phagocytosis of eLDL, parallel with extensive lipid droplet formation, increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and membrane contact site formation for interorganelle trafficking and signalling, and enhanced cellular content of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin.This review focuses on biological activities of oxLDL and eLDL in human macrophages, and discusses some lipidomic considerations related to foam cell formation and phospholipidosis.",

     "abstract": "Ionised calcium (Ca2+) is a key second messenger, regulating almost every cellular process from cell death to muscle contraction. Cytosolic levels of this ion can be increased via gating of channel proteins located in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and other membrane-delimited organelles. Ca2+ can be removed from cells by extrusion across the plasma membrane, uptake into organelles and buffering by anionic components. Ca2+ channels and extrusion mechanisms work in concert to generate diverse spatiotemporal patterns of this second messenger, the distinct profiles of which determine different cellular outcomes. Increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration are one of the most rapid cellular responses upon exposure to certain oxysterol congeners or to oxidised low-density lipoprotein, occurring within seconds of addition and preceding increases in levels of reactive oxygen species, or changes in gene expression. Furthermore, exposure of cells to oxysterols for periods of hours to days modulates Ca2+ signal transduction, with these longer-term alterations in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis potentially underlying pathological events within atherosclerotic lesions, such as hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictors observed in vascular smooth muscle, or ER stress-induced cell death in macrophages. Despite their candidate roles in physiology and disease, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that couple changes in oxysterol concentrations to alterations in Ca2+ signalling. This review examines the ways in which oxysterols could influence Ca2+ signal transduction and the potential roles of this in health and disease.",

     "abstract": "Free cholesterol is the predominant form of cholesterol in the neural retina. The vertebrate neural retina exhibits its own capacity to synthesize cholesterol and meets its demand also by taking it from the circulation. Defects in cholesterol synthesis and trafficking in the neural retina has detrimental consequences on its structure and function, highlighting the crucial importance of maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the retina. Our purpose was to give a review on the functioning of the retina, the role of cholesterol and cholesterol metabolism therein, with special emphasis on cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). Similar to the brain, the retina expresses cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and is enriched in its metabolic product, 24S-hydroxycholesterol. We recently published that one single nucleotide polymorphism in CYP46A1 gene, designated as rs754203, was a risk factor for glaucoma. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting more than 60 million people. Glaucoma is characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells, which show high CYP46A1 expression. These data suggest the potential involvement of CYP46A1 and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the pathophysiology of glaucoma.",

     "abstract": "In the central nervous system cholesterol is involved in membrane structure and function. Since the blood\u2013brain barrier efficiently prevents cholesterol uptake from the circulation, de novo synthesis is responsible for almost all cholesterol present there. In mature brain neurons down regulate their cholesterol synthesis and rely on delivery from ApoE lipoproteins secreted by astrocytes. ApoE transcription is regulated by 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) released by neurons, via LXR. In order to maintain homeostasis, excess of cholesterol is converted into 24OHC by the neuronal specific cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). The brain is the major source of circulating 24OHC. Plasma levels of 24OHC reflect the number of metabolically active neurons in the brain and thus, the volume of the grey matter structures. In neurodegenerative disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer and Huntington disease, plasma 24OHC was found reduced proportionally to the degree of brain atrophy as measured by MRI.Less than 1% of the total excretion of 24OHC occurs via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This small fraction appears to reflect neuronal damage and rate of neuronal loss rather than the total number of metabolically active neuronal cells. In CSF form patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases, increased levels of 24OHC were found. In case of Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD patients, the CSF concentration of 24OHC was correlated with CSF ApoE, cholesterol and Tau. CSF tau is considered related to the neurodegenerative process in AD, ApoE and cholesterol are involved in the \u03b2-amyloid deposition. It is likely that during process of neurodegeneration, the excess of cholesterol converted into 24OHC in neurons up-regulate the expression of ApoE proportionally to the amount of neurodegeneration. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), formed outside the brain, cross the blood\u2013brain barrier proportionally to the barrier dysfunction. There is a positive correlation between levels of cholesterol and 27OHC in the circulation. This oxysterol antagonizes the preventive effect of 24OHC on generation of \u03b2-amyloid. A rare hereditary disease, SPG5, due to mutation at CYP7B1, is characterized by massive neurodegeneration associated to high plasma and CSF 27OHC. Since its CSF levels were found higher in MCI and AD patients, 27OHC may be the link between hypercholesterolemia and AD.In conclusion the analysis of oxysterols in plasma and CSF seems to contribute to investigate the role of cholesterol metabolism in pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and is helpful in the study of patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases.",

The efficacy of the different pathways to regulate bile acid synthesis through short heterodimer partner (SHP) dependent FXR modulation in liver, and SHP independent activation via FGF19 is demonstrated. Characteristic changes of the bile acid profile during an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) were investigated in 73 individuals. 15 bile acid species including conjugated and unconjugated forms were quantitatively determined with LC\u2013MS/MS in serum samples collected at three time points during the oGTT. All conjugated bile acid species showed the same time course, a significant increase at 60\u00a0min after the glucose intake and an incline at 120\u00a0min. In contrast, a consistent decline of all unconjugated bile acids was monitored. 7\u03b1-Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, an early bile acid synthesis marker, showed an inverse response with a significant decrease at 60\u00a0min which proves the efficient and rapid downregulation of CYP7A1 via FXR activation through bile acid signaling. Significantly higher levels of FGF19 were observed 120\u00a0min after glucose intake and 60\u00a0min after bile acid excursion.",

Sunburn is a self-limiting inflammation offering a convenient and accessible system for the study of human cutaneous lipid metabolism. Recent lipidomic applications have revealed that a wider diversity of eicosanoids may be involved in the sunburn response than previously appreciated. This article reviews the effects of UVR on cutaneous lipids and examines the contribution of bioactive lipid mediators in the development of sunburn. Since human skin is an active site of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism, and these macronutrients can influence the production of eicosanoids/bioactive lipids, as well as modulate cell signalling, gene expression and oxidative stress, the application of PUFA as potential photoprotective agents is also considered.",

Here, as an illustration of the power of such analyses we investigated lung phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in Surfactant Protein-D (SP-D) null mice. These animals develop emphysema, foamy alveolar macrophages and an alveolar lipoproteinosis with increasing age. We used the incorporation of methyl-9-[2H] choline chloride coupled with ESI-MS/MS to quantify absolute rates of lung surfactant PC synthesis and secretion in an SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mouse model, together with an analysis of the molecular specificity of lung PC synthesis. PC synthetic rates were comparable in control (0.52\u00a0\u03bcmol/lung/h) and SP-D\u2212/\u2212 (0.69\u00a0\u03bcmol/lung/h) mice, as were rates of surfactant PC secretion (29.8 and 30.6\u00a0nmol/lung/h, respectively). Increased lung PC in the SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mouse was due to impaired catabolism, with a rate of accumulation of 0.057\u00a0\u03bcmol/lung/h. The relatively low rates of surfactant PC secretion compared with total lung PC synthesis were compatible with a suggested ABCA1-mediated basolateral lipid efflux from alveolar type II epithelial cells. Finally, PC molecular species analysis suggested that a proportion of newly synthesised PC is secreted rapidly into the lung air spaces in both control and SP-D\u2212/\u2212 mice before significant PC acyl remodelling occurs.",

SEC analysis showed an increase of protein aggregation during LDL-oxidation that could be essentially suppressed in the presence of HSA. In parallel, lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS assay over 24\u00a0h was inhibited by 95\u2013100% in the presence of HSA but only 0\u201334% by IgG, respectively. MALDI phospholipid profiles showed considerable decrease of signals from PCs containing sn-2 PUFAs (18:2 or 20:4) accompanied by increase of sn-2 LPCs indicating for specific breakdown of PUFA-containing PLs during LDL-oxidation. These effects were nearly 100% inhibited in the presence of HSA but not by IgG, respectively. Among known pro-atherogenic PL species present in human plasma sphingomyelin (SM16:0) was bound in significant amounts to HSA but not IgG after incubation with oxLDL.

Freeze fracture electron microscopy and light scattering showed that regardless of the hydrating fluid, all the non-ionic surfactants, with the exception of 2C16E17 and 2C18E17, formed vesicles in the absence of cholesterol \u2013 2C16E17 and 2C18E17 instead formed micellar aggregates. All surfactants, however, formed vesicles in the presence of 50\u00a0mol% cholesterol. Small angle neutron scattering studies of the surfactant vesicles enabled the bilayer thickness and repeat distance (d-spacing) to be determined. The bilayers formed by all the non-ionic surfactants in the absence of cholesterol were surprisingly thin (\u223c50\u00a0\u00c5 for the E12 containing surfactants and \u223c64\u00a0\u00c5 for 2C18E16) most likely due to the intrusion of oxyethylene groups into the hydrophobic core of the bilayers. In contrast, however, the non-ionic surfactants exhibited a relatively large d-spacing of around \u223c130\u2013150\u00a0\u00c5. The addition of 50\u00a0mol% cholesterol had a dramatic effect on the thickness of the vesicle bilayer, increasing its size by 10\u201320\u00a0\u00c5, most probably because of an extrusion of oxyethylene from the hydrophobic region of the bilayer and/or a reduction in the tilt on the surfactant alkyl chains. Additionally the presence of cholesterol in a vesicle tended to reduce slightly both the d-spacing and the thickness of the water layer separating the bilayers. The presence of NaCl, even at the low concentrations used in the study, did affect the properties of the bilayer such that it reduced the d-spacing and, in the case of cholesterol-containing systems, also reduced bilayer thickness.",

Experimental methods using GUVs, such as the single GUV method, would benefit if there was a methodology for obtaining a large population of similar-sized GUVs composed of oil-free membranes. We here describe a new membrane filtering method for purifying GUVs prepared by the natural swelling method and demonstrate that, following purification of GUVs composed of dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG)/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) membranes suspended in a buffer, similar-sized GUVs with diameters of 10\u201330\u00a0\u03bcm are obtained. Moreover, this method enabled GUVs to be separated from water-soluble fluorescent probes and LUVs. These results suggest that the membrane filtering method can be applied to GUVs prepared by other methods to purify larger-sized GUVs from smaller GUVs, LUVs, and various water-soluble substances such as proteins and fluorescent probes. This method can also be used for concentration of dilute GUV suspensions.",

The mole fraction of OA, XOA, was varied in the range of 0\u20131 and the total lipid content was constant and equal to 10\u00a0mM. The DODAB/OA dispersions were extruded at a temperature higher than that of the gel\u2013liquid transition of DODAB. The morphology of bilayer structures formed in the dispersions was inspected using a cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and a differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC). The observations revealed that the incorporation of OA into DODAB bilayer results in a decrease of the membrane curvature. Anisotropy measurements using 1,6-diphenylhexatriene (DPH) as a rotator probe demonstrated that the DODAB/OA membrane microviscosity decreased considerably for XOA\u00a0>\u00a00.4. The thermal behavior of DODAB/OA membranes has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the case of the systems in which XOA\u00a0<\u00a00.8, the DODAB/OA membranes are in the gel phase at room temperature. Additionally, Langmuir monolayer experiments of the DODAB/OA mixtures showed that due to the electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged head groups of DODAB and OA they get close to each other, which results in a decrease of the mean area per molecule. The results were next discussed based on the packing parameter concept. The reduction of the mean area per head group (a) in the DODAB/OA systems leads to subsequent increase in the so-called packing parameter (S), which governs the morphology of surfactant aggregates.",

     "abstract": "The goal of the present study is to elucidate the effect of sphingomyelin on interfacial binding of Taiwan cobra phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Substitution of Asn-1 with Met caused a reduction in enzymatic activity and membrane-damaging activity of PLA2 toward phospholipid vesicles, while sphingomyelin exerted an inhibitory effect on the biological activities of native and mutated PLA2. Incorporation of sphingomyelin reduced membrane fluidity of phospholipid vesicles as evidenced by Laurdan fluorescence measurement. The results of self-quenching studies, binding of fluorescent probe, trinitrophenylation of Lys residues and fluorescence energy transfer between protein and lipid revealed that sphingomyelin altered differently membrane-bound mode of native and mutated PLA2. Moreover, it was found that PLA2 and N-terminally mutated PLA2 adopted different conformation and geometrical arrangement on binding with membrane bilayer. Nevertheless, the binding affinity of PLA2 and N-terminal mutant for phospholipid vesicles was not greatly affected by sphingomyelin. Together with the finding that mutation on N-terminus altered the gross conformation of PLA2, our data indicate that sphingomyelin modulates the mode of membrane binding of PLA2 at water/lipid interface, and suggest that the modulated effect of sphingomyelin depends on inherent structural elements of PLA2.",

In this way, the effect of ionization of SA on the interaction and thus on phase separation with the DMPC matrix can be analyzed. To this purpose, we first determined the ionization state of pure SA monolayers as a function of the bulk subphase pH. The SA monolayers are nearly fully ionized at pH 10 and essentially neutral at pH 4 and the mixture of DMPC and SA was studied at those two pHs. We found that the DMPC-enriched phase admits more SA if the SA monolayer is in a liquid-expanded state, which is highly related to the acid ionization state, and thus to the bulk pH and ionic strength. At pH 4 the molecules hardly mix while at pH 10 the mixed monolayer with DMPC can admit between 30 and 100% of SA (depending on the lateral pressure) before phase separation is established. The addition of calcium ions to the subphase has a condensing effect on SA monolayers at all pHs and the solubility of SA in the DMPC matrix does not depend on the bulk pH in these conditions. The observed phase diagrams are independent on the manner in which the state of the mixed film is reached and may thus be considered states of apparent equilibrium.",

Atp7b\u2212/\u2212 mice accumulate copper in the liver and serve as an animal model for this inherited disease. The molecular mechanism of copper toxicity in hepatocytes is poorly understood. Total mitochondrial lipids from liver of wild-type mice were subjected to oxidative stress by the Cu2+/H2O2/ascorbate system. Phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylhydroxyacetone (PHA) were detected as cardiolipin fragmentation products by thin-layer chromatography combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in oxidized samples, but not in unperturbed ones. The formation of PA and PHA in copper-treated model membrane correlated well with the decrease of cardiolipin. Mitochondrial lipids from Atp7b\u2212/\u2212 mice of different age were analyzed for the presence of PA. While 32-weeks old wild-type (control) and Atp7b\u2212/\u2212 mice did not show any PA, there was a steady increase in the amount of this lipid in Atp7b\u2212/\u2212 mice in contrast to control with increasing age. Hepatocytes from elder Atp7b\u2212/\u2212mice contained morphologically changed mitochondria unlike cells from wild-type animals of the same age. We concluded that free-radical fragmentation of cardiolipin with the formation of PA is a likely mechanism that damages mitochondria under conditions of oxidative stress due to copper overload.

     "abstract": "Lipid rafts are cholesterol (Chol)-rich microdomains floating in a sea of lipid bilayers. Chol is thought to interact preferentially with sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) rather than with glycerophospholipids, and this putative SM\u2013Chol interaction is generally recognized as a requirement for raft formation. However, the presence of the specific interaction is still controversial, primarily because of the lack of useful molecular probes for scrutinizing this interaction. Recently, we reported that the dynamic properties of 6-F-Chol in DMPC bilayers are similar to those of unmodified Chol. Hence, in the present study, we first compared the roles of 6-F-Chol and Chol in SM bilayers through detergent insolubility, fluorescence polarization, and 2H NMR experiments. The results demonstrated that 6-F-Chol and Chol behave similarly in SM bilayers, whereas, in SM\u2013DOPC membranes, 6-F-Chol is less effective in domain formation. Then, we analyzed the molecular orientation of 6-F-Chol in SM bilayers using solid-state NMR, and found that the dynamics and orientation of 6-F-Chol in SM bilayers are almost identical to those in DMPC bilayers. This supports the notion of the lack of a putative specific interaction between SM and Chol. Thus, this study demonstrates the utility of 6-F-Chol as a molecular probe for understanding molecular recognition in lipid rafts.",

In the current work, in vitro water vapor uptake and surfactant absorption onto skin lipid model films were quantitatively studied using a technique based on the piezoelectric effect, the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). This approach is straightforward and reliable in providing subtle surface/interface related mass change information with high resolution and sensitivity. The results show that barrier properties of the lipid model system may be damaged by surfactant absorption, as well as by long-term water exposure due to alterations to the lipid film structure. Surfactant absorption is found to be concentration dependent even beyond its critical micelle concentration (CMC). QCM results for different surfactant systems are consistent with reported clinical data in showing that clinically milder surfactants (SLES) do not perturb the film as much as clinically harsh surfactants (SDS).",

     "abstract": "The presence of charged lipids in the cell membrane constitutes the background for the interaction with numerous membrane proteins. As a result, the valence of the lipids plays an important role concerning their lateral organization in the membrane and therefore the very manner of this interaction. This present study examines this aspect, particularly regarding to the interaction of the anionic lipid DPPS with the highly basic charged effector domain of the MARCKS protein, examined in monolayer model systems. Film balance, fluorescence microscopy and X-ray reflection/diffraction measurements were used to study the behavior of DPPS in a mixture with DPPC for its dependance on the presence of MARCKS (151\u2013175). In the mixed monolayer, both lipids are completely miscible therefore DPPS is incorporated in the ordered crystalline DPPC domains as well. The interaction of MARCKS peptide with the mixed monolayer leads to the formation of lipid/peptide clusters causing an elongation of the serine group of the DPPS up to 7\u00a0\u00c5 in direction to surface normal into the subphase. The large cationic charge of the peptide pulls out the serine group of the interface which simultaneously causes an elongation of the phosphodiester group of the lipid fraction too. The obtained results were used to compare the interaction of MARCKS peptide with the polyvalent PIP2 in mixed monolayers. On this way we surprisingly find out, that the relative small charge difference of the anionic lipids causes a significant different interaction with MARCKS (151\u2013175). The lateral arrangement of the anionic lipids depends on their charge values and determines the diffusion of the electrostatic binding clusters within the membrane.",

     "abstract": "In the paper, we present an improved method for evaluation of a compound ability to destabilize erythrocyte plasma membrane. The proposed method is based on the continuous monitoring of the light scattered by erythrocytes exposed to osmotic pressure differences. The kinetics of hemolysis depends on the plasma membrane mechanics and the extent of the osmotic stress. Generally, the osmotic pressure difference of approximately 150\u00a0mOsm is taken for measurements, as a result of the equal volume mixing with the physiological salt solutions. In this approach the hemolytic process completion is not established which may result in poor quality and reproducibility of the experimental data. In consequence, inaccurate parameters of the kinetic are determined due to the low quality fitting to the, widely used, single exponential model. In the paper we propose a new experimental protocol allowing to determine the extended set of parameters for kinetics of hemolysis. Namely, the method of the minimal osmotic pressure difference determination is proposed which ensures the completeness of the hemolytic process. This step allows improving the quality and exactness of the calculated parameters. The developed methodology was tested on two qualitatively different, biologically relevant, experiments; evaluation of the peptide effect on the plasma membrane properties and differentiating between human and rabbit erythrocytes.",

Using Laurdan and Prodan as fluorescent probes, we demonstrated phase behavior and membrane fluidity changes induced by genistein. ESR spectroscopy revealed alterations caused by genistein in membrane domains structure and mobility of spin probes with free radicals located at different depths of membrane. The method of ESR spectra decomposition and computer simulation of the recorded spectra were used in order to visualize domain coexistence by GHOST condensation method. Fluorescence and ESR spectroscopy experiments performed at different temperatures enabled us to observe the effect of isoflavone on phospholipid bilayers in either gel or liquid crystalline phase. It was concluded that genistein preferentially intercalated into lipid headgroup region, to some extent into polar\u2013apolar interface and only in minimal degree into hydrophobic core of the membrane. According to our best knowledge this is the first study on modification of domain structure of membranes by genistein.",

In the current work, the hydrolysis of phospholipids by PLA2 was monitored with acrylodan-labelled intestinal fatty acid binding protein (ADIFAB) and this fluorescence based technique was also used to access the enzymatic inhibitory effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The intrinsic fluorescence of PLA2 tryptophan residues was further used to gain complementary information regarding the accessibility of these residues on the PLA2 structure upon interaction with the NSAIDs tested; and to calculate the NSAIDs-PLA2 binding constants. Finally, circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed to evaluate changes in PLA2 conformation resultant from the inhibitory effect of the drugs tested. Overall, results gathered in this study point to the conclusion that the studied NSAIDs inhibit PLA2 activity due to a disturbance of the enzyme binding efficiency to membrane interface possibly by a shielding effect of the Trp residues required for the membrane interfacial binding step that precedes lipolysis process.",

The two-step extraction procedure (n-pentane and hexane, respectively) allowed to separately analyze the fractions of polyprenol as non-incorporated (PrenolNonInc) and incorporated (PrenolInc) into liposomes. Consequently, distribution coefficients, P\u2032, describing the equilibrium of prenol content between phospholipid (EYPC) membrane and the aqueous phase gave different log\u00a0P\u2032 for \u03b1-cis- and \u03b1-trans-Prenol-12, indicating that the configuration of the \u03b1-terminal residue significantly alters the hydrophobicity of the polyisoprenoid molecule and consequently the affinity of polyprenols for EYPC membrane. In fluorescence experiments \u03b1-trans-Pren-12 increased up to 1.7-fold the permeability of EYPC bilayer for glucose while the effect of \u03b1-cis-Pren-12 was almost negligible. Considerable changes of thermotropic behavior of DPPC membranes in the presence of both prenol isomers were observed. \u03b1-trans-Pren-12 completely abolished the pretransition while in the case of \u03b1-cis-Pren-12 it was noticeably reduced. Furthermore, for both prenol isomers, the temperature of the main phase transition (Tm) was shifted by about 1\u00a0\u00b0C to lower values and the height of the peak was significantly reduced. The DSC analysis profiles also showed a new peak at 38.7\u00a0\u00b0C, which may suggest the concomitant presence of more that one phase within the membrane.Results of these experiments and the concomitant occurrence of alloprenols and ficaprenols in plant tissues suggest that cis/trans isomerization of the \u03b1-residue of polyisoprenoid molecule might comprise a putative mechanism responsible for modulation of the permeability of cellular membranes.",

     "abstract": "The lipid organization in the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, is important for the skin barrier function. The stratum corneum lipids are composed of ceramides (CER), free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol (CHOL). In the present study Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques were utilized to evaluate the effect of three C18 fatty acid esterified \u03c9-acylceramides (CER EOS) on the lipid organization of stratum corneum model membranes. FTIR spectra (scissoring and rocking bands) showed as a function of temperature significant line-shape changes for both components assigned to the orthorhombic phase. Second-derivative analyzes revealed a significant decrease in the interchain coupling strength (\u0394\u03bd values) for the samples formed by CER EOS with the linoleate (CER EOS-L) and oleate (CER EOS-O) moiety around 28.5\u00a0\u00b0C. However, only a gradual decrease in the \u0394\u03bd values was noticed for the mixture formed with CER EOS with the stearate moiety (CER EOS-S) over the whole temperature range. In the absence of CER EOS the decrease started already at 25.5\u00a0\u00b0C, demonstrating that CER EOS stabilized the orthorhombic lattice. This stabilization was most pronounced for the CER EOS-S. Spectral fittings allowed to evaluate the orientation changes of the skeletal plane within the orthorhombic unit cell (\u03b8 values) for a given temperature range. From the best-fit parameters (peak area values), a decrease in the orthorhombic phase contribution to the scissoring band was also monitored as a function of the temperature. SAXS studies showed the coexistence of two lamellar phases with a periodicity of \u223c5.5\u00a0nm (short periodicity phase, SPP) and \u223c12\u00a0nm (LPP) in the presence of the CER EOS-L and CER EOS-O. However, no diffraction peaks associated to the LPP were detected for CER EOS-S. While CER EOS-S most efficiently stabilized the orthorhombic phase, CER EOS-L and CER EOS-O promoted the presence of the LPP. Therefore, the presence of all three CER EOS as observed in human stratum corneum may contribute to a proper skin barrier function.",

Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) vesicles were used as a membrane model. EYPC vesicles were prepared in the aqueous methanol solution (MeOH:H2O\u00a0=\u00a07:3, v/v) that gave the lowest turbidity in samples.

This work was undertaken to better understand how LOXs control production of hydroperoxides with different positional and stereochemistry. A number of glycerolipids were tested as substrates for maize 9-LOX (ZmLOX) and its A562G mutant form. Both the wild type (WT) ZmLOX and A562G mutant were shown to dioxygenate monolinolenoylglycerol (MLG) and 2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (lysoPC). Both the WT ZmLOX and A562G mutant form oxidized the MLG predominantly into (9S)-hydroperoxide. The A562G mutation did not affect the relative yield of 13-hydroperoxide, but increased the proportion of (13R)-enantiomer. LysoPC was a poor substrate for both wild type and A562G mutant form of ZmLOX. The oxidation of lysoPC exhibited the limited regio- and stereospecificity. Nevertheless, the WT ZmLOX produced some predominance of (13S)-hydroperoxide. In contrast, the A562G mutant produced some excess of (9S)-hydroperoxide of lysoPC. The bulky polar heads of glycerolipids like MLG and lysoPC cannot penetrate into the LOX active site.

We compare BCh2 with the intrinsically fluorescent dehydroergosterol (DHE), a well-established marker for cholesterol, by introducing simultaneous imaging of both sterols in model membranes and living cells. BCh2 had a lower affinity than DHE for the biologically relevant liquid-ordered phase in model membranes. Still, DHE and BCh2 trafficked from the plasma membrane to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) of BHK cells with identical kinetics. This transport pathway was strongly reduced after energy depletion of cells or expression of the dominant-negative clathrin heavy chain. The partitioning into lipid droplets of BHK and HeLa cells was higher for BCh2 than for DHE. Within droplets, the photodegradation of BCh2 was enhanced and followed a stretched exponential decay, while the fluorescence lifetime of BCh2 was comparable in various cellular regions.

     "abstract": "Temperature and pH effects were studied for stability, structural organization, fluidity and permeability of vesicles from a polar lipid methanol fraction isolated from the Aeropyrum pernix. We determined the permeability of C25,25 liposomes using fluorescence intensity of released calcein. At pH 7.0 and 9.0, and from 85\u00a0\u00b0C to 98\u00a0\u00b0C, only 10% of entrapped calcein was released. After 10\u00a0h at 90\u00a0\u00b0C, calcein release reached 27%, independent of pH. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of hydrophobic probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene revealed gradual changes up to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. At higher temperatures, the anisotropy did not change significantly. Fluorescence alone did not provide detailed and direct structural information about these C25,25 liposomes, so we used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). From EPR spectra, mean membrane fluidity determined according to maximal hyperfine splitting and empirical correlation times showed continuous increases with temperature. Computer simulation of EPR spectra showed heterogeneous membranes of these C25,25 liposomes: at low temperatures, they showed three types of membrane regions characterized by different motional modes. Above 65\u00a0\u00b0C, the membrane becomes homogeneous with only one fluid-like region. DSC thermograms of C25,25 liposomes reveal a very broad and endothermic transition in the temperature range from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are found naturally in dairy products. Two isomers of CLA, that differ only in the location of cis and trans double bonds, are found to have distinct and different biological effects. The cis 9 trans 11 (C9T11) isomer is attributed to have the anti-carcinogenic effects, while the trans 10 cis 12 (T10C12) isomer is believed to be responsible for the anti-obesity effects. Since dietary CLA are incorporated into membrane phospholipids, we have used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the comparative effects of the two isomers on lipid bilayer structure. Specifically, simulations of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers in which the sn-2 chains contained one of the two isomers of CLA were performed. Force field parameters for the torsional potential of double bonds were obtained from ab initio calculations. From the MD trajectories we calculated and compared structural properties of the two lipid bilayers, including areas per molecule, density profiles, thickness of bilayers, tilt angle of tail chains, order parameters profiles, radial distribution function (RDF) and lateral pressure profiles. The main differences found between bilayers of the two CLA isomers, are (1) the order parameter profile for C9T11 has a dip in the middle of sn-2 chain while the profile for T10C12 has a deeper dip close to terminal of sn-2 chain, and (2) the lateral pressure profiles show differences between the two isomers. Our simulation results reveal localized physical structural differences between bilayers of the two CLA isomers that may contribute to different biological effects through differential interactions with membrane proteins or cholesterol.",

This observation is interpreted in terms of Goodby's model for the smectic A phase in which the carbohydrate moieties are located at the centre of the smectic bilayer and assuming that hydrogen bonded aggregates persist into the isotropic phase.

Recent microsecond time-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and isothiocyanate covalent labeling studies have suggested that a transmembrane helix 6/7 (TMH6/7) lipid pathway for ligand entry may be necessary for interaction with cannabinoid receptors. Because LPI and 2-AGPI are lipid-derived ligands, conformations that each assumes in the lipid bilayer are therefore likely important for their interaction with GPR55. We report here the results of 70\u00a0ns NAMD molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LPI and of 2-AGPI in a fully hydrated bilayer of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). These simulations are compared with a 70\u00a0ns simulation of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor endogenous ligand, N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) in a POPC bilayer. These simulations revealed that (1) LPI and 2-AGPI sit much higher in the bilayer than AEA, with inositol headgroups that can at times be solvated completely by water; (2) the behavior of the acyl chains of AEA and 2-AGPI are similar in their flexibilities in the bilayer, while the acyl chain of LPI has reduced flexibility; and (3) both 2-AGPI and LPI can adopt a tilted headgroup orientation by hydrogen bonding to the phospholipid phosphate/glycerol groups or via intramolecular hydrogen bonding. This tilted head group conformation (which represents over 40% of the conformer population of LPI (42.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3%) and 2-AGPI (43.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4%)) may provide a low enough profile in the lipid bilayer for LPI and 2-AGPI to enter GPR55 via the putative TMH6/7 entry port.",

     "abstract": "To study the effect of membrane composition on the oxidation of liposomes, different systems were prepared by adding one component at time to phosphatidylcholine (Epikuron 200). In particular, the effect of cholesterol and its ester, cholesterol stearate, on membrane structure and oxidation was studied. A first screening of the structure and net charge of the different preparation was made by means of z-potential and size measurements. Then the liposomes were oxidized by using a hydrophilic radical initiator, the (2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, AAPH, which thermally decomposes to give a constant radical flux in water. The oxidation of liposomes, monitored by following the absorbance of the primary products of oxidation at 234\u00a0nm, was shown to be dependent on the composition of the liposomal bilayer and so on its biophysical properties. In addition, size and z-potential measurements gathered in the time course of the peroxidation reaction, revealed that the oxidation induced a modification of the superficial characteristics of the membrane bilayer so as to change its charge at the shear plane (z-potential). This behaviour was shared by all liposomal preparations independent of the composition. The change in sizes of the different liposomal preparation, instead, followed different trends, being more stable both in control samples and in oxidized ones when cholesterol was present. From the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that cholesterol affects the oxidation induced by hydrophilic radical initiator of model membranes by changing the biophysical properties of the phospholipid bilayer. The rigidity induced by cholesterol at temperatures above the Tm makes the membrane more resistant to radical attack from an external aqueous phase and this in turn delays the start of the reaction. The decrease of z-potential of the liposomal particles induced by the oxidation process can be an important clue to understand the mechanisms involved in the etiology of important diseases.",

     "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of the main components of outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, consists of a hydrophobic lipid (lipid A) with six hydrocarbon chains and a large hydrophilic polysaccharide chain. LPS plays endotoxic roles and can stimulate macrophages and B cells. To elucidate the mechanism of the interaction of LPS with various cell membranes, it is important to investigate the interaction of wild type LPS in a buffer with lipid membranes. In this report we investigated the interaction of low concentrations of LPS in a buffer with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) membrane in the liquid-crystalline (L\u03b1) phase and sphingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol(chol) (molar ration; 6/4) membrane in the liquid-ordered (lo) phase. We found that low concentrations (less than critical micelle concentration) of LPS in aqueous solution induced the shape changes such as the transformation from a prolate to a two-spheres-connected by a very narrow neck in the DOPC-GUVs and also in the SM/chol (6/4)-GUVs above their threshold concentrations. The analysis of the shape changes of the GUVs indicates that the monomers of LPS can insert spontaneously into the external monolayer of the lipid membranes of these GUVs from the aqueous solution. Moreover, higher concentrations of LPS induced the vesicle fission of SM/chol(6/4)-GUVs above its higher threshold concentration. The vesicle fission of GUVs is similar to those induced by single long chain amphiphiles such as lysophosphatidylcholine. On the basis of these results, we discuss the interaction of wild type LPS with lipid membranes and cell membranes. These results suggest that LPS molecules can insert spontaneously into the external monolayer of the plasma membranes composed of the L\u03b1 phase-membrane and the microdomain in the lo phase.",

The Fenton reaction, i.e. the transition metal catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 is frequently used to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO). Lipids with unsaturated fatty acyl residues are primarily converted by HO radicals into peroxides.In contrast, chloro- and bromohydrins as well as dihalogenides are formed by the addition of HOCl or HOBr to the olefinic groups of the fatty acyl residues of lipids or under the influence of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) from Cl\u2212 and H2O2. We will show here by using MALDI-TOF MS for product analysis that halogenated products may also be generated in the presence of the Fenton reagent, if either FeCl2 or FeBr2 is used. In the presence of FeSO4, however, peroxides are exclusively generated. It will also be shown that the generation of halogen-containing products is a competing reaction with the cleavage of the double bond under generation of the corresponding aldehyde or carboxylic acid that is favored at prolonged incubation times and at elevated pH.",

Melting from the gel L\u03b2\u2032 to the liquid-crystalline L\u03b1 phase starts at pre-existing line-type packing defects (grain boundaries) in absence of the peptide. The exact transition temperature is shown to be influenced by the magnitude of the force exerted by the AFM probe on the bilayer, but is higher than the main transition temperature of non-supported DPPC vesicles in all cases due to bilayer\u2013substrate interactions. Cooling of the fluid L\u03b1 bilayer shows the formation of the line-type defects at the borders between different gel-phase regions that originate from different nuclei. The number of these defects depends directly on the rate of cooling through the transition, as predicted by classical nucleation theory.The presence of the transmembrane, synthetic model peptide WALP23 is known to give rise to heterogeneity in the bilayer as microdomains with a striped appearance are formed in the DPPC bilayer. This striated phase consists of alternating lines of lipids and peptide. It is shown here that melting starts with the peptide-associated lipids in the domains, whose melting temperature is lowered by 0.8\u20132.0\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the remaining, peptide-free parts of the bilayer. The stabilization of the fluid phase is ascribed to adaptations of the lipids to the shorter peptide. The lipids not associated with the peptide melt at the same temperature as those in the pure DPPC supported bilayer.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylethanolamine-based pH-sensitive liposomes of various compositions have been described as efficient systems for cytoplasmic delivery of molecules into cells. Incorporation of an amphiphile of appropriate structure is needed for the stabilization and performance of these vesicles. Among the wide variety of interesting activities displayed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa dirhamnolipids (diRL), is their capacity to stabilize bilayer structures in phosphatidylethanolamine systems. In this work, X-ray scattering, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy have been used to study the structure and pH-dependent behaviour of phosphatidylethanolamine/diRL liposomes. We show that diRL, in combination with dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), forms stable multilamellar and unilamellar liposomes. Acidification of DOPE/diRL vesicles leads to membrane destabilization, fusion, and release of entrapped aqueous vesicle contents. Finally, DOPE/diRL pH-sensitive liposomes act as efficient vehicles for the cytoplasmic delivery of fluorescent probes into cultured cells. It is concluded that DOPE/diRL form stable pH-sensitive liposomes, and that these liposomes are incorporated into cultured cells through the endocytic pathway, delivering its contents into the cytoplasm, which means a potential use of these liposomes for the delivery of foreign substances into living cells. Our results establish a new application of diRL as a bilayer stabilizer in phospholipid vesicles, and the use of diRL-containing pH-sensitive liposomes as delivery vehicles.",

LDL pre-treatment with arzanol significantly preserved lipoproteins from oxidative damage at 2\u00a0h of oxidation, and showed a remarkable protective effect on the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol levels, inhibiting the increase of oxidative products (conjugated dienes fatty acids hydroperoxides, 7\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol). Arzanol, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, exerted a noteworthy protection on TBH-induced oxidative damage in a line of fibroblasts derived from monkey kidney (Vero cells) and in human intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2), decreasing, in both cell lines, the formation of oxidative products (hydroperoxides and 7-ketocholesterol) from the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. The cellular uptake and transepithelial transport of the compound were also investigated in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Arzanol appeared to accumulate in Caco-2 epithelial cells. This phenol was able to pass through the intestinal Caco-2 monolayers, the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) in the apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical direction at 2\u00a0h were 1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 and 2.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0cm/s, respectively, suggesting a passive diffusion pathway.

The X-ray line broadening was analyzed through the refinement of TCH-pseudo-Voigt function parameters (isotropic effects) and the refinement of multipolar functions, i.e., symmetrized cubic harmonics (anisotropic effects). The crystal structure turns out to be primitive monoclinic, space group Pc, type I monolayer having two molecules per unit cell with parameters: a\u00a0=\u00a018.921\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006\u00a0\u00c5, b\u00a0=\u00a012.952\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003\u00a0\u00c5, c\u00a0=\u00a09.276\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002\u00a0\u00c5 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a091.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00b0.

The unit cell parameters, including the lamellar thickness, of COC crystal is very closely similar to those of another, structurally similar cholesterol ester, e.g., cholesteryl oleate (CO) crystal, space group P21, type II monolayer. Type I monolayer structure has been established for COC on the basis of the intensity calculations of the XRD profiles of both CO and COC.

Given the difference between reactions that occur in homogeneous solutions and those that occur at lipid\u2013water interfaces, as in biological membranes and lipoproteins, the relevance of the commonly-used assays (such as TEAC and ORAC) to the antioxidative activity in biological systems is questionable. The aim of the present investigation is to develop a more relevant assay. Based on our results, we propose an assay based on prolongation of the lag preceding fast peroxidation of serum lipids. The assay employs our previously developed procedure for determination of susceptibility of serum lipids to peroxidation. The effect of antioxidants is expressed in terms of the relative prolongation of the lag preceding peroxidation. It can be considered reliable because it is only marginally dependent on the specific sera used for the assay. The resultant ranking of antioxidants may be expressed either as the relative prolongation of the lag per 1\u00a0\u03bcM of antioxidant or as the concentration of antioxidant required to double the lag. As expected, the observed ranking order is very different from that reported for TEAC or ORAC assays, undermining the relevance of these assays for oxidation that occurs at interfaces.",

     "abstract": "Low density lipoproteins (LDL) of human blood, once oxidized, provoke cholesterol accumulation in cells of arterial wall, which favors the development of atherosclerosis. Oxidative modification of LDL can result from their interaction with hypochlorous acid produced in the halogenation cycle of myeloperoxidase (MPO). On account that MPO is able to form complexes with LDL it seems important to learn the forces promoting such contacts and to spot the likely binding sites for the enzyme on the surface of LDL particles. In this study affinity chromatography on MPO-Sepharose showed that MPO-LDL complexes are uncoupled at ionic strength above 0.3\u00a0M NaCl or when pH of solution goes below 3.6. This is an evidence of ionic interaction between MPO and LDL. We used spin probes of lipid nature embedded in phospholipid monolayer so that a variety of distances between the surface of an LDL particle and the paramagnetic center of a spin probes was provided. Since MPO interaction with labeled LDL caused no alteration of EPR spectra it was concluded that lipid components of LDL are not involved in MPO binding. Analysis of Mn2+ distribution between LDL surface and the aqueous milieu showed that the surface negative charge of LDL is not considerably changed upon interaction with MPO. It can be suggested that interaction of LDL with MPO does not involve phospholipids that are the principal carriers of the surface charge.

     "abstract": "It is commonly believed that all membrane sterols are rigid all-trans ring systems with a fully extended alkyl side-chain and that they similarly influence phospholipid bilayer physical properties. Here, we report the sterol concentration-dependent, thermotropic phase behaviour of binary dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)/sterol mixtures containing two similar 5\u03b1-H sterols with different functional group orientations (3\u03b1-OH or 3\u03b2-OH), which adopt an ideal all-trans planar ring conformation but lack the deformed ring B conformation of cholesterol (Chol) and epicholesterol (Echol), using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Our deconvolution of the DSC main phase transition endotherms show differences in the proportions of sterol-poor (sharp) and sterol-rich (broad) domains in the DPPC bilayer with increasing sterol concentration, which delineate gel/liquid-crystalline (P\u03b2\u2032/L\u03b1) and disordered gel (L\u03b2)/liquid-ordered (lo) phase regions. There are similarities in the DPPC main phase transition temperature, cooperativity and enthalpy for each 3\u03b2-ol and 3\u03b1-ol pair with increasing sterol concentration and differences in the parameters obtained for both the sterol-poor and sterol-rich regions. The sterol-poor domain persists over a greater concentration range in both 3\u03b1-ol/DPPC mixtures, suggesting that either those domains are more stable in the 3\u03b1-ols or that those sterols are less miscible in the sterol-rich domain. Corresponding parameters for the sterol-rich domain show that at sterol concentrations up to 20\u00a0mol%, the 5\u03b1-H,3\u03b2-ol is more effective at reducing the phase transition enthalpy of the broad component ( \u0394 H m brd ) than Chol, but is less effective at higher concentrations. Although mixtures containing Echol and 5\u03b1-cholestan-3\u03b1-ol have similar positive slopes below 7\u00a0mol% sterol, suggesting that they abolish the L\u03b2/lo phase transition equally effectively at low concentrations, Echol is more effective than the saturated 3\u03b1-ol at higher sterol concentrations. A comparison of \u0394 H m brd obtained for the saturated and unsaturated pairs suggests that the latter sterols stabilize the lo phase and broaden and abolish the DPPC main phase transition more effectively than the saturated sterols at physiologically relevant concentrations, supporting the idea that the double bond of Chol and Echol promotes greater sterol miscibility and the formation of lo phase lipid bilayers relative to corresponding saturated sterols in biological membranes.",

These measurements differ in the proportions of sharp and broad components in the heating endotherms, representing the melting of the sterol-poor and sterol-rich lipid micro-domains of the DPPC bilayer, respectively. Our results suggest that the 5,10-cis ring configuration of both saturated sterols and the ring A conformations have the greatest influence on DPPC bilayer properties, most likely by inducing small increases in the mean area/molecule as compared to cholesterol. However, the C3-OH orientation also influences sterol miscibility, likely due to variations in the strength and number of interfacial H-bonds with changes in molecular area, which in turn probably reflect the depth of the sterol in the DPPC bilayer. This influence of C3-OH orientation is significantly greater than was observed in our earlier study of cholesterol/- and epicholesterol/DPPC mixtures. Overall, our results show that both saturated and unsaturated 3\u03b1-ols are less miscible than the corresponding 3\u03b2-ols, but that the presence of a \u03945 double bond can improve the sterol miscibility in the DPPC bilayer at high sterol concentrations.",

     "abstract": "The role of statins in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, diabetes or stroke is well established. However, there are still many questions regarding the role of statins in patients with heart failure (HF)/cardiomyopathy (CM), hypertension, atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). As for patients with HF/CM inhibition of inflammation, reducing endothelial dysfunction might comprise part of the underlying mechanisms leading to the improvement of left ventricular function and exercise tolerance in these groups of patients. Therefore the candidates for statin therapy with HF/CM should be in New York Heart Association class II or III and should have normal or increased levels of lipids. We should avoid reducing lipids levels in these patients. At present, it is also difficult to unequivocally assess the impact of statins on blood pressure (BP). However, according to most available studies, the impact of statins on the decrease in BP is slight, but significant, especially among patients with hypertension. Moreover statins significantly reduce cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Although the results of trials concerning the use of statins in CKD patients are conflicting, it is suggested that the benefits of statin use outweigh the drawbacks in patients with early-stage CKD, when the benefits can be effectively predicted. However, available large randomized clinical trials suggest a lack of efficacy in patients on renal replacement therapy.

Results obtained by fluorescence quenching and anisotropy studies indicate that resveratrol has a membrane fluidizing effect and is able to permeate the membrane even in the gel phase. These results mirror the well described antioxidant effect of resveratrol, since antioxidants have to reach peroxidised rigid membranes and increase membrane fluidity in order to interact more efficiently with lipid radicals in the disordered lipid bilayer.

This is in stark contrast with the tertiary amine derivative DC whose dispersion properties were improved and its monolayer surface potential is restored at high molecular surface density in the presence of DOPE. Overall the transfection activity mediated by DC and the quaternary ammonium TC derivative was greatly improved in the presence of DOPE and is attributed to decreased cytotoxicity, improved fusogenicity and cellular association.",

However, little is known about its surface organization and potential impact on membrane-mediated function. In this work we investigated the interfacial behavior of Langmuir monolayers formed with pure DGPP and of its mixtures with PA. We found that changes of the subphase pH affect the surface behavior of DGPP. At pH 8, DGPP forms liquid expanded monolayers with a compressibility modulus of about 60\u00a0mN\u00a0m\u22121 at collapse. On acidic solutions, the compressibility modulus increases to 90\u00a0mN\u00a0m\u22121 and the average molecular area is smaller. At pH 8, DGPP and its precursor PA form thermodynamically favored topographically homogeneous non-ideal mixtures. The interaction among these lipids leads to a non-ideal diminution of the mean molecular area and consequently, to an increase of the compressibility modulus, with variations of the surface electrostatics. The favorable interaction of PA and DGPP, leading to changes of the film packing suggest that DGPP may act as a structural signal transducer in membrane-mediated cellular processes.",

     "abstract": "The various experimental approaches and octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) assay's capability to meet the criteria for examining the Ca2+dependent synaptic vesicles (SVs) fusion with target membranes have been investigated. The existence of at least two simultaneous processes one of which attributed to real Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion, while another is considered to be non-specific probe transfer has been shown. The differences in response to temperature changes were found for R18 fluorescence dequenching upon stimulation of membrane fusion or nonspecific probe transfer. The temperature dependences of the probe dequenching rate were the same for heterotypic and homotypic membrane systems and increased with the temperature growth. The combination of R18 fluorescence studies with the data obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) offers a unique opportunity for the determination of SVs aggregation and the membrane fusion. The cholesterol content of the synaptosomal plasma membrane was modulated by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (MCD). The MCD molecule has proven to bind directly the membrane cholesterol and interact with lipophilic probe R18 that affects its fluorescence. The obvious distinctions in probe dequenching due to the membrane mixing or the MCD effect were observed. The cholesterol depletion from the synaptosomal plasma membranes was found to inhibit the process of Ca2+-induced membrane fusion with SVs. Thus, the manipulations with conditions of R18 probe dequenching at the model conditions, specific for the Ca2+-triggered fusion steps of regulated exocytosis, allowed us to determine the relative contribution of probe transfer and genuine membrane fusion to the overall fluorescence signal.",

The use of the complex mixtures of natural MA is complicated by an apparent antibody cross-reactivity with cholesterol. Here firstly we report three recombinant monoclonal scFv antibody fragments in the chicken germ-line antibody repertoire, which demonstrate the possibilities for cross-reactivity: the first recognized both cholesterol and mycolic acids, the second mycolic acids but not cholesterol, and the third cholesterol but not mycolic acids. Secondly, MA structure is experimentally interrogated to try to understand the cross-reactivity. Unique synthetic mycolic acids representative of the three main functional classes show varying antigenicity against human TB patient sera, depending on the functional groups present and on their stereochemistry. Oxygenated (methoxy- and keto-) mycolic acid was found to be more antigenic than alpha-mycolic acids. Synthetic methoxy-mycolic acids were the most antigenic, one containing a trans-cyclopropane apparently being somewhat more antigenic than the natural mixture. Trans-cyclopropane-containing keto- and hydroxy-mycolic acids were also found to be the most antigenic among each of these classes. However, none of the individual synthetic mycolic acids significantly and reproducibly distinguished the pooled serum of TB positive patients from that of TB negative patients better than the natural mixture of MA. This argues against the potential to improve the specificity of serodiagnosis of TB with a defined single synthetic mycolic acid antigen from this set, although sensitivity may be facilitated by using a synthetic methoxy-mycolic acid.",

Reaction with unsaturated fatty acyl chains in glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine results in the formation of chlorohydrins. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chlorohydrins formed by the reaction of hypochlorite with 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-, 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-, and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonylphosphatidylcholine on biophysical properties of bilayers and their effects on human erythrocytes. Using electrospray mass spectrometry we observed complete conversion of the lipids into chlorohydrins, which resulted in a decrease in the rotational correlation time and an increase in the order parameter of liposomes. Unilamellar chlorohydrin liposomes had a lower permeation coefficient for calcein than liposomes made of parent lipids. Flow cytometry demonstrated fast incorporation of uni and multilamellar chlorohydrin liposomes labeled with NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine into erythrocytes. This effect was accompanied by changes in erythrocyte shape (echinocyte formation) and aggregation. Similar but less pronounced effects were noticed for parent lipids only after longer incubation. Chlorohydrins showed also a stronger hemolytic action, proportional to the lipid:erythrocyte ratio.

Issues concerning separation of contributions from the polar head groups from those of the chain terminal methyl groups are discussed. Molecular volumes of lipids in crystals are also analysed to provide information on head-group packing that can be compared with the situation in membranes, and used to set limits on the relative contributions from polar groups and terminal methyl groups.

Analysis from dePaked 2H NMR spectra in the L\u03b1 phase reveals that BMP18:1 induces less disorder than equal concentrations of DOPG.

     "abstract": "We analyzed the kinetics for the subgel (SGI) phase formation in DPPC/DOPC binary bilayers paying attention to DOPC-induced modification of the bilayer physical properties. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction revealed that addition of DOPC reduced the apparent initial lag time to start the SGI phase formation, and that the SGI phase in the binary bilayers had basically the same structure as that in pure DPPC bilayers though addition of DOPC markedly increased the peak temperature and enthalpy of the subtransition in heating. Moreover, addition of DOPC abolished the prolongation of the initial lag time in pure DPPC bilayers induced by lowering the incubation temperature from 0 to \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C. Our results suggested that DOPC molecules work as a diffusion enhancer to promote the nucleation of the SGI phase, and relatively destabilize the gel phase so that the formed SGI phase transforms into the ripple phase in heating.",

     "abstract": "Biodiesel fuels (methyl or ethyl esters derived from vegetables oils and animal fats) are currently being used as a means to diminish the crude oil dependency and to limit the greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector. However, their physical properties are different from traditional fossil fuels, this making uncertain their effect on new, electronically controlled vehicles. Density is one of those properties, and its implications go even further. First, because governments are expected to boost the use of high-biodiesel content blends, but biodiesel fuels are denser than fossil ones. In consequence, their blending proportion is indirectly restricted in order not to exceed the maximum density limit established in fuel quality standards. Second, because an accurate knowledge of biodiesel density permits the estimation of other properties such as the Cetane Number, whose direct measurement is complex and presents low repeatability and low reproducibility. In this study we compile densities of methyl and ethyl esters published in literature, and proposed equations to convert them to 15\u00a0\u00b0C and to predict the biodiesel density based on its chain length and unsaturation degree. Both expressions were validated for a wide range of commercial biodiesel fuels. Using the latter, we define a term called Biodiesel Cetane Index, which predicts with high accuracy the Biodiesel Cetane Number. Finally, simple calculations prove that the introduction of high-biodiesel content blends in the fuel market would force the refineries to reduce the density of their fossil fuels.",

     "abstract": "A robust, well-defined and reproducible method to accurately measure the oil binding capacity (OBC) of structuring fats was developed. The method was validated using two oil/fat model systems, i.e., fully hydrogenated canola oil (FHCO) in canola oil (CO) (FHCO/CO) and fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO) in CO (FHSO/CO). The mixtures were crystallized from the melt down to three different temperatures (15, 25 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C) at constant rates of cooling and the OBC was measured after different periods of storage time. The critical concentration of hard fat at which the solid fat network is stable and effectively binds oil has been also measured for mixtures crystallized at temperatures close to room temperature, i.e., 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Crystal structure, melting behavior, microstructure, and solid fat content of these binary systems have been investigated in relation to the OBC of the solid fat network using X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and wide-line pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (pNMR) techniques. The two model systems exhibited similar trends in OBC over time, a behavior attributed to their similar TAG composition and polymorphism. However, relatively smaller OBC values were achieved by the CO/FHSO compared to CO/FHCO samples, largely due to differences in their solid network structure. Four successive decreasing linear segments, identifying successive mechanisms of oil migration/binding, were observed in the experimental OBC versus fat weight fraction curves. The critical concentration of hard fat, at which the solid fat network is effective in binding oil, was also determined and found to be \u223c6\u00a0wt% for both systems.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the heat-induced cis/trans isomerization of double bonds in monounsaturated lipids. When triolein (9-cis, 18:1) was heated around 180\u00a0\u00b0C, small amounts of isomerization products were obtained depending on the heating period. The heat-induced isomerization of triolein was considerably suppressed by the addition of different antioxidants or under nitrogen stream, and these additives simultaneously inhibited the thermal oxidation of double bonds in triolein. Therefore, an intermediate of the thermal oxidation reaction might be responsible for the heat-induced isomerization of the double bonds in triolein. The thermodynamics of the heat-induced isomerization of triolein (9-cis, 18:1) and trielaidin (9-trans, 18:1) were investigated using Arrhenius plot. The Arrhenius activation energies of cis double bonds in triolein and trans double bonds in trielaidin were 106\u00a0kJ/mol and 137\u00a0kJ/mol, respectively. The calculated internal rotational barrier heights of these double bonds were similar to those of the double bond of 2-butene radical and significantly lower than those of non-radicalized double bonds in 2-butene. These results suggest that heat-induced cis/trans isomerization of triolein and trielaidin occurs mainly through the formation of radical species, which are the intermediates produced during thermal oxidation. The activation energy difference between the two forms suggests that trans trielaidin radicals are more stable than cis triolein radicals. The high thermodynamic stability of the trans double bonds in lipid radicals would influence the population of cis and trans isomers in edible oils and contribute to slight accumulation of trans-18:1 isomers during heating or industrial processing.",

POPC liposomes were used as a simple model for eukaryotic membranes and 4:1 POPC:POPG liposomes were used as a simple model for prokaryotic membranes.

Compound 1 exhibits weaker binding and induces less calcein leakage in POPC liposomes than POPC:POPG (4:1 mole ratio) liposomes.

The mixing of DOPC and DOPS was found to be ideal and the molecular volumes of pure lipids VDOPC and VDOPS are additive in mixed bilayers. The increase of VDOPS with temperature was steeper than that of VDOPC as quantified by significantly higher coefficient of isobaric thermal expansivity \u03b3.

Free energy calculations of typical amphipathic peptide topologies show that using a relatively smooth surface morphology allows for a stable conformation of the tetramer bundle in a diamond formation. However, the model with side chains attached to the core in order to roughen the surface has a stable square tetramer bundle which is consistent with experimental data and all-atom (AA) MD simulations. Comparisons of the CG simulations with AA MD simulations are in reasonable agreement with the formation of tetrameric homo-oligomers, partitioning within the lipid bilayer and tilt angle with respect to the bilayer normal. We concluded that a square or diamond shape tetrameric homo-oligomers could be stabilized by rational design of the peptide morphology and topology of the surface, thus allowing us to tune the permeability of the bundle or channel.",

     "abstract": "Due to its sensitivity, the tolerance of impurities and the simplicity of performance, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) is increasingly used to analyze lipids from biological sources. Although its detailed role is not understood so far, the applied matrix has a pronounced effect on the achievable spectrum quality and particularly how sensitive the individual lipid classes are detectable. Different matrix compounds were recently established in the lipid field including 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), para-nitroaniline (PNA), 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), and 2-(2-aminoethylamino)-5-nitropyridine (AAN). It is the aim of this paper to compare the properties of these matrices with the newly synthesized matrix, \u03b1-cyano-2,4-difluorocinnamic acid (Di-FCCA). An organic extract from hen egg yolk was used as a simple and easily available test system.It will be shown that Di-FCCA is the matrix of choice to detect lipids in the positive-ion mode due to an achievable sensitivity gain of more than one order of magnitude compared to alternative matrices. In contrast, Di-FCCA is not suitable for negative-ion detection of phospholipids. Here, 9-AA is unequivocally the matrix of choice.",

In phase diagrams, the region for the folded forms of \u03b1 -MAs was very limited, in contrast to the previously established behavior of ketomycolates, where complete folding predominated.

A partial interdigitized bilayer structure of SmA phase is inferred from experimental d-spacing and computationally derived lengths of the molecules. The results were compared with those of normal alkyl glucopyranosides, retained with hydroxyl groups at C-2\u2013C-6 carbons, and alkyl 2-deoxy-glucopyranosides, devoid of a hydroxyl group at C-2 and the comparison showed important differences in the mesomorphic behavior.",

The ability of oxysterols to condense phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin films, their capacity to cause changes in in-plane elasticity moduli, and their propensity to form detergent-resistant membrane domains were all found to be dependant on the location of the oxygen functionality in the oxysterol, the chemical nature of the phospholipid in the model systems, and the oxysterol/phospholipid ratio in the membrane. The findings described in this study with respect to their biophysical/biophysiological implications provide additional insight into the activity of cytotoxic oxysterols in model membranes.",

     "abstract": "In cell biology (and in many biophysical) studies there is a natural tendency to consider ceramide as a highly condensed, solid-type lipid conferring rigidity and close packing to biomembranes. In the present work we advanced the understanding of the phase behavior of palmitoyl-ceramide restricted to a planar interface using Langmuir monolayers under strictly controlled and known surface packing conditions. Surface pressure\u2013molecular area isotherms were complemented with molecular area\u2013temperature isobars and with observations of the surface topography by Brewster Angle Microscopy. The results described herein indicate that palmitoyl-ceramide can exhibit expanded, as well as condensed phase states. Formation of three phases was found, depending on the surface pressure and temperature: a solid (1.80\u00a0nm thick), a liquid-condensed (1.73\u00a0nm thick, likely tilted) and a liquid-expanded (1.54\u00a0nm thick) phase over the temperature range 5\u201362\u00a0\u00b0C. A large hysteretic behavior is observed for the S phase monolayer that may indicate high resistance to domain boundary deformation. A second (or higher) order S\u00a0\u2192\u00a0LC phase transition is observed at about room temperature while a first order LC\u00a0\u2192\u00a0LE transition occurs in a range of temperature encompassing the physiological one (observed above 30\u00a0\u00b0C at low surface pressure).

     "abstract": "The combined effect of trehalose and temperature on the wetting properties of L- \u03b1 -dioleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DOPC) model membranes in excess aqueous solutions has been analyzed by X-ray diffraction and extended electron density map reconstruction. At room temperature, DOPC in excess water forms a fluid lamellar L\u03b1 phase. In the presence of trehalose, no phase transitions occur, but repeat and intermembrane distances increase considerably. Electron density maps show that trehalose in solution promotes a straightening of the hydrocarbon chain packing and a reduction of the molecular average area at the polar\u2013apolar interface. Accordingly, the increased intermembrane distance is interpreted as a clear indication of a sugar screening effect of the van der Waals attractive contribution in the lamellar stacks, which overcomes the eventual decreasing of the repulsive fluctuations due to the hardening of the bilayer. By contrast to the thermally induced membrane swelling observed in excess water, in the presence of trehalose the DOPC bilayer thickness and repeat and intermembrane distances decrease continuously with temperature. While the thermal dependence of bilayer thickness is a consequence of the chain conformational disorder promoted by temperature, the changes in the intermembrane distance can be explained only assuming a trehalose-induced re-setting of the long-range force balance. The final results confirm the complex mechanism by which trehalose stabilize lipid bilayers.",

     "abstract": "The binary phase behavior of purified 1,3-dilauroyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycerol (LSL) and 1,2-dilauroyl-3-stearoyl-sn-glycerol (LLS) was investigated at a slow (0.1\u00a0\u00b0C/min) and a relatively fast (3.0\u00a0\u00b0C/min) cooling rate in terms of melting and crystallization, polymorphism, solid fat content (SFC), hardness and microstructure. Much of the behavior of the system is explained by its polymorphism and the influence of thermal processing. The \u03b1-form and the \u03b2\u2032-form of a double chain length structure were detected in the mixtures cooled at 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C/min, whereas only the \u03b2\u2032-form was detected in those cooled at 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C/min. X-ray diffraction data as well as thermodynamic data propose that the most stable phases are promoted by the symmetrical LSL. The measured trends in structural characteristics, thermal properties, SFC, relative hardness and microstructure delimit three groups of mixtures which imply a competition between the stabilizing effect of LSL and disordering introduced by kinetic effects: (a) LLS-rich mixtures with LSL molar fractions (XLSL) less than 0.3, (b) mixtures with XLSL clustered around 0.5 and (c) LSL-rich mixtures with XLSL\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.7. The balance between ordering and kinetic effects determines the polymorphism of the mixtures, which in turn determines the behavior of the LSL/LLS system. The kinetic phase diagram of the LSL/LLS binary system constructed using heating differential scanning calorimetry thermograms displayed a singularity at the 0.5LSL molar fraction which delimits two distinct behaviors: eutectic behavior in one region and monotectic behavior in the other. The molecular interactions, as depicted by a non-ideality parameter of mixing obtained from a thermodynamic model based on the Hildebrand equation, suggests an almost ideal mixing behavior and a moderate tendency to the formation of unlike-pairs in the liquid state.",

We measured the volume/lipid VL\u00a0=\u00a01426\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00c53.

Lipid bilayer structure determined by the simultaneous analysis of neutron and X-ray scattering data. Biophys.

Theory of passive permeability through lipid bilayers. J. Gen. Physiol. 131, 77\u201385).

A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor system was employed to measure the equilibrium and rate constants of the bindings. As expected, PS was found to play a dominant role in the binding of AV; its binding level was directly proportional to the PS composition in a liposome. The binding levels of FVIII and AV to liposome increased with an increase in cholesterol composition in liposome. It seemed to suggest that cholesterol in liposome acts as a \u2018phospholipid arrangement\u2019 factor by inducing the formation of PS-rich microdomains. However, in the absence of PS (20% on a mole basis), cholesterol could not exert the binding enhancement effect, which again confirmed the critical role of PS in the bindings. Stability of the AV binding was significantly improved by the increase in cholesterol content; for AV, the dissociation rate constant was decreased approximately fivefold, from 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0s\u22121 in the absence of cholesterol to 3.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124\u00a0s\u22121 in the presence of only 10% cholesterol. But, for FVIII the binding stability was not so much influenced by the cholesterol addition (up to 50% on a mole basis). In summary, by using liposomes on an SPR system, we were able to demonstrate quantitatively the apparent effects of cholesterol on the binding affinity and stability of the membrane-binding proteins.",

Multiple linear regression analyses were used for predicting retention times of molecular species, predominantly of odd-chain TAGs.

In cultivations with succinate as a carbon source the content of these TAGs increased by half (i.e., from 23.5 to 34.2%) when the cultivation temperature was lowered from 30 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C. The content of the PoPoMo, PoMoO and PPoMo (see Table 1) TAGs containing the odd-numbered-chain margaroleic acid rose from 0.0 to 7.1% while in cultivation on phenol as a carbon source the lowering of cultivation temperature caused an increase of these TAGs from 0.5 to 6.7%.",

We developed a method to observe a minute structural change of intercellular lipid matrix and corneocytes on applying the chemicals to the SC using synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique. The performance of the present method was demonstrated by applying typical chemicals, chloroform/methanol mixture, hydrophilic ethanol and hydrophobic d-limonene. From the small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction we obtained the following results: on applying chloroform/methanol mixture the intercellular lipids were extracted markedly, on applying ethanol the intercellular lipid structure was slightly disrupted, ethanol molecules were taken into the corneocytes and in addition the pools of ethanol seem to be formed in the hydrophilic region of the intercellular lipid matrix in the SC, and on applying d-limonene the repeat distance of the long lamellar structure increased by incorporating d-limonene molecules, the intercellular lipid structure was slightly disrupted, and the pools of d-limonene were formed in the hydrophobic region of the intercellular lipid matrix in the SC.",

The fundamental crystallization parameters, such as induction time of nucleation and crystallization rate, were obtained by using the Gompertz equation. The Gibb's free energy of nucleation was calculated via the Fisher\u2013Turnbull equation based on the equilibrium melting temperature. All additives, investigated in this work, proved to have an inhibition effect on nucleation and crystallization kinetics of coconut oil. Our results revealed that the inhibition effect is related to the dissimilarity of the molecular characteristics between coconut oil and the additives. The equilibrium melting temperature (Tm\u00b0) of the coconut oil\u2013additive mixtures estimated by the Hoffman\u2013Weeks method was decreased with the addition of lauric acid and increased by using sucrose esters as additives. Micrographs showing simultaneous crystallization of coconut oil and lauric acid indicated that strong molecular interaction led to the increase in lamellar thickness resulting in the Tm\u00b0 depression of coconut oil. The addition of L-195 modified the crystal morphology of coconut oil into large, dense, non-porous crystals without altering the polymorphic occurrence of coconut oil. The enhancement in lamellar thickness and crystal perfection supported the Tm\u00b0 elevation of coconut oil.",

We systematically studied the preferential solubilization of cholesterol and sterol/stanol in sodium taurodeoxycholate solutions using relatively minor plant species of sterol/stanol (brassicasterol and stigmasterol) and a non-plant sterol (cholestanol). As relatively major sterol/stanol species (\u03b2-sitosterol, \u03b2-sitostanol, and campesterol) have already been examined using nearly identical procedures to that used in our system, we were able to sufficiently discuss the cholesterol-lowering effects resulting from the molecular structures of six sterol/stanol species. The results of competitive solubilization revealed that cholestanol has the largest cholesterol-lowering effect, decreasing cholesterol solubility to 33% of that in a single solubilizate system. The molecular structure of cholestanol is also most similar to that of cholesterol. In contrast, brassicasterol and stigmasterol have little ability to decrease cholesterol solubility in a mixed binary system. Both have an unsaturated double bond at the side chain of the steroid ring. By applying thermodynamic analyses to these results, we found that the Gibbs energy changes (\u0394G\u00b0) of solubilization for sterol/stanol species with cholesterol-lowering effects show larger negative values than that for cholesterol.",

BTL liposomes can serve as membrane models for understanding the structure-function relationship of the plasma membrane in thermoacidophiles and can be used for technological applications. This article reviews the separation, characterization and structures of BTL as well as the physical properties and technological applications of BTL liposomes. One of the structural features of BTL is the presence of cyclopentane rings in the lipid hydrocarbon core. Archaea use the cyclopentane ring as an adaptation strategy to cope with high growth temperature. Special attention of this article is focused on how the number of cyclopentane rings varies with environmental factors and affects membrane properties.",

It has long been recognized that the structural changes of lipids during the phase transition from bilayer to non-bilayer have striking similarities with those accompanying membrane fusion processes. In spite of this resemblance, the numerous quantitative studies on pure lipid bilayers are difficult to apply to real membranes. One reason is that in living matter, instead of pure lipids, lipid mixtures are involved and there is currently no model that establishes the connection between pure lipids and lipid mixtures. Here, we make this connection by showing how to obtain (i) the short-range repulsion between bilayers made of lipid mixtures and, (ii) the pressure at which transition from bilayer phase to non-bilayer phases occur. We validated our models by fitting the experimental data of several lipid mixtures to the theoretical data calculated based on our model.

PFOA caused a linear depression of the main phase transition temperature Tm while increasing the width of the phase transition of all three phosphatidylcholines. Although PFOA's effect on Tm and the transition width decreased in the order DMPC\u00a0>\u00a0DPPC\u00a0>\u00a0DSPC, its relative effect on the phase behavior was largely independent of the phosphatidylcholine. PFOA caused swelling of DMPC but not DPPC and DSPC liposomes at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the DLS experiments, which suggests that PFOA partitions more readily into bilayers in the fluid phase. These findings suggest that PFOA's effect on the phase behavior of phosphatidylcholines depends on the cooperativity and state (i.e., gel versus liquid phase) of the membrane.

At the most hydration degrees investigated, the incorporation of nonionic surfactants in a phospholipid bilayer leads to an increase of the hydrophilicity, which can be shown by the presence of excess hydration. The increased hydrophilicity could be explained by the excavation of additional water binding sites due to the \u201cdilution\u201d of the dipole field of the phospholipid bilayer. Another related contribution arises from the increase of the accessible surface area due to the increase of gauche conformers that result from the steric mismatch when surfactants are incorporated into the phospholipid matrix. 2H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the quadrupolar splitting representing a measure of the order state of water. The swelling behaviour could be assessed by small-angle X-ray diffraction. 31P NMR spectroscopy was applied for the assignment of phase structures to the respective hydration range.",

Initial reconstitutions using a standard dialysis method with bulk L/P ratios ranging from 20:1 to 100:1 (w/w) gave heterogeneous samples that contained both empty vesicles and proteoliposomes with a range of L/P ratios. This is problematic because empty vesicles adsorb and rupture to form bilayer patches more rapidly than do protein-rich vesicles, resulting in the loss of protein during sample washing. Although it was not possible to find reconstitution conditions that gave homogeneous populations of vesicles with high L/P ratios, an additional freeze\u2013thaw cycle immediately after dialysis did reproducibly yield a fraction of proteoliposomes with L/P ratios above 100:1. These proteoliposomes were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and used to prepare supported bilayers with well-separated individual receptors and minimal adsorbed proteoliposomes. AFM images of such samples showed many small features protruding from the bilayer surface. These features range in height from 1 to 5\u00a0nm, consistent with the smaller intracellular domain of the protein exposed, and have lateral dimensions consistent with an individual receptor. Some bilayers with reconstituted protein also had a small fraction of higher features that are assigned to nAChR with the larger extracellular domain exposed and showed evidence for aggregation to give dimers or small oligomers. This work demonstrates the importance of using highly purified reconstituted membranes with uniform lipid\u2013protein ratios for AFM studies of integral membrane protein\u2013lipid interactions.",

Under such conditions the liposomes were found to elute at almost identical elution times, which is in contrast to earlier studies.

To date, an ultimate understanding of the ozone reactivity during sesame oil ozonation process as well as detailed 1H and 13C NMR assignments are lacking. A practical advantage of NMR is that a single NMR sample measurement can explain many issues, while similar analysis by traditional methods may require several independent and time-consuming measurements. Moreover, significant relationships among NMR spectra and both conventional chemical analysis and viscosity measurements have been found. Eventually, NMR could play an important role for quality attributes of ozonated oil derivatives.",

     "abstract": "The analysis of beef lipids is normally based on chromatographic techniques and/or gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Modern techniques of soft-ionization MS were so far scarcely used to investigate the intact lipids in muscle tissues of beef. The objective of the study was to investigate whether matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are useful tools to study the intact lipid composition of beef. For the MALDI-TOF MS and 31P NMR investigations muscle samples were selected from a feeding experiment with German Simmental bulls fed different diets. Beside the triacylglycerols (TAGs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) species the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of total muscle lipids gave also intense signals of cardiolipin (CL) species.The application of different matrix compounds, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), leads to completely different mass spectra: 9-AA is particularly useful for the detection of (polar) phospholipids, whereas apolar lipids, such as cholesterol and triacylglycerols, are exclusively detected if DHB is used. Finally, the quality of the negative ion mass spectra is much higher if 9-AA is used.",

     "abstract": "Biofuels composed by fatty acid methyl esters are widely used as partly substituting fuels for diesel fossil fuels. Additionally, it is expected that the diesel biofuel norms will be extended to ethyl esters produced from bioethanol in the upcoming years. A precise knowledge of the standard enthalpy of formation is necessary for the calculation of some parameters useful for the analysis of the combustion process and emissions of a diesel engine operating with different fuels, such as the heating value, the adiabatic flame temperature or the kinetic mechanisms. However, experimental data for this property are scarce, and only available for short-chain, saturated methyl esters. In this work, four estimation methods for the calculation of the enthalpy of formation are examined and compared. Three of them are simple methods based on groups or bonds contribution, and another one is a computational method (with Gaussian 03 software). After presenting the implementation rules for each of them, conclusions are stated based on the results attained. Gaussian and Benson-Groups methods seem to be more accurate in predicting the actual values of the enthalpy of formation, both methods considering the separation between double bonds and the edge effects in the molecule. However, only the Gaussian method considers the effect of the position of the double bond in the molecule for all the unsaturated esters.",

     "abstract": "Phenylpropanoid glycosides are water-soluble compounds widely distributed, most of them deriving from medicinal herbs. Among them, verbascoside or acteoside has exhibited a wide biological activity, being free radical scavenging the most representative one. Moreover, antitumor, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and wound healing properties have been previously described. Herein, the interaction of verbascoside with phospholipid membranes has been studied by means of differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence anisotropy and dynamic light scattering. Verbascoside showed stronger affinity for negatively charged membranes composed of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) than for phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. This compound promoted phase separation of lipid domains in PC membranes and formed a stable lipid complex with and approximate phospholipid/verbascoside ratio of 4:1. Despite its hydrophilic character, verbascoside's caffeoyl moiety was located deep into the hydrophobic core of PC membranes and was almost inaccessible to spin probes located at different depths in PG membranes. This compound affected the ionization behavior of the PG phosphate group and most likely interacted with the vesicles surface. The presence of verbascoside decreased the particle size in PG unilamellar vesicles through the increase of the phospholipid head group area. A localization of verbascoside filling the upper region of PG bilayers close to the phospholipid/water interface is proposed. These effects on membranes may help to understand the mechanism of the biological activity of verbascoside and other similar phenylpropanoid glycosides.",

The formation of pores was accompanied by a decrease in lateral diffusion coefficient of the lipids to approximately 60% of its initial value. The second, simultaneous, effect is the formation of tubules of approximately 30\u00a0nm radius and length of the order of 10\u00a0\u03bcm.

These two membrane types were determined as co-existing phases based on their spontaneous and stable separation and named heavy and light phase according to their sedimentation behaviour. Marked differences were seen in the physical properties of these phases, even though only minor compositional variation was detected. The light, less polar phase was found to be less ordered and more fluid and seemed to allow significantly lower amount of water penetration into the membrane\u2013water interface than pure POPC membrane. The heavy phase, apart from their slightly altered water penetration, resembled more a pure POPC membrane.

Our results demonstrated that the increase in \u2013SH groups in HDL homocysteinylated in vitro (Hcy-HDL) was associated with apoprotein conformational changes and modifications of physico-chemical properties.A significant decrease of paraoxonase and lactonase activity of HDL bound PON1 has also been observed in Hcy-HDL. A significant decrease of the enzyme activity has been observed also in purified PON1 homocysteinylated following the same experimental conditions used for HDL. Moreover, we demonstrated that oxidized HDL were more susceptible to homocysteinylation with respect to control HDL.The modifications of apoprotein conformation and physico-chemical properties in Hcy-HDL and the decrease of paraoxonase-1 activity could affect the protective effect of HDL against oxidative damage and/or homocysteinylation and could contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in patients affected by diseases associated with oxidative damage, in renal disorders and in patients affected by genetic or nutritional disorders of homocysteine or folate metabolism.",

     "abstract": "\u03b1-Helical membrane proteins fulfill many vital roles in all living cells and constitute the majority of drug targets. However, their relevance is in no way paralleled by our current understanding of their structures and functions. This is because membrane proteins present a number of experimental obstacles that are difficult to surmount by classical methods developed for water-soluble proteins. Moreover, membrane proteins are not only challenging on their very own but, when embedded in a biological membrane, also reside in an outstandingly complex milieu. These difficulties have fostered a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach, in which a membrane protein is dissected into shorter and easier-to-handle transmembrane (TM) peptides. Under suitable conditions, such peptides fold independently and retain many of the properties displayed in the context of the full-length parent protein.This contribution reviews some of the most notable insights into \u03b1-helical membrane proteins gleaned from experiments on protein-derived TM peptides. We recapitulate some peculiar properties of lipid bilayers that render them such a complex and unique environment and discuss generic features pertaining to hydrophobic peptides derived from \u03b1-helical membrane proteins. The main part of the review is devoted to a critical discussion of particularly interesting examples of TM peptides studied in membrane-mimetic systems of increasing complexity: isotropic solvents, detergent micelles, lipid bilayers, and biological membranes. The unifying theme is to explore to what extent TM peptides in combination with different membrane-mimetic systems can aid in advancing our knowledge and comprehension of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins as well as in developing new pharmacological tools.",

A gold-coated QCM crystal was used as one of the electrodes and an Indium\u2013tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slide was used as the second electrode for electroformation. Increases in the frequency and decreases in the dissipation were observed immediately upon voltage application between the two electrodes, indicating the loss of lipid from the QCM surface. Concurrently, we observed vesicles on the QCM electrode surface by differential interference contrast (DIC)-optical microscopy. The lipid-coated substrates were measured with AFM at various stages in the electroformation, and a significant change in the morphology of the lipid film was observed. Ellipsometry was used to find the average thickness of lipid film. The QCM data were fitted to a viscoelastic model to determine the viscoelastic properties and time dependence of the film thickness. All methods used to determine film thickness give values in reasonable quantitative agreement. Differences between the methods are consistent with what one might expect due to what is actually measured in the individual techniques. The comparison between mass loss and observed vesicles suggest that the vesicles formed are first localized to the substrate and then slowly released into the solution. By comparing the mass lost from the lipid film, to the total surface area of lipid vesicles observed, it is apparent that only a relatively small fraction of the lipid goes into the production of unilamellar vesicles with sizes detectable with optical microscopy.",

Ceramides (CERs) as the major constituent of the SC lipid matrix are of particular interest. At the moment, 11 classes of CERs are identified, but the effect of each single ceramide species is still not known.Therefore in this article, the thermotropic behaviour of the long chain \u03c9-acylceramides CER[EOS] and CER[EOP] was studied using X-ray powder diffraction and FT-Raman spectroscopy.It was found that the \u03c9-acylceramides CER[EOS] and CER[EOP] do not show a pronounced polymorphism which is observed for shorter chain ceramides as a significant feature. The phase behaviour of both ceramides is strongly influenced by the extremely long acyl-chain residue. The latter has a much stronger influence compared with the structure of the polar head group, which is discussed as extremely important for the appearance of a rich polymorphism. Despite the strong influence of the long chain, the additional OH-group of the phyto-sphingosine type CER[EOP] influences the lamellar repeat distance and the chain packing. The less polar sphingosine type CER[EOS] is stronger influenced by the long acyl-chain residue. Hydration is necessary for the formation of an extended hydrogen-bonding network between the polar head groups leading to the appearance of a long-periodicity phase (LPP). In contrast, the more polar CER[EOP] forms the LPP with densely packed alkyl chains already in the dry state.",

     "abstract": "The crucial step in the preparation of the title arsonolipids starting from the dichloromethane-soluble dithioarsonite CH2(OH)CH(OH)CH2\u2013As(SPh)2 is to avoid an internal cyclization during the acylation which protects the primary \u2013OH group from being acylated. This was to a large extent accomplished by using fatty acyl chloride in the presence of the weak base pyridine and controlling the temperature and rate of the acyl chloride addition, giving \u223c70% yields of arsonolipids. The presence of catalytic amounts of 4-dimethylaminopyridine boosted the yields to 82\u201385%. This yield is a great improvement over the yields (20\u201355%) previously achieved. The acylating systems (RCO)2O or RCOCl and BF3\u00b7Et2O gave only moderate yields (25\u201360%) of arsonolipids.",

     "abstract": "Lipid monolayers can be laterally dilated under the action of the barriers in a Langmuir trough thus allowing for measurements of their mechanical response. We study the stress response of Escherichia coli polar lipid extract and POPC against oscillatory deformations stressed up to a 20% of the initial area. For E. coli monolayers a nonlinear regime described by a series of Fourier harmonics of the excitation mode is found beyond a critical strain (uC\u00a0\u2248\u00a01%). In contrast, the mechanical response of POPC monolayers is found linear upon much larger deformations. For E. coli monolayers the stress\u2013strain plot reflects stress softening (plastic-like) behaviour whilst POPC behaves as a linear elastic body. No viscous delay with respect to the applied strain is detected in both systems, as expected for high fluid materials. The presence of phase coexistence domains as lipid reservoirs to facilitate lateral diffusion is claimed as a plausible mechanism underlying the observed mechanical plasticity.",

     "abstract": "N,N,N-Trialkylammonioundecahydrododecaborates (1-), a novel class of compounds of interest for use as anions in ionic liquids, interact with DPPC liposomes. Increasing compound concentration causes an increasing negative \u03b6 potential. Dissociation constants demonstrate that the binding capacity increases strongly with longer chain length. N,N,N-Trialkylammonioundecahydrododecaborates with longer alkyl chains show a detergent-like behavior: the compounds incorporate into the liposome membrane and differential scanning calorimetric experiment show already low concentrations cause a complete disappearance of the peak representing the gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. In contrast, compounds with shorter alkyl chains only interact with the headgroups of the lipids. Investigations by means of cryo-TEM reveal that all derivatives induce significant morphological changes of the liposomes. N,N,N-Trialkylammonioundecahydrododecaborates with short alkyl chains produce large bilayer sheets, whereas those with longer alkyl chains tend to induce the formation of open or multi-layered liposomes. We propose that the binding of N,N,N-trialkylammonioundecahydrododecaborates is mainly due to electrostatic interactions between the doubly negatively charged cluster unit and the positively charged choline headgroup; the positively charged ammonium group might be in contact with the deeper-lying negatively charged phosphate. For N,N,N-trialkylammonioundecahydrododecaborates with longer alkyl chains hydrophobic interactions with the non-polar hydrocarbon part of the membrane constitute an additional important driving force for the association of the compounds to the lipid bilayer.",

It was found that monolayers of all studied compounds were expanded. The additivity rule was not fulfilled and the collapse pressure of mixtures was different from these recorded for pure components. This can be related with the existence of interactions between molecules in mixed monolayers. Tocopherol diminished the differences between parameters of monolayers formed by lipids extracted from objects cultivated on various media (with and without cadmium).",

     "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are naturally produced by numerous organisms including insects, plants and mammals. Their non-specific mode of action is thought to involve the transient perturbation of bacterial membranes but the molecular mechanism underlying the rearrangement of the lipid molecules to explain the formation of pores and micelles is still poorly understood. Biological membranes mostly adopt planar lipid bilayers; however, antimicrobial peptides have been shown to induce non-lamellar lipid phases which may be intimately linked to their proposed mechanisms of action. This paper reviews antimicrobial peptides that alter lipid phase behavior in three ways: peptides that induce positive membrane curvature, peptides that induce negative membrane curvature and peptides that induce cubic lipid phases. Such structures can coexist with the bilayer structure, thus giving rise to lipid polymorphism induced upon addition of antimicrobial peptides. The discussion addresses the implications of induced lipid phases for the mode of action of various antimicrobial peptides.",

     "abstract": "Interaction of a cationic phenazinium dye, phenosafranin (PSF), with the anionic liposomal vesicle/bilayer of dimyristoyl-l-\u03b1-phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) has been demonstrated using steady state and time resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy techniques. The charge transfer emission spectrum of PSF shows a dramatic modification in terms of fluorescence yield together with an appreciable hypsochromic shift in the lipid environment. The blue shift indicates a lowering in polarity inside the vesicle as compared to that in bulk water. The fluorescence and fluorescence quenching studies and micropolarity determination reveal that the cationic fluorophore has a profound binding interaction with the anionic DMPG membrane. Anisotropy study indicates the imposition of a motional restriction on the probe inside the bilayer. The electrostatic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic lipid membrane has been argued to be the reason behind all these observations. The results could be useful in analyzing membrane organization and heterogeneity in natural membranes exploiting PSF or alike compounds as fluorescent probes.",
