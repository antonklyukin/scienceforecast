     "abstract": "Chitooligosaccharides (COS), the depolymerization products of chitin, have many potential applications in agriculture and medicine since they induce immunostimulating effects and disease protective responses. Most of their biological activities require degrees of polymerization (DP) larger than the tetrasaccharide, but structurally well-defined COS with DP larger than six are difficult to produce due to their high insolubility and complex isolation from chitin hydrolysates. Enzymatic synthesis by exploiting the transglycosylation activity of chitinases offers a potential strategy for the assembly of oligomers in the range of bioactive DPs. We here explore the glycosynthase-like activity of six GH18 chitinases from bacterial and archaeal origin by mutating the catalytic assisting residue in the substrate-assisted mechanism of this enzyme family. The alanine mutants at the assisting residue have a significant, but not essential, effect on the hydrolase activity. We studied the ability of the alanine mutants at the assisting residue to catalyze the polymerization of an oxazoline derivative as donor substrate, selecting the oxazoline of pentaacetylchitopentaose (DP5ox) with the aim of obtaining larger oligomers/polymers that, being insoluble, might be resistant to further reactions by the hydrolytically compromised mutant enzymes. For all the enzymes, insoluble polymeric material was obtained, with DP10 as major component, but other COS with different DPs were also obtained, limiting the practical application to produce oligomers/polymers with a defined DP. The balance between the residual hydrolase activity of the mutant enzymes and the solubility/precipitation kinetics still lead to hydrolysis and/or transglycosylation reactions on the newly formed products. From the selected enzymes, the Thermococcus kodakaraensis ChiA D1022A mutant gave the best results, with the formation of insoluble polymers in 45% yield (w/w) and containing about 55% of the target DP10 product.",

Alkylation of these C-glucosyl compounds containing 1,2-trans-diol, namely 2- and 3-OH were first optimized with benzyl bromide. The reaction has then been extended to various electrophiles thus providing 3-O-substituted C-glucosyl compounds. These results are one of the first examples of regioselective alkylation with functionalized electrophiles on glycosyl compounds featuring a trans-vicinal diol. Furthermore, we describe some results obtained during regioselective deprotection of 4,6-O-benzylidene protecting group.

     "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase enzymes (GP) catalyse reversible reactions; the glucose transfer from glycogen to inorganic phosphate (Pi, phosphorolysis) or the reverse glucose transfer from glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) to glycogen (synthesis). Rabbit muscle GPb (rmGPb) was used as a model enzyme to study the reversible enzyme reaction. To follow both directions of this reversible reaction, we have developed a novel isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method for the determination of the direct reaction rate. The preference of forward or reverse reaction was ensured by the 0.1 or 10 concentration ratios of G-1-P/Pi, respectively. Substrate specificity was studied using different maltooligosaccharides and glycogen. Based on the KM values, glycogen and 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl maltoheptaoside (CNP-G7) were found to be analogous substrates, which allowed to optimize the method by taking advantage of the CNP chromophore being detectable in HPLC. In case of CNP-G7, substrate inhibition was observed and characterised by Ki of 23\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fmM. Inhibition of human GP is a promising strategy for the treatment of diabetes. Our ITC measurements have confirmed that caffeine and glucopyranosylidene-spiro-thiohydantoin (GTH), as known GPb inhibitors, inhibit the rmGPb-catalysed reversible reaction in both directions. Ki values obtained in the direction of synthesis (1.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.14\u202fmM for caffeine and 11.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.0\u202f\u03bcM for GTH) have been shown to be in good agreement with the Ki values obtained in the direction of phosphorolysis (4.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.26\u202fmM for caffeine and 13.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6\u202f\u03bcM for GTH). The higher difference between the inhibition constants of caffeine was explained by the non-competitive mechanism.The described ITC method using the developed experimental design and reaction conditions is suitable for activity measurements of different phosphorylase enzymes on various substrates and is applicable for inhibition studies as well.",

Fucosyl substituents prevent enzymatic degradations of FCS by chondroitinases, which are effectively used in the structural analysis of vertebrate chondroitin sulfates, and hence, several non-enzymatic approaches to structural elucidation of FCS have been developed. They include combination of chemical modifications, specific degradation of polymeric chain and spectroscopic investigations of the products. In addition, there are examples of successful determination of the structure of non-modified FCS using NMR spectroscopic methods. NMR spectroscopy is especially effective in characterization of molecules with regular distribution of substituents along the polymeric chains. Otherwise combination of both chemical and spectroscopic methods is required for unambiguous elucidation of non-regular FCS structures. Structural variations of FCS studied up to now were shown to be species specific and include differences in type, amount and position of branches, as well as in degree and pattern of sulfation. These features of FCS can modify significantly the spectrum of their biological activities.

     "abstract": "Deoxysugars are intrinsic components in a number of antibiotics, antimicrobials, and therapeutic agents that often dictate receptor binding, improve efficacy, and provide a diverse toolbox in modifying glycoconjugate function due to an extensive number of unique isomers and inherent conformational flexibility. Hence, this work provides a comprehensive examination of the conformational effects associated with deoxygenation of the pyranose ring. Both the location and degree of deoxygenation were evaluated by interrogating the energetic landscape for a number of mono- and dideoxyhexopyranose derivatives using DFT methods (M05-2X/cc-pVTZ(-f)). Both anomeric forms and in some cases, the alternate chair form, have been investigated in the gas phase. As was documented in a preceding study, variation of the C-6 oxidation state has been shown to affect the anomeric preference of select glucose stereoisomers. Similar results were also observed for several deoxysugar isomers in this work, wherein the alternate anomer was favored upon reduction to the 6-deoxyhexose derivative or oxidation to the hexonic acid. Additionally, comparison of relative Gibbs free energies revealed C-3 deoxygenation imparts greater instability compared to C-2 or C-4 deoxygenation, as indicated by an increase in free energy for 3-deoxysugars. A polarizable continuum solvation model was also applied to empirically validate theoretical results for several deoxysugars, wherein good agreement with both carbon (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f1.6\u202fppm) and proton (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.20\u202fppm) NMR shifts was observed for the majority of isomers. Solvated and gas phase anomeric ratios were also calculated and compared favorably to reported literature values, although some discrepancies are noted.",

     "abstract": "Resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) to antibiotics has motivated the development of an efficacious KP human vaccine that would not be subject to antibiotic resistance. Klebsiella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated O polysaccharide (OPS) types have provoked broad interest as a vaccine antigen as there are only 4 that predominate worldwide (O1, O2a, O3, O5). Klebsiella O1 and O2 OPS are polygalactans that share a common D-Gal-I structure, for which a variant D-Gal-III was recently discovered. To understand the potential impact of this variability on antigenicity, a detailed molecular picture of the conformational differences associated with the addition of the D-Gal-III (1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-\u03b1-Galp branch is presented using enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations. In D-Gal-I two major conformational states are observed while the presence of the 1\u202f\u2192\u202f4 branch in D-Gal-III resulted in only a single dominant extended state. Stabilization of the more folded states in D-Gal-I is due to a O4-H\u22efO2 hydrogen bond in the linear backbone that cannot occur in D-Gal-III as the O4 is in the Galp(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)Galp glycosidic linkage. The impact of branching in D-Gal-III also significantly decreases the accessibility of the monosaccharides in the linear backbone region of D-Gal-I, while the accessibility of the terminal D-Gal-II region of the OPS is not substantially altered. The present results suggest that a vaccine that targets both the D-Gal-I and D-Gal-III LPS can be developed by using D-Gal-III as the antigen combined with cross-reactivity experiments using the Gal-II polysaccharide to assure that this region of the LPS is the primary epitope of the antigen.",

Few nanoliters of reagents are sufficient and no labeling is required for this assay. The effect of natural and original synthetic effectors of hyaluronidase was evaluated. These di- and trisaccharides from linkage region of proteoglycans were synthesized in 30\u201340 steps from monomeric units using classical protection, deprotection, glycosylation and deoxygenation reactions. The influence of the chain length (di/trisaccharide), the modification type (methoxy/deoxy) and its position (2/4/6) was studied.The inhibition and/or activation percentages were determined at two concentrations of effectors; 0.2\u202fmM and 2\u202fmM.

Results showed that hyaluronidase was mostly inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by a deoxy modification and activated by a methoxy modification. Trisaccharides were found to be more effective on hyaluronidase activity than disaccharides. Position 4 was found to be more favorable for hyaluronidase activity than position 6 and the activity in position 2 was negligible. For a better understanding of the enzyme function mode, the inhibition constant (Ki) was also evaluated by CE (Ki\u202f\u223c\u202f2\u202fmM).

The main products from xylohexaose and various xylan substrates were X1-X3 xylooligosaccharides. Analysis of kinetic parameters indicated that NtSymX11 displays an outstanding catalytic performance when compared to other reported xylanases, and CBM36 enhances the activity by increasing the affinity to the substrate.

Mono- and disaccharide residues were attached to syn- or anti-bimane central cores via thio-, disulfido- or selenoglycosidic linkages to obtain novel fluorescent or nonfluorescent glycoconjugates. Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition of glycosyl azides to a bimane diethynyl derivative furnished further bivalent glycoconjugates with sugar residues linked to the central bimane core via 1,2,3-triazole rings. We have determined the crystal and molecular structures of several glycosylated and non-glycosylated bimanes and report fluorescence data for the new compounds.",

The maximum chitinase activity recorded after 48-h of incubation at 55\u202f\u00b0C was 9000 U/mL. Pure enzyme was obtained after heat treatment (20\u202fmin\u202fat 90\u202f\u00b0C) followed by sequential column chromatographies on fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Based on MALDI\u2013TOF/MS analysis, the purified enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 45201.10\u202fDa. The 27 residue NH2-terminal sequence of the enzyme showed high homology with Bacillus GH-18 chitinases family. The optimum pH and temperature values for chitinase activity were pH 3.5 and 90\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. In addition, the enzyme was halotolerant and can be classified as an extremozyme. The pure enzyme was completely inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (p-CMB) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Its Km and kcat values were 0.253\u202fmg colloidal chitin/mL and 47000 s\u22121, respectively. Interestingly, its catalytic efficiency was higher than those of chitinases ChiA-Hh59 from Hydrogenophilus hirchii KB-DZ44 and chitodextrinase from Streptomyces griseus, and N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase from Trichoderma viride. The studied chitinase exhibited high activity towards colloidal chitin, chitin azure, glycol chitin, while it did not hydrolyse chitibiose and amylose. Additionally, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis from chitin-oligosaccharides showed that ChiA-Mt45 acted as an endosplitting enzyme.

The processive mechanism is efficient in the degradation of insoluble substrates, but comes at the cost of reduced enzyme speed. We show that less processive chitinase variants with reduced ability to degrade crystalline chitin, regain much of this ability when combined with a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO). When combined with an LPMO, several less processive chitinase mutants showed equal or even increased activity on chitin compared to the wild-type. Thus, LPMOs affect the need for processivity in polysaccharide degrading enzyme cocktails, which implies that the composition of such cocktails may need reconsideration.",

Very recently, the Shao group reported that another key metabolic intermediate in LPS biosynthesis, ADP-heptose, could be transported into mammalian cells and bind with ALPK1 (alpha-kinase 1), which leads to a series of strong immune responses.

     "abstract": "Cerebroside is an important family of the mono-glycosylated ceramides involved in the larger family of glycosphingolipid and sulfatide. Cerebroside is synthesized from ceramide by the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose, and degraded back to ceramide, which plays an important role at the epidermis protecting interior of the body as a barrier. Because cerebroside is regarded as the source molecule of ceramide and is amphiphilic in nature, cerebroside is considered valuable as the ingredient of cosmetic lotion.Various sources can be considered as raw material of cerebrosides. Starfish is considered as one of such potent source. However, the structure of the ceramide part of cerebroside is not fully investigated. Therefore, the individual structures of cerebroside molecules need to be identified including sphingosine and fatty acyl group composition to assess the potential of the molecule.We investigated and determined the structures of cerebrosides in starfish Asterias amurensis using LC-MS, GC-MS, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and 1H NMR. We also discovered a characteristic structure distribution that was divided into three major groups: 1) a group composed of a relatively long sphingosine (C22) and a short length of fatty acyl group (less than C16), 2) a group composed of a typical C18 sphingosine and long fatty acyl groups (greater than C23), and 3) a group composed of C18 sphingosine and fatty acyl groups with their length less than C18. The calculated Log P values of cerebrosides ranging from 9 to 11 covered about 80% of the molecules that were in the range of those used in cosmetics, thus showing the potential usefulness of starfish Asterias amurensis as a source of raw material for cerebrosides.",

     "abstract": "Galectins are a family of carbohydrate-recognizing proteins that by interacting with specific glycoepitopes can mediate important biological processes, including immune cell homeostasis and activation of tolerogenic circuits. Among the different members of this family, Galectin 1 and 3 have shown pro-tumorigenic effects, being overexpressed in numerous neoplasic diseases, proving to be relevant in tumor immune escape, tumor progression and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, generation of specific glycosides that could inhibit their pro-tumorigenic ability by blocking their carbohydrate recognition domain is one of the current major challenges in the field. Considering that galectin-ligand binding strength is closely related to the ligand structure, analysis of this relationship provides valuable information for rational design of high-affinity ligands that could work as effective galectin inhibitors. Taking profit of the ability of glycosidases to catalyze transglycosylation reactions we achieved the enzymatic synthesis of \u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-d-Glcp (2), a mixture of \u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-d-Glcp (5) and \u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f3)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-d-Glcp (6), and finally benzyl \u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (9), with reaction yields between 16 and 27%. All the galactosides were purified, and characterized using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Docking results performed between the synthesized compounds and human Galectin 1 (hGal-1) and human Galectin 3 (hGal-3) showed that the replacement of a glucose moiety linked to the terminal galactose with a galactose moiety, decreases the affinity for these galectins. Moreover, regarding the interglycosidic bond the most favorable \u03b2-Gal linkage seems to be \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4) followed by \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f3) and \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6) for hGal-1, and \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4) followed by \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6) and \u03b2(1\u202f\u2192\u202f3) for hGal-3.

Results obtained from inhibitory studies revealed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 12.80\u202f\u03bcM and 2.63\u202f\u03bcM for 4-resorcinol glucosides 3 and 4, respectively. The IC50 value of 4 was approximately 4 times greater than that of kojic acid, which is a typical tyrosinase inhibitor. In contrast, 5-resorcinol glucosides 5 and 6 exhibited tyrosinase-inhibitory activity; however their IC50s were not estimated within 100\u202f\u03bcM. These results suggested that the discovering 4-resorcinol structure of dihydrooxyresveratrol glucoside is crucial for inducing potent tyrosinase-inhibitory activity.",

While substantial progress has been made on advancing chemical glycosylation methods, incorporating enzymes into carbohydrate synthetic schemes has become increasingly practical as more carbohydrate biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes as well as their mutants with synthetic application are identified and expressed for preparative and large-scale synthesis. Chemoenzymatic strategies that integrate the flexibility of chemical derivatization with enzyme-catalyzed reactions have been extremely powerful. Briefly summarized here are our experiences on developing one-pot multienzyme (OPME) systems and representative chemoenzymatic strategies from others using glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions for synthesizing diverse structures of oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates. These strategies allow the synthesis of complex carbohydrates including those containing naturally occurring carbohydrate postglycosylational modifications (PGMs) and non-natural functional groups. By combining these srategies with facile purification schemes, synthetic access to the diverse space of carbohydrate structures can be automated and will not be limited to specialists.",

Instead of applying homogeneous catalysis process with conventional inorganic acid catalysts like HCl and HClO4, it was found that heterogeneous catalysis using zeolites could be used for the one-pot synthesis of O-methyl 2,3-O-isopropylidenepentofuranoses directly from d-sugars, MeOH and acetone at mild condition. The best catalyst was H-beta zeolite containing a Si/Al molar ratio of 150, where a yield of >83% was obtained.

Activity tests of PNGases have been little improved since their discovery four decades ago, and still rely on observing deglycosylation patterns of glycoproteins or glycopeptides using SDS-PAGE or HPLC analysis. These techniques cannot be easily adapted for automated sampling and high-throughput procedures. Herein, we describe a PNGase activity assay which relies on the conversion of WST-1, a yellowish, water-soluble tetrazolium dye (sodium 2-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitro-phenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolate), into a blue formazan dye. In this work, we showed that WST-1 could be reduced by N-glycans, which were enzymatically released from glycoprotein substrates. After optimization of the assay conditions, the robustness of the method was challenged by quantifying the activity of various PNGase isoforms at different purification stages using a microwell plate reader. Furthermore, the assay could be used to obtain steady-state kinetics of PNGase H+ wild-type and mutant variants, which showed significant differences in their enzymatic reaction rates. The simplicity and robustness of this method might be of benefit for the detection of PNGase activity in routine applications of large amounts of samples.",

GlmA from Clostridium acetobutylicum and RmNag from Rhizomucor miehei, which have been defined as glucosamine N-acetyltransferases, were herein demonstrated to be also capable of acetylating the free amino group on the very first glycine residue of peptide in spite of varied catalytic efficiency. The human recombinant N-acetyltransferase of Naa10p, however, prefers primary amine groups in the peptides as opposed to glucosamine.

Dysregulation of the O-GlcNAc pathway has been linked to the etiology of several diseases such as neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and cancer. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes the removal of O-GlcNAc from the modified proteins and several carbohydrate-based OGA inhibitors have been synthesized to understand the role of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in physiological and pathological conditions. However, many of the inhibitors lack selectivity for OGA over lysosomal hexosaminidases A and B. Aiming the selectively inhibition of OGA, we propose herein the synthesis of twelve novel glucopyranoside derivatives exploring the bioisosteric replacement of the GlcNAc 2-acetamide group by 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole ring, bearing a variety of central chains with different shapes. Compounds were readily prepared through \"Copper(I) Catalyzed Azide/Alkyne Cycloaddition\" (CuAAC) reaction between a sugar azide and different terminal alkynes.

Structure-activity relationship analyses and molecular docking simulations demonstrated that the bridge of two-carbon atoms between the C-4 position of the triazole and the phenyl ring (6a), which may be replaced by heteroatoms such as N (6k) or O (6l), is fundamental for accommodation and inhibition within OGA catalytic pocket.",

Matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for analyzing large molecules due to its wide mass working range; however, the observed DP of PSAs using such an instrument is unreliable owing to sensitivity bias towards low-mass ions. A multi-layer MALDI sample preparation protocol is demonstrated in the current study to improve PSA sensitivity, and a dynamic instrument optimization method (DIOM) is employed to minimize detector saturation over a wide mass range. The DP information obtained in the DIOM combines a series of mass spectral data obtained with individually optimized instrument parameters to minimize the problem of sensitivity bias in respective mass ranges. The resultant mass spectra facilitate unambiguous determination of DP in the high-mass range due to significantly improved spectral quality. The main instrument parameters involved in the optimization process include extraction delay in MALDI ion source as well as the cutoff mass of the ion detector. In comparison to conventional methods, the DIOM doubles the maximum DP that can be unambiguously identified by mass spectrometry.",

Alginate lyase has received great interests due to its use in oligosaccharide preparation.

In this paper, the degradation products of Alginate lyase from Isoptericola halotolerans CGMCC 5336 were size-fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and the fractions were characterized by TLC, HPLC, MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The Mw values for these fractions were 352, 528, 704\u202fDa which represented di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide fragments, respectively. The 1H NMR revealed that the non-reducing ends of these oligosaccharides were 4-deoxy-L-erythro-hex-4-enepyranosyluronate and the reducing ends of these oligosaccharides were all guluronic acid. Therefore, it is believed that the alginate lyase produced by Isoptericola halotolerans CGMCC 5336 was capable of performing \u03b2 elimination on guluronic acid residue so that low molecular weight oligosaccharides with guluronic acid on the reducing end could be obtained in this way.",

The highest enzyme activity of 3741 U/mL was obtained, and the crude enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a purification fold of 7.3 and a recovery yield of 11.6%. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be approximately 34\u202fkDa on SDS-PAGE. TaGlu34 was most active at pH 6.0 and 75\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. It showed excellent thermostability with thermal denaturing half-lives of 209, 130 and 69\u202fmin\u202fat 50, 60 and 70\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. TaGlu34 exhibited strict substrate specificity towards barley \u03b2-glucan (13,527 U/mg), oat \u03b2-glucan (12,502 U/mg) and lichenan (9225 U/mg), but displayed no activity on other tested polysaccharides including laminarin, xylan, pullulan, CMC and starch. TaGlu34 hydrolyzed barley \u03b2-glucan and lichenan to yield both mainly disaccharide and trisaccharide, suggesting that it should be an endo type \u03b2-1,3-1,4-glucanase. Furthermore, TaGlu34 efficiently degraded the \u03b2-glucan component in oat bran to produce mainly oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization (DP) 3\u20135, with the highest conversion ratio of 47.1%. The high yield and excellent enzymatic properties of TaGlu34 may make it a good candidate in industries.",

     "abstract": "Sophorose (Sop2) is known as a powerful inducer of cellulases in Trichoderma reesei, and in recent years 1,2-\u03b2-D-oligoglucan phosphorylase (SOGP) has been found to use Sop2 in synthetic reactions. From the structure of the complex of SOGP with Sop2, it was predicted that both the 3-hydroxy group at the reducing end glucose moiety of Sop2 and the 3\u2032-hydroxy group at the non-reducing end glucose moiety of Sop2 were important for substrate recognition. In this study, three kinds of 3- and/or 3\u2032-deoxy-Sop2 derivatives were synthesized to evaluate this mechanism. The deoxygenation of the 3-hydroxy group of D-glucopyranose derivative was performed by radical reduction using a toluoyl group as a leaving group. The utilization of a toluoyl group that plays two roles (a leaving group for the deoxygenation and a protecting group for a hydroxy group) resulted in efficient syntheses of the three target compounds. The NMR spectra of the two final compounds (3-deoxy- and 3,3\u2032-dideoxy-Sop2) suggested that the glucose moiety of the reducing end of Sop2 can easily take on a furanose structure (five-membered ring structure) by deoxygenation of the 3-hydroxy group of Sop2. In addition, the ratio of the five- and six-membered ring structures changed depending on the temperature. The SOGPs exhibited remarkably lower specific activity for 3\u2032-deoxy- and 3,3\u2032-dideoxy-Sop2, indicating that the 3\u2032-hydroxy group of Sop2 is important for substrate recognition by SOGPs.",

Method 1 was optimized for eleven different carbohydrates: three pentoses (ribose, arabinose, xylose), three hexoses (glucose, fructose, mannose), and five dimers (sucrose, cellobiose, maltose, trehalose, lactose). Method 1 can monitor these carbohydrates simultaneously, except in the case of co-elution of xylose/arabinose and lactose/maltose/cellobiose peaks. Using the same stationary and mobile phases as in Method 1, Method 2 was developed to separate glucose and galactose, which were indistinguishable in Method 1.

     "abstract": "Lactonization and proton dissociation of sugar acids take place simultaneously in acidic aqueous solutions. The protonation-deprotonation processes are always fast, whilst the formation and hydrolysis of \u03b3- and \u03b4-lactones are usually slower. Thus, both thermodynamic and kinetic information are required for the complete understanding of these reactions. The protonation constant (Kp) of l-gulonate (Gul\u2013) was determined from potentiometric and polarimetric measurements, while the individual lactonization constants (KL,\u03b3 and KL,\u03b4) for l-gulonic acid (HGul) were obtained via 13C NMR experiments. The applicability of this method was proven by measuring these well-known constants for d-gluconic acid (HGluc) and by comparing them to literature data. l-gulonic acid \u03b3-lactone (\u03b3-HGul) has remarkable stability in contrast with \u03b4-HGul as well as \u03b3- and \u03b4-HGluc. The polarimetric measurement implies that the main factor responsible for the enhanced stability of \u03b3-HGul is that its hydrolysis is much slower than that of \u03b4-HGul. This higher stability of the \u03b3-HGul ring over its \u03b4-isomer was also confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. A new confirmed feature of the reaction is that in parallel to H3O+, HGul also catalyzes the formation and reverse hydrolytic processes of \u03b3-HGul, similarly to other general acid catalysts.",

     "abstract": "A sulfated polysaccharide, designated MAP2, was isolated from Monostroma angicava by water extraction, anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The structural characteristics of MAP2 were investigated by chemical and spectroscopic methods, including methylation analysis, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and electrospray mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation spectroscopic analyses. The results showed that MAP2 was primarily composed of rhamnose with small amounts of xylose, glucuronic acid and glucose. The molecular weight of MAP2 was estimated to be about 671\u202fkDa. The backbone of MAP2 was mainly constituted by 3-linked, 2-linked-\u00e1-l-rhamnose residues. Sulfate substitutions were at C-2/C-4 of 3-linked-\u00e1-l-rhamnose and C-3/C-4 of 2-linked-\u00e1-l-rhamnose residues. The branches consisted of 3-linked and 2-linked-\u00e1-l-rhamnose with monosulfate/unsulfate, as well as small amounts of \u03b2-d-GlcA-(1\u2192 and \u03b2-d-GlcA (2SO4)-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f.

The present method showed satisfactory performance for both saccharides. It was applied to assay sea cucumbers (Stichopus japonicus) reared in pond grow-out or bottom sowing, and the results were compared with those obtained by traditional HPLC method and 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue test, which could only provide the total sea cucumber polysaccharide (SCP) contents. No difference of total SCP content was observed between sea cucumbers reared through different ways, while a higher ratio of FCS to FUC of sea cucumbers of pond grow-out was revealed by the present method.

     "abstract": "Streptococcus suis serotype 3 is counted among the S. suis serotypes causing clinical disease in pigs. Yet, limited information is available on this serotype. Here we determined for the first time the chemical composition and structure of serotype 3 capsular polysaccharide (CPS), a major bacterial virulence factor and the antigen at the origin of S. suis classification into serotypes. Chemical and spectroscopic data gave the repeating unit sequence for serotype 3: [4)D-GlcA (\u03b21-3)d-QuiNAc4NAc(\u03b21-]n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of di-N-acetyl-d-bacillosamine (QuiNAc4NAc) containing polysaccharides in Streptococci and the second time this rare diamino sugar has been observed in a Gram-positive bacterial species since its initial report. This led to the identification of homologues of UDP-QuiNAc4NAc synthesis genes in S. suis serotype 18. Thus, the repeating unit sequence for serotype 18 is: [3)d-GalNAc(\u03b11-3)[d-Glc (\u03b21-2)]d-GalA4OAc(\u03b21-3)d-GalNAc(\u03b11-3)d-QuiNAc4NAc(\u03b11-]n. A correlation between S. suis serotypes 3 and 18 CPS sequences and genes of these serotypes' cps loci encoding putative glycosyltransferases and polymerase responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established. Knowledge of CPS structure and composition will contribute to better dissect the role of this bacterial component in the pathogenesis of S. suis serotypes 3 and 18.",

In current study, biopolymer of Bifidobacterium bifidum BIM \u0412-733D that interacts selectively with anti-gliadins (Bb-Ganti-gliadins) was isolated by affinity chromatography with anti-gliadins, purified by size exclusion chromatography on TSK 40 gel and identified by NMR as linear \u03b1-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6)-d-glucan with molecular mass about 5000\u202fDa.

Its unique immunochemical property is the ability to interact selectively with anti-TPO, anti-Tg, anti-TG2 and anti-gliadins in presence of no less than 10-fold excess of total immunoglobulins of class G (tIgG), as it was proven by ELISA.

     "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of bacterial meningitis worldwide especially in Africa. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is the main virulence factor and the target antigen for polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. The high burden of serogroup A disease in the Meningitis Belt of sub-Saharan Africa led to the introduction of MenAfriVac\u00ae, which has successfully reduced the number of cases of group A disease. However, several outbreaks caused by other serogroups have been reported, including those due to serogroup X. The capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A and X are both homopolymers of amino sugars (\u03b1-D-ManNAc and \u03b1-D-GlcNAc) containing phosphodiester linkages at C-6 and C-4, respectively. The similarity of the primary structures of the two polysaccharides suggests that serogroup A vaccination may provide cross-protection against serogroup X disease. Molecular dynamics simulations of a series of serogroup A and X oligosaccharides reveal that the MenA CPS behaves as a flexible random coil which becomes less conformationally defined as the length increases, whereas serogroup X forms a more stable regular helical structure. The presence of the MenX helix is supported by NMR analysis; it has four residues per turn and becomes more stable as the chain length increases. Licensed MenA vaccines are largely O-acetylated at C-3: simulations show that these O-acetyl groups are highly solvent exposed and their presence favors more extended conformations compared to the more compact conformations of MenA without O-acetylation. These findings may have implications for the design of optimal conjugate vaccines.",

     "abstract": "The structure of heparin and heparan sulfate (Hep/HS) oligosaccharides, as determined by the length and the pattern of sulfation, acetylation, and uronic acid epimerization, dictates their biological function through modulating interactions with protein targets. But fine structural determination is a very challenging task due to the lability of the sulfate modifications and difficulties in separating isomeric HS chains. Previously, we reported a strategy for chemical derivatization involving permethylation, desulfation, and trideuteroperacetylation, combined with standard reverse phase LC-MS/MS that enables the structural sequencing for heparin/HS oligosaccharides of sizes up to dodecasaccharide by positionally replacing all sulfates with more stable trideuteroacetyl groups, allowing for robust MS/MS sequencing. However, isomeric oligosaccharides that contain both N-sulfation and N-acetylation become isotopomers after labeling, differing only in the sites of deuteration. This prevents chromatographic separation of these different mixed domain sequences post-derivatization, and makes sequencing by MS/MS difficult due to co-fragmentation of the isotopomers leading to chimeric product ion spectra. In order to improve chromatographic separation of mixed domain oligosaccharides, we have introduced a propionylation step in place of trideuteroacetylation for labeling of sites of sulfation. HS standard disaccharides have been used to evaluate the efficiency of this improved chemical derivatization. The results show that we can quantitatively replace sulfation with propionyl groups with the same high efficiency as the previously reported trideuteroacetylation. After derivatization, we demonstrate the ability to chromatographically separate two mixed domain tetrasaccharide isomers differing solely by the order of N-sulfation and N-acetylation, allowing for full sequencing of each by MS/MS. These results represent a marked improvement in the ability of our previously reported derivatization strategy to analyze complex mixtures of Hep/HS oligosaccharides without a decrease in sensitivity.",

     "abstract": "Glycan-binding protein (GBP) interaction experiments, such as glycan microarrays, are often used to understand glycan recognition patterns. However, oftentimes the interpretation of glycan array experimental data makes it difficult to identify discrete GBP binding patterns due to their ambiguity. It is known that lectins, for example, are non-specific in their binding affinities; the same lectin can bind to different monosaccharides or even different glycan structures. In bioinformatics, several tools to mine the data generated from these sorts of experiments have been developed. These tools take a library of predefined motifs, which are commonly-found glycan patterns such as sialyl-Lewis X, and attempt to identify the motif(s) that are specific to the GBP being analyzed. In our previous work, as opposed to using predefined motifs, we developed the Multiple Carbohydrate Alignment with Weights (MCAW) tool to visualize the state of the glycans being recognized by the GBP under analysis. We previously reported on the effectiveness of our tool and algorithm by analyzing several glycan array datasets from the Consortium of Functional Glycomics (CFG). In this work, we report on our analysis of 1081 data sets which we collected from the CFG, the results of which we have made publicly and freely available as a database called MCAW-DB. We introduce this database, its usage and describe several analysis results. We show how MCAW-DB can be used to analyze glycan-binding patterns of GBPs amidst their ambiguity. For example, the visualization of glycan-binding patterns in MCAW-DB show how they correlate with the concentrations of the samples used in the array experiments. Using MCAW-DB, the patterns of glycans found to bind to various GBP-glycan binding proteins are visualized, indicating the binding \u201cenvironment\u201d of the glycans. Thus, the ambiguity of glycan recognition is numerically represented, along with the patterns of monosaccharides surrounding the binding region. The profiles in MCAW-DB could potentially be used as predictors of affinity of unknown or novel glycans to particular GBPs by comparing how well they match the existing profiles for those GBPs. Moreover, as the glycan profiles of diseased tissues become available, glycan alignments could also be used to identify glycan biomarkers unique to that tissue. Databases of these alignments may be of great use for drug discovery.",

In solutions, the ratio between \u03b1- and \u03b2-D-glucose is typically 4:6 but can vary depending on the surrounding ions or temperature. In this study, we obtained near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the glucose anomers based on concentration, and analyzed the spectral difference between each anomer by spectra subtraction and principal component analysis, respectively. Moreover, by simultaneously measuring the optical rotation and NIR spectra from dissolution to equilibration, we showed that NIR spectra quantitatively estimated the specific rotations of glucose solutions using partial least-squares regression in the 1100\u20131800\u202fnm wavelength range. All the analytical results indicated that the absorption at 1742\u202fnm possess the potential to distinguish each glucose anomer quantitatively. Therefore, we addressed the prediction of the specific rotation by the absorption at 1742\u202fnm, and demonstrated that the absorption normalized by line subtraction showed the high correlation with measured specific rotation. The absorption at 1742\u202fnm reflects structural changes of the glucose anomers in solution.

Selective functionalization of common monosaccharides has resulted in several classes of effective LMWGs. Recently we found that certain peracetylated sugars containing anomeric triazole functional groups were effective gelators. In this study we synthesized two series of 4,6-O-benzylidene acetal protected \u03b2-1,2,3-triazolyl glycoside of D-glucose and N-acetyl D-glucosamine derivatives and evaluated their self-assembling properties in a few solvents. Several gelators were obtained and the gelation properties of these compounds rely on the structures of the 4-triazolyl substituents. Typically, alkyl derivatives resulted in effective gelation in organic solvents and aqueous mixtures of ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide. But further acetylation of these compounds resulted in loss of gelation properties. The gels were characterized using optical microscopy, rheology, and FTIR spectroscopy. We also analyzed the molecular assemblies, using 1H NMR spectroscopy to probe the influences of the hydroxyl, amide, and triazole functional groups. Naproxen was used as a model drug and it formed co-gels with compound 25 in DMSO water mixtures. Using UV spectroscopy, we found that naproxen was slowly released from the gel to aqueous solution. The general structure and gelation trend obtained here can be useful in designing sugar based biomaterials. We expect that further structural optimization can lead to more effective gelators that are compatible with different drug molecules for encapsulation and sustained release.",

     "abstract": "Although chemical reactions driven by mechanical force is emerging as a promising tool in the field of physical sciences, its applications in the area of food sciences are not reported. In this paper, we propose ball milling as an efficient tool for the controlled generation of fructooligosaccharide (FOS) mixtures from inulin with a degree of polymerization (dp) ranging between 4 and 7. The addition of catalytic amounts of AlCl3 together with ball milling (30\u202fmin, at 30\u202fHz) generated mixtures rich in dehydrated disaccharides such as di-D-fructose dianhydrides. Based on anion exchange chromatography in conjunction with ESI/qTOF/MS/MS analysis, catalysis increased the overall content of mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides by around 30 fold compared to un-catalyzed milling. In addition, dialysis results of the untreated and treated samples have indicated that under catalysis the percent of depolymerization (dp\u202f<\u202f12) reached 73.4% from the starting value of 27.6% in the untreated sample. Both processes resulted in mixtures of prebiotic value. The use of mechanical energy may be suitable for a fast, cost-efficient and green conversion of inulin to value-added food ingredients.",

The substrate binding to an inactive mutant protein of full-length CJP-4, in which the catalytic acid Glu108 was mutated to glutamine, CJP-4(E108Q), was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Based on the chemical shift perturbations of 1H-15N HSQC signals of Gly26 (CBM18 domain) and Trp185 (GH19 domain), the association constants for individual domains of CJP-4(E108Q) toward soluble chitin hexamer (GlcNAc)6 were determined to be 2300 and 3500\u202fM\u22121, respectively.

The available approaches (including viscosity, settling volume, and P content) all have their limitations, i.e., not applicable in a large scope, pollution problem, and can not reflect the internal structure change. Here in this paper starch-iodine (St-I) method was proposed as a new approach to characterize the crosslinking degree. In this investigation, three starches of A, B, and C crystalline pattern with different amount (from very low to very high, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10%) of crosslinking reagent added were studied. This method is based on the mechanism that crosslinking reaction take place between amylose/amylopectin, amylopectin/amylopectin, whereas the amylose dose not crosslink one another. After crosslinked to amylopectin, the result amylose-amylopectin complex can be considered as a new amylopectin. Results showed that the St-I method can characterize all the crosslinked starches of the three starches, at low reagent level (0.01\u20130.1%), the amylose was found to decrease rapidly, this can also replace the viscosity method, whereas at high reagent level (1\u201310%), although the significant differences can still be observed, the effect was not so obvious as it for the lower crosslinked starches, here we firstly applied dose efficiency to characterize this phenomenon, which was informative and helpful in determining this modification process.",

The results were compared with those recently obtained for D-xylose in the same mass spectrometric experimental conditions. Dehydration of C1-OH protonated sugars was theoretically investigated at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//M11/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory. Protonated pentoses are not stable and promptly lose a water molecule giving rise to the dehydrated ions at m/z 133. D-xylose, D-ribose and D-arabinose dehydration follows a common reaction pathway with ionic intermediates and transition states characterized by similar structures. Slightly different dehydration energies were experimentally measured and the relative trend was theoretically confirmed. The overall dehydration activation energy follows the order arabinose\u202f<\u202fribose\u202f<\u202fxylose.

Based on a detailed analysis of the NMR chemical shifts of the sugar moieties of different ARPs, it could be derived that the formation of 3-DGal is sensitive to the stability of a co-operative hydrogen bond network which involves HO-C3, the deprotonated carboxyl functionality and the protonated amino nitrogen of the amino acid substituent. Participating in this bond network, HO-C3 is partially protonated which facilitates the elimination of water at C3. Based on that, a new mechanism of 3-deoxyglycosone formation is proposed.",

     "abstract": "The O-specific polysaccharide (O-antigen) was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide of Escherichia albertii O5 (strain T150248) and studied by sugar analysis, selective cleavages of glycosidic linkages, and 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Partial solvolysis with anh (anhydrous) CF3CO2H and hydrolysis with 0.05\u202fM CF3CO2H cleaved predominantly the glycosidic linkage of \u03b2-GalpNAc or \u03b2-Galf, respectively, whereas the linkages of \u03b1-GlcpNAc and \u03b2-Galp were stable. Mixtures of the corresponding tri- and tetra-saccharides thus obtained were studied by NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution ESI MS. The following new structure was established for the tetrasaccharide repeat (O-unit) of the O-polysaccharide: \u21924)-\u03b1-d-GlcpNAc-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-\u03b2-d-Galp6Ac-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f6)-\u03b2-d-Galf-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f3)-\u03b2-d-GalpNAc-(1\u2192where the degree of O-acetylation of d-Galp is \u223c70%.

The orf5-7 in the O-antigen gene cluster of E.\u00a0albertii O5 are 47%, 78%, and 75% identical on the amino acid level to genes for predicted enzymes of E.\u00a0albertii O7, including Galp-transferase wfeS, UDP-d-Galp mutase glf, and Galf-transferase wfeT, respectively, which are putatively involved with the synthesis of the shared trisaccharide fragment of the O-polysaccharides. The occurrence upstream of the O-antigen gene cluster of a 4-epimerase gene gnu for conversion of undecaprenyl diphosphate-linked d-GlcNAc (UndPP-d-GlcNAc) into UndPP-d-GalNAc indicates that d-GalNAc is the first monosaccharide of the O-unit, and hence the O-units are interlinked in the O-polysaccharide of E.\u00a0albertii O5 by the \u03b2-d-GalpNAc-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f4)-\u03b1-d-GlcpNAc linkage.",

     "abstract": "Motivated by underestimation of the diffusion constant of glucose in aqueous solution at high glucose concentrations we performed additional optimization of the Drude polarizable hexopyranose monosaccharide force field. This indicated aggregation of the glucose at higher concentrations, which is a concern for studies of complex glycan systems such as the HIV Envelope where high effective concentrations of sugars are present. High-level quantum mechanical calculations were undertaken on water monohydrate-glucose interactions, on water cluster-glucose interactions and on glucose-glucose dimers in stacked (parallel) and perpendicular orientations. Optimization of the nonbond and dihedral parameters targeting these data yielded a revised model that showed improved agreement with experimental aqueous diffusion data. However, limitations in the diffusion constants were still present. These were due to the SWM4-NDP inherently overestimating the diffusion constant of water, a problem that was validated by calculation of the aqueous diffusion constants using the SWM6-NDP water model. In addition, results show the water diffusion constant to be significantly overestimated at high glucose concentrations though the glucose diffusion is in satisfactory agreement with experiment. These results indicate the subtle balance of water-sugar, water-water and sugar-sugar interactions that needs to be properly modeled to account for the full range of aqueous behavior of sugars in aqueous solution.",

     "abstract": "Bisected N-glycans play significant roles in tumor migration and Alzheimer's disease through modulating the action and localization of their carrier proteins. Such biological functions are often discussed in terms of the conformation of the attached N-glycans with or without bisecting GlcNAc. To obtain insights into the effects of bisecting GlcNAc on glycan conformation, a systematic NMR structural analysis was performed on two pairs of synthetic N-glycans, with and without bisecting GlcNAc. The analysis reveals that terminal GlcNAcs and bisecting GlcNAc cooperate to restrict the conformations of both the \u03b11-3 and \u03b11-6 branches of N-glycans. 1H and 13C chemical shift comparisons suggest that bisecting GlcNAc directly modulates local conformation. Unique NOE correlations between core-mannose and the \u03b11-3 branch mannose as well as the 3JC-H constant of the glycoside linkage indicate that bisecting GlcNAc restricts the conformation of the 1\u20133 branch. The angles of the glycosidic bonds between core-mannose and \u03b11-6 branch mannose derived from 3JC-H and 3JH-H coupling constants show that terminal GlcNAcs restrict the distribution of the \u03c8 angle to 180\u00b0 and the bisecting GlcNAc increases the distribution of the \u03c9 angle\u00a0+60\u00b0 in the presence of terminal GlcNAcs. It is feasible that restriction of branch conformations by bisecting GlcNAc has important consequences for protein-glycan interplay and following biological events.",

     "abstract": "The reaction specificity of the transglycosylation catalyzed by keratanase II from Bacillus circulans KsT202 (KSase II) was studied by using the oxazoline derivatives having keratan sulfate repeating units. The addition of 10% organic cosolvent reduced the activity for the enzymatic transglycosylation. The oxazoline derivative of 6-O-sulfonato-N-acetyllactosamine (su-LacNAc) was processively oligomerized to the corresponding hexamer or longer by the enzyme. This result strongly implies that the enzyme has the large positively numbered subsites. In contrast, the transglycosylation of the su-LacNAc oxazoline donor with the 6-O-sulfonato-Lewis X (su-LeX) acceptor solely gave the su-LacNAc-su-LeX pentasaccharide. In addition, both the oxazoline derivatives of su-LeX and 6,6\u2032-di-O-sulfonato-LacNAc have been exclusively oligomerized to the corresponding dimers respectively. These results strongly suggest that the steric hindrance exists around the (+3)(+4) subsites in KSase II. Furthermore, KSase II-catalyzed reaction of the excess su-LeX oxazoline with the su-LacNAc gave the su-LeX-su-LacNAc pentasaccharide as the sole transglycosylation product, also implying the steric hindrance at the catalytic center hampering processive shift of this pentasaccharide. Thus, KSase II has the sterically crowded structures at the catalytic center and around the (+3)(+4) subsites, which are all expected to be tunnel-like.",

Overall architecture of PJ1 LPS was found to be consistent with a structural model described for several other H.\u00a0pylori strains. It contained a polymer of d-glycero-d-manno-heptose (dd-Hep) as the O-chain component, linked to \u03b1-1,6-glucan through a dd-Hep oligosaccharide. H.\u00a0pylori PJ1 HP1283:cam LPS was missing dd-heptan, terminating with an \u03b1-1,6-glucan chain containing 5\u201313 glucose residues. LPS of strain PJ1 HP1284:cam was missing dd-Hep from the core and had \u03b2-GlcNAc attached directly to O-3 of the inner-core ld-Hep residue. To investigate the role of dd-heptan in protective immunity, delipidated LPS (dLPS) from strain PJ1 was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) and immunological properties of the resultant glycoconjugate dLPS(PJ1)-TT determined.

Furthermore, in contrast to the usual galactose-1-phosphate product of the galactokinase-catalysed reaction, these enzymes produce glucose-6-phosphate.

     "abstract": "Sucralose, a derivative of sucrose, is widely used in noncaloric artificial sweeteners (NAS). Contrary to the belief that sucralose is physiologically inert and a healthy alternative sweetener to natural sugar, emerging studies indicate that sucralose alters the host metabolism as well as the composition of the microbiome. In this manuscript, we use real-time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that sucralose alters the enzymatic conversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose. The real-time NMR progress curve analysis suggests that sucralose has the characteristic of a competitive inhibitor on the kinetics of the enzymatic process. This affects the rate of glucose production, and thus indirectly affecting the mutarotation process of \u03b1-D-glucose to \u03b2-D-glucose conversion. At a 1:2\u00a0M ratio of sucrose to sucralose, the results show that the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme is reduced by more than 50% in comparison to the measurements without sucralose. Altogether, as sucralose alters the rate of glucose production, sucralose cannot be considered inert to the metabolism as several downstream events in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems strongly depend on the rate of glucose metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Conformation of monosaccharides, including the ring shape, has for years been the subject of intensive research. Although d-aldohexopyranoses are the most extensively studied pyranoses, there also exist other groups of saccharides that contain analogous chemical system of the six-membered ring. Here we describe in details the results of the molecular dynamics-based conformational analysis concerning a series of pyranoses, namely: d-aldopentoses, d-ketohexoses as well as deoxy- (d-quinovose, l-fucose, l-rhamnose) and dideoxy- (abequose, paratose, tyvelose, digitoxose) derivatives of aldohexoses. By using the carbohydrate-dedicated GROMOS 56a6CARBO force field, we determined the conformational properties of both the lactol and hydroxymethyl groups as well as the anomeric populations for all considered compounds. The orientation of the lactol group follows the trend expected on the basis of the exo-anomeric effect for all compounds whereas the conformation of the hydroxymethyl group in d-ketohexoses is represented by the two gauche (with respect to the ring oxygen atom) rotamers. The special emphasis is put on the ring-inversion properties studied in the context of both the full chair-chair inversion and the chair-boat/skew-boat rearrangement. The calculated ring-distortion energies, compared with those obtained for regular d-aldohexopyranoses allowed for estimating the influence of particular substituents on the ring flexibility. Overall, such influence is correlated with the dimension of the substituent and its orientation but is limited to the case of the chair-chair inversion whereas the chair-to-boat/skew-boat rearrangement exhibits roughly the same properties for all pyranoses. For all d-aldopyranoses the \u03b1 anomers exhibit lower ring-inversion free energies in comparison to the \u03b2 anomers whereas this trend is inverted in the case of d-ketohexopyranoses.",

Both furanose rings were biased towards a south conformation (64\u201374%) and both \u03b2\u2013bonds heavily favored trans conformations. The R-ring \u03b3\u2013bond was found to exist almost exclusively as the \u03b3+ conformer, whereas the A-ring \u03b3\u2013bond was a mixture of the \u03b3+ and \u03b3t conformers, with the trans conformer being slightly favored. Enthalpic factors accounted for most of the observed conformational preferences, although the R-ring furanose exists as its major conformation based solely on entropic factors. There was excellent agreement between the NMR and MD results, particularly with regard to the conformer identities, but the MD showed a bias towards \u03b3+ conformers. The MD results showed that both N-glycosidic \u03c7\u2013bonds are exclusively syn. Collectively the data allowed for the construction of a model for cADPR in which many of the conformationally flexible units in fact effectively adopt single orientations and where most of the conformational diversity resides in its A-ring furanose and \u03b3\u2013bond.",

Notably, with the two equivalents of reactive iodonium ions per molecule of DIDMH less mass needs to be added making this activator a more atom economically alternative to NIS.

On the other hand, HIV exploits the interaction between high-mannose structures of its envelope glycoprotein gp120 and DC-SIGN to be transported towards and infect T-cells. DC-SIGN is involved in the recognition process in the form of a tetramer and the multiple exposition of carbohydrate recognition sites (CRSs) is amplified by the formation on the DCs membrane of patches of tetramers. DC-SIGN is then considered an interesting target to fight the virus and multivalent systems exposing multiple copies of ligating units for its CRSs are becoming valuable tools to reach this goal. We herein prepared four mannosylated calix[n]arenes (1a-d) and tested them by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) competition assays as inhibitors of the binding between DC-SIGN and a mannosylated BSA used as model of HIV gp120. IC50s in the \u03bcM range were found evidencing in particular for compound 1a that, although rather moderate, a multivalent effect is taking place in the inhibition activity of this cluster.

To date, FvEn3GAL isolated from Flammulina velutipes is the sole \u03b2-1,3-galactanase acting on \u03b2-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner. Here we cloned two homologous genes, designated Af3G and NcEn3GAL, possibly encoding endo-\u03b2-1,3-galactanase from Aspergillus flavus and Neurospora crassa, respectively. The recombinant Af3G (rAf3G) and rNcEn3GAL expressed in Pichia pastoris specifically hydrolyzed \u03b2-1,3-galactan in an endo-manner, as did the rFvEn3GAL. Among galactooligosaccharides, \u03b2-1,3-galactotriose was identified as the smallest substrate for these enzymes. These results suggest that enzymatic characteristics are conserved in many endo-\u03b2-1,3-galactanases belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 16 family. On the other hand, rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL generated more \u03b2-1,3-galactobiose from \u03b2-1,3-galactotetraose than did rFvEn3GAL, suggesting that rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL prefer hydrolyzing the central \u03b2-1,3-glycosidic linkage of three in \u03b2-1,3-galactotetraose. Although rAf3G and rNcEn3GAL alone hardly hydrolyze native AGP, they acted synergistically with a fungal exo-\u03b2-1,3-galactanase on the AGP.

Every titration curve has been interpreted by formulating a suitable model for the reaction equilibrium, to elucidate intermolecular interactions. In DMSO, glucosamine cations associate with each other to yield linear aggregates, and undergo pseudo-1:1-complexation with capsaicin, the formation constant being ca. 30 M\u22121. N-Acetylglucosamine, without self-association, forms a 2:1-complex AGl2Cp with the stability of ca. 70 M\u22122. These complexations are achieved by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In D2O, glucosamine undergoes reversible protonation equilibrium between Gl0 and GlH+ with the logarithmic protonation constants log KD\u00a0=\u00a08.63 for \u03b1-glucosamine and 8.20 for \u03b2-isomer. Both anomeric isomers of deprotonated glucosamine form Gl0Cp-type complexes of capsaicin, in a competitive manner, with a formation constant of 1040\u00a0M\u22121 for the \u03b1-glucosamine complex and 830\u00a0M\u22121 for the \u03b2-complex; the anomeric carbons result in the difference in thermodynamic stability. The reactant molecules are closed up by the solvent-exclusion effect and/or the van der Waals interaction; the resulting pair is stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding within a local water-free space between the component molecules. By contrast, neither protonated glucosamine (GlH+) nor N-acetylglucosamine yields a capsaicin complex with the definite stoichiometry. The monosaccharides recognize capsaicin under only a controlled condition; the same phenomena are predicted for biological systems and nanocarriers based on polysaccharides such as chitosan.",

Extraction and purification of CPS for use as a potential vaccine candidate requires containment level 3 laboratories which is expensive and time-consuming.

This was further substantiated by anti-CPS monoclonal antibody binding. In connection with the production of CPS fragments for use in glycoconjugate vaccines, we set out to assess the importance or otherwise of the CPS 2-OAc groups in immune protection. To this end conjugates of the native and de-O-acetylated CPS with the Hc fragment of tetanus toxin (TetHc) were used as vaccines in a mouse model of melioidosis. The level of protection provided by deacetylated CPS was significantly lower than that from native, acetylated CPS. In addition, sera from mice vaccinated with the deacetylated CPS conjugate did not recognise native CPS. This suggests that CPS extracted from B.\u00a0thailandensis can be used as antigen and that the acetyl group is essential for protection.",

     "abstract": "The occurrence rates of non-communicable diseases like obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia have increased remarkably due to excessive consumption of a high-energy diet. Rare sugars therefore have become increasingly attractive owing to their unique nutritional properties. In the past two decades, various rare sugars have been successfully prepared guided by the \u201cIzumoring strategy\u201d. As a valuable complement to the Izumoring approach, the controllable dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)-dependent aldolases have generally predictable regio- and stereoselectivity, which makes them powerful tools in C-C bond construction and rare sugar production. However, the main disadvantage for this group of aldolases is their strict substrate specificity toward the donor molecule DHAP, a very expensive and relatively unstable compound. Among the current methods involving DHAP, the one that couples DHAP production from inexpensive starting materials (for instance, glycerol, DL-glycerol 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone, and glucose) with aldol condensation appears to be the most promising. This review thus focuses on recent advances in the application of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (RhaD), L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA), and D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FruA) for rare sugar synthesis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, while illustrating strategies for supplying DHAP in efficient and economical ways.",

Glycosylation of galactosaminyl acceptor 4 with galactosaminyl trichloroacetimidate donor 5 was followed by condensation of resulting disaccharide acceptor 12 with rhamnosyl imidate donor 6 to furnish stereoselectively trisaccharyl thioglycoside 3, which was used as a key and common glycosyl donor for the construction of both 1 and 2. Title molecule 1 was prepared by glycosylation of 3-azidopropanol with 3 and subsequently global deprotection, whereas coupling reaction of 3 with a trisaccharide acceptor 21 containing an 2,3-O-position acetonide-modified rhamnose residue, followed by global deprotection, generated the dimer 2 in a convergent [3\u00a0+\u00a03] manner.",

     "abstract": "O-Acetylation of sialic acid (Sia) modulates its recognition by sialic acid-binding proteins and plays an important role in biological and pathological processes. 9-O-Acetylation is the most common modification of sialic acid in human. However, study of O-acetylated sialoglycans is hampered due to the instability of O-acetyl group towards pH changes and sensitivity to esterases. Our previous studies demonstrated a chemical biology method to this problem by replacing the oxygen atom in the C9 ester group of sialic acid by a nitrogen to form an amide. Here, we synthesized a library of sixteen new 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc)-containing \u03b12\u20133- and \u03b12\u20136-linked sialosides with various underlying glycans using efficient one-pot three-enzyme (OP3E) sialylation systems. Neu5Ac9NAc-containing compounds with a para-nitrophenol aglycon have been used together with their 9-O-acetyl analogs in microtiter plate-based high-throughput substrate specificity studies of nine different sialidases including those from humans and bacteria. In general, similar to 9-O-acetylation, 9-N-acetyl modification of sialic acid in the substrates lowers sialic acid-cleavage activity of most sialidases. In most cases, Neu5Ac9NAc is a good analog of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid. However, exceptions do exist. For example, 9-N- and 9-O-acetyl modifications have different effects on the sialosides cleave efficiencies of a commercially available C.\u00a0perfringens sialidase as well as recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae sialidase SpNanC and Bifidobacterium infantis sialidase BiNanH2. The mechanism for the difference awaits further investigation.",

Glycomimetics that are easily accessible and have useful gelation properties are especially interesting molecules. In this research, nine per-O-acetyl lactosyl- and thirteen per-O-acetyl maltosyl triazole derivatives were synthesized and analyzed. Most of the maltosyl triazoles and one of the lactosyl derivatives were found to be effective molecular gelators. The supramolecular gels were characterized using rheology and optical microscopy and they exhibited morphologies ranging from fibers to planar sheets. The self-assembling properties of selected lactosyl and maltosyl triazole derivatives were studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy at different temperatures. The NMR studies revealed that the triazole moiety in these compounds played an important role in the formation of the supramolecular assembly, but the sugar moiety configurations are more influential towards gelation. Naproxen and chloramphenicol were used as the model drugs to assess the potential of these compounds in drug delivery applications. A pH responsive gelator showed faster delivery of chloramphenicol at mild basic conditions than neutral conditions. The effective disaccharide triazole-based molecular gelators are useful for the preparation of advanced soft materials that have potential applications as matrix for immobilization of drugs or biomolecules.",

Hyperconjugation plays a major role in most cases, either due to endo or exo-anomeric interactions, especially when nitrogen is the electron donor to an antiperiplanar \u03c3* orbital. This interaction also seems to contribute for the Perlin and reverse fluorine Perlin-like effects, which are related to the relative magnitude of 1JC,H and 1JC,F coupling constants, respectively, in axial and equatorial conformers. However, the preference for an equatorial conformation appears when a hydrogen or methyl group of the substituent faces the ring, increasing the steric repulsion, even if concomitant with a hyperconjugative interaction in the axial isomer, such as for the well-known 2-aminotetrahydropyran. Unlike some reports in the literature, the gas phase 2-hydroxypiperidine experiences the herein called reverse anomeric effect, although the highly stabilizing nN \u2192 \u03c3*C-O interaction in the axial isomer. Overall, steric effects should be taken into account when deciding for the normal or reverse anomeric effects as determinant factors of the stereochemical control of carbohydrate-like molecules.",

The OPLS2005 and Glycam06 force fields were used. Simulations were performed with explicit water (TIP3P) and methanol. Results were compared with a complete conformational scan at the MM4 level with the dielectric constant corresponding to methanol. In order to verify predicted conformational preferences, vicinal 3JHH NMR coupling constants were calculated by the Karplus equation on simulated potential energy surfaces (PES). A set of new parameters for the Karplus equation was also designed. Predicted 3JHH were compared with experimental data. We also used reverse methodology, in which the 3JHH coupling constants were calculated at the DFT level for each family of (\u03d5, \u03c8)-conformers separately and then experimental values were decomposed onto calculated 3JHH couplings in order to obtain experimentally derived populations of conformers. As an alternative method of evaluation of preferred conformers, analysis of sensitive 13C chemical shifts was introduced. We were able to thoroughly discuss several fundamental issues in predictions of preferred conformers of C-saccharides, such as the solvent effect, reliability of the force field, character of empirical Karplus equation or applicability of NMR parameters in predictions of conformational preferences in general.",

The choice of protecting groups in sialyl donors was based on hypothesis that variations in ability of different acyl groups to act as hydrogen bond acceptors would influence the supramolecular structure of reaction mixture (solution structure), hence the outcome of sialylation. These glycosyl donors were examined in the model glycosylation of the primary hydroxyl group of 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-\u03b1-D-galactopyranose in comparison with sialyl donors without O-TFA groups. The presence of O-TFA groups in a sialyl donor strongly affected the outcome of sialylation. Several sialyl donors studied showed promising results: yields of disaccharides can be as high as 86% as can be the stereoselectivities (\u03b1/\u03b2 up to 15:1). The results obtained suggest that varying acyl O-protecting groups in sialyl donor may result in dramatic changes in the outcome of sialylation although further studies are required to dissect the influence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and intramolecular substituent effects related to variations of electron-withdrawing properties of different acyl groups.",

     "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is covered by a dense glycocalix mainly composed by glycoproteins called mucins which are also the acceptors of sialic acid in a reaction catalyzed by a trans-sialidase (TcTS). Sialylation of trypomastigote mucins protects the parasite from lysis by the anti \u03b1-Galp antibodies from serum. The TcTS is essential for the infection process since T.\u00a0cruzi is unable to biosynthesize sialic acid. The enzyme specifically transfers it from a terminal \u03b2-d-Galp unit in the host glycoconjugate to terminal \u03b2-d-Galp units in the parasite mucins to construct the d-NeuNAc(\u03b12\u21923)\u03b2-d-Galp motif. On the other hand, although galactose is the most abundant sugar in mucins of both, the infective trypomastigotes and the insect stage epimastigotes, \u03b1-d-Galp is only present in the infective stage whereas \u03b2-d-Galf is characteristic of the epimastigote stage of the less virulent strains. Neither \u03b1-d-Galp nor d-Galf is acceptor of sialic acid. In the mucins, some of the oligosaccharides are branched with terminal \u03b2-d-Galp units to be able to accept sialic acid in the TcTS reaction.Based on previous reports showing that anti \u03b1-Galp antibodies only partially colocalize with sialic acid, we have undertaken the synthesis of the trisaccharide \u03b1-d-Galp(1\u21923)-[\u03b2-d-Galp(1\u21926)]-d-Galp, the smallest structure containing both, the antigenic d-Galp(\u03b11\u21923)-d-Galp unit and the sialic acid-acceptor \u03b2-d-Galp unit. The trisaccharide was obtained as the 6-aminohexyl glycoside to facilitate further conjugation for biochemical studies. The synthetic approach involved the \u03b1-galactosylation at O-4 of a suitable precursor of the reducing end, followed by \u03b2-galactosylation at O-6 of the same precursor and introduction of the 6-aminohexyl aglycone. The fully deprotected trisaccharide was successfully sialylated by TcTS using either 3\u2032-sialyllactose or fetuin as donors.

This GlcNAc derivative is attractive as a chemical tool compound for biological and biochemical studies because of its reported potency as an inhibitor, and its short and straightforward synthesis from readily available starting materials. We report that in our hands, 2-naphthyl \u03b2-d-GlcNAc behaved, unexpectedly, as an acceptor substrate of the inverting \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase (\u03b2-1,4-GalT) from bovine milk.

We found that 2-naphthyl \u03b2-d-GlcNAc can be an acceptor substrate both for recombinantly expressed \u03b2-1,4-GalT, and for a commercial batch of the same enzyme, and both in the presence and absence of bovine serum albumin (BSA). As expected for a full acceptor substrate, this substrate activity was time- and concentration-dependent. Additional experiments show that the observed inhibitor/substrate switch is facilitated by a phosphatase that is an essential component of our enzyme-coupled glycosyltransferase assay. These findings suggest that the behaviour of 2-naphthyl \u03b2-d-GlcNAc and related acceptor-based glycosyltransferase inhibitors is strongly dependent on the individual assay conditions. Our results therefore have important implications for the use of 2-naphthyl \u03b2-d-GlcNAc and related glycosides as tool compounds in glycobiology and glycobiochemistry.",

Trehalose metabolism is essential for mycobacterial viability and has been linked to in\u00a0vitro biofilm formation, which may bear relevance to in\u00a0vivo drug tolerance. Previous research has shown that some trehalose analogues bearing modifications at the 6-position inhibit growth of various mycobacterial species. In this work, 2-, 5-, and 6-position-modified trehalose analogues were synthesized using our previously reported one-step chemoenzymatic method and shown to inhibit growth and biofilm formation in the two-to three-digit micromolar range in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The trehalose-specific ABC transporter LpqY-SugABC was essential for antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity, suggesting that inhibition by monosubstituted trehalose analogues requires cellular uptake and does not proceed via direct action on extracellular targets such as antigen 85 acyltransferases or trehalose dimycolate hydrolase. Although the potency of the described compounds in in\u00a0vitro growth and biofilm assays is moderate, this study reports the first trehalose-based mycobacterial biofilm inhibitors and reinforces the concept of exploiting unique sugar uptake pathways to deliver inhibitors and other chemical cargo to mycobacteria.",

     "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a globally important encapsulated human pathogen with approximately 100 different serotypes recognized. Serogroup 23 consists of serotype 23F, present in licensed vaccines, and emerging serotypes 23A and 23B. Here, we report the previously unknown structures of the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides serotype 23A and 23B determined using genetic analysis, NMR spectroscopy, composition and linkage analysis and Smith degradation (of polysaccharide 23A). The structure of the serotype 23A capsular polysaccharide is: \u21924)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u21923)-[[\u03b1-L-Rhap-(1\u21922)]-[Gro-(2\u2192P\u21923)]-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u21924)]-\u03b2-L-Rhap-(1\u2192. This structure differs from polysaccharide 23F as it features a disaccharide backbone and the di-substituted \u03b2-Gal is linked to \u03b2-Rha as a side chain. This is due to the different polymerization position catalysed by the unusually divergent repeat unit polymerase Wzy in the 23A cps biosynthesis locus. Steric crowding in 23A, confirmed by molecular models, causes the NMR signal for H-1 of the di-substituted 2,3-\u03b2-Gal to resonate in the \u03b1-anomeric region. The structure of the serotype 23B capsular polysaccharide is the same as 23F, but without the terminal \u03b1-Rha: \u21924)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1\u21924)-[Gro-(2\u2192P\u21923)]-\u03b2-D-Galp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-L-Rhap-(1\u2192. The immunodominant terminal \u03b1-Rha of 23F is more sterically crowded in 23A and absent in 23B. This may explain the reported typing cross reactions for serotype 23F: slight with 23A and none with 23B.",

The preparation was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel eluted stepwise with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0\u00a0M NaCl to give four fractions differing in monosaccharide composition and degree of sulfation. Their NMR spectra were too complex to be completely interpreted. Fractions 1.0\u00a0M and 1.5\u00a0M were analyzed by methylation before and after desulfation. In addition, desulfated 1.0\u00a0M was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography into six fractions according to the uronic acid content. They were characterized by methylation and NMR spectral data, and three structurally different polysaccharides were identified. One of them has a core of alternating 2-linked \u03b1-d-Manp and 4-linked \u03b2-d-GlcpA residues, about a half of the former bearing single \u03b1-l-Fucp or \u03b2-d-Xylp at position 3. The second polymer is a (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranuronan partially substituted with single \u03b2-d-Xylp or single \u03b1-l-Fucp at position 4. The third polysaccharide is a xylo(fuco)galactan having a linear core of alternating 4-linked \u03b1-d-Gal and 3-linked \u03b2-d-Gal residues. The latter bear single \u03b2-d-Xylp or a short chain of 4-linked \u03b2-d-Xyl, 6-linked \u03b2-d-Gal, and variously linked \u03b1-l-Fuc. In FSA, these polysaccharides are sulfated at different positions and devoid of regularity. Fractions of FSA possess anticoagulant, cytotoxic, and antitumor activities, which increase with the degree of sulfation. The most sulfated fraction 2.0\u00a0M that contains mainly a sulfated fucogalactan, is about half as active as anticoagulant as the standard low-molecular mass heparin (enoxaparin).",

The \u03b1-D-galactosidase is one of the enzymes which may act on pectin degradation. This enzyme has several biotechnological and medical applications. The aim of this work was to better understand the molecular mechanism of \u03b1-D-galactosidase from P.\u00a0purpurogenum (GALP1). For this purpose, a gene coding for the enzyme was identified from the fungal genome and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 27. The protein of 435 amino acids has an optimum pH and temperature for activity of 5.0 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The KM for p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-galactopyranoside (Gal\u03b1pNP) is 0.138\u00a0mM. The enzyme is inhibited by Gal\u03b1pNP at concentrations higher than 1\u00a0mM, and by the product galactose. A kinetic analysis of product inhibition shows that it is of mixed type, suggesting the presence of an additional binding site in the enzyme. To confirm this hypothesis, a structural model for GALP1 was built by comparative modelling methodology, which was validated and refined by molecular dynamics simulation. The data suggest that galactose may bind to an enzyme alternative pocket promoting structural changes of the active site, thus explaining its inhibitory effect. In silico site-directed mutagenesis experiments highlighted key residues involved in the maintenance of the alternative binding site, and their mutations for Ala predict the formation of proteins which should not be inhibited by galactose. The availability of an \u03b1-galactosidase with different kinetic properties to the existent proteins may be of interest for biotechnological applications.",

     "publication date": "08-2017",
     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to further the understanding of the mechanisms that govern the hydration behavior of neutral solutes, with respect to the ions' properties that are present in a solution. For that, a systematic volumetric study of saccharides (xylose, glucose and sucrose), in the presence of various electrolytes (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, Na2SO4, K2SO4, CaCl2, MgCl2, MgSO4) has been carried out with density measurements at 298.15\u00a0K. From this data, the standard transfer molar volume of the saccharide \u0394 V \u03d5 , S 0 , which characterizes the hydration state of the solute, has been determined.Positive and increasing values of \u0394 V \u03d5 , S 0 with increasing electrolyte concentrations were obtained. This indicated the dehydration of the saccharide in the presence of the electrolyte, due to the predominance of saccharide/cation interactions.Concerning the influence of the cation, it was shown that saccharides are more dehydrated in the presence of divalent cations than in the presence of monovalent ones. This is because the interactions are stronger between saccharides and divalent cations, in comparison to those with monovalent cations. For a specific cation valence and molality, regardless of the anion, saccharide dehydration increases according to the following sequences: Li+< Na+< K+ and Mg2+< Ca2+. These saccharide dehydration sequences have been explained by the Gibbs free energy of hydration of the cations, reflecting the cation/water interactions. For a specific cation valence, it was concluded that decreasing cation/water interactions induce the increase of saccharide dehydration.Concerning the influence of the anion, it was also observed that saccharides are more dehydrated in the presence of divalent anions than in the presence of monovalent ones. It was stated that saccharide/cation interactions are modulated by the nature of the anion. The anion impact was again attributed to its capacity to interact with water molecules. It was pointed out that anions with increasing values of Gibbs free energy of hydration cause an increase in saccharide/cation interactions or a decrease in saccharide/anion interactions. Therefore, saccharide dehydration increases.",

The data are often viewed as the amount of materials recovered and coinciding colored heatmaps of mAb binding are generated. Interpretation of these data can be considered qualitative in nature as it depends on detecting subtle visual differences in antibody binding strength. Here, we report a mixed model-based quantitative approach for glycome profile analyses, which accounts for the amount of materials recovered and displays the normalized values in revised heatmaps and statistical heatmaps depicting significant differences. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated on a previously published dataset investigating the effects of moisture stress on the roots and needles of Pinus taeda. An annotated R script for the quantitative methodology is included to allow future studies to utilize the same approach.",

     "abstract": "An exhaustive search approach was used to establish all possible rotamers of \u03b1- and \u03b2-d-galactopyranose using DFT at the B3LYP/6-311+G** and M06-2X/6-311+G** levels, both in vacuum calculations, and including two variants of continuum solvent models as PCM and SMD to simulate water solutions. Free energies were also calculated. MM3 was used as the starting point for calculations, using a dielectric constant of 1.5 for vacuum modeling, and 80 for water solution modeling. For the vacuum calculations, out of the theoretically possible 729 rotamers, only about a hundred rendered stable minima, highly stabilized by hydrogen bonding and scattered in a ca. 14\u00a0kcal/mol span. The rotamer with a clockwise arrangement of hydrogen bonds was the most stable for the \u03b1-anomer, whereas that with a counterclockwise arrangement was the most stable for the \u03b2-anomer. Free energy calculations, and especially solvent modeling, tend to flatten the potential energy surface. With PCM, the total range of energies was reduced to 9\u201310\u00a0kcal/mol (\u03b1-anomer) or 7\u20138\u00a0kcal/mol (\u03b2-anomer). These figures fall to 4.5\u20136\u00a0kcal/mol using SMD. At the same time, the total number of possible rotamers increases dramatically to about 300 with PCM, and to 400 with SMD. Both models show a divergent behavior: PCM tends to underestimate the effect of solvent, thus rendering as the most stable many common rotamers with vacuum calculations, and giving underestimations of populations of \u03b2-anomers and gt rotamers in the equilibrium. On the other hand, SMD gives a better estimation of the solvent effect, yielding correct populations of gt rotamers, but more \u03b2-anomers than expected by the experimental values. The best agreement is observed when the functional M06-2X is combined with SMD. Both DFT models show minimal geometrical differences between the optimized conformers.",

     "abstract": "Diatoms secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), or mucilage, around the cell wall that may serve to aid in motility and form a discrete layer that may help maintain thicker layers of EPS that have a greater role in adhesion. Mucilage molecules adhere to the diatom frustules, which are biosilica skeletons that develop from the diatom cell walls. Here, molecular dynamics methods were used to determine the characteristics of mucilage molecules as a function of pore size; notably 1,4-\u03b1-D-galacturonic acid, 1,4-\u03b2-glucuronic acid and 1,4-\u03b2-D-mannuronic acid. These uronic acids differ from each other in structure and extensibility as a function of their folding characteristics. Here, we find that when overlain upon a pore, mucilage molecules try to return to their native folded states but are restrained by their interactions with the silica surfaces. Furthermore, the extensibility of mucilage molecules over pore spaces affects the extent of mechanical energy required to straighten them. As such, different EPS molecules will affect sliding, friction and adhesion to subsequent layers of EPS in different ways. We conclude that higher EPS extensibility is homonymous with higher adhesive or frictive resistance since the molecules will be able to strain more before they reach the most extended (and thus rigid) conformation. The research herein is applicable to modern engineering as it yields insight into the biomimetic design of molecules and surfaces for improved adhesion or motility.",

The N-terminal half of AA9 LPMOs displays a huge sequence variability that is in contradiction with the substrate simplicity so far observed for these enzymes. To understand the cause of the high multigenicity that prevails in the family, we have performed a clustering analysis of the N-terminal region of 3400 sequences of family AA9 LPMOs, and have evaluated the coincidence of the clusters with distal visible features that may accompany functional differences. A method based on local pairwise alignments was devised to avoid the pitfalls of a global multiple alignment. Our analysis allowed the definition of 64 clusters, which successfully segregated several visible features associated to LPMO family AA9, such as the presence of carbohydrate-binding modules, of modules of unknown function and of the conspicuous H \u2192\u00a0R substitution at the first residue of the histidine brace that holds the catalytic copper. Our analysis shows that the hypervariability of the N-terminal half of the AA9 sequences is not driven by random evolution as sequence similarity does not follow solely taxonomy. The results suggest that some clusters are perhaps able to target chitin instead of cellulose, and that preference for C1 or C4 oxidation (or lack thereof), does not appear to constitute a strong evolutionary constraint. On an evolutionary standpoint, there seems to be little constraints that apply to the N-terminal half of the sequences other than the conservation of the histidine brace. The weak evolutionary constraints that apply to the N-terminal half of AA9 LPMOs explain both their hypervariability and multigenicity.",

These enzymes carry out oxidative cleavage of cellulose (and other polysaccharides), acting synergistically with cellulases and other hydrolases. In fact, LPMOs have the potential for increasing the efficiency of the lignocellulosic biomass conversion in biofuels and high value chemicals. Among a small number of microbial LPMOs that have been characterized, some LPMOs were expressed and characterized biochemically from the bacteria Thermobifida fusca, using the host Escherichia coli.

     "abstract": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are able to cleave recalcitrant polysaccharides, such as cellulose, by oxidizing the C1 and/or C4 atoms. The analysis of the resulting products requires a variety of analytical techniques. Up to now, these techniques mainly focused on the identification of non-oxidized and C1-oxidized oligosaccharides. The analysis of C4-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides is mostly performed by using high pressure anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC). However, the alkaline conditions used during HPAEC analysis lead to tautomerization of C4-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides, which limits the use of this technique. Here, we describe the use of reverse phase-ultra high performance liquid chromatography (RP-UHPLC) in combination with non-reductive 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling. Non-reductive 2-AB labeling enabled separation of C4-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides from their non-oxidized counterparts. Moreover, RP-UHPLC does not require buffered mobile phases, which reduce mass spectrometry (MS) sensitivity. The latter is seen as an advantage over other techniques such as hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and porous graphitized carbon coupled to MS. RP-UHPLC coupled to UV detection and mass spectrometry allowed the identification of both labeled non-oxidized and C4-oxidized oligosaccharides. Non-reductive labeling kept the ketone at the C4-position of LPMO oxidized oligosaccharides intact, while selective reducing agents such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride (STAB) reduced this ketone group. Our results show that RP-UHPLC-UV-ESI-MS in combination with non-reductively 2-AB labeling is a suitable technique for the separation and identification of LPMO-generated C4-oxidized gluco-oligosaccharides.",

The second LPMO, SamLPMO10C (34.7\u00a0kDa), is a bimodular enzyme comprised of an AA10 catalytic module and a carbohydrate binding module of family CBM2. SamLPMO10C shows activity on cellulosic substrates, including agricultural fiber paper pulps. The methodology developed simplifies the purification process to a binding-elution protocol with low-grade polysaccharides including Avicel. The strategy can be a cheap, simple and fast solution for the purification of LPMOs for industrial applications, leaving out periplasmic fractionation from recombinant strains therefore, with reduction of time and costs compared to conventional processes. The activity of SamLPMO10C expands the potential of the high valued LPMOs in lignocellulosic biomass valorization, reaffirming their promising role in cellulose deconstruction.",

     "abstract": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymatic players of lignocellulosic biomass degradation processes. As such, they have been introduced in cellulolytic cocktails for more efficient and less expensive lignocellulose saccharification. The recombinant production of LPMOs in bacteria for scientific investigations using vectors typically based on the T7 and lacUV5 promoters has been hampered by low yields. Reasons for this have been catabolite repression when producing the proteins in defined media with glucose as the sole carbon source, as well as the lack of an inducible expression system that allows controlled production of LPMOs that are correctly processed during translocation to the periplasmic space. A cassette vector design containing the XylS/Pm system was constructed and evaluated, showing that the expression cassette could easily be used for exchanging LPMO coding genes with or without signal sequences. The cassette was shown to reliably produce mature (translocated) LPMOs under controlled conditions that were achieved by using a low dosage (0.1\u00a0mM) of the Pm inducer m-toluic acid and a low (16\u00a0\u00b0C) cultivation temperature after induction. Furthermore, the signal sequences of five bacterial LPMOs were tested, and the signal sequence of LPMO10A from Serratia marcescens was found to give highest levels of recombinant protein production and translocation. The LPMO expression cassette was also evaluated in cultivations using defined media with glucose as the sole carbon source with a product yield of 7\u201322\u00a0mg per L of culture in shaking flasks. The integrity of the recombinant proteins were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy, showing that the system produced correctly processed and folded LPMOs. Finally, high cell-density cultivations of the recombinant strains were carried out, demonstrating stable protein production levels at similar relative yields (42\u20131298\u00a0mg per L of culture; 3.8\u201311.6\u00a0mg per OD600nm unit) as in shaking flasks, and showing the scale-up potential of the system.",

However, methods for monitoring protein-specific glycosylation are largely lacking. Here we describe a highly sensitive fluorescence imaging strategy to visualize the protein-specific glycosylation by combining glycan metabolic tagging and in situ proximity ligation (termed GPLA). We demonstrate the visualization of sialylation, fucosylation and GalNAcylation on several important membrane proteins. Notably, the high spatial resolution of this method allows subcellular localization of the glycosylated fraction of the proteins. We further show that our strategy can be applied to image the dimerization of endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor.

Significant differences in reactivity were observed and tagatose (48% conversion after 75\u00a0min) and psicose (35% conversion after 75\u00a0min) were clearly more reactive than fructose and sorbose (around 20% conversion after 75\u00a0min). The selectivity to HMF was found to be higher for fructose and psicose than for tagatose and sorbose. 2-Hydroxyacetylfuran (HAF) was shown to be a by-product for mainly sorbose and tagatose (as high as 2% yield). The results indicate that the relative orientation of the hydroxyl groups on C3 and C4 has a major effect on the reactivity and selectivity. This suggests that the dehydration towards HMF takes place via a mechanism with cyclic intermediates in which the C3C4 bond is fixed in a ring structure. A reaction mechanism involving a bicyclic structure is proposed to explain the formation of HAF. The reactivity of the sugars was significantly lower in water than previously observed in methanol.",

These analyses showed that the isoamylase could specifically and efficiently attack \u03b1-1,6-glucosidic linkages at branch points, leaving the amylose favored by other amylolytic enzymes. Its ability to attack side chains composed of 1\u20133 glucose residues differentiates it from other isoamylases, a property which is also ideal for the RS preparation process.

This result is supported by our NMR NOESY analysis, which indicates key close contacts for W that are not present in Y.

Methods that permit regioselective removal of O-isopropylidene groups are extremely valuable, as the number of steps in the total synthesis of complex oligosaccharides could be significantly decreased. Here we report that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/acetic anhydride (Ac2O) can be used to regioselectively convert one of the two O-isopropylidene groups to vicinal di-O-acetates in the di-O-isopropylidene-protected galacto- and fructo-pyranosyl systems, and the reagent is compatible with some common functionalities such as sulfonate esters, bromide, azide etc.",

     "abstract": "GlyTouCan version 1.0 was released in 2015 as the international glycan structure repository, and a new sequence format called WURCS (Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures) was proposed during the early stages of the GlyTouCan project. GlyTouCan uses WURCS as its base representation for glycans because existing formats were insufficient in their flexibility to represent any and all glycans universally. Therefore, in order to obtain WURCS strings for existing or new glycan structures, conversion tools or glycan structure editors that can export WURCS became necessary. GlycanBuilder was an obvious choice to extend due to its wide usage by the community. However, GlycanBuilder was limited because it was originally developed to support mammalian glycans. It also did not support the newly proposed monosaccharide symbol standard called Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG). Therefore in this work, we implemented a new version of GlycanBuilder to greatly increase its usability. The glycan rendering system was refactored so that cyclic glycans, nested repeating units, monosaccharide compositions and cross-linked glycan structures can be represented. Both import and export utilities for WURCS were also implemented and SNFG symbols were incorporated to allow glycans to be exported as graphics using the latest glycan symbol nomenclature.This new version of GlycanBuilder called \u201cGlycanBuilder2\u201d, is able to support a wide variety of ambiguous glycans, including structures containing monosaccharides from bacteria and plants. These glycans can also be displayed using the new SNFG symbols. This tool can aid researchers in communicating about the complex, diverse, and ambiguous structures of glycans more rapidly. Moreover, the new GlycanBuilder can now easily output WURCS sequences from glycans drawn on the canvas. Most importantly, because GlyTouCan employs WURCS as the basic format for registration and searching of glycan information, a wider variety of glycans can now be readily registered and queried in GlyTouCan.",

Here, we report the efficient synthesis of a mixed O- and S-linked tetraxylan. This thio-oligosaccharide has been developed as a putative inhibitor of arabinoxylan degrading enzymes used for the saccharification of biomass. Two common approaches for the synthesis of thio-oligosaccharides, either involving 1-thioglycoside donors or thioacceptors, are presented and compared regarding byproduct formation and yields. Both methods have shown to be useful for the synthesis of thiolinkages in oligoxylans assembly. However, the success of the reaction is highly dependent on the \u201cmatch\u201d between donors and acceptors.",

Reference compounds devoid of hydroxyl groups in the linker were also prepared from \u03b2-galactosylamine and succinic anhydride. After functionalization with an alkynyl residue, the resulting building blocks were grafted onto different azide-equipped scaffolds through the copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Thus, a family of structurally related mono and divalent \u03b2-N-galactopyranosylamides was obtained and fully characterized. The binding affinities of the ligands towards the model lectin PNA were measured by the enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). The IC50 values were significantly higher than that of galactose but the presence of hydroxyl groups in the aglycone chain improved lectin recognition. Docking and molecular dynamics experiments were in accordance with the hypothesis that a hydroxyl group properly disposed in the linker could mimic the Glc O3 in the recognition process. On the other hand, divalent presentation of the ligands led to lectin affinity enhancements.",

Herein, we report on the synthesis and activity for four new C-glycosides of KRN 7000, 11-phenylundecanoyl and 11-p-fluorophenylundecanoyl derivatives of C-KRN 7000, 2,3-bis-epi-C-KRN 7000 and the reverse amide of C-KRN 7000. In mice, compared to C-KRN 7000, 2,3-bis-epi-C-KRN 7000 stimulated higher release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and lower release of the inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12. The phenyl terminated alkanoyl and reverse amide analogues were inactive. These data suggest that structure activity effects for KRN 7000 are not necessarily additive and their use in the design of new analogues will require an improved understanding of how subtle structural changes impact on cytokine activity.",

In this study, we examined the influence of aglycone structures on N-glycan processing using synthetic substrates.

With these compounds, glucose transfer, glucose trimming and mannose trimming reactions of an endoplasmic reticulum fraction were examined. The results showed that substrates with shorter linkers between the N-glycan and hydrophobic patch had higher activities for both the glucose transfer and the mannose trimming reactions. In contrast, the glucose trimming reaction showed lower activity when substrates had shorter linkers. Thus, the reactivity for N-linked oligosaccharide processing of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum might be tunable by the aglycone structure, e.g., protein portion of glycoproteins.",

The goal of this focused review is to discuss the structure, synthesis, and function of carbohydrate additives that play a role in governing the composition of the infant microbiome and have other health benefits.",

Synthesis of model compounds like methyl-4-keto-xylose (Me-Xyl-4O) is reported to investigate the binding pattern thereof to hUXS1. Hence, selective oxidation of the desired hydroxyl function required employment of protecting group chemistry. Solution behavior of synthesized keto-saccharides was studied without enzyme via 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy with respect to existent forms in deuterated potassium phosphate buffer. Keto-enol tautomerism was observed for all investigated keto-saccharides, while gem-diol hydrate forms were only observed for 4-keto-xylose derivatives. Saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR was used to study binding of synthesized keto-gylcosides to wild type hUXS1. Resulting epitope maps were correlated to earlier published molecular modeling studies of UDP-Xyl-4O. STD NMR results of Me-Xyl-4O are in good agreement with simulations of the intermediate UDP-Xyl-4O indicating a strong interaction of proton H3 with the enzyme, potentially caused by active site residue Ala79. In contrast, pyranoside binding pattern studies of methyl uronic acids showed some differences compared to previously published STD NMR results of UDP-glycosides. In general, obtained results can contribute to a better understanding in binding of UDP-glycosides to other UXS enzyme family members, which have high structural similarities in the active site.",

The newly-developed protocol eliminates the need for the synthesis of Ni(4-F-PhCN)4(OTf)2 and is scalable and reproducible. Furthermore, computational simulations in combination with 1H NMR studies analyzed the effects of various solvents on the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network of tumor-associated mucin Fmoc-protected GalNAc-threonine amino acid antigen derivative, verifying discrepancies found that were previously unreported.",

The biological significance of Lewis a type plant N-glycans and their effects on the human immune system remain to be elucidated. Since a substantial amount of such plant specific N-glycans are required to evaluate immunological activity, we have searched for good plant-glycan sources to characterize Lewis a epitope-containing plant N-glycans. In this study, we have found that three water plants, Elodea nuttallii, Egeria densa, and Ceratophyllum demersum, produce glycoproteins bearing Lewis a units. Structural analysis of the N-glycans revealed that almost all glycoproteins expressed in these three water plants predominantly carry plant complex type N-glycans including the Lewis a type, suggesting that these water plants are good sources for preparation of Lewis a type plant N-glycans in substantial amounts.",

The valency of glycoconjugates was controlled by the reaction ratio of the S-sialoside monomer and protein. Hemagglutination inhibition assay showed that these synthetic glycoproteins have higher affinity to HA than the small clusters of sialosides with lower valency, due to multivalent effect and optimized three dimensional presentation of sialosides on the protein platform. The results of fluorescent NA inhibition assay showed that some of the conjugates have moderate NA inhibitory activity, in comparison to the monomer and low valent conjugates with weak or none inhibitory activity. These synthetic sialylated proteins were not cytotoxic with concentrations up to 100\u00a0\u03bcM, since the sialylation did not change the secondary structure of protein.

The presence of phosphate failed to significantly modify the kinetic parameters of the reaction. The enzyme showed a broad aglycone site specificity, being able to hydrolyze sugar phosphates beta-D-GlcNAc 1P and beta-D-Glc 1P, albeit at a fraction of the rate of hydrolysis of aryl glycosides. GH3 beta-glucosidase EryBI, that does not have a histidine as the general acid/base residue, also hydrolyzed beta-D-Glc 1P, at comparable rates to Hsero1941. These data indicate that Hsero1941 functions primarily as a hydrolase and that phosphorolytic activity is likely adventitious. The prevalence of histidine as a general acid/base residue is not predictive, nor correlative, with GH3 beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases having phosphorolytic activity.",

We have analyzed seminal plasma N-glycome in pooled samples derived from fertile and infertile men by means of MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Among infertile subjects, normozoospermic, oligozoospermic, asthenozoospermic and oligoasthenozoospermic samples were obtained. Eighty-six oligosaccharides were identified in all the analyzed samples. Differences in the content of unique glycans: high mannose and hybrid type, lacking terminal sialic acid and highly fucosylated were found when samples derived from infertile subjects with different semen patterns were compared to the fertile control. The content of highly branched glycans was 3-fold elevated in normozoospermic infertile men, while the expression of highly fucosylated oligosaccharides was increased in asthenozoospermic, oligozoospermic and oligoasthenozoospermic samples. Sialylation of oligosaccharides was decreased in oligozoospermic, oligoasthenozoospermic and especially asthenozoospermic samples, but increased in infertile normozoospermic subjects. Altered glycosylation observed in seminal plasma may reflect similar changes in sperm surface glycoproteins, and may disturb sperm interaction with female immune system. We suggest that at least some cases of unexplained male infertility may be associated with impaired glycosylation.",

It has long been assumed, but never empirically shown, that the LCO backbone is synthesized first by NodC, NodB, and NodA, followed by addition of one or more substituents by other Nod proteins. By analyzing a collection of in-frame deletion mutants of key nod genes in the bacterium Rhizobium sp. IRBG74 by mass spectrometry, we were able to shed light on the possible substitution order of LCO decorations, and we discovered that the prevailing view is probably erroneous. We found that most substituents could be transferred to a short chitin backbone prior to acylation by NodA, which is probably one of the last steps in LCO biosynthesis. The existence of substituted, short chitin oligomers offers new insights into symbiotic plant\u2013microbe signaling.",

Although many cellulose synthase genes have been identified over the past 25 years, functional studies of cellulose synthase using recombinant proteins have rarely been conducted. In this study, we conducted a functional analysis of cellulose synthase with site-directed mutagenesis, by using recombinant cellulose synthase reconstituted in living Escherichia coli cells that we recently constructed (cellulose-synthesizing E.\u00a0coli, CESEC). We demonstrated that inactivating mutations at an important amino acid residue reduced cellulose production. In this study, an interesting loss-of-function mutation occurred on Cys308, whose main chain carbonyl plays an important role for locating the cellulose terminus. Mutating this cysteine to serine, thus changing sulfur to oxygen in the side chain, abolished cellulose production in addition to other apparent detrimental mutations. This unexpected result highlights that the thiol side-chain of this cysteine plays an active role in catalysis, and additional mutation experiments indicated that the sulfur\u2013arene interaction around Cys308 is a key in cellulose-synthesizing activity. Data obtained by CESEC shed light on the function of cellulose synthase in living cells, and will deepen our understanding of the mechanism of cellulose synthase.",

Several studies have linked viral infection to the modulation of ganglioside expression such as human T-lymphotropic virus to GD2 and simian virus 40 to GM3.

The objective of this study was to unveil the relationship between HSV-1 infection and the alteration of cellular ganglioside expression in neuronal and glial cell lines. In addition to these cell lines, several human tumor cell lines including astrocytoma cells, neuroblastoma cells, T-cell leukemia cells and kidney cells derived from normal human and monkey were infected with HSV-1 as well as HSV-2. To measure changes in ganglioside-related gene expressions and gangliosides levels in cells, quantitative PCR and glycosphingolipid-glycomic analysis were performed. Changes in gene expression of glycosyltransferases and sialyltransferases were observed in HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected cells, although with different trends. 39 glycosphingolipid-glycans were quantitatively analyzed.

This finding is additionally verified and explained by MD simulations which demonstrate that the 1HO(2) and 1HO(6) hydroxyl groups of the constituting glucose units act as hydrogen-bond donors to water, while the 1HO(3) groups behave exclusively as hydrogen-bond acceptors from water and donate hydrogen to their intra-chain neighbors O(5).

Therefore, construction of structurally defined part structures of the C. neoformans GXM capsule is in great demand.

Complete conversion of chitosan to mono-sugars requires the synergistic action of endo- and exo- chitosanases. In the present study we have developed an efficient and cost-effective chitosan-degrading enzyme cocktail containing only two enzymes, an endo-attacking bacterial chitosanase, ScCsn46A, from Streptomyces coelicolor, and an exo-attacking glucosamine specific \u03b2-glucosaminidase, Tk-Glm, from the archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1. Moreover, we developed a fast, reliable quantitative method for analysis of GlcN using high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). The sensitivity of this method is high and less than 50\u00a0pmol was easily detected, which is about 1000-fold better than the sensitivity of more commonly used detection methods based on refractive index.

     "abstract": "Aminopyrene trisulfonate (APTS)-labelled disaccharides are demonstrated to serve as readily accessible acceptor substrates for galactosyltransferase activities present in Arabidopsis microsome preparations. The reductive amination procedure used to install the fluorophore results in loss of the ring structure of the reducing terminal sugar unit, such that a single intact sugar ring is present, attached via an alditol tether to the aminopyrene fluorophore. The configuration of the alditol portion of the labelled acceptor, as well as the position of alditol galactosylation, substantially influence the ability of compounds to serve as Arabidopsis galactosyltransferase acceptor substrates. The APTS label exhibits an unexpected reaction-promoting effect that is not evident for structurally similar sulfonated aromatic fluorophores ANDS and ANTS. When APTS-labelled \u03b2-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-Gal3 was employed as an acceptor substrate with Arabidopsis microsomes, glycan extension generated \u03b2-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-galactan chains running to beyond 60 galactose residues. These studies demonstrate the potential of even very short glycan-APTS probes for assessing plant galactosyltransferase activities and the suitability CE-LIF for CAZyme profiling.",

In spite of its pathogenicity for pigs and increasing zoonotic potential, limited information is available on this serotype. Here we determined for the first time the chemical composition and structure of serotype 9 capsular polysaccharide (CPS), a major bacterial virulence factor and the antigen at the origin of S.\u00a0suis classification into serotypes. Chemical and spectroscopic data gave the repeating unit sequence: [3)Glcol-6-P-3-[D-Gal(\u03b11-2)]D-Gal(\u03b21-3)D-Sug(\u03b21-3)L-Rha(\u03b11-)]n. Compared to previously characterized S.\u00a0suis CPSs (serotypes 1, 1/2, 2 and 14), serotype 9 CPS does not contain sialic acid but contains a labile 4-keto sugar (2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-\u03b2-D-xylo-hexopyranos-4-ulose), one particular feature of this serotype. A correlation between S.\u00a0suis serotype 9 CPS sequence and genes of this serotype cps locus encoding putative glycosyltransferases and polymerase responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.

     "abstract": "Hyaluronic Acid (HA) is a non-sulphated glycosaminoglycan that, despite its high molecular weight, is soluble in water and is not resistant to enzymatic degradation, the latter of which hinders its wider application as a biomedical material. Auto-crosslinked polymer (ACP) gels of HA are fully biocompatible hydrogels that exhibit improved viscoelastic properties and prolonged in\u00a0vivo residence times compared to the native polymer. Crosslinking is achieved through a base-catalysed reaction consisting of the activation of HA carboxyl groups by 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI) and subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitution by the hydroxyl groups of HA in organic solvent.In this study, a number of ACP hydrogels have been obtained via reactions using varying ratios of CMPI to HA. The crosslinking reaction was monitored by rheological measurements in organic solvents during CMPI addition to the reaction mixture. The ACP intermediates, powders and hydrogels were characterized, helping to elucidate the crosslinking process. A two-step mechanism was proposed to explain the observed trends in viscosity and particle size. Syntheses were carried out by varying the reaction temperature, respectively at 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 45\u00a0\u00b0C in N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP), as well as the solvent respectively in NMP, DMSO and DMF at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Interestingly, varying these parameters did not substantially affect the degree of crosslinking but likely did influence the intra/inter-molecular crosslinking ratio and, therefore, the viscoelastic properties. A wide range of crosslinking densities was confirmed through ESEM analysis.Finally, a comparative hyaluronidase degradation assay revealed that the ACPs exhibited a higher resistance toward enzymatic cleavage at low elastic modulus compared to other more chemically resistant, crosslinked HAs. These observations demonstrated the importance of crosslinking density of matrix structures on substrate availability.",

Negative-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (ES-CID-MS/MS) is attempted for sequence determination of the sulfated oligosaccharides. The sequence of F1 with homogeneous disaccharide composition was first characterized to be Galp-(4SO4)-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-Galp by detailed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses. The fragmentation pattern of F1 in the product ion spectra was established on the basis of negative-ion ES-CID MS/MS, which was then applied to sequence analysis of other sulfated oligosaccharides.

     "abstract": "Mucus produced and secreted by gastrointestinal mucosa contains various types of mucins equipped with unique sugar chains considered to play critical roles in protecting mucous membranes; therefore, the identification and verification of mucin sugar chains is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms. In our previous work, we generated three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), RGM22, RGM26, and RGM42, which recognize sugar chains in rat gastric mucin. Here, we immunohistochemically analyzed the rat gastrointestinal mucosa and found that the antigens recognized by RGM22 and RGM42 were expressed in the rat antrum and Brunner's glands, whereas that recognized by RGM26 was detected in the antrum, but rarely in Brunner's glands. We found that these antibodies reacted with porcine gastric mucin-derived oligosaccharides bearing a common structure: GalNAc\u03b11-3(Fuc\u03b11-2)Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-6GalNAc-ol. Moreover, epitope analysis revealed that RGM42 and RGM22 recognized \u03b1-linked GalNAc and GalNAc\u03b11-3Gal, respectively, on the GalNAc\u03b11-3(Fuc\u03b11-2)Gal structure, whereas RGM26 was specific for GalNAc\u03b11-3(Fuc\u03b11-2)Gal. These results indicate that rat Brunner's glands express specific antigens bearing GalNAc\u03b11-3Gal that are recognized by RGM22 and RGM42. Thus, RGM22, RGM26, and RGM42 with their unique antigen specificities could be useful tools for investigation of oligosaccharide diversity among mucins.",

     "abstract": "Glycopolymers, synthetic sugar-containing macromolecules, are attracting ever-increasing interest from the chemistry community. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) is an important building block for the synthesis of sugar based methacrylate monomers and polymers. Normally, glycidyl methacrylate shows some advantages such as reactivity against nucleophiles or milder synthetic conditions such as other reactive methacrylate monomers. However, condensation reactions of glycidyl methacrylate with for instance protected galactose monomer leads to a mixture of two products due to a strong competition between the two possible pathways: epoxide ring opening or transesterification. In this paper, we propose two alternative routes to synthesize regiospecific galactose-based methacrylate monomers using the epoxy-ring opening reaction. In the first alternative route, the protected galactose is first oxidized to the acid in order to make it more reactive against the epoxide of GMA. In the second route, the protected sugar was first treated with epichlorohydrin followed by the epoxy ring opening reaction with methacrylic acid, to create an identical analogue of the ring-opening product of GMA. These two monomers were polymerized using conventional radical polymerization and were compared to the previously known galactose-methacrylate one. The new polymers show similar thermal stability but lower glass transition temperature (Tg) with respect to the known galactose methacrylate polymer.",

Databases of these structures are an essential resource for the interpretation of analytical data and the development of bioinformatics tools. However, with no template to predict what structures are possible the human glycan structure databases are incomplete and rely heavily on the curation of published, experimentally determined, glycan structure data. In this work, a library of 45 human glycosyltransferases was used to generate a theoretical database of N-glycan structures comprised of 15 or less monosaccharide residues. Enzyme specificities were sourced from major online databases including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Glycan, Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy), GlycoGene DataBase (GGDB) and BRENDA. Based on the known activities, more than 1.1 million theoretical structures and 4.7 million synthetic reactions were generated and stored in our database called UniCorn. Furthermore, we analyzed the differences between the predicted glycan structures in UniCorn and those contained in UniCarbKB (www.unicarbkb.org), a database which stores experimentally described glycan structures reported in the literature, and demonstrate that UniCorn can be used to aid in the assignment of ambiguous structures whilst also serving as a discovery database.",

     "abstract": "One of the \u03b2-1,3-glucans, laminarin, has been widely used as a substrate for enzymes including endo-1,3-\u03b2-glucanase. To obtain quantitative information about the molecular interaction between laminarin and endo-1,3-\u03b2-glucanase, the structural properties of laminarin should be determined. The results from pioneering work using analytical ultracentrifugation for carbohydrate analysis showed that laminarin from Laminaria digitata predominantly exists as a single-chain species with approximately 5% of triple-helical species. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments did not show a peak assignable to the transition from triple-helix to single-chain, supporting the notion that a large proportion of laminarin is the single-chain species. The interaction of laminarin with an inactive variant of endo-1,3-\u03b2-glucanase from Cellulosimicrobium cellulans, E119A, was quantitatively analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding was enthalpically driven and the binding affinity was approximately 106\u00a0M\u22121. The results from binding stoichiometric analysis indicated that on average, E119A binds to laminarin in a 2:1 ratio. This seems to be reasonable, because laminarin mainly exists as a monomer, the apparent molecular mass of laminarin is 3.6\u00a0kDa, and E119A would have substrate-binding subsites corresponding to 6 glucose units. The analytical ultracentrifugation experiments could detect different complex species of laminarin and endo-1,3-\u03b2-glucanase.",

The isolation of GSLs from SKOV3 and T29\u00a0cell lines was carried out using Folch partition.

     "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues in the form of HS proteoglycans, which play essential roles in various physiological and pathological processes. In contrast to the template-guided processes involved in the synthesis of DNA and proteins, HS biosynthesis is not believed to involve a template. However, it appears that the final structure of HS chains was strictly regulated. Herein, we report research based hypothesis that two major steps, namely \u201ccoding\u201d and \u201cdecoding\u201d steps, are involved in the biosynthesis of HS, which strictly regulate its chemical structure and biological activity. The \u201ccoding\u201d process in this context is based on the distribution of sulfate moieties on the amino groups of the glucosamine residues in the HS chains. The sulfation of these amine groups is catalyzed by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, which has four isozymes. The composition and distribution of sulfate groups and iduronic acid residues on the glycan chains of HS are determined by several other modification enzymes, which can recognize these coding sequences (i.e., the \u201cdecoding\u201d process). The degree and pattern of the sulfation and epimerization in the HS chains determines the extent of their interactions with several different protein factors, which further influences their biological activity.",

Within this study we present the results of azetidinium salts as a new functional group for conjugation to polysaccharides. The reactivity of three azetidinium salts on xylan, arabinoxylan and galactoglucomannan was investigated. Carbonyl groups were found to be favorable for the reaction with azetidinium salts and thus the glucuronic acid content in the hemicellulose determines the degree of substitution. TEMPO-oxidation of the hemicelluloses was done which successfully increased the degree of substitution. The highly reactive azetidinium salts are easily synthesized from secondary amines and epichlorohydrin and can be used as a new tool toward functionalization of hemicelluloses into the after sought properties.",

     "abstract": "Our previous work showed that substitution of an amino acid that is coupled with the +2 subsite adjacent to the transition stabilizer of a glucansucrase, which produces a water-insoluble glucan, resulted in significant changes in the structures and yields of the water-insoluble glucans produced. We now describe how these changes affect the ability of the glucansucrase to bind to exogenous glucans, and how these glucans can influence the yield, product structures, and kinetics of the mutant glucansucrases. The activity of the wild-type enzyme, with threonine at position 654, is not significantly activated by added dextran, and the yield of water-insoluble glucan from sucrose is only slightly increased by dextran. Mutant T654Y is not affected at all by the addition of dextran. However, several mutant enzymes exhibit markedly lower yields of glucan relative to the wild type; these lower yields can be partially or completely overcome by the addition of water-soluble dextran. Although evidence indicates that the soluble dextran is incorporated into water-insoluble glucan, the increased yields cannot be accounted for solely by incorporation of the dextran into insoluble product. Furthermore, these DsrI mutants are significantly activated by exogenous glucans. The addition of dextran does not markedly change the KM for sucrose in the mutant enzymes, but does increase the Vmax of the reaction. These effects apparently depend on the presence of unbranched sequences of \u03b11\u21926-linked D-glucose units in the glucan.",

The self-consistent force field (SCRF) calculations together with the polarized continuum (PCM) model were used to study the systems in solution while the solvation energies were computed using the solvation model (SM). The calculated structural and vibrational properties could explain the anomerization of maltose in solution, as was reported in the literature while the natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses for those species support clearly the mutarotation equilibria between both forms in solution, evidencing the anhydrous forms the equilibrium: \u03b1 (45%) \u21d4 \u03b2 (55%), similar to that experimentally reported at 20\u2009\u00b0C. Bands of all the species observed in the vibrational spectra support the presence of the anomeric species of maltose in solution while the presence of dimeric species justify the intense IR bands observed in the higher wavenumbers region. The similar gap values for maltose and lactose probably justify that these sugars are reducing sugars while the high values in sucrose could explain that it is a non-reducing sugar. On the other hand, the sweeteners cyclamate and saccharine are most reactive in solution than the sugars maltose, lactose and sucrose, as expected due to their ionic characteristics. The predicted vibrational spectra for the four species of maltose show reasonable concordances with the corresponding experimental ones.

They exhibit a fascinating quaternary structure variation. Recently, it has become clear that lectins exist as oligomers. Soybean agglutinin is a tetrameric legume lectin, each of whose subunits are glycosylated. In the present study we explore the main origin for the stability of soybean agglutinin dimer. In order to understand the role of glycosylation on the dimeric interface, we have carried out normal (298K), high temperatures (380K, 500K) long explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared the structural and conformational changes between the glycosylated and non-glycosylated dimers. The study reveals that the high degree of stability at normal temperature is mostly contributed by interfacial ionic interactions (~200\u2009kcal/mol) between polar residues like Lys, Arg, Asp, Thr, Ser, Asn and Gln (62%). It maintains its overall folded conformation due to high subunit interactions at the non-canonical interface. Mainly five important hydrogen bonds between CO of one \u03b2 sheet of one subunit with the N-H of other \u03b2 strand of the other subunit help to maintain the structural integrity. Ten inter subunit salt-bridge interactions between Arg 185\u2013As\u1e55192, Lys 163\u2013As\u1e55169, Asp 169\u2013Ly\u015b 163 and Asp 192\u2013Ar\u01f5 185 at non-canonical interface appear to be important to maintain the three dimensional structure of SBA dimer. Moreover, our simulation results revealed that increase in vibrational entropy could decrease the free energy and contribute to the glycan-induced stabilization by ~45\u2009kcal/mol at normal temperature.",

Besides structure elucidation of six Amadori rearrangement products derived from d-glucose and d-galactose with l-alanine, l-phenylalanine and l-proline, especially quantitative 13C selective saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy was applied to deduce information on isomeric systems. It could be shown exemplarily that the Amadori compound N-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-l-proline exhibits much higher isomerisation rates than d-fructose, which can be explained by C-1 substituent mediated intramolecular catalysis. In combination with a reduced carbonyl activity of Amadori compounds compared to their related ketoses which results in an increased acyclic keto isomer concentration, the results on isomerisation dynamics lead to a highly significant increased reactivity of Amadori compounds. This can be clearly seen, comparing approximated carbohydrate milieu stability time constants (ACuSTiC) which is 1\u2009s for N-(1-deoxy-d-fructos-1-yl)-l-proline and 10\u2009s for d-fructose at pD 4.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05 at 350\u2009K.

     "abstract": "The use of the 2-O-(2-trimethylsilylmethallyl) group as intramolecular nucleophile and cation clock reaction in the glucopyranose series depends on the nature of the glycosyl donor. As previously reported, with trichloroacetimidates the anticipated intramolecular Sakurai reaction proceeds efficiently and is an effective clock, whereas with sulfoxides complications arise. The source of these complications is now shown to be an intramolecular sulfenyl transfer reaction between the tethered allylsilane and the activated sulfoxide. These results illustrate how a different unimolecular clock reaction may be required for a given cation when it is generated from different donors in order to avoid side reactions. The synthesis and cyclization of a 2-O-(3-hydroxypropyl) glucopyranosyl sulfoxide leading on activation to the formation of a trans-fused acetal is also described. The formation of this crystallographically-established trans-fused acetal is discussed in terms of the high effective concentration of the intramolecular nucleophile which leads to a high degree of a SN2 character in the displacement of the \u03b1-glucosyl triflate or at the level of the corresponding \u03b1-CIP. The possible use of such intramolecular alcohols as clock reactions and their limitations is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is a main surface antigen and virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria. Regardless of the source of LPS, this molecule, isolated from the smooth forms of bacteria, is characterised by a general structural layout encompassing three regions: (i) an O-specific polysaccharide (O-PS) \u2013 a polymer of repeating oligosaccharide units, (ii) core oligosaccharide (OS), and (iii) the lipid A anchoring LPS in the outer membrane of the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. Structural analysis usually requires degradation of LPS and further efficient separation of various poly- and oligosaccharide glycoforms.The hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was shown as an efficient technique for separation of labelled or native neutral and acidic glycans, glycopeptides, sialylated glycans, glycosylated and nonglycosylated peptides. Herein we adopted ZIC\u00ae (zwitterionic stationary phase covalently attached to porous silica)-HILIC technology in combination with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry to separate different LPS-derived oligosaccharides. As a result three effective procedures have been developed: (i) to separate different core oligosaccharides of Escherichia coli R1 LOS, (ii) to separate RU-[Hep]-Kdo oligosaccharides from core OS glycoforms of Hafnia alvei PCM 1200 LPS, and (iii) to separate Hep and Kdo-containing mono, di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides of H. alvei PCM 1200 LPS. Moreover, some of developed analytical procedures were scaled to semi-preparative protocols and used to obtain highly-purified fractions of the interest in larger quantities required for future evaluation, analysis, and biological applications.",

The other two steps (deprotonation and chair inversion) combined involve lower activation energies (9\u201312\u2009kcal/mol). Comparison of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions suggest that if the deprotonation step precedes the chair inversion, the reaction should be faster for both compounds. No major differences in reaction rate can be theoretically predicted to be caused by the presence of sulfate on O-2, although one experimental result suggested that O-2 sulfation should increase the reaction rate. The conformational pathways are complex, given the large number of rotamers available for each compound, and the way that some of these rotamers combine into some of the pathways.

     "abstract": "Using trisaccharide diol acceptors displaying two glucosamine residues free at O-3, we observed that \u03b1-l-fucosylation with \u03b1 armed donor proceeded smoothly at the most accessible N-trichloroacetyl nonreducing end glucosamine residue. In contrast, glycosylations with peracetylated glycosyl bromide donors activated under Helferich conditions seemed to proceed preferentially or exclusively at the more sterically hindered N-acetylated reducing end unit. Thus, we concluded that disarmed donors were mismatched at O-3 of the N-trichloroacetylated glucosamine residue regardless of \u03b1 or \u03b2 configuration of the glycosidic bond formed and d or l configuration of the donor. Interestingly orthoester formation occurred in some cases at this position while they were not observed at the reducing end unit. Conversion of the nonreducing end trichloroacetamido to an acetamido allowed the Helferich catalyzed galactosylation to occur at both positions and revealed the impact of the N-trichloroacetamido on the mismatched glycosylations. Changing the activation conditions from the mild Lewis acid Hg(CN)2 to the stronger acid AgOTf revealed that in fact \u03b2-d-galactosylation at the less hindered N-trichloroacetylated residue was kinetically favored over that at the reducing end residue. Isolation of equal amounts of orthoester at this position suggested that it was formed first but that the strong AgOTf Lewis acid was able to promote rearrangement to the \u03b2-d-galactosidic bond. These results shed additional light on the apparent mismatch of disarmed glycosyl donors with hydroxyl groups deemed more accessible. Depending on electronic factors imposed by the acceptor and activation conditions, transient unstable orthoester formation may explain in some cases why these donors appear mismatched with the most accessible hydroxyl groups which are otherwise glycosylated by armed donors.",

As a spin-off of this study, we used the developed analytical strategy for the evaluation of 6 anonymous commercial GOS products, in comparison with Vivinal GOS. These GOS products were first subjected to HPLC-SEC, calibrated HPAEC-PAD profiling (glucose units in relation to a malto-oligosaccharide ladder), and 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. For a more detailed analysis and support of the conclusions based on the initial analysis, the GOS products were separated into DP-pure subpools on Bio-Gel P-2 (MALDI-TOF-MS analysis), which were subjected to calibrated HPAEC-PAD profiling and 1H NMR analysis. Unidentified peaks from different GOS products, not present in Vivinal GOS, were isolated for detailed structural characterization. In this way, the differences between the various GOS products in terms of DP distribution and type of glycosidic linkages were established. A total of 13 new GOS structures were characterized, adding structural-reporter-group signals and HPAEC-PAD based glucose unit G.U. values to the analytical toolbox.

Resvera-A is a pharamacophore-based designed molecule that exhibits anti-oxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. In this study, an alternative cost-effective uridine diphosphate (UDP) recycling system was established to produce UDP-\u03b1-D-glucose through a two-step enzyme-catalyzed reaction using easily available cheap sources. This UDP-\u03b1-D-glucose biosynthesis system was combined with a glycosyltransferase (YjiC, from Bacillus licheniformis)-catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of glucoside derivatives of resvera-A. The side product of the glycosylation reaction, UDP, was used as a precursor for the biosynthesis of UDP-\u03b1-D-glucose, which is used by YjiC for glycosylation, thus recycling UDP. As a result, two novel molecules, resvera-A 3-O-\u03b1-D-glucoside (42.33\u2009mg, 2.10\u2009mM, 0.84\u2009mg/mL) and resvera-A 4\u02b9-O-\u03b1-D-glucoside (99.38\u2009mg, 4.87\u2009mM, 1.98\u2009mg/mL), were synthesized within 4\u2009h from 50\u2009mL preparative scale reaction using only 0.1\u2009mM of UDP-\u03b1-D-glucose, 100 folds lower concentration than the concentration of resvera-A (10\u2009mM) used.

In the case of polysaccharide from C.\u00a0japonica bearing 3-O-fucosylated and 3-O-sulfated glucuronic acid residues in the backbone, acidification of the medium led to separation of H-1 signals of GlcA3S and GalNAc. Therefore, the combination of data obtained at different pH values may be useful for interpretation of overcrowded spectra of fucosylated chondroitin sulfates.",

The results indicate that ring-inversion free energies calculated for residues in a chain are weakly correlated with those of corresponding monomers, except of the case of 1\u21926 linkages. This, in combination with the results for O1-methyl-hexopyranosides (Plazinski et\u00a0al, 2016), suggests that both the type of functionalization (glycolysation vs. methylation) and the topology of glycosidic linkage play an important role in possible alterations of the hexopyranose ring flexibility. Additionally, the correlation of the ring shape with the preferred geometry of glycosidic linkages was investigated. The linkages of the 1\u21922, 1\u21923 and 1\u21926 types do not follow the trend found in the case of the 1\u21924 linkages, i.e. there is no correlation between the range of changes in the glycosidic linkage conformation and the topological orientation of the glycosidic oxygen atoms. Overall, the ring shape affects the glycosidic linkages of the 1\u21926 type to the least extent in comparison to the remaining ones.",

The parenchyma tissue is what you enjoy eating, while collenchyma, because of its fibrous nature, is not so attractive. Celery is a useful model for comparing the cell walls (CWs) of the two cell types such as collenchyma and parenchyma. However, to date, the structural characteristics of collenchyma and parenchyma cell walls from the same plant have not been compared. Monosaccharide composition suggested the collenchyma cell walls contained less pectin but more hemicellulose in comparison to parenchyma. High-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of highly mobile pectins revealed that the arabinan signals were more evident in the collenchyma spectrum, while galactan showed a much stronger resonance in the parenchyma spectrum. In addition, methyl esterified and non-esterified galacturonic acid signals were observed in parenchyma CWs, but only the latter one appeared in the collenchyma. The ratio of cellulose surface/interior obtained from CP/MAS spectra for collenchyma suggested the cellulose microfibrils were ~2.4\u2009nm, while in the parenchyma, these were somewhat larger. X-ray diffraction indicated the size of the cellulose microfibrils were the same for both types of CWs.",

By the impregnation, cellulose was rather stabilized against discoloration and weight-loss through converting the reducing ends into the glycosides with Glc\u03b2OMe. Alternatively, polymerization and discoloration of Glc\u03b2OMe were accelerated in the presence of cellulose. A mechanism via reducing sugars as reactive intermediates formed through hydrolysis is proposed to explain these phenomena.

The maximum xylanase activity recorded after 24\u2009h of incubation at 70\u2009\u00b0C and in an optimized medium containing 10\u2009g/L mix birchwood- and oats spelt-xylan was 250\u2009U/mL.

     "abstract": "Quantitative 1H selective saturation transfer NMR spectroscopy (1H SST qNMR) was used to fully describe the milieu dependent dynamics of the isomeric system of d-erythrose. Thermodynamic activation parameters are calculated for acidic as well as for basic catalysis combining McConnell's modified Bloch equations for the chemical exchange solved for the constraint of saturating the non-hydrated acyclic isomer, the Eyring equation and Hudson's equation for pH dependent catalysis. A detailed mathematical examination describing the milieu dependent dynamics of sugar isomerisation is provided. Thermodynamic data show evidence that photo-catalysed sugar isomerisation as well as degradation has to be considered. Approximations describing the pH and temperature dependence of thermodynamic activation parameters are derived that indicate the possibility of photo-affecting equilibrium constants. Moreover, the results show that isomerisation dynamics are closely related to degradation kinetics and that sugars' reactivities are altered by the concentration of acyclic carbonyl isomer and the sum of its ring closing rate constants. Additionally, it is concluded that sugar solutions show a limited self-stabilising behaviour.",

Most of the studies are interested in phenolic compounds, extracted during ageing and especially involved in wine oxidation, colour, and sensory properties such as astringency and bitterness. Oak aroma volatile compounds have also been the subject of numerous studies. These compounds of interest are part of low molecular weight compounds which represent 2%\u201310% of oak wood composition.

     "abstract": "A variety of applications in glycobiology exploit affinity chromatography through the immobilization of glycans to a solid support. Although several strategies are known, they may provide certain advantages or disadvantages in how the sugar is attached to the affinity matrix. Additionally, the products of some methods may be hard to characterize chemically due to non-specific reactions. The lack of specificity in standard immobilization reactions makes affinity chromatography with expensive oligosaccharides challenging. As a result, methods for specific and efficient immobilization of oligosaccharides remain of interest. Herein, we present a method for the immobilization of saccharides using N\u2032-glycosylsulfonohydrazide (GSH) carbohydrate donors. We have compared GSH immobilization to known strategies, including the use of divinyl sulfone (DVS) and cyanuric chloride (CC), for the generation of affinity matrices. We compared immobilization methods by determining their immobilization efficiency, based on a comparison of the mass of immobilized carbohydrate and the concentration of active binding sites (determined using lectins). Our results indicate that immobilization using GSH donors can provide comparable amounts of carbohydrate epitopes on solid support while consuming almost half of the material required for DVS immobilization. The lectin binding capacity observed for these two methods suggests that GSH immobilization is more efficient. We propose that this method of oligosaccharide immobilization will be an important tool for glycobiologists working with precious glycan samples purified from biological sources.",

In this study, utilizing an IL co-solvent system, selective synthesis of mono-acylated fructose with lauric acid catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) was investigated. The imidazolium-based ILs selected as co-solvents with 2-methyl-2-butanol (2M2B) markedly improved the ratios of monolauroyl fructose in the presence of 60% [BMIM][TfO] (v/v) and 20% [BMIM][BF4] (v/v), in which the mono-acylated fructose was 85% and 78% respectively. Based on a Ping-Pong Bi\u2212Bi model, a kinetic equation was fitted, by which the kinetic parameters revealed that the affinity between fructose and acyl-enzyme intermediate was enhanced. The inhibition effect of fructose on free enzyme was weakened in the presence of IL co-solvents. The conformation of CALB binding substrates also changed in the co-solvent system as demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectra. These results demonstrated that the variation of CALB kinetic characteristics was a crucial factor for the selectivity of mono-acylation in ILs/2M2B co-solvents.",

Due to a limited availability of the experimental data, the conformational rearrangements (puckering) which occur within the pyranose rings are studied extensively by using various computational approaches. Contrary to the basic structural and energetic features characterizing the process of ring flexing, the kinetic and dynamics properties of puckering remain less recognized. We performed the first, molecular dynamics-based, systematic calculations aimed at description of the kinetic characteristics of the conformational changes in the rings of \u03b1-d- and \u03b2-d-glucopyranose molecules. The rate constants representing particular molecular events which comprise the chair\u2013chair inversion are determined and analyzed in the context of the available experimental data. Furthermore, several various variables (e.g. transmission coefficients) and issues (e.g. memorylessness of the puckering process) are investigated and discussed.

Unlike UXS, however, UGAE prevents the decarboxylation. Human UXS (hUXS) and UGAE from Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit high structural similarity in the active site, but two catalytically important residues in hUXS (Glu120 and Arg277) are replaced by Ser and Thr in the UGAE group. Additionally, Asn176, which participates in substrate binding, is changed to Thr. We therefore analyzed single, double and triple mutants of hUXS carrying these substitutions to evaluate their significance for product specificity. All mutants showed considerably lower activities than wild-type hUXS (>1000-fold reduction). NMR spectroscopic analysis of the reaction products showed that UDP-\u03b2-l-threo-pentopyranos-4-ulose (UDP-4-keto-Xyl), UDP-Xyl or both, but no UDP-GalUA or UDP-4-keto-GlcUA were formed. Correlation of product characteristics, such as deuterium incorporation, with the amino acid replacements gave insights into structure\u2013function relationships in UXS, suggesting that interaction between active site and overall enzyme structure rather than distinct conserved residues are decisive for product formation.",

The different timescales associated with the particular degrees of freedom hinder the progress in both those fields. The present paper reports the results of computational studies aimed at elucidating and characterizing the potential correlations between the two main structural determinants of the carbohydrate structure, i.e. the ring conformation and the orientation of the glycosidic bonds (expressed in terms of the \u03d5 and \u03c8 glycosidic dihedral angles). The free energy landscapes computed for 16 different oligomers composed of unsubstituted, 1,4-linked hexopyranose residues allowed for a detailed insight into how the ring geometry affects the glycosidic linkage conformation. The factor of main importance appeared to be the local changes of the chain length induced by the ring conformational rearrangements. This effect is important mainly for the carbohydrate chains exploiting the glycosidic bonds of uniform orientation with respect to the ring (i.e. either exclusively axially or exclusively equatorially oriented). The shape of the ring may affect the (\u03d5,\u03c8) free energy maps but only if the population of the alternative ring conformers is relatively high and (at the same time) the presence of such conformers is associated with the significant shifts of the favorable \u03d5 and \u03c8 values.",

The metabolic disease type III galactosemia is caused by detrimental mutations in the human GalE. GalE and related enzymes display unusual enzymologic, chemical, and stereochemical properties; including irreversible binding of the cofactor NAD and uridine nucleotide-induced activation of this cofactor. These epimerases have been found active on UDP-hexoses, the N-acetylated and uronic acid forms thereof as well as UDP-pentoses. As they are involved in different pathways and functions, a deeper understanding of the enzymes, and their substrate promiscuity and/or selectivity, could lead to drug and vaccine design as well as antibiotic and probiotic development. This review summarizes the research performed on UDP-sugar 4-epimerases\u2019 structure, mechanism and substrate promiscuity.",

The structures of the glycosides were elucidated by 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass-spectrometry. Glycosides 2, 3, 4, and 5 have pentasaccharide branched carbohydrate moieties and differ from each other by monosaccharide compositions and aglycone structures. At that, glycosides 2 and 3 contain three xylose, one 3-O-methyl-glucose and one quinovose residues, while glycosides 4 and 5 have two quinovose, two xylose and one 3-O-methyl-glucose residues. Compounds 1 and 6\u20138 are hexaosides differing from each other by aglycone structures and by the fifth monosaccharide residue, which proved to be glucose in cladoloside C3 (1), xylose in cladoloside G (6) and quinovose in cladolosides H1 (7) and H2 (8). The presence of quinovose residue in the fifth position, as in 4, 5, 7 and 8 has never been earlier found in carbohydrate chains of triterpene glycosides from sea cucumbers. The carbohydrate chains with xylose in the fifth position of pentaosides and hexaosides are also very unusual for holothurious glycosides. All the substances demonstrate strong or moderate cytotoxic and hemolytic effects with hexaosides being more active than the corresponding pentaosides.

     "abstract": "In human, digestion of cooked starch mainly involves breaking down of \u03b1-amylase to \u03b1-limit dextrins and small linear malto-oligosaccharides, which are in turn hydrolyzed to glucose by the gut mucosal maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM). Human pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (HPA), amino- and carboxyl-terminal portions of MGAM (ntMGAM and ctMGAM) catalyze the hydrolysis of \u03b1-d-(1,4) glycosidic linkages in starch, playing a crucial role in the production of glucose in the human lumen. Accordingly, these enzymes are effective drug targets for the treatments of type 2 diabetes and obesity. In this study, a Plackett\u2013Burman based statistical screening procedure was adopted to determine the most critical factors affecting cooked starch digestion by the combination of HPA, ctMGAM and ntMGAM. Six factors were tested and experimental results showed that pH and temperature were the major influencing factors, with optimal pH and temperature at 6.0 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Surprisingly, ntMGAM had no significant contribution to the glucose production from starch digestion compared to the HPA and ctMGAM. The optimal proportion of HPA and ctMGAM in a starch digestion system was further determined by response surface methodology. Results showed a maximum starch digestion (88.05%) within 0.5\u00a0h when used HPA:ctMGAM=1:9 (U). The inhibitory effects of various inhibitors on the cooked starch digestion by HPA1/ctMGAM9 were evaluated by determining their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Acarviostatin II03 showed the highest inhibitory activity, with 67 times higher potency than acarbose. Moreover, acarviostatin II03 could significantly depress postprandial blood glucose levels in mice, better than that by acarbose. These findings suggest that our in\u00a0vitro enzymatic system can simulate in\u00a0vivo starch digestion process, and thus can be used to screen and evaluate \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Chitin is one of the most abundant polysaccharides on earth. It consists of repeating \u03b2-1,4 linked N-acetylated glucosamine (A) units. Chitosan is an N-deacetylated product of chitin. Chitosan and its derivatives have broad medical applications as drugs, nutraceuticals, or drug delivery agents. However, a reliable analytical method for quality control of medically used chitosans is still lacking. In current study, nitrous acid was used to cleave all glucosamine residues in chitosan into 2,5-anhydromannose (M) or M at the reducing end of di-, tri-, and oligosaccharides. PMP, i.e. 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone, was used to label all the Ms. Online UV detection allowed quantification of all M-containing UV peaks whereas online MS analysis directly identified 11 different kinds of mono-, di-, tri-, and oligosaccharides that correlated each oligosaccharide with specific UV peak after HPLC separation. The DA (degree of acetylation) for chitosans was calculated based on the A/(A+M) value derived from the UV data. This newly developed method had several advantages for quality control of chitosan: 1. the experimental procedures were extensively optimized; 2. the reliability of the method was confirmed by online LC-MS analysis; 3. the DA value was obtainable based on the UV data after HPLC analysis, which was comparableto that of 1H NMR and conductometric titration analyses; 4. finally and most importantly, this method could be used to obtain the DA as well as chemical acetylation/deacetylation mechanisms for chitosan by any laboratory equipped with a HPLC and an online UV detector.",

The OST enzymes catalyze the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain from lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLO) to asparagine residues in proteins. The detergent-solubilized membrane fractions prepared from cultured A.\u00a0fulgidus cells contain both OST and LLO. The addition of a peptide containing the glycosylation sequon produced oligosaccharide chains attached to a structurally defined peptide. To facilitate the NMR analysis, the cells were grown in rich medium supplemented with 13C-glucose, to label the LLOs metabolically. The MS analysis of the glycopeptide revealed that the glucose and galactose residues were nearly fully 13C-labeled, but the mannose residues were fractionally labeled with about 20% efficiency. An immunodetection experiment revealed that the longest AglB paralog (AfAglB-L) was expressed in the membrane fractions under our cell culture conditions, while the other two shorter AglB paralogs (AfAglB-S1 and AfAglB-S2) were not. Thus, the oligosaccharide chain analyzed in this study was the product of AfAglB-L. The N-glycan consists of eight hexose residues, as follows:The \u03b11,3-linked glucose is an optional residue branching from the distal mannose residue. The MS analysis of the minor HPLC peak of the in\u00a0vitro oligosaccharyl transfer products also revealed an optional sulfate modification on the glucose residue directly linked to the Asn residue.

Here, a method for glycoprotein labeling/carbohydrate detection through glycan replacement, termed g lycoprotein l abeling with c lick c hemistry (GLCC), is described. In this method, a glycoprotein is first treated with specific glycosidases to remove certain sugar residues, a procedure that creates acceptor sites for a specific glycosyltransferase. A \u2018clickable\u2019 monosaccharide is then installed onto these sites by the glycosyltransferase. This modified glycoprotein is then conjugated to a reporter molecule using a click chemistry reaction.

As a demonstration, labeling on fetal bovine fetuin, mouse immunoglobulin IgG and bacterial expressed human TNF\u03b1 and TNF\u03b2 are shown.

Because d-mannose establishes a hydrogen bond via its 6-OH group with Ser23 of LecB in the crystal structure and may be beneficial for binding affinity, we extended d-mannose and synthesized mannoheptoses bearing the free 6-OH group as well as amido and sulfonamido-substituents at C7. Two series of diastereomeric mannoheptoses were synthesized and the stereochemistry was determined by X-ray crystallography. The potency of the mannoheptoses as LecB inhibitors was assessed in a competitive binding assay. The data reveal a diastereoselectivity of LecB for (6S)-mannoheptose derivatives with increased activity over methyl \u03b1-d-mannoside.",

Notwithstanding its importance in various pathological and non-pathological events few straightforward methods for heparanase enzymatic activity has been stated. The aim of this study was to develop two heparanase activity assays to cover a whole range of applications. First, a fast and easy method based on commercial homogenous substrate, fondaparinux, was described. The other method is a quantitative assay based on biotinylated heparan sulfate that uses an easier technique to immobilize the substrate in a 96-well plate.The heparanase recombinant enzyme and fondaparinux were incubated overnight. After incubation, a fluorescent redox marker, resazurin, was added. The reduction of resazurin depends on the amount of glucuronic acid released by heparanase digestion. Fluorescence measurements were done using excitation and emission wavelengths of 560\u00a0nm and 590\u00a0nm, respectively.The 96-well plate was incubated with protamine sulfate. Subsequently, biotinylated heparan sulfate was immobilized. The enzymatic assay was performed using chimeric recombinant heparanase at different concentrations. In sequence, the immobilized biotinylated heparan sulfate that was not digested by recombinant heparanase was bound to streptavidin conjugated with europium. Fluorescence was measured using a time-resolved fluorometer.Both methods have high sensitivity and can be used to detect heparanase activity. Fondaparinux assay is a quick and easy method for screening of heparanase inhibitors using recombinant enzyme or bacterial crude extract. Biotinylated heparan sulfate assay can be used for quantitative analysis in biological samples and protamine sulfate showed been capable to immobilized heparan sulfate.",

The advantage of the methodology is that the acid-catalyzed O3-desilylation can be carried out in a stepwise manner so that different types of functional groups can be introduced to a CD molecule at different stage of the O3-desilylations. This makes the current methodology flexible and versatile. This current methodology constitutes one of the few methodologies available for the regioselective modification of CDs at the secondary face.",

Various reaction parameters, such as time, temperature, and reactant molar ratio were performed to determine the optimal reaction conditions.

Negative-ion electrospray (ESI-MS) mass spectrum showed two molecular ions at m/z 686.3 and 728.3, which corresponded to the core OS having the composition Rha2QuiNAcKdh. The mass difference between both ions indicated that the higher molecule mass represented the mono O-acetylated variant of the OS. The sequence of the oligosaccharide was reflected in CID MS/MS spectra. In turn, NMR spectroscopy confirmed the composition and glycosylation pattern of the core OS and provided additional evidence on its structure. 2D NMR experiments revealed that the terminal Rhap is acetylated at position O-2. Moreover, 3-deoxyheptulosonic acid (Kdh), which was detected at the reducing terminus of the OS, was evidently derived from the Kdo as a result of Smith degradation. In addition, the higher intensity of signals for a six-membered pyranose ring of Kdhp over 2,7-anh-Kdhf seemed to indicate prevalence of this form of the sugar in the OS-derived species.

Arabinogalactan (AG), a liver specific high galactose containing branched polysaccharide was hydrophobized using cholesterol (CHOL) as a lipid anchor via a two step reaction process to yield the novel polysaccharide lipid conjugated ligand (CHOL-AL-AG). CHOL-AL-AG was characterized by Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (NMR), size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Conventional liposomes (CL) and surface modified liposomes (SML) containing CHOL-AL-AG were prepared using reverse phase evaporation technique. Effect of CHOL-AL-AG concentration on particle size and zeta potential of SML was evaluated. Surface morphology of CL and SML was studied using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). In\u00a0vitro binding affinity of SML and CL was evaluated using Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) assay. Cellular uptake of SML and CL was determined on ASGPR expressing HepG2 cell lines by confocal laser scanning microscopy technique (CLSM). FTIR spectra revealed bands at 1736\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1664\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to ester and carbamate functional groups, respectively. Signals at \u03b4 0.5\u20132.5 corresponding to the cholestene ring and \u03b4 3\u20135.5 corresponding to the carbohydrate backbone were observed in 1H NMR spectrum of the product.

An endothermic peak at 207\u00a0\u00b0C was observed in the DSC thermogram of CHOL-AL-AG, which was not observed in thermograms of reactants and intermediate product. Synthesized CHOL-AL-AG was successfully incorporated in liposomes to yield SML. Both CL and SML possessed a mean particle size of\u223c200\u00a0nm with polydispersity index of\u223c0.25. The zeta potential of CLs was observed to be\u00a0\u221217\u00a0mV whereas zeta potential of SMLs varied from\u00a0\u221218 to\u00a0\u221222\u00a0mV. RCA assay revealed enhanced binding of SML compared to CL confirming presence of galactose on surface of SML. CLSM studies demonstrated enhanced cellular uptake of SMLs compared to CL by HepG2 cells post 3\u00a0h administration indicating enhanced uptake by the ASGPR.

They consist of three main regions: O-specific polysaccharide, core oligosaccharide, and lipid A. Bacteria modify LPS structure to escape the immune defence, but also to adapt to environmental conditions. LPS\u2019s structures are highly diversified in the O-specific polysaccharide region to evade bactericidal factors of immune system, but retain some common epitopes that are potential candidates for therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections. Common occurrence of glycine within the structure of LPS is a known phenomenon and was previously reported for variety of species. Since glycine residue substitutes mainly core oligosaccharide of LPS, especially inner core region, it was also considered as a part of common epitope for broad-reactive antimicrobial antibodies. Herein, we used multiple-stage electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry to identify glycine substitution in core oligosaccharide type characteristic for Hafnia alvei LPS, and isolated from five strains of different O-serotypes: 32, PCM 1190, PCM 1192, PCM 1200, and PCM 1209.

The heterogeneity of the complex matrix of BCs can make carbohydrate analysis challenging or necessitate tedious sample preparation leading to potential sugar loss or starch degradation into sugars. A recently established, simple and robust free solution capillary electrophoresis (CE) method was used in a new application to 13 BCs (in Australia) and compared with several established methods for quantification of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates identified in BCs by CE included sucrose, maltose, glucose and fructose. The CE method is simple requiring no sample preparation or derivatization and carbohydrates are detected by direct UV detection. CE was shown to be a more robust and accurate method for measuring carbohydrates than Fehling method, DNS (3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid) assay and HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography).",

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these stacking-like interactions between pyranose sugars and aromatic moieties. The physical basis of these interactions is being explained as either dispersion CH/\u03c0 or hydrophobic. In order to elucidate the nature of these interactions, we performed a series of molecular dynamics simulation of hevein domain (HEV32) in complex with (\u03b2-d-GlcNAc)3. Selected OH/O and CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds involved in carbohydrate recognition were artificially weakened in 100\u00a0ns molecular dynamics simulations. Separate weakening of either OH/O or CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds was not sufficient to destabilize the complex. This indicates that other effects, not solely CH/\u03c0 dispersion interactions, contribute significantly to the stability of the complex. Significant destabilization of complexes was reached only by simultaneous weakening of OH/O and CH/\u03c0 hydrogen bonds. This also shows that classical hydrogen bonds and CH/\u03c0 interactions are working in concert to stabilize this carbohydrate\u2013protein test case.",

     "abstract": "In this work, the dissolution mechanism of chitosan in imidazolium acetic-based ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). Chitobiose is considered to symbolize chitosan during the DFT calculations. [Bmim]OAc is supposed to be the best suitable IL among the investigated ILs for the dissolution of chitosan since the complex formed between [Bmim]OAc and chitobiose has the lowest energy. The hydrogen bonds formed by IL and chitobiose were studied by discussing the geometric parameter variations and the vibration mode analyses. Four strong hydrogen-bond patterns C1\u2013H1\u22efO16, C2\u2013H2\u22efO16, O38\u2013H39\u22efO1 and O40\u2013H41\u22efO2 were found, which means the existence of strong interaction between chitosan and [Bmim]OAc. In addition, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was used to study the second order perturbation stabilization energies (E(2)) that denotes the intensity of the interactions between chitobiose with H2O and ILs. The E(2) of chitobiose with [Bmim]OAc is larger than that of chitobiose with other ILs and solvents studied, which proves that chitobiose can be dissolved in [Bmim]OAc but cannot in water and other solvents. Atom in molecules (AIM) theory shows that hydrogen bonds between chitobiose and [Bmim]OAc are stronger than that between chitobiose and other solvents. It means that the interactions between [Bmim]OAc and chitobiose interrupt the initial hydrogen bonds in the chitobiose due to the formation of new hydrogen bonds in the complexes. The calculation data provide the interaction mechanism of the dissolution of chitosan in [Bmim]OAc.",

In this paper, we analyzed the intrinsic structural characteristics of four sucrose isomers with different glycosidic linkage by mass spectrometry (MS) technique. Our results show that sucrose has the most labile glycosidic bond compared with other three isomers, which is helpful for releasing glucose and fructose unit. Besides, sucrose has the most stable integral structure, which is hard to dehydrate and degrade into fragments through losing one or three even four-carbon units, just as its three isomers. In other words, sucrose is more easily holds an integral structure during the transport process, whenever it is necessary, and sucrose can be cleaved into glucose and fructose easily. Besides, we also investigate the internal relationship of sucrose with K+ by tandem mass spectrometry and viscosity measurement. The related results have shown that the K+ can stabilize sucrose to a greater extent than the Na+. Furthermore, under the same conditions, K+ ions reduce the viscosity of sucrose\u2013water system much more than Na+. These results suggest that K+ is a better co-transporter for sucrose.Of course, the transport of sucrose in plants is a very complicated process, which is involved in many proteins. This paper directly accounts for the basic structure feature of sucrose, and the results discovered could provide the novel insight for the answer why Nature chose sucrose for plants.",

     "abstract": "In comparison to the annual grain crops dominating current agricultural production, perennial grain species require fewer chemical and energy inputs and improve soil health and erosion control. The possibility for producing sustainable grain harvests from marginal land areas is motivating research initiatives to integrate perennial grains into commercial cropping and food processing systems. In this study, the feruloylated arabinoxylans from intermediate wheat grass (Thinopyrum intermedium, IWG), a promising perennial grain candidate in agronomic screening studies, were investigated. Insoluble fiber isolated from IWG whole grain flour was subjected to either mildly acidic (50\u00a0mM TFA, 100\u00a0\u00b0C, 2\u00a0h) or enzymatic (Driselase) hydrolysis. The liberated feruloylated arabinoxylan oligosaccharides were concentrated with Amberlite XAD-2, separated with gel chromatography (Sephadex LH-20, water), and purified with reversed-phase HPLC (C18, water-MeOH gradient). Thirteen feruloylated oligosaccharides were isolated (including eight structures described for the first time) and identified by LC-ESI-MS and NMR. Linkage-type analysis via methylation analysis, as well as the monosaccharide and phenolic acid profiles of the IWG insoluble fiber were also determined. IWG feruloylated arabinoxylans have a relatively simple structure with only short feruloylated side chains, a lower backbone substitution rate than annual rye and wheat varieties, and a moderate phenolic acid content.",

However, references are rather weak in eukaryotic chemotaxis about significance of simple carbohydrates. In the present work our goal is (i) to investigate the chemotactic effect of 10 mono- and disaccharides in the eukaryotic Tetrahymena pyriformis; (ii) to describe effective ligands with physicochemical parameters; (iii) to test whether sugars are acting via induction of metabolic pathways. Our results are: (i) the tested sugars can trigger both significant attractant (d-glucose, d-mannose) and significant repellent (d-glucosamine, d-fructose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, d-arabinose) effects, while some of the sugars (maltose, lactose, sucrose, d-galactose) had no effect. (ii) Correlations were described between the chemotactic effectiveness of the ligands and their physicochemical characters (TPSA, XLogP), which are supposed to influence the internalization of the sugars. (iii) All ligands proved to have low selection potential, which refers to a \u2018short-term\u2019 receptor moiety or influencing specific metabolic pathways.

Compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), LMWHs are prevalently used as clinical anticoagulant drugs due to their lower side effects and better bioavailability. The work presented herein provides a rapid and powerful fragment mapping method for structural characterization of LMWHs. The chain fragments of two types of LMWHs, enoxaparin and nadroparin, were generated by controlled enzymatic digestion with each of heparinase I (Hep I, Enzyme Commission (EC) # 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (Hep II, no EC # assigned) and heparinase III (Hep III, EC # 4.2.2.8). Reversed phase ion pair high performance liquid chromatography (RPIP-HPLC) coupled with electrospray ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-IT-TOF-MS) was used to profile the oligosaccharide chains ranging from disaccharides to decasaccharides. A database containing all theoretical structural compositions was established to assist the mass spectra interpretation. The six digests derived by three enzymes from two types of LMWHs exhibited distinguishable fingerprinting patterns. And a total of 94 enoxaparin fragments and 109 nadroparin fragments were detected and identified. Besides the common LMWH oligosaccharides, many components containing characteristic LMWH structures such as saturated l-idopyranosuronic acid, 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol, 1,6-anhydro-d-aminopyranose, as well as odd number oligosaccharides were also revealed. Quantitative comparison of major components derived from innovator and generic nadroparin products was presented. This approach to profile LMWHs' fragments offers a highly reproducible, high resolution and information-rich tool for evaluating the quality of this category of anticoagulant drugs or comparing structural similarities among samples from various sources.",

CfcI was recently shown to release GlcNAc from the reducing end of COS, a new activity for fungal chitinases. A Carbohydrate Binding Module of family 18 (CBM18) is inserted in the CfcI catalytic domain. Site directed mutagenesis was used to assess the functionality of this CfcI-CBM18: four of its key amino acids were replaced by glycine residues, yielding CfcISYNF.

The hydrolysate of Ge-132, 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoic acid, can interact with diol compounds; therefore, it can possibly interact with diol-containing sugar compounds, which have important physiological functions in sugar chains, glycoproteins, and glucolipids. In this study, we examined the interaction between sodium 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoate and monosaccharides using nuclear magnetic resonance. When 1,4-anhydroerythritol was mixed with sodium 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoate, a pattern of signals different from that obtained for each solute alone was observed. Some signals were broader, and novel signals with different chemical shifts appeared to originate from complex formation. Spectral observations for sodium 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoate and the sugar isomers of glucose and fructose indicated that sodium 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoate has a higher affinity for fructose (a ketose) than glucose (an aldose). Moreover, the \u03b2-furanosyl conformation of fructose was the structure that interacted most with sodium 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoate. These results demonstrate the ability of aqueous Ge-132 to form complexes with the cis-diol structures of saccharides. Thus, interactions among 3-(trihydroxygermyl)propanoic acid and the important biological sugar compounds might be implicated in the physiological function of Ge-132.",

However, there are clear conformational differences. In the 19F repeat unit, the rhamnose residue is nearly orthogonal to the other residues, whereas 19A has residues in similar orientations. This finding is corroborated by key inter-residue distances calculated from NMR NOESY experiments. Further, 19F is predominantly in extended conformations, whereas 19A exhibits a high prevalence of tight hairpin bends.These conformational differences may account for a lack of antibody cross-protection between serotypes 19F and 19A.",

Firstly, the extent of hydration water was determined by the decreased amount of bulk water with picosecond relaxation time that was replaced by that with much longer orientational relaxation time. As a result, we found glucose and trehalose exhibits stronger hydration capacity than fructose and sucrose, respectively, despite of the same number of the hydroxyl groups. For each saccharide, the hydration number tended to decrease with solute concentration. Secondly, the destructuring effect of these saccharide solutes on the HB network of the surrounding bulk water was discussed from the perspective of the fraction of non-hydrogen-bonded (NHB) water isolated from the HB network. We found the fraction of NHB water molecules that are not engaged in the HB network monotonously increased with saccharide concentration, indicating saccharide solutes promote the disruption of the water HB network. However, no noticeable differences were confirmed in the fraction of NHB water between glucose and fructose or between sucrose and trehalose. In contrast to hydration number, the number of NHB water produced by a single saccharide solute was less dependent on solute concentration, and three monosaccharide/disaccharide solutes were found to produce one/two NHB water molecules.",

Imaging by scanning electron microscopy reveals a morphology consisting of randomly configured block-like nanostructures.

In this approach, polyethyleneimine (PEI)-modified MWCNTs were covalently conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FI) and hyaluronic acid (HA). The formed MWCNT/PEI\u2013FI\u2013HA conjugates were characterized via different techniques and were used as a new carrier system to encapsulate the anticancer drug doxorubicin for targeted delivery to cancer cells overexpressing CD44 receptors.

In vitro release studies show that the drug release rate under an acidic condition (pH 5.8, tumor cell microenvironment) is higher than that under physiological condition (pH 7.4). Cell viability assay demonstrates that the carrier material has good biocompatibility in the tested concentration range, and the MWCNT/PEI\u2013FI\u2013HA/DOX complexes can specifically target cancer cells overexpressing CD44 receptors and exert growth inhibition effect to the cancer cells.

     "abstract": "Natural Killer T (NKT) cells are a unique type of innate immune cells which exert paradoxical roles in animal models through producing either Th1 or Th2 cytokines and activating dendritic cells. Alpha-galactosylceramide (\u03b1GalCer), a synthetic antigen for NKT cells, was found to be safe and immune stimulatory in cancer and hepatitis patients. We recently developed microparticle-formulated \u03b1GalCer, which is selectively presented by dendritic cells and macrophages, but not B cells, and thus can avoid the anergy of NKT cells. In this study, we have examined the immunogenicity of microparticles containing \u03b1GalCer and protein vaccine components through sublingual injection in mice. The results showed that sublingual injection of microparticles containing \u03b1GalCer and ovalbumin triggered IgG responses in serum (titer >1:100,000), which persisted for more than 3\u00a0months. Microparticles containing ovalbumin alone also induced comparable level of IgG responses. However, immunoglobulin subclass analysis showed that sublingually injected microparticles containing \u03b1GalCer and ovalbumin induced 20 fold higher Th1 biased antibody (IgG2c) than microparticles containing OVA alone (1:20,000 as compared to 1:1000 titer). Sublingual injection of microparticles containing \u03b1GalCer and ovalbumin induced secretion of both IgG (titer >1:1000) and IgA (titer\u00a0=\u00a01:80) in saliva secretion, while microparticles containing ovalbumin alone only induced secretion of IgG in saliva. Our results suggest that sublingual injection of microparticles and their subsequent trafficking to draining lymph nodes may induce adaptive immune responses in mucosal compartments. Ongoing studies are focused on the mechanism of antigen presentation and lymphocyte biology in the oral cavity, as well as the toxicity and efficacy of these candidate microparticles for future applications.",

We show that the particles bearing the saccharides selectively inhibited tumor cell growth of the Gal-3 positive cells significantly more than the Gal-3 negative cells. In addition, the threonine-attached TF particles were more potent than the serine-attached constructs. These results support the use of AuNP as antitumor therapeutic platforms, targeted against cell lines that express specific lectins that interact with TFag.",

Here, we show identification of its positively charged cluster involved in alginate binding using X-ray crystallography, docking simulation, and site-directed mutagenesis. The tertiary structure of Algp7 was determined at a high resolution (1.99\u00a0\u00c5) by molecular replacement, although no alginates were included in the structure. Thus, an in silico model of Algp7/oligoalginate was constructed by docking simulation using atomic coordinates of Algp7 and alginate oligosaccharides, where some charged residues were found to be potential candidates for alginate binding. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted and five purified mutants K68A, K69A, E194A, N221A, and K68A/K69A were subjected to a binding assay. UV absorption difference spectroscopy along with differential scanning fluorimetry analysis indicated that K68A/K69A exhibited a significant reduction in binding affinity with alginate than wild-type Algp7. Based on these data, Lys68/Lys69 residues of Algp7 probably play an important role in binding alginate.",

For this purpose, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of p-nitrophenyl-d-glucopyranoside were used as glycosyl acceptors, Bacillus macerans and Thermoanaerobacter sp.

Labeling of oligosaccharides with 3-aminoquinoline (3-AQ) improved MS-ionization efficiency of the oligosaccharides and reduced the complexity of the product ion mass spectra, without losing resolution of the HILIC separation.

Besides the intrinsic attraction of oxygen centred negative dipoles towards the developing electron deficiency at the anomeric carbon only a few suggestions have been given in the literature. By studying the effect on Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelled glycosylation reactions on the presence of polar additives as tested with acetonitrile two possible effects have been identified. One was noted in a previous publication (Carbohydr. Res. 2012, 356, 180\u2013190) and two further examples discovered here that suggest that a lone pair of a nucleophile approaching a donor with a \u03b2-leaving group from the \u03b1-face can act as the antiperiplanar lone pair that assists leaving group departure. This interaction starts at just under a nucleophile C-1 separation of 3\u00a0\u00c5 and has an incipient bond angle of O-5-C-1-Nuc(O or N) of very close to 90\u00b0 which can be at C-1 with the p-type orbital at C-1\u2013O-5 of the incipient oxacarbenium ion, that is, the LUMO of the activated donor. The 2nd interaction is less well studied and is suggested to be a similar bonding interaction which moves \u03b2-face nucleophiles to O-Nuc-C-1-leaving groups angles close to 180\u00b0.",

Mechanistic studies involving the isolation of departed aglycones were indicative of the direct activation of both p-methoxy-SNea and p-nitro-SNea leaving groups via the anomeric sulfur rather than the remote nitrogen atom. The presence of an electron donating substituent (p-methoxy) has a strong effect on the nucleophilicity of the sulfur atom that becomes more susceptible toward the attack of thiophilic reagents, in particular. This key observation allowed to differentiate the reactivity levels of p-methoxy-SNea versus p-nitro-SNea and even unmodified SNea leaving groups.

Michael addition of acrylate trisaccharides to peptide thiol under mildly basic conditions gave a mixture of N- and C- terminal glyco-peptide thioethers. An adaptation of this strategy coordinated S-acyl protection with anticipated thioester exchange equilibria. This furnished a single chemically defined fully synthetic neoglycopeptide conjugate that could be anchored to a tetanus toxoid carrier and avoids the introduction of exogenous antigenic groups. The second strategy retained the N-terminal thiopropionyl residue but replaced the C-terminal S-acetate functionality with an azido group that allowed efficient, selective formation of neoglycopeptide thioethers and subsequent conjugation of these with propargylated tetanus toxoid, but introduced potentially antigenic triazole linkages.",

The O-specific chain of the O-deacylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OH) consists of branched tetrasaccharide\u2013glycerol repeating units joined by phosphodiester linkages. The lipid-free polysaccharide contains 0.8\u00a0equiv of O-acetyl groups per repeating unit and has the following teichoic acid-like structure: Based on biosynthetic aspects, this should also be the biological repeating unit. This O-antigen structure is remarkably similar to that of E. coli O28ac, differing only in the presence or absence, respectively, of a glucose residue at the branching point. The structural similarity explains the serological cross-reactivity observed between strains of these two serogroups, and also their almost identical O-antigen gene cluster sequences.

Acetic anhydride was then further used as a reagent in the synthesis of diacetyl mixed anhydride of AGA. Polymerizations were conducted as bulk condensation polymerization at 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Thermal properties of the copolymers varied depending on monomer composition. Increase in the AGA content had a clear increasing effect on the Tg. A similar increasing effect was observed in Tm. The degree of crystallinity decreased as AGA content increased. There was a slightly lowering tendency in the molecular weights of the obtained polymers when the AGA content in the polymerization mixtures increased.

MvNeuB is less stable at higher temperature and has a high catalytic activity at lower temperature compared to mesophilic counterparts. Enzymes from psychrophilic organisms are generally cold adapted meaning they can maintain adequate function near the freezing point of water. Cold adapted enzymes are catalytically more efficient at lower temperature and are more thermo-labile compared to their mesophilic counterparts.

     "abstract": "C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) is a newly identified receptor expressed on the platelet surface. It has been reported that CLEC-2 exists as a higher molecular weight (HMW) and a lower molecular weight (LMW) form, which share the same protein core but differ in glycans. The two forms appear to have different ligand-binding abilities, indicating that the differential glycosylation of CLEC-2 possibly produces functionally distinct glycoforms. This study aimed to explore an easy method to directly elucidate the N-glycosylation difference by employing a glycoproteomics approach. The off-line coupling of nano-LC with a MALDI-QIT-TOF mass spectrometer was demonstrated to be capable of sensitive and direct elucidation of the glycosylation difference between HMW and LMW CLEC-2, simultaneously providing information about their oligosaccharide structures and the glycosylation sites. The results reveal that a specific glycosylation site, Asn 134, is differently glycosylated in the two forms, with complex types of bi-antennary, tri-antennary and tetra-antennary, N-linked, fucosylated glycans identified at this site in the HMW form but not in the LMW form. The observed difference in glycosylation might provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of biological functions of CLEC-2. Because of its simplicity and sensitivity, the method explored in this work suggests that it holds promise as a method of elucidating differences in direct N-glycosylation of target glycoprotein, even in small amount of samples.",

In addition to branching and original acetylation, the only other difference between these two \u03b2-1,4-linked glycans is the configuration at C-2 in approximately 80% of the sugar residues. In contrast to glucose, the 2-OH in mannose has an axial orientation. The influence of this stereochemistry on the relative reactivities of glucosyl compared to mannosyl units in methylation reactions are studied in this work.Glucomannan isolated from spruce (SGM) and commercially available konjac glucomannan (KGM) was methylated in DMSO/Li-dimsyl/MeI and water/NaOH/MeI system, respectively. In the early stage of the reaction, the glucose part of the SGM achieved slightly higher DS values than the mannose residues, but the overall relative rate constants were close to 1:1. The order of reactivities in glucose was k2\u00a0>\u00a0k3\u00a0>\u00a0k6 and k3\u00a0>\u00a0k2\u00a0>\u00a0k6 for mannose (in DMSO/Li-dimsyl/MeI). The rate constants did not remain constant, but k3 decreased when k2 increased for both epimeric sugars. In water/NaOH/MeI, the methylation of the primary 6-OH was much more pronounced with an order of reactivity of O-6\u00a0>\u00a0O-2\u00a0>\u00a0O-3 for mannose and O-2\u00a0>\u00a0O-6\u00a0>\u00a0O-3 for glucose.

However, they are hard to be detected because of their low concentration and the limited availability of antibodies and lectins that recognize them. Thus, mass spectrometry is an effective method to analyze GSLs with high sensitivity. Here, we use electrospray ionization-linear ion trap quadrupole mass spectrometry (ESI-LTQ-MS) and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS/MS) to determine the structure of a certain GSL in human breast cancer tissue. To obtain the breast cancer-associated GSLs, we applied relative abundance contrast of GSLs and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analyses. We also used \u03b11,2 fucosidase and fucosyltransferases as tools in the structural analysis. Based on this analysis, we identified the ion with m/z 1184 molecular ion as fucosyl-lactoceramide (Fuc-LacCer) with a C16 fatty acid ceramide. Quantitative analysis of GSLs revealed both Fuc-LacCer and Globo-H increased in breast cancer tissues. However, these two breast cancer-associated GSLs had different roles. The results of SNR analysis suggested the abnormal Fuc-LacCer is specific to breast cancer. The GSL profiling of breast cancer cells showed fucosyltransferase 1 contributed to the biosynthesis of Globo-H and Fuc-LacCer. In conclusion, MS analysis identified an accumulation of Fuc-LacCer in breast cancer tissue. Our findings provide GSL profiles of human breast cancer and develop an MS method for the study of cancer-associated GSLs.",

     "abstract": "Carbohydrate dynamics plays a vital role in many biological processes, but we are not currently able to probe this with experimental approaches. The highly flexible nature of carbohydrate structures differs in many aspects from other biomolecules, posing significant challenges for studies employing computational simulation. Over past decades, computational study of carbohydrates has been focused on the development of structure prediction methods, force field optimization, molecular dynamics simulation, and scoring functions for carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions. Advances in carbohydrate force fields and scoring functions can be largely attributed to enhanced computational algorithms, application of quantum mechanics, and the increasing number of experimental structures determined by X-ray and NMR techniques. The conformational analysis of carbohydrates is challengeable and has gone into intensive study in elucidating the anomeric, the exo-anomeric, and the gauche effects. Here, we review the issues associated with carbohydrate force fields and scoring functions, which will have a broad application in the field of carbohydrate-based drug design.",

To achieve this goal, a two-step, high-throughput digital imaging protocol involving a colorimetric substrate was used to screen a library of 30,000 mutants. In the first step this screen selected for hydrolytically-impaired mutants, and in the second step the screen identified mutants whose global activity was improved in the presence of a xylo-oligosaccharide mixture. Thereby, 199 mutants displaying lowered hydrolytic activity and modified properties were detected. In the presence of these xylo-oligosaccharides, most of the 199 (i.e., 70%) enzymes were less inhibited and some (18) mutants displayed an unambiguous alleviation of inhibition (<25% loss of activity). More precise monitoring of reactions catalyzed by the most promising mutants revealed a significant improvement of the synthesis yields of transglycosylation products (up to 18% compared to 9% for the parental enzyme) when xylobiose was present in the reaction. Genetic analysis of improved mutants revealed that many of the amino acid substitutions that correlate with the modified phenotype are located in the vicinity of the active site, particularly in subsite \u22121. Consequently, we hypothesize that these mutations modify the active site topology or the molecular interaction network of the l-arabinofuranoside donor substrate, thus impairing the hydrolysis and concomitantly favoring transglycosylation onto natural acceptors.",

Structurally, heparan sulfate consists of repeating linear sulfated poly-anionic disaccharide structures. The K5 polysaccharide has the same structure as heparosan, and is the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K5 strain which serves as a precursor in heparin and heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Here, we prepared sulfated K5 polysaccharides that are structurally similar to heparan sulfate and investigated their biocompatibility and bioactivity in stem cell chondrogenic differentiation. Briefly, sulfation groups were added to \u2013NH\u2013 and/or \u2013OH of a precursor heparosan and the modified heparosan was qualitatively analyzed by FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR techniques. Cell viability was not significantly affected by the sulfated K5 capsular polysaccharide. Relative mRNA expression of the chondrogenic differentiation marker COL2A1 was significantly upregulated in cells treated with the N,O-sulfated K5 polysaccharide confirming that the sulfated K5 capsular polysaccharide is able to stimulate chondrogenic differentiation. The main sulfation pattern for chondrogenic activity is N,6-O sulfation and the activity was not proportional to the sulfation level. This type of mimic was prepared in nearly a gram scale, supporting further structural study and 3 dimension stem cell culture. Together, the results of this study show that sulfated K5 capsular polysaccharides are able to stimulate chondrogenic differentiation without affecting cell viability.",

     "abstract": "There is a growing interest on glycol-split low-molecular weight heparins (gs-LMWHs), obtained by periodate oxidation of LMWHs, optionally followed by borohydride reduction, as potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. However, their structural characterization is still a challenging task, mainly because of the high microheterogeneity of the starting material. In addition, susceptibility to oxidation of some end-groups of LMWHs induces additional heterogeneity, making analysis of gs-LMWHs more complex. In our previous study we showed that 1,6-anhydro-d-mannosamine N-sulfate was affected by periodate, while its epimer 1,6-anhydro-d-glucosamine N-sulfate was resistant. In order to understand the apparently anomalous behavior of terminal 1,6-anhydro-d-mannosamine N-sulfate residues, in the present work we have studied by NMR spectroscopy and LC/MS the behavior of the reducing end amino sugar residues of the tetrasaccharides, isolated from the LMWH enoxaparin, in the presence of periodate. Their molecular mechanics conformational characterization has been also performed. We have shown that the C(2)\u2013C(3) bond of the 1,6-anhydro-d-mannosamine residue can be split by periodate despite the N-substitution. Moreover, we have found that both terminal d-mannosamine N-sulfate and d-glucosamine N-sulfate, lacking the 1,6-anhydro-bridge, can be also oxidized by periodate but with a significantly lower rate. The present results suggest that the cis-e-/a-position of OH and NHSO3\u2212 groups of N-sulfated 1,6-anhydro-d-mannosamine is not the only factor that makes these end residues susceptible to the oxidation. The 1,6-anhydro-bridge that \u2018blocks\u2019 the ring conformation appears another crucial factor for oxidation to occur. Moreover, we have shown that controlling the reaction time could permit to selectively split non-sulfated iduronic acids of enoxaparin chains without oxidizing terminal amino sugar residues, a finding that may be useful to obtain more structurally homogeneous gs-LMHWs.",

Unfortunately, the very low water solubility of ABZ (0.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121, 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM) impairs considerably its formulation. Phase solubility diagrams showed that \u03b1-cyclodextrin (10% w/w), hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (40% w/w) and sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (40% w/w) allowed an increase of apparent solubility with enhancement factors of 570, 3970, and 5880, respectively. The apparent aqueous solubility of ABZ was markedly increased from 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121 (0.7\u00a0\u03bcM) without cyclodextrins to 1.52\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121 (5.69\u00a0mM) with random methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (Me-\u03b2-CD) (40% w/w). This corresponds to an apparent solubility enhancement factor of 7600 which is the maximal enhancement factor of ABZ apparent aqueous solubility ever reported in the literature using conventional cyclodextrins. The complexation mechanism between ABZ and cyclodextrins has been investigated using phase solubility diagrams, nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) coupled with two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOESY) experiments and molecular docking calculations.

We then have paid attention to an amidine group to provide the agglomeration\u2013nanofibrillation behavior of chitin derivatives. An amidinated chitin was synthesized by the reaction of the amino groups in a partially deacetylated chitin with N,N-dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal, which was subjected to CO2 gas bubbling and ultrasonic treatments in water to convert into an amidinium chitin by protonation. The SEM images of the product clearly showed nanofiber network morphology. We further examined re-nanofibrillation of the agglomerated material, which was obtained by mixing the nanofibrillated amidinium chitin with water, followed by drying under reduced pressure. Consequently, the material was re-nanofibrillated by N2 gas bubbling with ultrasonication in water owing to electrostatic repulsion between the amidinium groups. Furthermore, deprotonation of the amidinium chitin and re-protonation of the resulting amidinated chitin were conducted by alkaline treatment and CO2 gas bubbling\u2013ultrasonic treatments, respectively. The material showed the agglomeration\u2013nanofibrillation behavior during the processes.",

These gemini surfactants showed low cytotoxicity by MTT assay on HeLa cell line. The DNA binding capabilities of these surfactants were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, fluorescence titration, and DLS experiments. The preliminary studies by agarose gel electrophoresis indicated chain length dependent DNA binding abilities, further supported by ethidium bromide exclusion experiments. Two of the d-glucose derived gemini surfactants showed effective binding with pET-28a plasmid DNA (pDNA) at relatively low N/P ratio (i.e., cationic nitrogen/DNA phosphate molar ratio).",

These two hexasaccharides differ only in their terminal saccharide: N-acetylneuraminic acid in SSEA-4 and l-fucose in Globo H. Herein, we evaluated the affinity of the monoclonal antibodies \u03b1-SSEA-4 and \u03b1-GH for the glycans SSEA-4 and Globo H. Using fluorescence polarization, we find that the two monoclonal antibodies have affinity for their cognate glycan in the low nanomolar range, and have negligible affinity for the non-cognate glycan. Using surface plasmon resonance, we find that each cognate affinity is \u223c20-fold greater if the glycan is immobilized on a surface rather than free in solution. We conclude that the terminal saccharide plays a dominant role in the ability of monoclonal antibodies to recognize these Globo-series glycans and that the extraordinary specificity of these antibodies supports their use for identifying and sorting stem-cells (\u03b1-SSEA-4) and as an agent in cancer immunotherapy (\u03b1-GH).",

Our new procedure simplified the extraction process by treating the egg yolk powder with 40% acetone, avoiding massive emulsification, high-speed centrifugation, and sophisticated chromatography in reported methods. Subsequent semi-synthesis of the N-glycan core Man3GlcNAc oxazoline from SGP was accomplished for the first-time via glyco-trimming and successive oxazoline formation. This efficient semi-synthesis provides an alternative to the pure chemical approach that involves multi-step total synthesis and facilitates the application of endo-glycosidase-enabled chemoenzymatic synthesis of various homogeneous glycoconjugates.",

Genetic studies have demonstrated that CPSA biosynthesis is dependent primarily on a single gene cluster within the B. fragilis genome. However, the precise functions of the individual glycosyltransferases encoded by this cluster have not been identified. In this report each of these glycosyltransferases (WcfQ, WcfP, and WcfN) have been expressed and tested for their function in vitro. Using a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, WcfQ and WcfP were found to transfer galactose from uridine diphosphate (UDP)-linked galactose (Gal) to N-acetyl-4-amino-6-deoxy-galactosamine (AADGal) linked to a fluorescent mimic of bactoprenyl diphosphate, the native isoprenoid anchor for bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis. The incorporation of galactose to form a bactoprenyl-linked disaccharide was confirmed by radiolabel incorporation and mass spectrometry (MS) of purified product. Using varying concentrations of UDP-Gal and enzyme, WcfQ was found to be the most effective protein at transferring galactose, and is the most likely candidate for in vivo incorporation of the sugar. WcfQ also cooperated in the presence of three preceding biosynthetic enzymes to form an isoprenoid-linked disaccharide in a single-pot reaction. This work represents a critical step in understanding the biosynthetic pathway responsible for the formation of CPSA, an unusual and potentially therapeutic biopolymer.",

The high sweetness of glycyrrhizic acid can be closely correlated with this aggregation, because the multimers of glycyrrhizic acid can simultaneously bind to the sweet taste receptors on the human tongue. The isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that \u03b3-cyclodextrin binds to glycyrrhizic acid more strongly than \u03b2-cyclodextrin, however, both reactions are accompanied by a favorable change in binding entropy. Considering the large negative change in heat capacity that is observed during the binding of \u03b3-cyclodextrin, the main driving force for the binding is hydrophobic interactions with dehydration, which is typical for inclusion complex. NMR experiments showed that \u03b3-cyclodextrin interacts with the central part of the aglycone moiety, not the glucuronic acid moieties, resulting in high binding affinity. It should also be noted that the two distinct complexes of glycyrrhizic acid with \u03b3-cyclodextrin would exist in aqueous solution.",

     "abstract": "Chitosan oligosaccharides have diverse biological activities with potentially valuable applications, for example, in the fields of medicine and agriculture. These functionalities are thought to depend on their degree of polymerization and acetylation, and possibly on specific patterns of acetylation. Chitosan oligomers with fully defined architecture are difficult to produce, and their complete analysis is demanding. Analysis is typically done using MS or NMR, requiring access to expensive infrastructure, and yielding unequivocal results only in the case of rather small oligomers. We here describe a simple and cost-efficient method for the sequencing of \u03bcg amounts of chitosan oligosaccharides which is based on the sequential action of two recombinant glycosidases, namely an exo-\u03b2-N-acetylhexosaminidase (GlcNAcase) from Bacillus subtilis 168 and an exo-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (GlcNase) from Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1. Starting from the non-reducing end, GlcNAcase and GlcNase specifically remove N-acetyl glucosamine (A) and glucosamine (D) units, respectively. By the sequential addition and removal of these enzymes in an alternating way followed by analysis of the products using high-performance thin-layer chromatography, the sequence of chitosan oligosaccharides can be revealed. Importantly, both enzymes work under identical conditions so that no buffer exchange is required between steps, and the enzyme can be removed conveniently using simple ultra-filtration devices. As proof-of-principle, the method was used to sequence the product of enzymatic deacetylation of chitin pentamer using a recombinant chitin deacetylase from Vibrio cholerae which specifically removes the acetyl group from the second unit next to the non-reducing end of the substrate, yielding mono-deacetylated pentamer with the sequence ADAAA.",

Furthermore, chitosan solutions at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4\u00a0mg/mL markedly inhibited bacterial biofilm formation compared to the control, and the inhibitory effect increased with the increase of chitosan concentration.

It was shown that the SPG/dA60 complex made form phosphodiester was recognized in the same manner as SPG, while its dissociation constant (Kd) was much larger than SPG itself, that is, less affinity than SPG. When the phosphodiester linkage of dA60 was changed to phosphorothioate (denoted by dA60(S)), the QCM frequency decrease was dramatically enhanced. There seemed to be multiple binding sites; the same site as SPG and SPG/dA60, and an additional site (or sites) for which phosphate anion specific electrostatic interactions were mainly involved.

     "abstract": "Hsp90 (Heat shock protein-90) is a chaperone protein and an established anti-apoptotic target in cancer therapy. Most of the known small-molecule inhibitors that have shown potent antitumor activity target the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and directly inhibit its ATP-ase activity. Many of these molecules display important secondary effects. A different approach to Hsp90 inhibition consists of targeting the protein C-terminal domain (CTD) and modulating its chaperone activity through allosteric effects. Using an original computational approach, allosteric hot-spots in the CTD have been recently identified that control interdomain communication. A combination of virtual and experimental screening enabled identification of a rhamnosylated benzofuran (Eupomatenoid-2) as a lead for further development. In this paper we describe glycodiversification of Eupomatenoid-2 using chemical glycosylation of the 2-(4\u2032-hydroxyphenyl)benzofuran aglycon (a.k.a. Eupomatenoid-6). Glycosylation of the phenol by glycosyl bromides under basic conditions afforded the desired products in the gluco-, galacto-, and fuco-series. This approach failed in the manno- and rhamno-series. However, mannosylation and rhamnosylation of Eupomatenoid-6 could be obtained under carefully controlled acidic conditions, using O-benzoxazolyl imidate (OBox) donors. The glycosides obtained are currently under investigation as modulators of Hsp90 chaperone activity.",

Glycosylation at position O-4\u2032 of a propargyl cellobioside glycosyl acceptor and position O-6\u2032 of a propargyl lactoside glycosyl acceptor with a 6-deoxy-6-thio galactosyl donor gave rise to two unique trisaccharides that in turn underwent copper-catalyzed azide\u2013alkyne cycloadditions with either 1-azidododecane or 1-azidooctadecane. The potential for each of these analogues to function as tethers of lipid bilayers to Au(1\u00a01\u00a01) surface was assessed by differential capacitance experiments.

Although widespread infant immunisation with the PCV7 seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has led to a dramatic decrease in IPD, infections due to non-vaccine serotypes, particularly serotype 19A, have increased. As the 19F polysaccharide differs from 19A at a single linkage position, it was assumed that PCV7 (containing 19F) would cross-protect against 19A disease. However, vaccination with PCV7 results in only 26% effectiveness against IPD caused by 19A. We explored the conformations and dynamics of the polysaccharide repeating units from serotypes 19F and 19A, comparing free energy surfaces for glycosidic linkages with 100\u00a0ns aqueous molecular dynamics simulations of the di- and trisaccharide components. All calculations were performed with both the CHARMM and the GLYCAM carbohydrate force fields to establish whether the choice of model affects the predicted molecular behaviour. Although we identified key differences between the force fields, overall they were in agreement in predicting a 19F repeating unit with a wider range of conformation families than the more restricted 19A trisaccharide. This suggests a probable conformational difference between the 19F and 19A polysaccharides, which may explain the low cross-protection of 19F vaccines against 19A disease.",

The key peculiarities were its high 3-O-sulfated glucosamine content compared to mammalian heparins; a residue which is usually associated with the antithrombin (AT) binding site, and the location of these residues within 2-O-sulfated iduronate and glucuronate-containing sequences (I2S\u2013A\u2217\u2013G), a situation not found in mammalian heparin.

A high affinity fraction, eluting at a similar salt concentration (0.75\u20131.5\u00a0M NaCl) from an antithrombin affinity column, to the high affinity fraction of heparin, also showed only weak thermal stabilization of AT (+\u223c2\u00a0\u00b0C).

Several pathways to such building blocks have been investigated, addressing the problem of constructing a \u03b2-linked glucuronic acid residue protected with groups that are orthogonal to a primary acetyl group. Two efficient routes have been developed, one using benzoylated glucosyl donors to form the \u03b2-linkage followed by a change of protecting groups to benzyls and subsequent introduction of the carboxyl function and the acetyl group.

In previous reports, we created a quadruple mutant of the endoglucanase Cel8A from Clostridium thermocellum resulting from a combination of both random error-prone PCR and a bioinformatics-based consensus mutagenesis approach. The quadruple mutant exhibited an increased half-life of activity by 14-fold at 85\u00a0\u00b0C with no apparent loss of catalytic activity compared to the wild-type form. Connection of the wild-type enzyme to its respective cohesin partner conferred increased thermostability, but no increase was observed for the cohesin-complexed mutant enzyme. The mutant and the wild-type enzymes were integrated into divalent chimeric scaffoldins with a family 48 exoglucanase partner, and the cellulose-degradation activities of resultant designer cellulosomes were examined. Despite the heightened thermostability of the mutant as a free enzyme, its substitution for the wild-type endoglucanase within the cellulosome context failed to exhibit an improvement in overall degradation of cellulose.",

The screening of a nucleophile saturation library of this enzyme yielded the unexpected E134D mutant which has high glycosynthase efficiency (25% higher kcat than the best glycosynthase to date, E134S) but also retains some hydrolase activity (2% relative to the wild-type enzyme). Here, we report the biochemical and structural analyses of this mutant compared to E134S and wild-type enzymes. E134D shows a pH profile of general base catalysis for the glycosynthase activity, with a kinetic pKa (on kcat/KM) assigned to Glu138 of 5.8, whereas the same residue acts as a general acid in the hydrolase activity with the same pKa value. The pKa of Glu138 in the wt enzyme was 7.0, a high value due to the presence of the catalytic nucleophile Glu134 which destabilizes the conjugate base of Glu138. Thus, the pKa of Glu138 drops 1.1 pH units in the mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme meaning that the larger distance between carboxylates in positions 138 and 134 (5.6\u00a0\u00c5 for wt, 7.0\u00a0\u00c5 for E134D) and/or a new hydrogen bonding interaction with a third Asp residue (Asp136) in the mutant reduces the effect of the negatively charged Asp134. In consequence, the pKa of Glu138 has a similar pKa value in the E134D mutant than in the other glycosynthase mutants having a neutral residue in position 134. The behavior of the E134D mutant shows that shortening the side chain of the nucleophile, despite maintaining a carboxylate group, confers glycosynthase activity. Therefore E134D is a transitional hydrolase to glycosynthase mutation.",

     "abstract": "Glycans at the forefront of cells facilitate immune recognition processes. Cancer cells commonly present altered cell surface glycosylation, especially manifested in the expression of sialic acid at the termini of glycolipids and glycoproteins. Although tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) result in expression of altered-self, most such carbohydrates do not elicit strong humoral responses. Various strategies had been devised to elicit increased immunogenicity of such TACA aiming for potent immunotherapeutic antibodies or cancer vaccines. However some carbohydrates are immunogenic in humans and hold potential for novel glycotherapies. N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a foreign immunogenic sugar in humans originating from the diet (e.g., red meat) and subsequently expressed on the cell surface, especially accumulating on carcinoma. Consequently, the human immune system detects this non-self carbohydrate generating a broad anti-Neu5Gc antibody response. The co-existence of Neu5Gc/anti-Neu5Gc within humans spurs chronic inflammation mediated disease, including cancer. Concurrently, anti-Neu5Gc antibodies hold potential for novel targeted therapy. \u03b1Gal is another foreign immunogenic carbohydrate antigen in humans and all humans have circulating anti-Gal antibodies. This review aims to describe the immunogenicity of Neu5Gc and its implications for human diseases, highlighting differences and similarities with \u03b1Gal and its potential for novel targeted theranostics.",

While C. jejuni is pathogenic in humans, it is a commensal in avian hosts. Bacterial cell surface carbohydrates are important virulence factors and play roles in adherence, colonisation and infection. The mechanisms leading to infection or persistent colonisation of C. jejuni are not well understood but host temperature may provide an important stimulus for specific adaptation. Thus, examination of the modulation of the total surface glycome of C. jejuni in response to temperature may help shed light on commensal and pathogenic mechanisms for this species. C. jejuni strains 81116 and 81-176 were cultured at 37 and 42\u00a0\u00b0C to simulate human and avian host conditions, respectively, and whole cells were profiled on lectin microarrays constructed to include a wide range of binding specificities. C. jejuni 81116 profiles indicated that the previously characterised lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-like molecule and N-linked glycans were the predominantly recognised cell surface structures while capsular polysaccharide (CPS), lipooligosaccharides (LOS) and N-linked glycosylation were best recognised for strain 81-176 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The profiles of both strains varied and were distinguishable at both temperatures. At the higher temperature, reduced dominance of the LPS-like structure was associated with strain 81116 and a change in the relative distribution of CPS and LOS structures was indicated for strain 81-176. This change in LOS molecular mass species distribution between temperatures was confirmed by SDS\u2013PAGE analysis. Additionally, opposite behaviour of certain lectins was noted between the plate agglutination assay and the microarray platform. Insights into the important glycosylation involved in C. jejuni host cell tropism at different growth temperatures were gained using the lectin microarray platform.",

     "abstract": "Proper understanding of the mechanisms of binding to Gram-positive bacteria cell wall layers\u2014especially to the peptidoglycan (PG) layer, seems to be crucial for proper development of new drug candidates which are effective against these bacteria.In this work we have constructed two different models of the Gram-positive bacteria PG layer: the layered and the scaffold models. PG conformational changes during geometry optimization, models relaxation, and molecular dynamics were described and discussed. We have found that the border surface of both PG layer models differs from the surface located away from the edge of models and the chains formed by disaccharide units prefer helix-like conformation. This curling of PG chains significantly affects the shape of antibiotic-accessible surface and the process is thus crucial for new drug development.Glycopeptide antibiotics effective against Gram-positive bacteria, such as vancomycin and its semisynthetic derivatives\u2014oritavancin and telavancin, bind to d-alanyl-d-alanine stem termini on the peptidoglycan precursors of the cell wall. This binding inhibits cross-linking between the peptides and subsequently prevents cell wall synthesis.In this study some of the aspects of conformational freedom of vancomycin and restrictions from the modifications of vancomycin structure introduced into oritavancin and telavancin and five other vancomycin derivatives (with addition of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-galactopyranosylamine, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosylamine, 1-amine-1-deoxy-d-glucitol, 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-galactitol, or 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucitol to the C-terminal amino acid group in the vancomycin) are presented and discussed. The resulting molecular dynamics trajectories, root mean square deviation changes of aglycon and saccharide moieties as well as a comparative study of possible interactions with cyclic and chain forms of modified groups have been carried out, measured, and analyzed. Energetically advantageous conformations show close similarity to the structures known from the experimental data, but the diversity of others suggest very high conformational freedom of all modeled antibiotics and vancomycin derivatives. Alditol derivatives move closer to the peptidoglycan chain more easily but they also form intramolecular interactions more frequently than their homologous cyclic forms. One of the proposed derivatives seems to be a promising agent which is efficient in treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are aquatic and photosynthetic microorganisms, which contribute up to 30% of the yearly oxygen production on the earth. They have the distinction of being the oldest known fossils, more than 3.5 billion years old, and are one of the largest and most important groups of bacteria on earth. Cyanobacteria are an emerging source of potentially pharmacologically active products and, among these, there are the lipopolysaccharides. Despite their significant and well documented activity, very little is known about the cyanobacteria lipopolysaccharides (LPS) structure. The aim of this work is to investigate the structure of the highly TLR4-antagonist lipopolysaccharide from the cyanobacterium Oscillatoria plankthotrix FP1.The LPS was purified and analysed by means of chemical analysis and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The LPS was then degraded by Smith degradation, HF and acetic acid hydrolyses. All the obtained products were investigated in detail by chemical analysis, NMR spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry. The LPS consists of a high molecular mass and very complex molecule lacking Kdo and heptose residues, where the polysaccharide chain is mainly constituted by a backbone of 3-substituted \u03b1-l-rhamnose units. The core region is rich in galacturonic acid and mannose residues.Moreover a glycolipid portion, similar to Gram-negative lipid A, was identified. This was built up of a non phosphorylated (1\u2032\u21926) linked glucosamine disaccharide, acylated with 3-hydroxylated fatty acids. In particular 3-hydroxypentadecanoic and 3-hydroxyesadecanoic acids were found, together with esadecanoic and tetradecanoic ones. Finally the presence of a galacturonic acid residue at 6-position of the distal glucosamine in place of the Kdo residue is suggested.",

Three monosaccharides, mannose, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), were added separately to the serine side-chain of a hamster prion peptide because it is a sensitive model for comparing the effect of protein modification on the conformational properties of the polypeptide chain. In buffer, this prion peptide goes through a gradual coil-to-\u03b2 structural conversion and forms amyloid fibrils slowly during incubation. Our results showed that a sugar with an N-acetyl amino group in the equatorial configuration (GalNAc) or with a hydroxyl group in the axial configuration (mannose) on C2 had a greater inhibitory effect on the amyloidogenesis of the prion peptide than a sugar with the hydroxyl group in the equatorial configuration (galactose). We suggest that galactosylation has less effect than mannosylation or GalNAc glycosylation on promoting turn formation at the glycosylation site and on inhibition of amyloidogenesis. The anti-amyloidogenic property of mannose implies that protein mannosylation has an anti-aggregation function.",

     "abstract": "The burden of unsafe drinking water is responsible for millions of deaths each year. To relieve this burden, we are in search of an inexpensive material that can adsorb pathogens from drinking water. In this pursuit, we have studied the natural carbohydrate, chitosan. To impart virus removal features, chitosan has been functionalized with a quaternary amine to form quaternized chitosan N-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC). HTCC can be electrospun into nanofibers with the non-ionogenic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), creating a high surface area mat. High surface area is a major requirement for effective adsorption processes. HTCC is antiviral and antimicrobial, making it a good material for water purification. However, HTCC dissolves in water. We have explored the parameters to crosslink the nanofibers with glutaraldehyde. We have imparted water stability so there is a maximum of 30% swelling of the fibers after 6\u00a0h in water. The water stable fibers retain their ability to adsorb virus, as shown for an enveloped and nonenveloped virus. HTCC now has the potential to be incorporated into a microfiltration membrane that can remove viruses. This could create an inexpensive, low pressure filtration membrane for drinking water purification.",

Truncation and fusion resulted in an increase in fTDSR-S biosynthesis in E. coli BL21 (DE3) by 35 fold. fTDSR-S leads to production of dextran as well as increased acceptor reactions. Due to GST fusion, it was possible to immobilize fTDSR-S covalently onto Eupergit C successfully.

Phosphorylated chitosan has attracted interests in recent years. The literature has reported that the phosphorylation of chitosan could be achieved through three different reaction routes, namely, in the presence of H3PO4/urea, H3PO4/Et3PO4/P2O5, or P2O5/CH3SO3H. However, the exact chemical structure of phosphorylated chitosan synthesized by different reaction routes has not been systematically studied and compared. Meanwhile, the most common opinion is that the hydroxyl group in chitosan is the main substitution site. In this work, phosphorylated chitosan was synthesized using three different reaction routes, and the chemical structures of the products were studied by infrared, X-ray photoelectron and 13C NMR spectroscopic characterization. It was observed that in the reaction routes using H3PO4/urea and H3PO4/Et3PO4/P2O5, the amino groups were substituted instead of the hydroxyl groups. In the reaction route using P2O5/CH3SO3H, the amino groups were shielded by the ionic binding with CH3SO3H, and the C-6 hydroxyl groups were phosphorylated. Different structures of the phosphorylated chitosan were proposed based on the characterization results.",

A previous study of grass AXs (switchgrass, rice, Brachypodium, Miscanthus and foxtail millet) concluded that grasses lacked the comparable RE glycosyl sequence (4-\u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21923)-\u03b1-l-Rhap-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-d-GalpA-(1\u21924)-d-Xylp) found in dicots and gymnosperms but the actual RE sequence was not determined.Here we report the isolation and structural characterisation of the RE oligosaccharide sequence(s) of wheat endosperm cell wall AXs. Walls were isolated as an alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) and sequentially extracted with hot water (W-sol Fr) and 1\u00a0M KOH containing 1% NaBH4 (KOH-sol Fr). Detailed structural analysis of the RE oligosaccharides was performed using a combination of methylation analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS, ESI-QTOF-MS, ESI-MSn and enzymic analysis. Analysis of RE oligosaccharides, both 2AB labelled (from W-sol Fr) and glycosyl-alditol (from KOH-sol Fr), revealed that the RE glycosyl sequence of wheat endosperm AX comprises a linear (1\u21924)-\u03b2-d-Xylp backbone which may be mono-substituted with either an \u03b1-l-Araf residue at the reducing end \u03b2-d-Xylp residue and/or penultimate RE \u03b2-d-Xyl residue; \u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21924)-[\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u21923)](+/\u2212)-\u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21924)-[\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u21923)](+/\u2212)-\u03b2-d-Xylp and/or an \u03b1-d-GlcpA residue at the reducing end \u03b2-d-Xylp residue; \u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21924)-[\u03b1-l-Araf-(1\u21923)](+/\u2212)-\u03b2-d-Xylp-(1\u21924)-[\u03b1-d-GlcAp-(1\u21922)]-\u03b2-d-Xylp. Thus, wheat endosperm AX backbones lacks the RE sequence found in dicot and gymnosperm xylans; a finding consistent with previous reports from other grass species.",

Four oxidative systems involving H2O2, EDTA, iron chloride, and UV light were studied and the products obtained were analyzed by LC\u2013MS and NMR, before and after a derivatization reaction.

Analysis of the reaction indicated an apparent radical mechanism and heterolytic alpha-hydroxy-hydroperoxide cleavages.

     "abstract": "The degradation compounds formed during pretreatment when lignocellulosic biomass is processed to ethanol or other biorefinery products include furans, phenolics, organic acids, as well as mono- and oligomeric pentoses and hexoses. Depending on the reaction conditions glucose can be converted to 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF) and/or levulinic acid, formic acid and different phenolics at elevated temperatures. Correspondingly, xylose can follow different reaction mechanisms resulting in the formation of furan-2-carbaldehyde (furfural) and/or various C-1 and C-4 compounds. At least four routes for the formation of HMF from glucose and three routes for furfural formation from xylose are possible. In addition, new findings show that biomass monosaccharides themselves can react further to form pseudo-lignin and humins as well as a wide array of other compounds when exposed to high temperatures. Hence, several aldehydes and ketones and many different organic acids and aromatic compounds may be generated during hydrothermal treatment of lignocellulosic biomass. The reaction mechanisms are of interest because the very same compounds that are possible inhibitors for biomass processing enzymes and microorganisms may be valuable biobased chemicals. Hence a new potential for industrial scale synthesis of chemicals has emerged. A better understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the impact of the reaction conditions on the product formation is thus a prerequisite for designing better biomass processing strategies and forms an important basis for the development of new biorefinery products from lignocellulosic biomass as well.",

It was shown that: (i) in vitro fructose was more reactive than glucose and produced higher level of autoxidation and glycation products; (ii) no substantive differences were observed for the effect of glucose and fructose on the intracellular level of glycoxidation products, when intact yeast cells were exposed to the high concentration of hexoses; (iii) the activity of defensive enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glyoxalases, and glutathione reductase) was increased in both glucose- and fructose-stressed yeasts, indicating the development of oxidative/carbonyl stress; (iv) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity significantly dropped in yeast exposed to both hexoses, demonstrating its high sensitivity to reactive oxygen and carbonyl species; and (v) fructose more markedly activated glyoxalases than glucose. Involvement of glucose and fructose in the glycoxidation reactions as well as potential role of antioxidant and antiglycation enzymes in yeast protection against glycoxidation are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The interaction of 4-thiothymidine (S4TdR) with human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by equilibrium dialysis under normal physiological conditions. In this work, the mechanism of the interaction between S4TdR and human serum albumin (HSA) was exploited by fluorescence, UV, CD circular, and SERS spectroscopic. Fluorescence and UV spectroscopy suggest that HSA intensities are significantly decreased when adding S4TdR to HAS, and the quenching mechanism of the fluorescence is static. Also, the \u0394G, \u0394H, and \u0394S values across temperature indicated that hydrophobic interaction was the predominant binding force. The CD circular results show that there is little change in the secondary structure of HSA except the environment of amino acid changes when adding S4TdR to HSA. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows that the interaction between S4TdR and HSA can be achieved through different binding sites which are probably located in the II A and III A hydrophobic pockets of HSA which correspond to Sudlow\u2019s I and II binding sites. In addition, the molecular modeling displays that S4TdR\u2013HSA complex is stabilized by hydrophobic forces, which result from amino acid residues. The atomic force microscopy results revealed that the single HSA molecular dimensions were larger after interaction of 4-thiothymidine. This work would be useful to understand the state of the transportation, distribution, and metabolism of the anticancer drugs in the human body, and it could provide a useful biochemistry parameter for the development of new anti-cancer drugs and research of pharmacology mechanisms.",

Both cyclic (\u03b1- and \u03b2-pyranoses, \u03b1- and \u03b2-furanoses) and open-chain isomers have been probed using second order M\u00f8ller\u2013Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), M06-2X density functional, and multi-level G4 methods. This study revealed a multitude of existing minima structures. Numerous furanose conformers found are described with the Altona and Sundaralingam pseudorotation parameters. In agreement with the recent gas-phase microwave (MW) investigation of Cocinero et al., the calculated free ribose isomers of lowest energy are the two \u03b2-pyranoses with the 1C4 and 4C1 ring chair conformations. Both \u03b2-pyranoses lie within 0.9\u00a0kJ/mol in terms of \u0394G(298\u00a0K) (G4), thus challenge the computational methods used to predict the ribose global minimum. The calculated most favoured ribofuranose is the \u03b1-anomer having the twist 2T1 ring conformation, put 10.4\u00a0kJ/mol higher in \u0394G than the global minimum. By contrast with d-ribose, the lowest energy 2-deoxy-d-ribose is the \u03b1-pyranose, with the most stable 2-deoxy-d-furanose (the \u03b1-anomer) being only 6.2\u00a0kJ/mol higher in free energy. For both pentoses, the most favoured open-chain isomers are significantly higher in energy than the low-lying cyclic forms. A good overall agreement is observed between the M06-2X and MP2 results in terms of both the existing low-energy minima structures and intramolecular H-bonding geometrical parameters. The natural orbital analysis confirms the occuring of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects and maximization of intramolecular H-bonding in the lowest-lying pyranoses and furanoses of both sugars.",

However, fucoidan was partially degraded during depolymerization above 160\u00a0\u00b0C. Nearly the same depolymerization was observed for chondroitin sulfate.

In response to exposure to lactobacilli EPSs HT29-19A cells produce significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8. Additionally, the EPSs differentially modulate the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors.

Serotype 33C is notably different from all other serogroup 33 polysaccharides, as there is no \u21923-\u03b2-Glcp residue and the location of the O-acetylation of the \u21925-\u03b2-Galf residue (O-6) differs from the other serogroup 33 polysaccharides (O-2). This completes the structural assignments of polysaccharides within serogroup 33 and provides a framework for understanding the recognition of epitopes by serogroup 33 typing sera based on observed cross-reactivities reported in the literature.",

     "abstract": "The effect of the antioxidants gallic acid and methyl, propyl, and octyl gallate on the molecular mobility and hydrogen bond network in amorphous sucrose was studied. Solid amorphous sucrose films with and without the addition of antioxidants at a mole ratio of 1:5 (antioxidant/sucrose) were cast from solution onto quartz slides. Local molecular mobility from 0 to 70\u00a0\u00b0C was measured using tryptophan amino acid as a luminescent probe dispersed in the films. Phosphorescence from the tryptophan probe provides spectroscopic characteristics\u2014emission spectrum and lifetime\u2014that are sensitive to changes in molecular mobility induced by the addition of antioxidants. Local molecular mobility detected by tryptophan increased in the following order: sucrose\u00a0<\u00a0sucrose\u2013octyl gallate\u00a0<\u00a0sucrose\u2013propyl gallate\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0sucrose\u2013methyl gallate\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0sucrose\u2013gallic acid. The antioxidants also modulated the activation energy for matrix motions that quench the tryptophan phosphorescence in a structure-dependent manner. IR measurements as a function of temperature indicated that hydrogen bond strength in these amorphous films followed a rank order (sucrose\u2013methyl gallate\u00a0>\u00a0sucrose\u2013gallic acid\u00a0>\u00a0sucrose\u2013propyl gallate\u00a0>\u00a0sucrose\u00a0>\u00a0sucrose\u2013octyl gallate) that was nearly the reverse of that seen in matrix mobility. Analysis of the differential effects of the antioxidants suggests that the presence of the hydroxyl benzoyl head group increased matrix molecular mobility and hydrogen bond strength while the saturated carbon chain decreased mobility and bond strength. The influence of the carboxyl group on matrix properties was comparable to that of the formyloxy group. These results indicate that the addition of specific functional ingredients such as antioxidants may significantly affect the physical properties and consequently functional properties of amorphous edible films in ways that might condition their use. The observed changes are closely related to the chemical structure of the added species.",

Toward routine prediction of oligosaccharide conformational populations and exchange rates at thermodynamic equilibrium, we apply hardware-accelerated aqueous molecular dynamics to model \u03bcs motions in N-glycans that underpin inflammation and immunity. In 10\u00a0\u03bcs simulations, conformational equilibria of mannosyl cores, sialyl Lewis (sLe) antennae, and constituent sub-sequences agreed with prior refinements (X-ray and NMR). Glycosidic linkage and pyranose ring flexing were affected by branching, linkage position, and secondary structure, implicating sequence dependent motions in glycomic functional diversity. Linkage and ring conformational transitions that have eluded precise quantification by experiment and conventional (ns) simulations were predicted to occur on \u03bcs timescales. All rings populated non-chair shapes and the stacked galactose and fucose pyranoses of sLea and sLex were rigidified, suggesting an exploitable 3D-signature of cell adhesion protein binding. Analyses of sLex dynamics over 25\u00a0\u03bcs revealed that only 10\u00a0\u03bcs were sufficient to explore all aqueous conformers. This simulation protocol, which yields conformational ensembles that are independent of initial 3D-structure, is proposed as a route to understanding oligosaccharide recognition and structure\u2013activity relationships, toward development of carbohydrate-based novel chemical entities.",

     "abstract": "Here we present a synthetic route for solid phase synthesis of N-linked glycoconjugates containing high mannose oligosaccharides which allows the incorporation of useful functional handles on the N-terminus of asparagine. In this strategy, the C-terminus of an Fmoc protected aspartic acid residue is first attached to a solid phase support. The side chain of aspartic acid is protected by a 2-phenylisopropyl protecting group, which allows selective deprotection for the introduction of glycosylation. By using a convergent on-resin glycosylamine coupling strategy, an N-glycosidic linkage is successfully formed on the free side chain of the resin bound aspartic acid with a large high mannose oligosaccharide, Man8GlcNAc2, to yield N-linked high mannose glycosylated asparagine. The use of on-resin glycosylamine coupling provides excellent glycosylation yield, can be applied to couple other types of oligosaccharides, and also makes it possible to recover excess oligosaccharides conveniently after the on-resin coupling reaction. Useful functional handles including an alkene (p-vinylbenzoic acid), an alkyne (4-pentynoic acid), biotin, and 5-carboxyfluorescein are then conjugated onto the N-terminal amine of asparagine on-resin after the removal of the Fmoc protecting group. In this way, useful functional handles are introduced onto the glycosylated asparagine while maintaining the structural integrity of the reducing end of the oligosaccharide. The asparagine side chain also serves as a linker between the glycan and the functional group and preserves the native presentation of N-linked glycan which may aid in biochemical and structural studies. As an example of a biochemical study using functionalized high mannose glycosylated asparagine, a fluorescence polarization assay has been utilized to study the binding of the lectin Concanavalin A (ConA) using 5-carboxyfluorescein labeled high mannose glycosylated asparagine.",

Using \u03b2FFaseI extracted from the mycelia of strain NBRC100959, two novel oligosaccharides consisting of GlcNAc and fructose, \u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21921)-\u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21941)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (N-acetyl-1-kestosamine, 1-KesNAc) and \u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21921)-\u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21921)-\u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21941)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (N-acetylnystosamine, NysNAc), were synthesized from \u03b2-d-fructofuranosyl-(2\u21941)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (N-acetylsucrosamine, SucNAc).

However, it was thought that the presence of \u03b2FFaseII is disadvantageous for the production of these oligosaccharides by \u03b2FFaseI, because \u03b2FFaseII hydrolyzed 1-KesNAc and NysNAc. We succeeded to produce A. oryzae mycelia containing \u03b2FFaseI as the major \u03b2-fructofuranosidase, by increasing sucrose concentration in the culture medium. Then, using a dried sample of these A. oryzae mycelia, reaction for the oligosaccharide production was performed. As the results, 190\u00a0mg of 1-KesNAc and 60\u00a0mg of NysNAc were obtained from 0.6\u00a0g of SucNAc.

Under the optimal transformation conditions (pH 6.5, temperature 36\u00a0\u00b0C, the mass ratio of l-ascorbic acid to maltose 1:1), the highest AA-2G titer by the K47P reached 1.12\u00a0g/L, which was 1.32-fold of that (0.85\u00a0g/L) obtained by the wild-type CGTase. The reaction kinetics analysis confirmed the enhanced maltose specificity of the mutants K47F, K47P, and K47Y. It was also found that compared to the wild-type CGTase, the three mutants had relatively lower cyclization activities and higher disproportionation activities, which was favorable for AA-2G synthesis. As revealed by the interaction structure model of CGTase with substrate, the enhancement of maltose specificity may be due to the removal of hydrogen bonding interactions between the side chain of residue 47 and the sugar at \u22123 subsite. The obtained mutant CGTases, especially the K47P, has a great potential in the large-scale production of AA-2G with maltose as a cheap and soluble substrate.",

However, control reactions and subsequent kinetic studies showed that a stoichiometric, irreversible reaction of the catalyst and glycosyl donor was occurring, with a remarkable rate variance depending upon the structure of the carboxylic acid. It was subsequently found that a combination of Br\u00f8nsted acid (carboxylic acid) and Lewis acid (MgBr2) was unique in catalyzing the desired glycosylation reaction. Thus, it was concluded that the two acids act synergistically to catalyze the desired transformation. The role of the catalytic components was tested with a number of control reactions and based on these studies a mechanism is proposed herein.",

     "abstract": "A method to immobilize glycan-linked amino acids with protected \u03b1-amino groups, which are key intermediates to produce the desired neoglycoprotein, to a Biacore sensor chip was developed and its utility for interaction analyses was demonstrated. Two types of diN-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc)-containing glycans, a core 2 hexasaccharide involving linear diLacNAc that is O-linked to N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-Thr and a biantennary diLacNAc that is N-linked to Fmoc-Asn, were used as ligands. For immobilization, the free carboxyl groups of the amino acid residues were activated with EDC/NHS, then reacted with the ethylenediamine-derivatized carboxymethyldextran sensor chip to obtain the desired ligand concentrations. Interactions of the ligands with five plant lectins were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance, and the bindings were compared. The resonance unit of each lectin was corrected by subtracting that of the reference cell on which the Fmoc-Thr-core 1 or Fmoc-Asn was immobilized as a ligand. The carbohydrate specificities of interactions were verified by preincubating lectins with their respective inhibitory sugar before injection. By steady state analysis, the Lycopersicon esculentum lectin showed a 27-fold higher affinity to linear diLacNAc than to biantennary diLacNAc, while Datura stramonium and Solanum tuberosum lectins both showed low Ka,apps of 106\u00a0M\u22121 for these two ligands. In contrast, Ricinus communis agglutinin-120 showed a 3.2-fold higher Ka,app to biantennary LacNAc than to linear diLacNAc. A lectin purified from Pleurocybella porrigens mushroom interacted at the high affinity of 108\u00a0M\u22121 with both linear and biantennary diLacNAcs, which identified it as a unique probe. This method provides a useful and sensitive system to analyze interactions by simulating the glycans on the cell surface.",

Man is substituted with abequose (Abe) O-acetylated at carbon 2.

The labile O-acetylation of the O-antigen we observed in S. Typhimurium generates non-stoichiometric O-acetylation states and therefore changes the nature of an immunogenic epitope.",

By combined matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry profiling and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we determined that the A. gossypii secreted N-glycome is characterized by high-mannose type structures in the range Man4\u201318GlcNAc2, mostly containing neutral core-type N-glycans with 8\u201310 mannoses.

     "abstract": "Glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors play a key role in many eukaryotic biological pathways. Stereoselective synthesis of GPI anchor analogues have proven to be critical for probing the biosynthesis, structure, and biological properties of these compounds. Challenges that have emerged from these efforts include the preparation of the selectively protected myo-inositol building blocks and the stereoselective construction of glucosamine \u03b1-linked myo-inositol containing pseudodisaccharide units. Herein, we describe the effectiveness of the cationic nickel(II) catalyst, Ni(4-F-PhCN)4(OTf)2, at promoting selective formation of 1,2-cis-2-amino glycosidic bonds between the C(2)-N-substituted benzylideneamino trihaloacetimidate donors and C(6)-hydroxyl myo-inositol acceptors. This catalytic coupling process allows rapid access to pseudosaccharides of GPI anchors in good yields and with excellent levels of \u03b1-selectivity (\u03b1:\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a010:1\u201320:1). In stark contrast, activation of trichloroacetimidate donors containing the C(2)-N-substituted benzylidene group with TMSOTf and BF3.OEt2 provided the desired pseudodisaccharides as a 1:1 mixture of \u03b1- and \u03b2-isomers.",

Heparin is one of the most studied GAGs, for which many experimental structures of its complexes with proteins are available. One of the monosaccharide components of heparin, sulfated iduronic acid (IdoA(2S)), is observed to adopt both 1C4 and 2S0 ring conformations. Despite the biological relevance of the sugar ring conformations for heparin\u2013protein interactions, it is very challenging to take into account the conformational space of IdoA(2S) sugar ring for computational studies. Therefore, instead of systematically analyzing several ring conformations, which represents a combinatorial problem for a periodic heparin molecule, often only one ring conformation is taken into account. Here, we use docking and molecular dynamics (MD) to estimate how crucial this assumption could be for the conclusions being made in computational studies of heparin\u2013protein interactions. We show that both docking solutions and free energy calculations from MD simulations are significantly affected by the conformations adopted by IdoA and IdoA(2S) rings. Therefore, in the application of computational approaches to heparin\u2013protein systems the ring conformations should be treated properly to avoid misleading conclusions.",

Toluene and nitrile solvents improved the \u03b2-stereoselectivity of cyclization, however, the overall efficiency of the formation of cyclic products in these solvents was lower than that in dichloromethane. The use of bromide or pentenyl glycoside as leaving groups instead of the thioglycoside did not increase the \u03b2-stereoselectivity. Replacement of the N-phthaloyl group in the glycosylating unit by N-Troc one did not affect the stereoselectivity of cyclization, while the tetrasaccharides, which contained 2-O-benzoyl glucose instead of glucosamine as the glycosyl donor moiety, were found to provide \u03b2-linked cyclic products exclusively. Using this finding, two cyclic tetrasaccharides with alternate or adjacent arrangement of two glucose and two glucosamine units have been efficiently synthesized. These cycles were intended for the preparation of divalent glycoclusters with different ligand orientation. The difference in the stereoselectivity of cyclization of glucose and glucosamine precursors was accounted for by more effective anchimeric participation of the O-benzoyl group as compared to N-Phth and N-Troc counterparts that was confirmed by calculations of the stabilization energy and rotational barriers around C2\u2013O/N bond in the corresponding glycosyl cations.

This includes a resurgence of interest in the Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis enzymes as drug targets. The six carbon acidic sugar 2-keto-3-deoxymanno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) is a component of the lipid A moiety of the LPS in Gram-negative bacteria. In most cases the lipid A substituted by Kdo is the minimum requirement for cell growth, thus presenting the possibility of targeting either the synthesis or incorporation of Kdo for the development of antibacterial agents. Indeed, potent in vitro inhibitors of Kdo biosynthesis enzymes have been reported but have so far failed to show sufficient in vivo action against Gram-negative bacteria. As part of an effort to design more potent antibacterial agents targeting Kdo biosynthesis, the crystal structures of the key Kdo biosynthesis enzymes from Escherichia coli have been solved and their structure based mechanisms characterized. In eukaryotes, Kdo is found as a component of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II in the plant primary cell wall. Interestingly, despite incorporating Kdo into very different macromolecules the Kdo biosynthesis and activation pathway is almost completely conserved between plants and bacteria. This raises the possibility for plant research to exploit the increasingly detailed knowledge and resources being generated by the microbiology community. Likewise, insights into Kdo biosynthesis in plants will be potentially useful in efforts to produce new antimicrobial compounds.",

The PFH core (substructure 2) was proved to play a significant role in their inhibitory properties. Additionally, the substituent on substructures 1 and 3 of the heterocyclic ring was demonstrated to be important in the enzyme inhibitory action of the pyrimidine-fused derivatives. Moreover, these ligands show selective inhibitory properties for \u03b1-Gls over porcine pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (\u03b1-Amy) which is important in terms of their reduced susceptibility for the possible development of intestinal disturbance side effects. Therefore, low to moderate \u03b1-Amy inhibition with effective \u03b1-Gls inhibitory action may offer a better therapeutic strategy. Overall, these compounds can potentially offer a new opportunity to develop novel antidiabetic drugs with selective inhibitory action against \u03b1-Gls.",

For small viruses that can have a diameter <25\u00a0nm, removal by size leads to large membrane areas, high transmembrane pressures, low water flux, and frequent changing of membranes. In this work, we discovered that electrospun nanofibers made of chitosan and functionalized with a quaternary amine (HTCC) have the ability to adsorb a model non-enveloped virus, porcine parvovirus (PPV). To improve the virus removal of HTCC, we added graphene. Graphene both enhanced the ability to form nanofibers with HTCC and improved the virus removal. The hydrophobicity of graphene and the high charge of the HTCC create a system that can bind 95% of PPV. The HTCC/graphene nanofibers could be incorporated into microfiltration membranes and remove virus by adsorption. This would create a low pressure system that is more likely to benefit areas in need of fresh water.",

In this report, we aimed to explore the relationship between structural characteristics of glycoclusters and anti-adhesion activity. Using selective glycosylation method and convergent strategy, we synthesized a new series of homoglycoclusters and heteroglycoclusters with diverse structures. And the bioactivities of these compounds were assessed by a static state cell-based adhesion assay. We found that when the linked saccharide fragments are the same, the anti-adhesion activities of compounds with flexible linkers were stronger than those with rigid scaffold such as the benzene ring, and the best flexible linker in the tested compounds was l-glutamic acid. When l-glutamic acid was employed as the linker, glycoclusters with four valences, but not other valences, exhibited the most significant anti-adhesion activity; however, no significant differences in anti-adhesion activity were found among the tetravalentglycosides that were made by linking glucose (32), mannose (TMa-4), cellobiose (34), or lactose (Gu-4). Thus, we conclude that a flexible linker with proper length, such as that of l-glutamic acid, and the linking of four saccharide fragments might be the preferable structural characteristics for the glycocluster compounds with potent anti-adhesion activity.",

The folded-chain crystal of the cellulose II polymorph was suggested based on the following results: (1) the glucose residue with boat and skew boat ring conformations enabled the cellulose chain to form a hairpin turn; (2) the lattice parameters of the folded-chain crystal and original crystal were almost the same (deviations in the a, b, and \u03b3 parameters of both crystals were within 3%); (3) the folded-chain molecular sheet was as stable in a water medium as the extended-chain molecular sheet, and structural parameters such as the hydrogen bonding system and side chain conformation of both molecular sheets were almost the same, indicating that the folded-chain molecular sheet is an initial structure during crystallization of the folded-chain crystal.",

Its autolysis releases intracellular enzymes which is a prerequisite for optimum cheese maturation, and is known to be strain dependent. Autolysis is caused by an enzymatic hydrolysis of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) by endogenous peptidoglycan hydrolases (PGHs) or autolysins. Origins of differences in autolytic properties of different strains are not fully elucidated. Regulation of autolysis possibly depends on the structure of the cell wall components other than PG, particularly polysaccharides. In the present work, we screened six L. helveticus strains with different autolytic properties: DPC4571, BROI and LH1. We established, for the first time, that cell walls (CWs) of these strains contained polysaccharides, different from their CW teichoic acids. Cell wall polysaccharides of three strains were purified, and their chemical structures were established by 2D NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis.

In this work, the total chemical synthesis of the PSI pentasaccharide repeating unit carrying a linker at the reducing end, \u03b1-l-Rhap-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u21924)-[\u03b1-l-Rhap-(1\u21923)]-\u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u2192O(CH2)5NH2, was achieved by a linear synthesis strategy from four monosaccharide building blocks. The synthesized PSI pentasaccharide was conjugated to a subunit of C. difficile exotoxin B yielding a potential dual C. difficile vaccine. More significantly, sera from healthy horses were shown to contain natural anti-PSI IgG antibodies that detected both the synthetic non-phosphorylated PSI repeat and the native PSI polysaccharide, with a slightly higher recognition of the native PSI polysaccharide.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial capsules are formed primarily from long-chain polysaccharides with repeat-unit structures. A given bacterial species can produce a range of capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) with different structures and these help distinguish isolates by serotyping, as is the case with Escherichia coli K antigens. Capsules are important virulence factors for many pathogens and this review focuses on CPSs synthesized via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent processes in Gram-negative bacteria. Bacteria utilizing this pathway are often associated with urinary tract infections, septicemia, and meningitis, and E. coli and Neisseria meningitidis provide well-studied examples. CPSs from ABC transporter-dependent pathways are synthesized at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane through the concerted action of glycosyltransferases before being exported across the inner membrane and translocated to the cell surface. A hallmark of these CPSs is a conserved reducing terminal glycolipid composed of phosphatidylglycerol and a poly-3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) linker. Recent discovery of the structure of this conserved lipid terminus provides new insights into the early steps in CPS biosynthesis.",

     "abstract": "In order to evaluate the importance of molecular shape of inhibitor molecules and the charge/H-bond and hydrophobic interactions, we synthesized three types of molecules and tested them against a sialyltransferase. The first type of compounds were designed as substrate mimics in which the phosphate in CMP-Neu5NAc was replaced by a non-hydrolysable, uncharged 1,2,3-triazole moiety. The second type of compound contained a 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-acetylneuraminic moiety which was linked to cytidine through its carboxylic acid and amide linkers. In the third type of compound the sialyl phosphate was substituted by an aryl sulfonamide which was then linked to cytidine. Inhibition study of these cytidine conjugates against Campylobacter jejuni sialyltransferase Cst 06 showed that the first type of molecules are competitive inhibitors, whereas the other two could only inhibit the enzyme non-competitively. The results indicate that although the binding specificity may be guided by molecular shape and H-bond interaction, the charge and hydrophobic interactions contributed most to the binding affinity.",

     "abstract": "Carbohydrates, in more biologically oriented areas referred to as glycans, constitute one of the four groups of biomolecules. The glycans, often present as glycoproteins or glycolipids, form highly complex structures. In mammals ten monosaccharides are utilized in building glycoconjugates in the form of oligo- (up to about a dozen monomers) and polysaccharides. Subsequent modifications and additions create a large number of different compounds. In bacteria, more than a hundred monosaccharides have been reported to be constituents of lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, and exopolysaccharides. Thus, the number of polysaccharide structures possible to create is huge. NMR spectroscopy plays an essential part in elucidating the primary structure, that is, monosaccharide identity and ring size, anomeric configuration, linkage position, and sequence, of the sugar residues. The structural studies may also employ computational approaches for NMR chemical shift predictions (CASPER program).Once the components and sequence of sugar residues have been unraveled, the three-dimensional arrangement of the sugar residues relative to each other (conformation), their flexibility (transitions between and populations of conformational states), together with the dynamics (timescales) should be addressed. To shed light on these aspects we have utilized a combination of experimental liquid state NMR techniques together with molecular dynamics simulations. For the latter a molecular mechanics force field such as our CHARMM-based PARM22/SU01 has been used. The experimental NMR parameters acquired are typically 1H,1H cross-relaxation rates (related to NOEs), 3JCH and 3JCC trans-glycosidic coupling constants and 1H,13C- and 1H,1H-residual dipolar couplings. At a glycosidic linkage two torsion angles \u03d5 and \u03c8 are defined and for 6-substituted residues also the \u03c9 torsion angle is required. Major conformers can be identified for which highly populated states are present. Thus, in many cases a well-defined albeit not rigid structure can be identified. However, on longer timescales, oligosaccharides must be considered as highly flexible molecules since also anti-conformations have been shown to exist with H\u2013C\u2013O\u2013C torsion angles of \u223c180\u00b0, compared to syn-conformations in which the protons at the carbon atoms forming the glycosidic linkage are in close proximity.The accessible conformational space governs possible interactions with proteins and both minor changes and significant alterations occur for the oligosaccharides in these interaction processes. Transferred NOE NMR experiments give information on the conformation of the glycan ligand when bound to the proteins whereas saturation transfer difference NMR experiments report on the carbohydrate part in contact with the protein. It is anticipated that the subtle differences in conformational preferences for glycan structures facilitate a means to regulate biochemical processes in different environments. Further developments in the analysis of glycan structure and in particular its role in interactions with other molecules, will lead to clarifications of the importance of structure in biochemical regulation processes essential to health and disease.",

The preparation was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography, and two highly sulfated fractions F3 and F4 were obtained. The fractions were quite similar in composition, but different in chemical structure. F4 was analyzed by chemical methods, including desulfation, methylation, Smith degradation, and partial acid hydrolysis with mass-spectrometric monitoring, as well as by NMR spectroscopy. Several 2D NMR procedures, including HMQC-TOCSY and HMQC-NOESY, were used to obtain reliable structural information from the complex spectra. Molecules of F4 were shown to contain a backbone built up mainly of 3-linked \u03b1-l-fucopyranose 4-sulfate residues, as in many other fucoidans, but rather short sequences of these residues are interspersed by single 2-linked \u03b1-d-galactopyranose residues also sulfated at position 4. This rather unusual structural feature should have a great influence on the conformation of the polymeric molecule and may be important for biological activity of the polysaccharide. Hence, F4 is an example of a new sulfated galactofucan isolated from the brown alga. According to the data obtained, the distribution of galactose residues along the polysaccharide backbone seems to be not strictly regular, but the definitive sequence of monomers in the polymeric molecules awaits additional investigation.",

Next, B3LYP/6-311++G\u2217\u2217 level geometry optimizations were carried out, albeit on a simpler model. The relative Gibbs free energies and geometry parameters are presented for the optimized structures. Conformational analysis concerning the clockwise (cw) and counterclockwise (ccw) arrangements of the OH groups as well as the three orientations of the NH2 and CH2OH groups was performed. Furthermore, a full scan of all the possible locations of the diosgenyl moiety in relation to the sugar ring in the target compounds was done. The PM3 optimization results indicate that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside exists as a mixture of many rotamers. Of these, ccw conformers as well as the \u2212ac orientation of the aglycone (ca \u2212100\u00b0 for torsion angle \u03d5) are preferred. In the case of the N-protonated glucoside one rotamer is dominant in the mixture (population\u00a0>\u00a060%). Only the cw arrangement is stable in the protonated form, because of steric and electronic repulsion between the charged ammonium group and the hydrogen atom of the neighbouring 3-OH group. The gauche-trans (gt) orientation of the CH2OH group is favourable to both neutral and protonated forms of diosgenyl glucosides at the PM3 level. DFT studies also predict conformational mixtures for both neutral and protonated forms of simplified diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosides. These investigations showed unequivocally the preference for the ccw arrangement over cw, and that values of angle \u03d5 concur with the exo-anomeric effect. The B3LYP functional predicts the greater stability of the gt and tg orientations for the neutral and protonated analogues respectively. According to both PM3 and B3LYP calculations, torsion angle \u03c8 has only a minor influence on the conformational energy. The importance of the geometry parameters affecting the stability of these conformers appears to be as follows: angle \u03d5\u00a0\u2248\u00a0NH2/ccw/cw\u00a0>\u00a0gg/gt/tg\u00a0>\u00a0angle \u03c8.",

The highest yields have been reached using TEBA\u0421 as phase-transfer catalyst, though the non-catalytic version proves to be also efficient (DS 2.8, 70% yield). The propargylation of AG is less effective in the systems M\u041e\u041d (M\u00a0=\u00a0Na, K)/DMSO. DS of propargyl AG reaches 1.8 (70% yield) when propargyl chloride is used as propargylating agent, while with PB under the same conditions DS value does not exceed 0.4\u20130.6, the yields being 44\u201365%. Under the action of t-BuOK/DMSO system, the AG propargyl ethers have been isomerized to the corresponding unstable allenyl ethers.

In this area, ILs have been involved in protecting group manipulation reactions as well as glycosidic couplings leading to new methodologies and enhanced procedures. In addition, ILs have been successfully utilized as solution-phase purification supports.This review focuses on the most recent advances in the application of ILs to oligosaccharide synthesis.

The key method was the chemoselective and protecting group-free oxime functionalization of the pseudo-tetrasaccharide-based inhibitor acarbose.

It was shown that furfural is degrading significantly faster when glucose is present in the reaction mixture. In the series with glucose present distinct second-order reaction kinetics were observed. From experiments with varying concentrations of glucose it turned out that an additional (second-order) reaction had to be added to the reaction mechanism in order to satisfactorily predict the experimental data. This additional reaction incorporated the initial glucose concentration as a constant in the Arrhenius expression for the reaction rate constant.

The purified PA-labeled glycans were analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the glycans on flagellin of Pgl4, PtoDC3000, and Pph1448A were identical to those of Pta6605, which were characterized previously.

Among these, the F196H mutant showed increases in catalytic efficiency toward almost all glycoside substrates tested, with the most improved catalytic efficiency being a 3-fold increase for hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-mannoside, suggesting a preferred polar residue at this position and consistent with the presence of histidine at this position in two other GH1 glycosidases from barley and rice that prefer \u03b2-mannosides. In addition, the M369E mutation resulted in a small increase in catalytic efficiency for cleavage of p-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-galactoside. By contrast, the multiple mutants were up to 8-fold less efficient than the recombinant wild-type dalcochinase, and displayed primarily antagonistic interactions between these residues. Thus, differences in catalytic efficiency between dalcochinase and Abg are therefore not primarily due to differences in the residues that directly contact the substrate, but derive largely from contributions from more remote residues and the overall architecture of the active site.",

     "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs), that is, salts with melting points <100\u00a0\u00b0C, have recently attracted a lot of attention in biomass processing due to their ability to dissolve lignocellulosics. In this work, we studied how two imidazolium-based, hydrophilic, cellulose dissolving ionic liquids 1,3-dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate [DMIM]DMP and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [EMIM]AcO affect the usually employed analytical methods for mono- and oligosaccharides, typical products from hydrolytic treatments of biomass. HPLC methods were severely hampered by the presence of ILs with loss of separation power and severe baseline problems, making their use for saccharide quantification extremely challenging. Problems in DNS photometric assay and chromatography were also encountered at high ionic liquid concentrations and many capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods did not allow an efficient analysis of saccharides in these matrices. In this paper we describe an optimized CE method with pre-column derivatization for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of mono- and oligosaccharides in sample matrices containing moderate (20\u201340% (v/v)) concentrations of ILs. The IL content and type in the sample matrix was found to affect both peak shape and quantification parameters. Generally, the presence of high IL concentrations (\u2a7e20% (v/v)) had a dampening effect on the detection of the analytes. IL in lower concentrations of <20% (v/v) was, however, found to improve peak shape and/or separation in some cases. The optimized CE method has good sensitivity in moderate concentrations of the ionic liquids used, with limits of detection of 5\u00a0mg/L for cellooligomers up to the size of cellotetraose and 5\u201320\u00a0mg/L for cellopentaose and cellohexaose, depending on the matrix. The method was used for analysing the action of a commercial \u03b2-glucosidase in ILs and for analysing saccharides in the IL containing hydrolysates from the hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose with Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase Cel5A. According to the results, [DMIM]DMP and [EMIM]AcO] showed clear differences in enzyme inactivation.",

In 2010, nearly 10 million people in whole world, most from Latin America, had Chagas disease, which is an illness of high morbidity, low mortality, and serious problems of quality of life. The available treatment has high toxicity and low efficacy at chronic phase. Some of the protozoan antigenic or virulence factors include complex carbohydrate structures that, due to their uniqueness, may constitute potential selective targets for the development of new treatments. One example of such structures is NETNES, a low abundance T. cruzi glycopeptide, comprising 13 amino acid residues, one or two N-glycosylation chains, a GPI anchor and two P-glycosylations. In this context, the current work aims to obtain an atomic model for NETNES, including its glycan chains and membrane attachment, in order to contribute in the characterization of its structure and dynamics. Based on POPC and GPI models built in agreement with experimental data, our results indicate that, in the first third of the simulation, NETNES peptide is very flexible in solution, bending itself between asparagine residues and lying down on some carbohydrates and membrane, exposing amino acid residues and some other glycans, mainly terminal mannoses, to the extracellular medium, remaining in this position until the end of simulations.",

The binding of soybean agglutinin (SBA) to the globotriose (Gb3) unit in the SAMs was then studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is a label free method found to be quite sensitive to SAM composition and to the differences in SAM structure on NPG versus on flat Au.

This led to the hypothesis that the biosynthesis of starch required a preformed primer. Later it was found that phosphorylase was exclusively a degradative enzyme in vivo and that starch-synthase was the enzyme that reacted with ADPGlc to biosynthesize starch. Amylogenin, a putative self-glycosylated protein, was postulated to be the primer, although it was never demonstrated or found. In the present study, three reactions were performed in sequence with a highly purified potato starch-synthase to determine whether an amylogenin primer was present and required or whether the biosynthesis was de novo. Reaction 1 was performed by adding 2.0\u00a0mM ADPGlc to synthesize the putative primer to a possible amylogenin in the preparation; in Reaction 2, 10\u00a0mM ADP-[14C]Glc was added; and in Reaction 3, 10\u00a0mM nonlabeled ADPGlc was added. After the isolation, reduction, and acid hydrolysis of the products of Reactions 2 and 3, 14C-d-glucitol was obtained from Reaction 2 and was decreased by Reaction 3. The formation of 14C-d-glucitol and its decrease showed that an amylogenin, protein primer was not involved in starch biosynthesis and the synthesis is de novo by the addition of d-glucose to the reducing-ends of growing starch chains.",

Hydrolysis with each of the three enzymes produced a different pattern of oligosaccharides. Mannanase was the most selective of the three enzymes in the hydrolysis of konjac mannan and over 99% of the formed oligosaccharides had mannose as their reducing end pyranosyl unit. Tr Cel5A hydrolysate shared similarities with mannanase and Tr Cel7B hydrolysates and the enzyme had the lowest substrate specificity of the studied enzymes. The hydrolysate of Tr Cel7B contained a series of oligosaccharides with non-reducing end mannose (M) and reducing end glucose (G) (MG, MMG, MMMG, and MMMMG). These oligosaccharides were isolated from the hydrolysate by size exclusion chromatography in relatively high purity (86\u201395%) and total yield (23% of substrate).

This process is often initiated by the interaction of bacterial lectins and specific carbohydrate ligands. Thus, adhesion of bacterial cells to glycosylated surfaces is a suitable model system to study various parameters of lectin-mediated carbohydrate recognition. Glycoarrays have become important tools to study such lectin-mediated carbohydrate recognition. However, it is difficult to adjust the characteristics of a specific glycoarray regarding its carbohydrate density or the clustering of sugar ligands, respectively. Thus, we have made an attempt to use synthetic cluster glycosides of different valencies to vary carbohydrate density on a polystyrene surface. A series of mono-, di- and trivalent mannosides were synthesised for immobilisation on pre-functionalised polystyrene microtiter plates and the resulting glycoarrays were tested as adhesive surfaces in mannose-specific adhesion of Escherichia coli. Our measurements give first promising hints about the potential of this approach to alter ligand density of glycoarrays in a systematic way.",

The kinetic studies of this ligand series show that MshB is more strongly inhibited as a function of increasing alkyl chain length. While docking studies yielded highest ranked conformations in which the ligands extended along the catalytic site, these conformations produced free energy values prone to large errors and which were inconsistent with experimental kinetic measurements. Solution-favoured conformations of the inhibitors feature a preference for intramolecular aromatic association that results in curled conformations. Free energy perturbation calculations of MshB bound to the inhibitors in the preconfigured solution-favoured curled conformations gave the same binding pattern observed in the kinetic experiments. On investigation of these conformations lodged in the catalytic domain, we found that the selective feature determining their relative binding strength was the result of an optimisation of the dispersion interactions between the ligand aromatic groups phenyl and plumbagin, and the enzyme aromatic groups His144 and Tyr142 respectively. These results show that rather than deform the preferred folded ligand solution conformation, such that the hydrophobic C-2 acyl chain is linearly projected into a buried hydrophobic rich binding cavity adjacent to the active site, MshB binds preconfigured solution inhibitor curled conformations with a preference for aromatic association.",

Therefore, they may become the drugs for autoimmune diseases for the following reasons: (i) compound OCH, one of the \u03b1-galactosylceramide analogues with a shorter sphingosine chain than KRN7000, increases hydrophilicity relative to KRN7000; and (ii) OCH is known to induce much more Th2 cytokines (IL-4) than Th1 cytokines from iNKT cells compared to KRN7000. Naturally, OCH has become one of the candidate drugs for autoimmune diseases. The more hydroxylated derivatives of KRN7000 are anticipated to induce Th2 bias. Therefore, eight analogues with 1\u20134 excess hydroxyl groups on the lipid chain of KRN7000 were synthesized to examine if they behave in the same way as OCH. As a result, three out of eight compounds biased largely to IL-4 secretion, and their effectiveness for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was examined. It was recognized that two compounds \u2020RCAI-147/-160 showed good suppression of EAE symptoms.",

     "abstract": "In this work, it was found that some monosaccharides normally used to stabilize enzymes at high temperatures, however, actually caused a deactivation of chloroperoxidase (CPO). The red native CPO was converted to a stable pale species that lost enzymatic activity. This deactivation was irreversible and was sensitive to temperature. It was different from the general peroxide-mediated deactivation of CPO.Data from measurement of chlorination activity as well as UV\u2013vis, fluorescent, and CD spectral analysis indicated that monosaccharide-induced deactivation can be attributed to precipitation of protein in the presence of monosaccharide and the interaction of the aldehyde group of sugar with amino groups, especially the terminal amino group, on proteins to form Schiff bases which then rearrange to the stable amino ketone.It is further noted that the deactivation efficiency depends on the stereostructure of monosaccharides. d-Glucose was the most efficient inactivating agents due to its aptitude for both of the interactions mentioned in the above paragraphs. The deactivation was specific to aldose. No deprivation of the heme iron was involved in this deactivation.",

     "abstract": "Aureobasidium pullulans is a common, ubiquitous fungus, which is used industrially to produce the polysaccharide pullulan. We have previously shown that A. pullulans produces various heavier-than-water oils, first named here as liamocins, that accumulate in fermentations. Here we report the structural characterization of four liamocins, A1, A2, B1, and B2, produced by A. pullulans strain NRRL 50380 using a combination of MALDI-TOF/MS, quadrupole-TOF/MS, isotopic labeling, NMR, GC/MS, and classical carbohydrate analysis. The data showed that the liamocins are composed of a single mannitol headgroup partially O-acylated with three (for liamocin A1 and A2) or four (for liamocin B1 and B2) 3,5-dihydroxydecanoic ester groups. Liamocins A1 and B1 are non-acetylated, whereas A2 and B2 each contain a single 3\u2032-O-acetyl group. Each of these compounds is characterized by pseudomolecular [M+Na]+ ions in the MALDI-TOF/MS spectra at m/z 763.22, 949.35, 805.22, and 991.37, respectively. The 186\u00a0Da mass difference between A-type and B-type liamocins corresponds to one O-linked 3,5-dihydroxydecanoate group. HMBC NMR showed that one 3,5-dihydroxydecanoate carbonyl group is ester linked to a primary hydroxyl on the mannitol. Other long range 13C\u20131H couplings across 1,5-ester bridges showed that the 3,5-dihydroxydecanoate groups form 1\u20135-linked polyester chains, similar in structure to the antibiotic substance exophilin A. Moreover, the MS analysis identified several non-conjugated poly-3,5-dihydroxydecanoate esters as minor components that are tentatively assigned as exophilins A1, A2, B1, and B2. The liamocins, and three of the exophilins, are new, previously unreported structures.",

The grafting of acrylic acid onto cassava starch in an aqueous medium initiated by Fenton\u2019s reagent has been studied. Common grafting result parameters are add-on (yield) and graft efficiency (selectivity). However, the analysis of the reaction products and an accurate determination of these parameters stand or fall with a complete separation of the entangled but ungrafted homopolymer from the grafted product. Therefore, this separation is the core of the newly developed analytical procedure. An appropriate solvent has been selected with dedicated testing from the range methanol, ethanol, acetone, dioxane, 2-propanol, and 1-propanol. Acetone showed the best performance in many respects. It has a high dissolving power for the homopolymer, as well as the highest yield of precipitation for the starch derivatives and it is the most economical in use. After the successful separation, the precipitated graft copolymers could be analyzed quantitatively by nuclear magnetic resonance. The liquid with homopolymer and unreacted monomer was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. Proof of grafting has been found by FTIR and TGA analyses. The mass balance calculation shows a systematic error which appears fairly consistent: 18.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0wt\u00a0%. This was used as a correction factor in the calculation of the grafting parameters but more importantly, it means that the method we developed has a high level of repeatability, in the order of 97%.",

Upregulation of genes controlling the glycolytic pathway under normoxia, known as the Warburg effect, clearly differentiates malignant from non-malignant cells. The resurgence of interest in cancer metabolism aims at a better understanding of the metabolic differences between malignant and non-malignant cells and the creation of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents exploiting these differences.Modified d-glucose and d-mannose analogs were shown to interfere with the metabolism of their respective monosaccharide parent molecules and are potentially clinically useful anticancer and diagnostic agents.One such agent, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo and also clinically evaluated. Studies clearly indicate that 2-DG has a pleiotropic mechanism of action. In addition to effectively inhibiting glycolysis, 2-DG has also been shown to affect protein glycosylation. In order to better understand its molecular mechanism of action, we have designed and synthesized deuterated molecular probes to study 2-DG interference with d-glucose and d-mannose metabolism using mass spectrometry. We present here the synthesis of all desired probes: 2-deutero-d-glucose, 2-deutero-d-mannose, 6-deutero-d-glucose, 6-deutero-d-mannose, and 2-deutero-2-deoxy-d-glucose as well as their complete chemical characterization.",

Detailed assays of \u03b2-glucan degradation pathways by enzyme mixtures therefore promise to support the analysis of physiological and the optimization of technological processes. Physiological and biotechnological processes tend to occur in complex mixtures of catalysts and substrates and the development of advanced methodologies for mixture analysis has been attracting a great deal of attention. In situ detection of processes that involve carbohydrate synthesis and degradation encompasses the challenge of detecting monomer identities and linkage patterns, as well as enzymatic stereochemistry and specificity while resolving chemically similar reactants, challenges that are complicated in the additional detection of intermediate degradation steps. In the current study, we show that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy near the highest available spectrometer fields permits detailed real-time assays of the degradation of polymeric barley (1\u21923),(1\u21924)-\u03b2-glucan by commercial enzyme mixtures. Up to six different intermediates can be resolved and structurally assigned within a 0.07\u00a0ppm chemical shift range using the anomeric 1H chemical signal in \u03b2-(1\u21923) glycosidic linkages as a structural reporter.

In this study, the acceptor promiscuity of a Rosa hybrid UGT RhGT1 and an evolved microbial UGT OleDPSA toward a small flavonoid library was probed and compared. Interestingly, RhGT1 showed comparable acceptor promiscuity in comparison with OleDPSA, though the acceptor binding pocket of the latter is much more open and large. This clearly indicates that stabilization of the acceptor position by suitable hydrophobic interactions is important for the specificity or regioselectivity determination as well as overall fit of the acceptor into a \u2018big enough\u2019 binding pocket.

The catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, N2 physical adsorption, temperature-programed desorption of NH3, n-butylamine titration using Hammett indicators, infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that both catalytic activity and surface acid sites decrease with increasing calcination temperatures. The Nb2O5 derived from calcination of niobic acid at 400\u00a0\u00b0C reveals the maximum yield of HMF among all the catalysts, although the amount of acid sites on the catalyst is lower than that on the sample calcined at 300\u00a0\u00b0C. The results suggest that the presence of larger amounts of strong acid sites on the surface of the Nb2O5 calcined at 300\u00a0\u00b0C may promote side reactions.

The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the severe life-threatening Gram-positive pathogens and elucidation of the structure of its lipoteichoic acid revealed 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-galactose as a main component of the cell wall glycopolymer. Our approach toward this carbohydrate used an l-threonine derived aldehyde as starting material following the Garner protocol, which was subjected to a nitro aldol reaction with 2-nitroacetaldehyde diethylacetal to generate the galacto configurated carbon backbone. Subsequent reduction of the nitro group and peracetylation of the molecule resulted in a fully and orthogonally protected derivative, which was deprotected by a single step in pure deionized water at elevated temperatures.",

     "abstract": "Among the glycoside hydrolases (GHs) classified within the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) server, the \u03b1-amylase family GH13 belongs to the largest GH families. It has been divided into the official 36 subfamilies by the CAZy curators. Originally the subfamilies of oligo-1,6-glucosidase and neopullulanase were defined using the sequence of the fifth conserved sequence region (CSR) as a selection marker. It is localized outside the catalytic \u03b1-amylase (\u03b2/\u03b1)8-barrel in the domain B, that is, in a longer loop connecting the strand \u03b23 with the helix \u03b13 of the barrel. It is sequentially positioned 26\u201328 residues in front of the invariant aspartic acid residue in the \u03b24-strand acting as the GH13 catalytic nucleophile. The CSR V is characteristic as QpDln and MpKln for the former and latter subfamilies, respectively. A group of intermediate sequences possessing the CSR V as a mix of the two above-mentioned subfamilies, that is, MpDln, was also proposed previously. The present bioinformatics analysis was done in an effort to reveal as many as possible GH13 members of this intermediary group, currently classified as the subfamily GH13_36, and to discuss their evolutionary relationships to known GH13 specificities as well as with regard to their taxonomic origin. Using the BLAST tool with the sequence of the \u03b1-amylase from Halothermothrix orenii AmyA exhibiting the intermediary features, 152 GH13 enzymes, and hypothetical proteins were retrieved covering defined specificities (GH13 subfamilies 4, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 29, 30, 31, 34, and 35) and intermediary enzymes and proteins (GH13_36). In both evolutionary trees\u2014based on the alignment of CSRs and complete sequences\u2014most of the \u2018intermediary\u2019 proteins (i.e., those with MPDLN signature) were positioned in several closely related clusters forming, however, a single GH13_36 large part of the trees. A few novel GH13 subfamilies were proposed as well as the specificity implications were discussed based on the presented in silico analysis. The results may also be helpful in assigning any GH13-like amino acid sequence the subfamily GH13_36 affiliation without additional biochemical characterization.",

     "abstract": "Acid hydrolysis and subsequent quantification of glucosamine (GlcN) are widely used for chitosan quantification. Degradation of GlcN during chitosan hydrolysis was the main reason for the decrease of recovery, which made the method improper for the quantification of chitosan. Ten milligram of chitosan hydrolyzed with 10\u00a0mL mixed acid solution of HCl\u2013H3PO4 (75:25 in molar ratio) showed the highest recovery, significantly higher than HCl hydrolysis. Further study revealed that the optimum conditions involved the hydrolysis with HCl\u2013H3PO4 (4.5:1.5\u00a0M) for 24\u00a0h at 110\u00a0\u00b0C. The hydrolysate was neutralized and derived with 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC-Cl) before HPLC quantification. The optimum ratio of FMOC-Cl:GlcN was 53:1, with excess FMOC-Cl induced by the high ionic strength of the solution. This quantification procedure was then validated and proved to be specific, with good linearity, accuracy, and precision, making it well-suited for the determination of chitosan.",

The activated form of PC (APC), in association with the cofactor protein S, proteolytically converts activated coagulation factors VIIIa and Va into inactive forms. Studies have shown that forms of PC that contain 3N-linked glycans (beta-PC) are functionally distinct from the fully glycosylated 4-glycan type (alpha-PC). Since some findings have also hinted at qualitative differences in PC from newborns and adults, we decided to determine the relative constitution of glycoforms in these age groups. Subtypes of PC in newborn and adult plasmas were distinguished by SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Western blotting, followed by immunological analysis. Newborns were found to have alpha-PC/beta-PC mole ratios of 8.8:1, compared to 2.3:1 in adults. PC was also isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from newborn and adult plasmas. Glycans were released by protease treatment and studied by mass spectrometry. Results from glycan analysis showed a small range of glycan structures in both age groups. No clear differences were noted between newborn and adult PC microheterogeneity in glycan structures (branching). We conclude that newborns have important differences in PC macroheterogeneity in glycoform content relative to adults. This age-dependent glycosylation variation may have implications in management of PC function in vivo.",

However, the role of the latter class of biomolecules is only poorly understood yet. Therefore, we investigated the saccharide composition of the biosilica-associated organic material of the diatom Stephanopyxis turris. This species exhibits a considerably high saccharide content in its siliceous cell walls. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that mannose-6-phosphate is strongly associated to the cell walls. This phosphorylated saccharide has not yet been found in diatom biosilica. In vitro studies on the polyallylamine-induced silica precipitation were carried out in the presence of mannose-6-phosphate. Compared to inorganic phosphate, mannose-6-phosphate significantly influenced the precipitation behavior of this model system suggesting a possible contribution of mannose-6-phosphate to the biomineralization process of Stephanopyxis turris.",

In this study, the pulsed-field-gradient stimulated echo (PGSTE) 1H NMR method was utilized to elucidate the gelation mechanism and to determine the network structure of agarose. The echo signal intensity of agarose decreased with the formation of aggregated bundles, and therefore, it was used to determine the concentration of the solute agarose (csol) in the gel. The diffusion coefficient of a dendrimer, added to the gel as a probe molecule, increased concomitantly with the formation of the network of aggregated bundles, suggesting apparent dilution of solute agarose in the network interspaces. The hydrodynamic mesh size (\u03be) of the network was estimated from the degree of retardation of the diffusion. The dependence of \u03be on csol was interpreted using a simple model, where the hydrodynamic interaction of the probe molecule with a solute chain or an aggregated bundle of chains is same. Our theoretically predicted lines fitted well on the experimentally obtained plots, thus validating the use of this model.",

However, with TMSOTf as the catalyst, the outcomes of the corresponding phenol O-glycosylation are highly dependent on the nucleophilicity of the phenols; less nucleophilic is the phenol, higher amounts of the 1,2-cis-O-glycoside together with more side-products are generated. 1,2-Orthoesters have been found to be the major products at a low temperature (<\u221270\u00a0\u00b0C) in all these phenol O-glycosylation reactions, which are transformed into the final products at a higher temperature. BF3\u00b7OEt2 is an effective catalyst to promote the conversion of 1,2-orthoesters into the corresponding 1,2-trans-O-glycosides. However, the 1,2-orthoesters could be converted into the dioxolenium triflate and glycosyl triflate in the presence of TMSOTf, these intermediates which might be in equilibrium with the glycosyl oxocarbenium related species lead to the final mixture of the \u03b1/\u03b2-O-glycosides and side-products.",

     "abstract": "Increased activity of the main carbohydrate pathways (glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and hexosamine biosynthetic pathways) is one of the hallmarks of metabolic diseases such as cancer. Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol is a sulfoglycolipid found in the human diet that possesses anticancer activity that is absent when its carbohydrate moiety (glucose 6-sulfonate or sulfoquinovose) is removed. This work used bacterial systems to further understand the metabolism of this sugar through three main carbohydrate processing pathways and how this could influence its biological activity. Using 13C NMR spectroscopy and enzyme assays, we showed that glucose 6-sulfonate cannot enter the pentose phosphate pathway, hence decreasing pentose and nucleotide biosyntheses. In glycolysis, glucose 6-sulfonate only provides one pyruvate per monosaccharide molecule, decreasing the flux of this pathway by half when compared to glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-sulfonate can enter the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway by producing glucosamine 6-sulfonate, which is a reported antibacterial agent that competitively inhibits hexosamine production. All these interactions with carbohydrate routes might help explain the observed anticancer activity that glucose 6-sulfonate has in vitro. This adds to our knowledge of how vegetables rich in glucose 6-sulfonate can also act as metabolic inhibitors of pathways that are increased in metabolic diseases.",

The identified optimal fermentation conditions for extracting chitin from SSPs using S. marcescens B742 were 2% SSP, 2\u00a0h of sonication time, 10% incubation level, and 4\u00a0d of culture time, while that of using L. plantarum ATCC 8014 fermentation was 2% SSP, 15% glucose, 10% incubation level, and 2\u00a0d of culture time. Successive two-step fermentation using identified optimal fermentation conditions resulted in chitin yield of 18.9% with the final deproteinization (DP) and demineralization (DM) rate of 94.5% and 93.0%, respectively. The obtained chitin was compared with the commercial chitin from SSP using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Methylation dependant enhancement of trehalose synthesis has been reported from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Universal methyl group donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) and its inhibitor, oxidized adenosine (Adox) were used to study the effect of methylation on trehalose metabolism in C. utilis. Treatment of early stationary phase cells of C. utilis with AdoMet and Adox exhibited increase in both intracellular metabolite levels and activities of the trehalose synthesizing enzymes, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose phosphate phosphatase (TPP). Among the intracellular metabolites studied, trehalose levels were enhanced in presence of AdoMet which correlated with the increasing levels of trehalose synthesizing enzymes. TPS was purified in presence of AdoMet and Adox, following an established protocol reported from this laboratory. Differences in the mobility of control TPS, methylated TPS, and methylation-inhibited TPS during acidic native gel electrophoresis confirmed the occurrence of induced methylation. MALDI-TOF analysis of trypsin-digested samples of the same further strengthened the presence of methylation in TPS. The data presented in this paper strongly indicate a positive role of methylation on trehalose synthesis which finally leads to enhanced trehalose production during the stationary growth phase of C. utilis.",

A method for the reliable quantification of DHA in honey samples was established, based on derivatization with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and subsequent RP-HPLC with UV detection. The previously unknown reaction product of DHA and OPD was identified as 2-hydroxymethylquinoxaline by spectroscopic means. DHA was exclusively determined in 6 fresh manuka honeys originating directly from the beehive as well as 18 commercial manuka honey samples, ranging from 600 to 2700\u00a0mg/kg and 130 to 1600\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. The corresponding MGO contents varied from 50 to 250\u00a0mg/kg in fresh and 70 to 700\u00a0mg/kg in commercial manuka honey samples. A good linear correlation between DHA and MGO values in commercial manuka honeys was observed, resulting in a mean ratio of DHA to MGO of 2:1. In contrast to this, the DHA-to-MGO relation was much higher in fresh manuka honeys but approximated to a ratio of 2:1 while honey ripening. Heating experiments revealed that MGO formation based on thermal treatment as a consequence, for example, of caramelization in honey does not occur. DHA and MGO can serve as suitable unique quality parameter for manuka honey.",

Phosphorescence from erythrosin B (Ery B) was used to characterize the temperature dependence of mobility in glucose/glycerol films over the temperature range from 100\u00a0\u00b0C down to \u221210\u00a0\u00b0C. Analysis of emission energy and excited state decay kinetics from Ery B provided information about thermally activated modes of matrix dipolar relaxation around and collisions with the excited triplet state of the probe. Both the average rate of matrix mobility and the width of the distribution of matrix mobility rates largely scaled with the effect of glycerol on the glass transition temperature of the glucose/glycerol mixture. The IR hydrogen bond bandwidth increased at higher glycerol content, suggesting that the strength of the bond became more widely distributed with the added glycerol. An increase with temperature in the hydrogen bond peak frequency indicated the transformation of associated hydroxyl to free hydroxyl. These results support a model in which glycerol plasticizes the glucose matrix at mole ratios of 0.1 and above while providing no evidence for the antiplasticization seen in other sugar matrices.",

     "abstract": "Saccharides interact with aromatic residues mostly through CH\u22ef\u03c0 mediated stacking interactions. The energetics of such interactions depends upon the mutual position-orientations (POs) of the two moieties. The POs found in the crystal structures are only a subset of the various possible ways of interaction. Hence, potential energy surfaces of saccharide-aromatic residue complexes have been explored by mixed Monte Carlo multiple minimum/low mode sampling. The saccharides considered in this study are \u03b1/\u03b2-d-glucose, \u03b2-d-galactose, \u03b1-d-mannose, and \u03b1/\u03b2-l-fucose. p-Hydroxytoluene, toluene, and 3-methylindole were used as analogs of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively. The saccharides interact from either above or below the \u03c0-cloud of an aromatic ring but not along the edges. The POs preferred by different saccharides, both in the preferred chair and skew-boat forms, for interacting with different aromatic amino acid residue analogs have been identified. Aromatic residues can interact with the same \u2013CH group in many POs but not so with the \u2013OH groups. Changes in the configurations of pyranose ring carbon atoms cause remarkable changes in stacking preferences. \u03b2-d-Galactose and \u03b2-l-fructose interact only through their b- and a-faces, respectively. Saccharides use a wide variety of apolar patches for stacking against aromatic residues and these have been analyzed in detail. As many as four \u2013CH groups can simultaneously participate in CH\u22ef\u03c0 interactions, especially with 3-methylindole owing to its larger surface area.",

     "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a congenital disease caused by a mutation in a gene responsible for the synthesis of a membrane protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is closely related to the biological properties of CFTR; however, these properties have not been clearly linked to the known role of CFTR as a chloride and bicarbonate ion channel. Indeed, data indicate that CFTR is an epithelial cell receptor for P. aeruginosa, with CFTR binding to the oligosaccharide of the outer core region of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), of which two distinct glycoforms have been identified. Binding leads to effective innate immunity to clear this pathogen in individuals with wild-type CFTR. To reveal the molecular basis of elimination of the bacterium through this interaction, the synthesis of pentasaccharides corresponding to both glycoforms of the outer core region of P. aeruginosa LPS was undertaken. Here we report the synthesis of the glycoform II. Like glycoform I, it was prepared as three pentasaccharides bearing naturally occurring N-alanyl and N-acetyl substituents in the galactosamine moiety as well as unnatural N-acetylalanine to reveal the role of the amino group in the alanyl substituent. Key features of the synthesis were two \u03b1-glucosylations with glucosyl donors bearing \u03b1-stereodirecting acyl groups at O-6 and/or O-3 and high-yielding reduction of the azido group followed by N-acylation and final O-debenzylation.",

     "abstract": "Herbivorous marine snails like Littorina species are known to possess alginate lyases in their digestive tracts. The Littorina enzymes have been identified as endolytic polymannuronate (poly(M)) lyases (EC 4.2.2.3); however, it is still unclear which polysaccharide-lyase family (PL) the Littorina enzymes belong to, since no complete primary structure of Littorina enzymes has been determined. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the primary structure of LbAly28, a 28\u00a0kDa alginate lyase isozyme of Littorina brevicula, by the cDNA method. LbAly28 cDNAs were amplified by PCR followed by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-RACE PCRs from the L. brevicula hepatopancreas cDNA. A cDNA covering entire coding region of LbAly28 consisted of 1129\u00a0bp and encoded an amino-acid sequence of 291 residues. The deduced amino-acid sequence comprised an initiation methionine, a putative signal peptide of 14 residues, a propeptide-like region of 16 residues, and a mature LbAly28 domain of 260 residues. The mature LbAly28 domain showed 43\u201353% amino-acid identities with other molluscan PL-14 enzymes. The catalytically important residues in PL-14 enzymes, which were identified in the Chlorella virus glucuronate-specific lyase vAL-1 and Aplysia poly(M) lyase AkAly30, were also conserved in LbAly28. Site-directed mutagenesis regarding these residues, that is, replacements of Lys94, Lys97, Thr121, Arg 123, Tyr135, and Tyr137 to Ala, decreased the activity of recombinant LbAly28 to various degrees. From these results we concluded that LbAly28 is a member of PL-14 alginate lyases. Besides the effects of above mutations, we noticed that the replacement of T121 by Ala changed the substrate preference of LbAly28. Namely, the activities toward sodium alginate and poly(MG)-block substrate increased and became comparable with the activity toward poly(M)-block substrate. This suggests that the region including T121 of LbAly28 closely relates to the recognition of poly(MG) region of alginate.",

     "abstract": "Sphaerotilus natans is a filamentous sheath-forming bacterium, commonly found in bulking activated sludge. The bulky nature of this bacterium is caused by an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS). EPS is a linear acidic polysaccharide with the following chemical structure: [\u21924)-\u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-d-GlcpA-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-l-Rhap-(1\u21923)-\u03b2-l-Rhap-(1\u2192]n. 1H\u20131H and 1H\u201313C correlation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed to acquire nuclear Overhauser effect signals, which were used for conformational elucidation. Molecular mechanics calculations were performed on each disaccharide unit of the EPS building blocks. On the basis of the results of the calculations, the conformation of a pentasaccharide fragment was estimated. After confirmation of the coincidence between the NMR data and the predicted conformation of the pentasaccharide fragment, the conformation of a heptadecasaccharide fragment was estimated using the same procedure. The heptadecasaccharide was found to form a (12/1) helix and take locally folded chain, which is attributed to a triangular arrangement formed by a series of residues, \u03b1-d-Glcp-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-d-GlcpA-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-l-Rhap. This arrangement is caused by the peculiar consecutive (1\u21922) linkages and reinforced by a hydrogen bond between the \u03b1-glucosyl and \u03b1-rhamnosyl residues. Considering the steric hindrance due to this triangular arrangement, EPS molecules are not supposed to form double helix in an aqueous environment.

Their physiological benefits, primarily stimulation of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the colon informs their significance as high value nutraceuticals in the food and pharmaceutical industry. In addition they are well known as useful components of important pharmaceutical products. There are two main ways of producing these sugars from biomass, which include enzymatic and non-enzymatic pretreatments. Each of the two processes has advantages and disadvantages. Enzymatic processes are associated with high costs, higher concentration of monomeric sugars, and low oligosaccharide yields while thermo-chemical processes are usually associated with undesirable byproducts such as furfural and lower oligosaccharide yields. In this paper we discuss the benefits and constraints for optimization of different methods for the production of oligosaccharides from biomass.",

     "abstract": "Undecaprenyl Pyrophosphate Synthase (UPPS) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the production of bactoprenols, which act as membrane anchors for the assembly of complex bacterial oligosaccharides. One of the major hurdles in understanding the assembly of oligosaccharide assembly is a lack of chemical tools to study this process, since bactoprenols and the resulting isoprenoid-linked oligosaccharides lack handles or chromophores for use in pathway analysis. Here we describe the isolation of a new UPPS from the symbiotic microorganism Bacteroides fragilis, a key species in the human microbiome. The protein was purified to homogeneity and utilized to accept a chromophore containing farnesyl diphosphate analogue as a substrate. The analogue was utilized by the enzyme and resulted in a bactoprenyl diphosphate product with an easy to monitor tag associated with it. Furthermore, the diphosphate is shown to be readily converted to monophosphate using a common molecular biology reagent. This monophosphate product allowed for the investigation of complex oligosaccharide biosynthesis, and was used to probe the activity of glycosyltransferases involved in the well characterized Campylobacter jejuni N-linked protein glycosylation. Novel reagents similar to this will provide key tools for the study of uncharacterized oligosaccharide assemblies, and open the possibility for the development of rapid screening methodology for these biosynthetic systems.",

Here, we report the NMR assignment of different structural motifs in the \u03b2-limit dextrin from lintnerized maize starch as a branched \u03b1-glucan model system for starch, which is depleted of repetitive \u03b1-(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds at non-reducing ends but has the \u03b1-(1\u21926) branch points intact. By NMR spectroscopy at 18.7\u00a0T magnetic field, we assign 12 discernible \u03b1-glucopyranosyl spin systems and identify them with different structural motifs. Amylolysis of the \u03b2-limit dextrin is directly followed by real-time NMR spectroscopy and four major cleavage products are identified and assigned to different branch point structures. Overall, these NMR assignments facilitate in situ assays under realistic conditions of substrate competition, transglycosylation, and product inhibition and shed light on chemical shift tendencies in different structural motifs of branched \u03b1-glucans.",

Treatment of the stable rhOVGP1-expressing HEK293 cells with either GalNAc\u03b1-Bn to block O-glycan extension, tunicamycin to block N-glycosylation, or neuraminidase increased the electrophoretic mobility of rhOVGP1.

Immobilized enzyme can be used effectively for the hydrolysis of RFOs. After five runs, chitosan and Amberlite immobilized enzyme retained 53% and 34% activity, respectively with soybean RFOs. The easy availability of enzyme source, ease of its immobilization on matrices, non-toxicity and low cost of matrices, increased stability of immobilized enzyme, and effective hydrolysis of RFOs makes it a suitable product with potential applications at industries.",

     "abstract": "For a two phase system comprising an enzyme in solution acting on an insoluble substrate such as starch, adsorption of the enzyme is a key initial step in the reaction but few studies of agents affecting direct binding have been performed. The effect of maltose on the interaction of maize starch with porcine pancreatic \u03b1-amylase was studied by using a method in which the direct binding of starch to amylase is measured under conditions of negligible catalytic activity. The dissociation constant for starch binding increased with maltose concentration and analysis of the binding showed that the kinetic action of maltose was entirely competitive. This result accords with results described in the literature in which maltose was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of amylase action. If the maltose concentration is sufficiently high, a second molecule may bind at the active site but the affinity of the second binding step is approximately 6.5-fold weaker. Because of the relatively low affinity for maltose, it seems unlikely that inhibition by maltose of the initial stage of starch-amylase interaction normally plays any role in regulating intestinal digestion of starch.",

Two haptens, a pentasaccharide and a mimetic octapeptide, bind to SYA/J6 with moderate binding affinities. In a previous attempt to obtain improved binding affinity to SYA/J6, two glycopeptide chimeras (\u03b1-glycopeptide and \u03b2-glycopeptide) were designed based on the structures of the pentasaccharide and the octapeptide, as well as a molecular docking study. Despite the overall fit of the ligand, the \u03b1-glycopeptide showed no inhibition of the SYA/J6 antibody binding to the O-polysaccharide. In this work, we conducted conventional molecular dynamics simulations of the SYA/J6 Fab in complex with these four related haptens. Several conformational differences between crystal structures and bioactive structures for the pentasaccharide binding and the octapeptide binding were identified. More significantly, the MD simulations revealed that the Fab complexes of both \u03b1-glycopeptide and \u03b2-glycopeptide were not stable, with the ligand dissociating from the combining site. This behavior provides a reasonable explanation for the lack of binding of the \u03b1-glycopeptide, and implies further that the \u03b2-glycopeptide would not be a hapten that binds the SYA/J6 antibody.",

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements indicated that the self-assembling property of 6-O-dodecyltrehalose was completely different from that of the other derivatives. The former primarily formed spherical micelles in water, which further assembled into face-centered cubic-based aggregates when dried.

The in situ generated species could completely reduce platinum ions (20\u00a0mM) and sufficiently stabilize the obtained platinum nanoparticles (5\u00a0mM) of uniform particle size (2\u20134\u00a0nm). The reduction is efficient and rapid as a complete conversion is achieved within 5\u00a0min. In a stronger alkaline condition, the platinum nanoparticles tend to aggregate and form a bigger domain because extensive degradation generates small starch fragments with less stabilization efficiency. This observation suggests that starch is a promising green material which could be chemically treated and transformed to a powerful reducing agent and stabilizer for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles.",

Additionally, HPLC-ESI-MSn experiments indicated glycoforms that have chain elongation from HepII, this was found only in glycoforms, which lack the additional heptose in the outer core region. Structural details of these glycoforms were confirmed by analyses of LPS from a 1158losB2 mutant strain; the losB2 gene is required for addition of the d,d-Hep to the outer core region in strain 1158.",

The calculations were performed on the two levels of theory: semi-empirical (PM3) conformational search in vacuo and molecular dynamics with explicit solvent based on the biomolecular (GROMOS) force field. The results indicate that the values of glycosidic dihedral angles can vary in a very similar range, independently of the disaccharide composition. The presence of interresidual hydrogen bonds involving carboxyl groups reduces the ability for calcium ion binding. The type and the concentration of cations in the solution do not practically affect the conformation of disaccharides. Both disaccharides and the oligosaccharides composed of corresponding units exhibit a similar degree of conformational flexibility; only in the case of oligosaccharides containing the \u03b1-l-guluronate units, the glycosidic bonds are much more rigid when compared to those of disaccharides.",

The cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils to inflammatory sites. Here, we investigated the interaction of heparin hexasaccharides and recombinant human IL-8, consisting of 77 amino acids using fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. A dissociation constant of 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcM was determined for the heparin\u2013IL-8 complex, which is slightly higher than what has been found for chondroitin-6-sulfate (KD\u00a0=\u00a01.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcM) [Pichert, A.; Samsonov, S.

Only the incubation of heparin with IL-8 affected the IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils.

The catalytic mechanism of such enzymes is not yet fully understood and its study remains a challenge for both experimental and theoretical researches. In the case of ret-GTs where a well defined nucleophilic agent is identified in the vicinity of the anomeric center, a double-displacement mechanism via a covalent enzyme-glycosyl intermediate is commonly assumed and has received some experimental support, although not direct and univocal evidence has been obtained so far. This is the case for \u03b1-(1\u21923)-galactosyltransferase (\u03b13GalT), a ret-GT from Bos taurus where a glutamate (Glu317) is in suitable position to act as a nucleophile. Here we perform density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on the full \u03b13GalT enzyme to analyze the role of Glu317 in the catalytic process. This is done not only for the double-displacement mechanism, where the function of the nucleophile is obvious, but also in the scenario of a front-side attack mechanism (via an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (SNi) or an ion-pair oxocarbenium intermediate (SNi-like)). Glu317 is found to be essential in both cases. For a front-side attack, this residue would have a key role in leaving group departure and consequent stabilization of the increasing positive charge at the anomeric center. This finding alerts on the interpretation of the mutagenesis data as both, the formation of a covalent intermediate and a SNi or a SNi-like mechanism \u2018assisted\u2019 by a nucleophile, could be consistent with experiment. In addition, it could explain why the covalent enzyme-glycosyl intermediate has never been isolated.",

The catalytic reaction proceeds in two NAD+-dependent steps via covalent thiohemiacetal and thioester enzyme intermediates. Formation of the thiohemiacetal adduct occurs through attack of Cys276 on C-6 of the UDP-gluco-hexodialdose produced in the first oxidation step. Because previous studies of the related enzyme from bovine liver had suggested loss of the C-5 hydrogen from UDP-gluco-hexodialdose due to keto-enol tautomerism, we examined incorporation of solvent deuterium into product(s) of UDP-glucose oxidation by hUGDH. We used wild-type enzyme and a slow-reacting Glu161\u2192Gln mutant that accumulates the thioester adduct at steady state. In situ proton NMR measurements showed that UDP-glucuronic acid was the sole detectable product of both enzymatic transformations. The product contained no deuterium at C-5 within the detection limit (\u2a7d2%). The results are consistent with the proposed mechanistic idea for hUGDH that incipient UDP-gluco-hexodialdose is immediately trapped by thiohemiacetal adduct formation.",

One isolate, denoted as BLT1C was selected from this screening, and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) classified the strain as Hypocrea lixii. The secretome of BLT1C showed high xylanase activity (compared to that of two reference Trichoderma reesei strains) when cultivated using brave straw, an abundant native grass from the area, as carbon source. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis revealed three main protein-bands (18, 32 and 65\u00a0kDa) and in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry combined with activity analysis showed that these proteins were active xylanases with molecular masses corresponding to (I) a single glycoside hydrolase family 11 catalytic module (18\u00a0kDa), and (II, III) modular enzymes, with the GH11 catalytic domain connected to a module of unknown function (32\u00a0kDa) or putatively connected to a GH7 catalytic module (65\u00a0kDa). The N-terminal sequence of the 65\u00a0kDa xylanase did not show significant sequence similarities to deposited sequences.

When performed in D2O, enzymatic phosphorolysis of d-glucal proceeds with incorporation of deuterium in equatorial position at C-2, implying a stereochemical course of reaction where substrate becomes protonated from below its six-membered ring through stereoselective re side attack at C-2. The proposed catalytic mechanism, which is supported by results of docking studies, involves direct protonation of d-glucal by the enzyme-bound phosphate, which then performs nucleophilic attack on the reactive C-1 of donor substrate. When offered d-glucose next to d-glucal and phosphate, CuCPase produces 2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-glucosyl-(1\u21924)-d-glucose and 2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-glucose 1-phosphate in a ratio governed by mass action of the two acceptor substrates present. Enzymatic synthesis of 2-deoxy-\u03b2-d-glucosyl-(1\u21924)-d-glucose is effectively promoted by catalytic concentrations of phosphate, suggesting that catalytic reaction proceeds through a quaternary complex of CuCPase, d-glucal, phosphate, and d-glucose.

It adopts a conformationally restricted chair with two indomethacin groups in the sterically hindered 1,3-diaxial positions. Acid-induced cleavage of the orthoacetate lock of the prodrug leads to a ring flip of the myo-inositol ring with the two indomethacin groups now in 1,3-diequatorial positions. This increases the susceptibility of hydrolysis of the ester groups to release indomethacin under acidic conditions. The long half-life (152\u00a0min) of decomposition of (2) at \u223cpH 1\u20132 suggests that it may bypass the stomach with minimal hydrolysis upon oral administration. Indomethacin ester (2) was completely stable at pH 4.0\u20138.5 over 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and showed comparable activity to indomethacin in a COX-2 assay (pH 8.0).",

A dichotomy arises as to why 61 studies from 1964 to the present have had to add a carbohydrate primer to obtain starch-synthase activity. All of these studies used 25\u2013100\u00a0mM Tris, Bicine, or Tricine buffers. We have found that the Tris-type buffers completely inhibit starch-synthase at these concentrations. The addition of 10\u00a0mg/mL of the putative primers, glycogen and maltotetraose, gave a partial reversal of the inhibition, with glycogen being better than maltotetraose. It has been found that the Tris-type buffers form a complex with the ADPGlc substrate, removing it from the digest, causing the inhibition. The addition of the putative primers releases some of the ADPGlc from the complex, permitting it to act as a substrate for starch-synthase. The study definitively shows that the need for primers for starch-synthase by many investigators from 1964 to the present has been caused by Tris-type buffer inhibition that was partially reversed by putative primers. This has led to the perpetuation of the primer myth for the biosynthesis of starch chains by starch-synthase.",

The SDS\u2013PAGE results show its molecular mass is around 41\u00a0kDa, with a purity of more than 95%. The purified chitosanase exhibits optimum activity at 50\u00a0\u00b0C, pH 5.0. It is stable between 30 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C and at pH values between 5 and 7. It shows the highest activity towards colloidal chitosan and breaks down glycol chitosan and glycol chitin weakly. The enzyme is significantly inhibited by Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and EDTA, but slightly activated by Mg2+. Further action mode analysis based on chitosan oligomers and a polymer reveals that the chitosanase could split chitooligosaccharides with degree of polymerization (DP) >4 and chitosan in an endolytic manner. The resultant hydrolytes are mainly chitotrisaccharides, indicating it is suitable for the uniform bioconversion of chitosan and its derivatives with high efficiency.",

In control rabbits, intake of CS for 20 and 30\u00a0days did not affect CYP3A6, CYP1A2 and NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) mRNA, protein expression and activity. Compared with control rabbits, the TIIR not only reduced mRNA, protein expression and activity of CYP3A6 and CYP1A2 but also that of CPR. In rabbits with TIIR, CS prevented the decrease of CYP3A6 expression but not the reduction in activity. CS did not impede TIIR-induced down-regulation of CYP1A2.

Laboratory crystallization was operated at 65.5\u00a0\u00b0C (150\u00a0\u00b0F), 60.0\u00a0\u00b0C (140\u00a0\u00b0F), and 51.7\u00a0\u00b0C (125\u00a0\u00b0F) with a 78.0 Brix (% refractometric dissolved solids) pure sucrose syrup containing 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, and 10% (at 65.5\u00a0\u00b0C only) mannitol on a Brix basis. Produced mother liquor and crystals were separated by centrifugation and their mannitol contents measured by ion chromatography with integrated pulsed amperometric detection (IC-IPAD). The extent of mannitol partitioning into the crystals depended strongly on the mannitol concentration in the feed syrup and, to a lesser extent, the crystallization temperature. At 65.5 and 60.0\u00a0\u00b0C, the Keff varied from \u223c0.4% to 3.0% with 0.2% to 3.0% mannitol in the feed syrup, respectively. The mannitol Keff was lower than that reported for dextran (\u223c9\u201310% Keff), another product of Leuconstoc deterioration, under similar sucrose crystal growth conditions. At 10% mannitol concentration in the syrup at 65.5\u00a0\u00b0C, co-crystallization of mannitol with sucrose occurred and the crystal growth rate was greatly impeded. In both laboratory and pilot plant crystallizations (95.7% purity; 78.0 Brix; 65.5\u00a0\u00b0C), mannitol tended to cause conglomerates to form, which became progressively worse with increased mannitol syrup concentration. At the 3% mannitol concentration, crystallization at both the laboratory and pilot plant scales was more difficult. Mannitol incorporation into the sucrose crystal results mostly from liquid syrup inclusions but adsorption onto the crystal surface may play a minor role at lower mannitol concentrations.",

The moderate enantioselectivity was attributed to the two different binding models between CD-1 and thioanisole, which could be defined as intramolecular catalysis and intermolecular catalysis, in which intramolecular catalysis gave (S)-methyl phenyl sulfoxide and intermolecular catalysis gave (R,S)-methyl phenyl sulfoxide.",

     "abstract": "6-Gingerol [(S)-5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)decan-3-one] is a biologically active compound and is abundant in the rhizomes of ginger (Zingiber officinale). It has some beneficial functions in healthcare, but its use is limited because of its insolubility in water and its heat-instability. To improve these physical properties, the glucosylation of 6-gingerol was investigated using \u03b1-glucosidases (EC. 3.2.1.20) from Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus nidulans ABPU1, Acremonium strictum, Halomonas sp. H11, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTase, EC. 2.4.1.19) from Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus sp. No. 38-2, Bacillus clarkii 7364, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Among these, only \u03b1-glucosidase from Halomonas sp. H11 (HaG) transferred a glucosyl moiety to 6-gingerol, and produced glucosylated compounds. The chemical structure of the reaction product, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, was (S)-5-(O-\u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)decan-3-one (5-\u03b1-Glc-gingerol). Notably, the regioisomer formed by glucosylation of the phenolic OH was not observed at all, indicating that HaG specifically transferred the glucose moiety to the 5-OH of the \u03b2-hydroxy keto group in 6-gingerol. Almost 60% of the original 6-gingerol was converted into 5-\u03b1-Glc-gingerol by the reaction. In contrast to 6-gingerol, 5-\u03b1-Glc-gingerol, in the form of an orange powder prepared by freeze-drying, was water-soluble and stable at room temperature. It was also more stable than 6-gingerol under acidic conditions and to heat.",

Structural characterization of the isolated surface polysaccharides from two strains confirmed the presence of the conserved water soluble polysaccharide originally described by Ganeshapillai et al. which was composed of a hexaglycosyl phosphate repeat consisting of [\u21926)-\u03b2-d-Glcp-(1-3)-\u03b2-d-GalpNAc-(1-4)-\u03b1-d-Glcp-(1-4)-[\u03b2-d-Glcp(1-3]-\u03b2-d-GalpNAc-(1-3)-\u03b1-d-Manp-(1-P\u2192].

Spores are the infectious form of C. difficile, which germinate into toxin-producing vegetative cells in response to bile acids. Recently, we discovered that C. difficile cells possess three complex polysaccharides (PSs), named PSI, PSII, and PSIII, in which PSI was only associated with a hypervirulent ribotype 027 strain, PSII was hypothesized to be a common antigen, and PSIII was a water-insoluble polymer. Here, we show that (i) C. difficile spores contain, at least in part, a d-glucan, (ii) PSI is not a ribotype 027-unique antigen, (iii) common antigen PSII may in part be present as a low molecular weight lipoteichoic acid, (iv) selective hydrolysis of PSII yields single PSII repeat units, (v) the glycosyl diester\u2013phosphate linkage affords high flexibility to PSII, and (vi) that PSII is immunogenic in sows.

     "abstract": "An approximate model for the delactonization of tri-sialic acid lactone is presented with two water-layers that led to neutral hydrolysis of \u03b4-lactone. The hydrolytic reactivity was studied with a 10-ns in-solution molecular dynamics simulation. The initial step of this hydrolysis involves a reactant water nucleophile complex via a proton transfer with another water molecule. Therefore, the probability of water molecules localized at the hydrolytic center correlates to the hydrolysis of \u03b4-lactone. The stepwise delactonization of \u03b12,8-(NeuAc)3 lactone results/resulted from water concentration discrepancy near the carbonyl carbon of lactones in two water oxygen\u22efcarbonyl carbon shells, and the distances of OC\u22efOwater layers were 2.8\u00a0\u00c5 and 5.1\u00a0\u00c5. Based on in-solution molecular dynamics study, the motion of water molecules over the re-face of the carbonyl groups was used for the quantitative description of the residence probability, p, whose value is 0.11 for lactone I and 0.33 for lactone II. The geometric criteria used to determine the residence statistics are (1) the distance of water\u2013oxygen\u22efcarbonyl carbon in less than 5.1\u00a0\u00c5 and (2) the cone angle, \u03b8, of carbonyl OC\u22efOwater in the range of 85\u2013115\u00b0. As expected, a higher residence probability at lactone II led to its faster hydrolysis. Both the radial g(r) and angular p(\u03b8) pair distribution functions of water oxygen and carbonyl groups of lactones ensure a better surrounding hydration encounter for lactone II. In contrast, water molecules around lactone I are deduced due to a steric hindrance by the turn structure of \u03b12,8-(NeuAc)3 lactone.",

The reaction also shows slight increase in the rate by decreasing dielectric constant of the medium and remains unaffected by the change in ionic strength of the medium. The reaction was carried out at four different temperatures and observed values of rate constants were utilized to calculate various activation parameters specially the entropy of activation (\u0394S#). The species, [RhCl3(H2O)2OH]\u2212, was postulated as the main reactive species of Rh(III) chloride for the oxidation of lactose by Cu(II) in alkaline medium. On the basis of kinetic and equivalence studies together with spectrophotometric information for the formation of a complex, the most appropriate mechanism for the aforesaid reaction has been proposed. Support to the proposed mechanism was also given by the observed activation parameters and multiple regression analysis.

Xylogluco-oligosaccharide aminoalditols (XGO-NH2) were coupled to both linear and cyclic peptides, which contained the endothelial cell epitope Arg-Gly-Asp, in a facile two-step approach employing diethyl squarate cross-linking. Subsequent xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase-mediated coupling of the resulting XGO-GRGDS (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser) and XGO-c[RGDfK]-PEG-PEG (cyclo[Arg-Gly-Asp-(d-Phe)-Lys]-PEG-PEG; where PEG is 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid) conjugates into high molecular mass xyloglucan yielded xyloglucan-RGD peptide conjugates suitable for cellulose surface activation. Notably, use of XGO-squaramate as a readily accessible, versatile intermediate overcomes previous limitations of solid-phase synthetic approaches to XGO-peptide conjugates, and furthermore allows the method to be generalized to a wide variety of polypeptides and proteins, as well as diverse primary amino compounds.",

An intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl H(O)3 and a carbonyl oxygen from the dimethylmaleoyl (DMM) group was observed. This was in agreement with previous NMR temperature shift determinations and molecular modeling. The determination has also found an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the second hydroxyl H(O)4 and the other carbonyl oxygen (generated by symmetry) from DMM. The crystal structure was optimized by five different functionals, namely the hybrid methods B3LYP, M06-2X, B3PW91, and PBE0, and the pure functional PBE, and the optimized geometries were compared with the crystal geometry and with MM3. An excellent coincidence of the geometries was found with the five quantum methods, with minor details deviating from this coincidence. PBE tends to yield larger bond distances, whereas M06-2X fails slightly to match the exocyclic torsion angles for the sugar moiety. In any case, the differences are small, implying that any of these functionals can accurately emulate the geometries of a complex carbohydrate derivative like this one.",

No significant scavenging activity of PM and PG toward hydrogen peroxide was observed. Interestingly, the macrophage-stimulation activity of PG as measured by nitric oxide (NO)-production from mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells was evidently stronger than that of PM.

Here we describe a method for the labeling of oligosaccharide mixtures with a fluorogenic pyrylium dye to enable analysis by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS). The unreacted free dye, Py-1, is effectively non-fluorescent but when conjugated to the analyte it displays strong fluorescence at 600\u2013640\u00a0nm. Removal of excess dye following labeling is not required prior to analysis unlike for many traditional oligosaccharide labels. Labeling is achieved in two steps; the oligosaccharide mixtures are first functionalized with an ethylenediamine moiety via reductive amination at the reducing-end sugar, then the remaining free primary amine is reacted with the pyrylium dye (Py-1) under basic conditions to form a pyridinium ion. We have labeled mixtures of maltooligosaccharides and observed good peak separation in CE analysis using a SDS/borate pH 9.3 running buffer. Excellent sensitivity in MALDI-ToF-MS analysis enabled detection of oligosaccharides with up to 58 glucose units.",

The results were compared to those previously found for O-, S-, and C-\u03b2-glycoside analogs. While the rotational populations of the hydroxymethyl group in O-, S-, and C-glycosides are known to depend on the structural nature of their aglycon, in carbasugars it proved to be independent of the pseudo-aglycon. This result confirms that endocyclic oxygen is necessary for the observed relationship between the structure of the aglycon and the rotational populations of the hydroxymethyl group, and indicates that the stereoelectronic exo-anomeric effect is mainly responsible for such conformational dependence.",

In this study, the PHAMCL synthesis pathway was blocked by a deletion of approximately 57% of the sequence of PHA synthase operon mediated by the suicide plasmid, pEX18TcC1ZC2Amp. Deletion of the PHA synthase operon in P. mendocina NK-01 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibiotic resistance assays to form the gene knockout mutant, P. mendocina C7. Shake-flask and 30\u00a0L fermentor cultures of P. mendocina C7 showed a 2.21-fold and 2.64-fold accumulation of AO from glucose, respectively, compared with the wild-type strain. Mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography characterization revealed that P. mendocina C7 and P. mendocina NK-01 produced AO were identical in terms of monomer composition and average molecular weight (MW). Thus, the mutant P. mendocina C7 has potential use in large scale fermentation of AO. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the PHAMCL and AO synthesis pathways compete for the use of carbon sources in P. mendocina NK-01.",

Sucrose was used as a model compound to illustrate the applicability of this technique. The hydrolysis of sucrose was shown to follow pseudo first order kinetics and have an activation energy of 107.0\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 (SD 1.7\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121). Inulin, pullulan and glycogen also all followed pseudo first order kinetics, but had an initiation phase at least partially generated by the protonation of the glycosidic bonds. It was also demonstrated that polysaccharide chain length has an effect on the hydrolysis of inulin. For short chain inulin (DPn 18, SD 0.70) the activation energy calculated for the hydrolytic cleavage of glucose was similar to sucrose at 108.5\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 (SD 0.60).

The lipid A backbone was composed of a \u03b2-(1\u21926)-linked 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcpN3N) disaccharide and \u03b1-d-glucuronic acid (GlcpA). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that the GlcpA was connected to the reducing end of the diaminosugar disaccharide via an \u03b1-(1\u21921) glycosidic bond. The lipid A was deprived of phosphate residues. ESI-MS analysis showed that the lipid A preparation was a mixture of molecules due to the occurrence of different acylation patterns. The GlcpN3N disaccharide backbone was N-acylated at the C-2, C-3, C-2\u2032 and C-3\u2032 positions with 3-OH-18:0, 3-OH-14:0, 3-OH-20:1 and 3-OH-14:0 fatty acids, respectively. Nonpolar fatty acids as well as 3-OH-18:0 were found to be ester-linked. They were attached to hydroxyl groups of primary 3-OH fatty acids giving three acyloxyacyl moieties. Thus, the complete lipid A from A. caulinodans comprised seven acyl residues. Part of the lipid A molecules was esterified by 3-methoxybutyric acid. Azorhizobium caulinodans did not incorporate \u03c9-1 hydroxylated very long chain fatty acids (e.g., 27-OH-28:0) into the lipid A, which makes this variant of endotoxin unusual among rhizobial lipids A.",

Reactions of four different concentrations of starch-synthase, with constant ADPGlc concentration and temperature, gave four amylose chains, each with different number average molecular weights that were inversely proportional to the concentration of the enzyme, indicating that the synthesis was processive.

Chemical modification is often needed to tailor such water-soluble polysaccharides into industrially valuable compounds. In this work, treatment of GGM with butyric and benzoic anhydride in pyridine/dimethylformamide rendered GGM derivatives, which were hydrophobic and partially soluble in organic solvents. The degree of substitution can be adjusted by varying the quantity of the reagent and reaction temperature. The dn/dc value for the benzoyl ester of GGM was determined in 0.05\u00a0M LiBr DMSO in order to obtain accurate molar mass analysis with SEC-MALLS-RI. Novel substances with adjusted hydrophobicity can thus be prepared on one step synthesis from natural hemicelluloses, which then showed a slight increase in the molar mass upon esterification.",

Electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI\u2013MS) with collision induced dissociation (CID) up to MS3 experiments of oligosaccharides obtained by partial methanolysis or partial acid hydrolysis indicated the presence of Man\u2192Man- and Ara\u2192Ara- as well as Ara\u2192Man- and also Man\u2192Ara-sequences.

The Gibbs free energies, relative Gibbs free energies and geometry parameters are presented for all the optimized structures. Conformational analysis of both the acetoxy groups and 1,2-unsaturated pyranoid ring is performed. It is demonstrated that the acetoxy group is planar and adopts two conformations with regard to the Ac-O bond rotations, one of which is strongly preferred. One of the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group is always oriented synperiplanarly whereas the remaining two anticlinally with respect to the carbonyl oxygen. With regard to the AcO\u2013R bond rotations some of the orientations are forbidden. The calculations indicate that 3,4-di-O-acetyl-d-arabinal adopts mainly the 4H5 conformation, whereas 3,4-di-O-acetyl-d-xylal prefers the 5H4 form, owing to the vinylogous anomeric effect (VAE). Competition between the VAE and quasi 1,3-diaxial interactions means that both 3,4-di-O-acetyl-d-rhamnal and 3,4-di-O-acetyl-d-fucal remain in the 4H5 \u21c4 5H4 conformational equilibrium, shifted in the 4H5 direction.

In this study, we prepared S- and R-form MEL homologs with similar fatty acyl groups, and compared their interfacial properties. Among the four diastereomers (S-MEL-B and -D/R-MEL-B and -D), R-form MELs showed a higher critical aggregation concentration and hydrophilicity compared to the corresponding S-form. R-form MELs also efficiently formed relatively large vesicles compared to S-form. Moreover, we estimated the binary phase diagram of the MEL\u2013water system and compared the aqueous phase behavior among the four diastereomers. The present MELs self-assembled into a lamellar (L\u03b1) structure at all concentration ranges. Meanwhile, the one-phase L\u03b1 region of R-form MELs was wider than those of S-form MELs. R-form MELs may maintain more water between the polar layers in accordance with an extension of the interlayer spacing. These results suggest that the differences in MEL carbohydrate configurations significantly affect interfacial properties, self-assembly, and hydrate ability.",

The three dimensional structure and conformation of \u03b1-Neu5Ac in biological environments can be clearly observed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. A 10\u00a0ns MD simulation on \u03b1-Neu5Ac yields two conformational models which are stabilized by water mediated hydrogen bond between O-8/O-9 hydroxyl oxygen and carbonyl of carboxylate group. The average life time of the conformers and the residual time of water which mediates the hydrogen bonding interactions are computed. Based on the amphiprotic nature of water, water mediation of each conformer is divided into two different modes, one donor\u2013one acceptor mode and two donor modes. According to the analysis of simulation trajectories, the preferred mode of water mediation for conformers is the one donor\u2013one acceptor mode. The energy and geometry of the MD derived conformational models of \u03b1-Neu5Ac are optimized using HF/6-31G\u2217 basis set of Gaussian03. QM calculations also resulted that \u03b1-Neu5Ac is preferentially stabilized by water mediated hydrogen bonding between O-8 hydroxyl and the carboxylate group where the mediation is one donor\u2013one acceptor type.

An amorphous sugar matrix exhibits high hygroscopicity, and it has been established that the sorbed water lowers the glass transition temperature Tg of the amorphous sugar matrix. It is naturally expected that the random allocation and configuration of sugar molecules would result in heterogeneity of states for sorbed water. However, most analyses of the behavior of water, when sorbed to an amorphous sugar matrix, have implicitly assumed that all of the sorbed water molecules are in a single state. In this study, the states of water molecules sorbed in an amorphous sugar matrix were analyzed by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy and a Fourier self-deconvolution technique. When sorbed water molecules were classified into five states, according to the extent to which they are restricted, three of the states resulted in a lowering of Tg of an amorphous sugar matrix, while the other two were independent of the plasticization of the matrix. This finding provides an explanation for the paradoxical fact that compression at several hundreds of MPa significantly decreases the equilibrium water content at a given RH, while the Tg remains unchanged.",

The 6-deoxy-hexose isolated from acid hydrolysate of the polysaccharide extracted from L. lividatus was involved in four anomeric isomers (\u03b1-pyranose and \u03b2-pyranose, and \u03b1-furanose and \u03b2-furanose), as was chemically synthesized 6-deoxy-d-altrose in an aqueous solution because of mutarotation. Almost all signals of 1D (1H NMR and 13C NMR) and 2D (COSY and HMQC)-NMR spectra agreed with those of the authentic 6-deoxy-d-altrose. The specific optical rotation [\u03b1]589 of 6-deoxy-sugar showed a value of +18.2\u00b0, which was in agreement with that of authentic 6-deoxy-d-altrose. Consequently, 6-deoxy-hexose was identified as the 6-deoxy-d-altrose. This work is the first complete identification of 6-deoxy-d-altrose in a natural environment.",

The structural properties of 60S were elucidated by partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, and MALDI-TOF-MS. The results of the partial acid hydrolysis and methylation analysis indicated that the main chain of 60S consisted of (1\u21924)-linked d-Manp and (1\u21924)-linked d-Glcp in a molar ratio of 1:1.3. Over half of the glucosyl residues in the main chain were branched at the O-6 position. The terminal sugar residues were mainly composed of T-Araf, T-Arap, T-Galp, T-GlcpA, and T-Glcp. Besides, 3-Araf and 2-Galp were also observed in comparable amounts. Based on all the aforementioned results and the data obtained by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy as well as MALDI-TOF-MS, a structure of 60S is proposed as follows:R could be one or some of -(3-\u03b1-Araf)n-(A), T-\u03b1-Galp\u00a0(B), T-\u03b1-Glcp\u00a0(C), T-Araf\u00a0(H) or T-Arap.",

This bacterium produces two unique fully pyruvylated exopolysaccharides in similar quantities: an \u03b1-(1\u21922)-linked mannan and a \u03b2-(1\u21923)-linked glucan. We employed molecular modelling methods to probe the characteristic conformations and dynamics of these polysaccharides, with corroboration from potentiometric titrations and circular dichroism experiments. Our calculations reveal different structural motifs for the mannan and glucan polysaccharides: the glucan forms primarily right-handed helices with a wide range of extensions, while the mannan forms only left-handed helices. This finding is supported by our circular dichroism experiments. Our calculations also show that the (1\u21923)-\u03b2-d-Glcp linkage is more dynamically flexible than the (1\u21922)-\u03b1-d-Manp: the glucan characteristically forms a range of wide helices with large central cavities.

An anti-glycogen monoclonal antibody (IV58B6) and newly constructed antibody (ESG1A9mAb) have a common immunoglobulin type (IgM) and binding ability to glycogens, but overall possess different binding features. Therefore, they may prove useful for the construction of an advanced system of quantitative ELISA based on their molecular structures. For this purpose, detailed information on the carbohydrate-specificities of ESG1A9mAb and IV58B6 is first required, but their fine specificities for various types of glycogens have not been elucidated. To overcome this problem, we performed interaction analysis by ELISA of ESG1A9mAb and IV58B6 toward 15 glucose polymers, that is, 5 enzymatically-synthesized glycogens (ESGs), 6 natural source glycogens (NSGs), 3 enzymatically digested glycogens (EDGs), and soluble starch. To provide a more detailed analysis, we determined the association constants (Ka) of the two antibodies toward these glycogens by surface plasmon resonance. The results indicated that the carbohydrate-binding properties toward NSGs of ESG1A9mAb and IV58B6 were similar, but markedly differed for ESGs and EDGs. ESG1A9mAb showed significant affinity for all the ESGs and NSGs tested, whereas IV58B6 had only slight affinity for ESGs, although the affinities were increased when the ESGs were enzymatically digested. This information should be helpful for the design of both in vitro and in vivo immunological assays.",

Among them sulfated chitooligosaccharides (SCOSs) have been identified to possess enhanced biological activities. This study reports the effects of SCOSs with different molecular weights on the degradation of articular cartilage through unregulated collagenase expression. The results indicated that the SCOS II (3\u20135\u00a0kDa) effectively inhibited the expressions of collagenases 1 and 3 and thereby prevented TNF-\u03b1 induced degradation of collagen in human chondrosarcoma cells (SW-1353). Moreover, the signaling cascade responsible for this effect was found as SCOS II mediated suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. Based on these data, it can be concluded that SCOS II prevented collagen degradation by inhibiting collagenases 1 and 3 via suppressing TNF-\u03b1 induced NF-\u03baB signaling. We suggest that SCOS II can be further studied as a potential candidate for the treatment of arthritis.",

     "abstract": "We synthesized new dispersive chitosan particles at circumneutral pH. Particles composed of a chitosan\u2013borate complex were synthesized by a method consisting of two simple steps: mixture and dialysis. As this method does not employ reagents such as organic solvents or surface-active agents and does not require heat treatment, it has a minimal negative impact on the environment. Crosslinking of the reaction of glucose and boric acid at ordinary temperature and pressure led to the formation of composite particles. Stereoscopic microscopy and investigation of the particle size distribution by dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that particles ranging in size from submicrons to several microns with high dispersibility in water were obtained. Even after heat treatment at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 12\u00a0h, the particles maintained their composite formation, indicating that they have high thermal stability. Chitosan powders demonstrated inadequate antimicrobial properties at circumneutral pH, but the particles of the chitosan\u2013borate complex had antimicrobial properties against the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, and the gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, as well as the fungi Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani.

Principle of the method is that the sample reacts with excessive acid, and the excessive acid is measured by alkaline titration. The refractive index of an aqueous chitosan solution was monitored and recorded in the course of acid-base titration. This gives a titration curve having two inflexion points and the difference between the two points corresponds to the volume of base required to neutralize the ammonium groups. It was proved that flocculation did not interfere with the measurement. The method is found to be low-cost, precise, and easy to operate for industrial applications. The DD values of three chitosan samples obtained with this new method show good agreement with those yielded from 1H NMR.

This research provides a basis for the evaluation of chitosan/silver composites in applications requiring flexible films with tuned optical properties and antimicrobial activity.",

Both polymers are exopolysaccharides of d-mannose. The mannan isolated from P. mutabilis T6 contains on average about 5% of residual \u03b2-d-glucose, in contrast to the mannan from P. mutabilis ATCC 31014, which contained only trace amounts of residual \u03b2-d-glucose (less than 1%). Based on the 13C NMR spectra, all of the remaining carbohydrates in the exopolysaccharides occur in the form of pyranose rings. All of the mannose residues have the \u03b1 configuration at the anomeric carbon atom while the glucose adopts the \u03b2 configuration. The reaction of both polysaccharide hydrolysates with an optically active alcohol indicates that all of the sugar residues have the d configuration. We found that the main chain of the exopolysaccharide is composed of mannose residues connected through \u03b1-(1\u21926) linkages, of which a large number are substituted on O2 with d-mannose and the remaining are substituted with di- to pentasaccharide fragments. The rheological properties of the exopolysaccharide isolated from P. mutabilis T6 show that its viscosity is over 30 times greater than that of P. mutabilis ATCC 31014.",

     "abstract": "The hydrophilic features of natural fibers (NFs) hinder the widespread application of natural fiber/polymer composites due to the hydroxyl groups (\u2013OH) presented in the cellulose molecule. Detecting reactive hydroxyl groups in NFs is very important for optimizing the modification process of natural fibers. This paper proposes a simple and practical methodology to measure reactive hydroxyl groups in NFs using a isocyanate group, a method we term the isocyanate group back titration (IBT) method. Application of the IBT method to ramie fiber with toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and hexadecanol indicated that the measured value of reactive hydroxyl groups was about 150\u00a0mg KOH/g, which was less than the theoretical value of hydroxyl groups in the ramie fiber being tested. The FTIR analysis revealed that the TDI and hexadecanol were grafted onto the surface of the ramie fiber, leading the modified ramie fiber to be hydrophobic. Thus, the IBT method is also useful for modifying the surface properties of NFs and improving their compatibility with polymers, and finally leading to good mechanical properties of NF/polymer composites.",

The A units were found mostly pyruvylated, 2-sulfated (\u223c34%), and 6-methylated (\u223c34%), with the latter partially 2- and 2,4-sulfated. Minor amounts of \u03b2-d-galactopyranosyl units 2-, 6- and 2,6-sulfated, 6-glycosylated, and non-substituted are also present. The B-units are l-sugars composed predominantly of their cyclized derivatives, 3,6-anhydrogalactose and 3,6-anhydro-2-O-methylgalactose (\u223c56%).

Kinetic studies suggest that in P. flagellifera agaran the cyclizable units are linked to 6-O-methyl-\u03b2-d-galactosyl and/or \u03b2-d-galactosyl units (6-glycosylated). The structural complexity of this polysaccharide is increased by the presence of 2- and 3,6-sulfated \u03b1-l-galactoses, with the latter additionally 2-O-methylated. Therefore, the major subfraction obtained from the cold extract contains structurally complex sulfated, methylated, and pyruvylated agaran.",

     "abstract": "The development of a MALDI-TOF MS method for the quantitative analysis of the glycosylation of CHO-expressed biotherapeutic glycoproteins shall be presented. The method utilizes a well-established chemistry, reductive amination of glycans, to derivatize glycans with either a light analog (12C7 anthranilic acid) or a heavy analog (13C7 anthranilic acid) to allow for the direct comparison of the alternately-labeled glycans by MALDI-TOF MS. The method allows for the simultaneous analysis of neutral and sialylated glycans and displays a linear dynamic range over two orders of magnitude with sub-picomolar sensitivity. Additionally, because the glycans are derivatized with anthranilic acid, which is a very sensitive fluorophore, the glycans can be analyzed by chromatography with fluorescence detection. The need for this type of method is highlighted by the biotechnology/biopharmaceutical industry\u2019s continuous drive towards fully understanding process control. By providing this type of quantitative data, glycosylation changes of the expressed protein can be easily observed thereby helping to further advance the understanding of a major aspect of the biopharmaceutical process.",

     "abstract": "A new method for the determination of oligosaccharide chains, known as the D60 one-dimensional TOCSY method is introduced in this paper. The results show that the use of this method enables a more effective coherent long-range magnetic relay transfer compared with that of existing DIPSI-2 and MMDY methods. Further, the method is easy to use and is not sensitive to the error of the pulse width. Without complex z-filtering steps, the high-quality sub-spectrum of pure absorption can be quickly obtained, which facilitates sub-spectroscopy detection for the existence of weak spin-coupling sugar components in the saccharide ring. Glycosides are taken as examples to discuss the characteristics of this method and its application in the determination of oligosaccharides in spectrum peak height.",

The degree of substitution (DS) of xylan acetates ranged between 0.9 and 2.0 as a function of experimental conditions. Due to the problems of toxicity and recycling of DMF, an alternative method of esterification is reported in the second part of this work, performing in the absence of organic solvent and using DMAP or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) as catalysts. Acetylation reaction catalyzed by MSA was developed through an experimental design in order to achieve the highest DS under the mildest conditions. The significant factors and their interactions were identified. The optimization of reaction parameters allowed to obtain a high DS (1.6) and maximal yield (85%). Moreover, the reactivity of propionic and hexanoic anhydrides was evaluated and hydrophobic xylan esters with low degrees of substitution were obtained.",

The repeating unit of cepacian consists of a backbone having a trisaccharidic repeating unit with three side chains, as reported in the formula below. The exopolysaccharide is also acetylated, carrying from one to three acetyl esters per repeating unit, depending on the strain examined. The consequences of O-acetyl substitution in a polysaccharide are important both for its biological functions and for industrial applications, including the preparation of conjugated vaccines, since O-acetyl groups are important immunogenic determinants. The location of acetyl groups was achieved by NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry and revealed that these substituents are scattered in non-stoichiometric ratio on many sugar residues in different positions, a feature which adds to the already unique carbohydrate structure of the polysaccharide.",

Water molecules significantly reduce the energy barrier of the hemiacetal formation occurring between the open-chain and furanose configurations. The energy barrier is optimally reduced by two water molecules. Methanol yields a smaller transition state barrier than the one obtained with a single water molecule.

The analysis showed that the breakage of the interaction between the H1, H3, and H5 hydrogens of the pyranose ring and the acetyl carbonyl oxygen in the C01 and C02 adjacent chains would be crucial for the dissolution of CTA.

However, recent results on a series of Guerbet glycosides have indicated similar liquid crystal clearing temperatures for pure \u03b2-glucosides and the corresponding \u03b1-galactosides. This observation has led to speculation on similarities in the self-assembly interactions between the two systems, attributed to the trans-configuration of the 4-OH group and the hydrophobic aglycon. Previous simulations on related bilayers systems support this hypothesis, by relating this clearing transition temperature to intralayer (sugar\u2013sugar) hydrogen bonding. In order to confirm the hypothesis, the comparison was expanded to include the cis-configurated pair, that is, \u03b1-gluco/\u03b2-galactoside. A set of \u03b1-configurated Guerbet glucosides as well as octyl \u03b1-galactoside were prepared and their thermotropic phase behavior studied. The data obtained enabled a complete comparison of the isomers of interest. While the results in general are in line with a pairing of the stereo-isomers according to the indicated cis/trans-configuration, differences within the pairs can be explained based on the direction of hydrogen bonds from a simple modeling study.",

In this work, recombinant human CtMGAM has been cloned for the first time, and this, combined with the expression of NtMGAM in Pichia pastoris, made it possible for us to study the catalytic mechanism of MGAM in a well-defined system. The enzymatic kinetic assays of the two catalytic domains suggest that CtMGAM has the higher affinity for longer maltose oligosaccharides. Kinetic studies of commercially-available drugs such as 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), miglitol, voglibose, and acarbose along with a series of acarviosine-containing oligosaccharides we isolated from Streptomyces coelicoflavus against NtMGAM, CtMGAM, and human pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (HPA) provide us an overall profile of the inhibitory ability of these inhibitors. Of all the inhibitors used in this paper, DNJ was the most effective inhibitor against MGAM; the Ki values for the two catalytic domains were 1.41 and 2.04\u00a0\u03bcM for NtMGAM and CtMGAM, respectively. Acarviostatins 2-03 and 3-03 were the best inhibitors against HPA with relatively high inhibitory activity against CtMGAM.

Strain M71 ability to persist on the tomato rhizosphere and on the aerial part of cypress plants could be related to the nature of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) present on the outer membrane and in particular to the O-specific polysaccharide.A neutral O-specific polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharide from P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens strain M71. By means of compositional analyses and NMR spectroscopy, the chemical repeating unit of the polymer was identified as the following linear trisaccharide.",

Due to this important feature the obtained films can be considered as candidates for application in high-temperature electrochemical devices. The microscopic nature and mechanism of the conduction in alginate based materials were studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

On an average, the rye starch granules were larger than those of wheat starch. The former had very comparable gelatinisation temperatures and enthalpies, but slightly lower gelatinisation temperatures than wheat starch. Under standardised conditions, they retrograded to a lesser extent than wheat starch. The lower gelatinisation temperatures and tendencies of the rye starches to retrograde originated probably from their higher levels of short amylopectin (AP) chains [degree of polymerisation (DP) 6\u201312] and their lower levels of longer chains (DP 13\u201324) than observed for wheat starch. The rapid visco analysis differences in peak and end viscosities between the rye starches as well as between rye and wheat starches were at least partly attributable to differences in the levels of AP short chains and in average amylose molecular weight. The AP average chain lengths and exterior chain lengths were slightly lower for rye starches, while the interior chain lengths were slightly higher than those for wheat starch.",

Previous work has focused on growing C. albicans on media such as Sabouraud or YPD at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Because C. albicans normally colonizes a host, we hypothesized that cultivation on blood or serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C would result in structural changes in cell wall mannan. C. albicans SC5314 was inoculated onto YPD, 5% blood, or 5% serum agar media three successive times at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C, then cultivated overnight at 30\u00a0\u00b0C in YPD. The mannan was extracted and characterized using 1D and 2D 1H NMR techniques. At 30\u00a0\u00b0C cells grown in blood and serum contain less acid-stable terminal \u03b2-(1\u21922)-linked d-mannose and \u03b1-(1\u21922)-linked d-mannose-containing side chains, while the acid-labile side chains of mannan grown in blood and serum contain fewer \u03b2-Man-(1\u21922)-\u03b1-Man-(1\u2192 side chains. The decrement in acid-stable mannan side chains is greater at 37\u00a0\u00b0C than at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Cells grown on blood at 37\u00a0\u00b0C show fewer \u21926)-\u03b1-Man-(1\u2192 structural motifs in the acid-stable polymer backbone. The data indicate that C. albicans, grown on media containing host-derived components, produces less complex mannan. This is accentuated when the cells are cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. This study demonstrates that the C. albicans cell wall is a dynamic and adaptive organelle, which alters its structural phenotype in response to growth in host-derived media at physiological temperature.",

Alkylmaltoside detergents, which are more frequently used in recent structural biological researches, are uniquely used in this study to solubilize cellulose-synthesizing activity from the cell membrane of G. xylinus. Activity comparable to that previously reported is obtained, while the synthesized cellulose is crystallized into a non-native polymorph of cellulose (cellulose II) as well as the previous studies. In spite of this failure to recover the native activity to synthesize cellulose I microfibril in vitro, the product is a polymer with a degree of polymerization greater than 45 as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). It was thus concluded that the established protocol can solubilize cellulose-synthesizing activity of G. xylinus with polymerizing activity.",

In the present study we monitored fecal oligosaccharide profiles together with the HMO-profiles of the respective breast milks up to six months postpartum, by means of capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence detection and mass spectrometry. Eleven mother/child pairs were included. Mother\u2019s secretor- and Lewis-type included all combinations [Le(a\u2212b+), Le(a+b\u2212), Le(a\u2212b\u2212)]. The fecal HMO-profiles in the first few months of life are either predominantly composed of neutral or acidic HMOs and are possibly effected by the HMO-fingerprint in the respective breast milk. Independent of the initial presence of acidic or neutral fecal HMOs, a gradual change to blood-group specific oligosaccharides was observed. Their presence pointed to a gastrointestinal degradation of the feeding-related HMOs, followed by conjugation with blood group specific antigenic determinants present in the gastrointestinal mucus layer. Eleven of these \u2018hybrid\u2019-oligosaccharides were annotated in this study. When solid food was introduced, no HMOs and their degradation- and metabolization products were recovered in the fecal samples.",

The quantitative thermal analyses of experimental data of crystalline and amorphous \u03b1-d-glucose were performed based on heat capacities. The total, apparent and reversing\u00a0heat capacities, and phase transitions were evaluated on heating and cooling. The melting temperature (Tm) of a crystalline carbohydrate such as \u03b1-d-glucose, shows a heating rate dependence, with the melting peak shifted to lower temperature for a lower heating rate, and with superheating of around 25\u00a0K. The superheating of crystalline \u03b1-d-glucose is observed as shifting the melting peak for higher heating rates, above the equilibrium melting temperature due to of the slow melting process. The equilibrium melting temperature and heat of fusion of crystalline \u03b1-d-glucose were estimated. Changes of reversing heat capacity evaluated by TMDSC at glass transition (Tg) of amorphous and melting process at Tm of fully crystalline \u03b1-d-glucose are similar. In both, the amorphous and crystalline phases, the same origin of heat capacity changes, in the Tg and Tm area, are attributable to molecular rotational motion. Degradation occurs simultaneously with the melting process of the crystalline phase. The stability of crystalline \u03b1-d-glucose was examined by TGA and TMDSC in the melting region, with the degradation shown to be resulting from changes of mass with temperature and time.

Interestingly, the ion pairs formed through negatively charged phosphate groups with protonated amine functionality of chitosan in ionotropic gelation are expected to provide chitosan with an amphoteric character, which may facilitate protein adhesion following enhanced attachment of anchorage dependant cells than chitosan, which shows poor cell adhesion properties. In this study, chitosan\u2013tripolyphosphate (TPP) fibers with varying phosphate contents were prepared through wet spinning in STPP baths of different pH. Gelation kinetics and gel strength of chitosan with STPP solutions of three different pH were evaluated and compared with that of NaOH solution for evaluation of their influence on nature of gelation. The solution pH of STPP baths was found to have significant control on the extent of ionic cross-linking and physico-chemical properties of the fibers. Moreover, this kinetically driven ionotropic gelation of chitosan by TPP results in low degree of crystallinity of chitosan\u2013TPP fibers and consequently their lower thermal stability than chitosan fibers.",

The coating of XGs on cellulose surfaces is believed to be one of the most probable interaction patterns. In this work, the effects of explicit water and side chain variation on the adsorption of XGs on cellulose are investigated by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The adsorption properties are studied in detail for three XGs on cellulose I\u03b2 1\u201310 surface in aqueous environment, namely GXXXGXXXG, GXXLGXXXG, and GXXFGXXXG, which differ in the length and composition of one side chain. Our work shows that when water molecules are included in the theoretical model, the total interaction energies between the adsorbed XGs and cellulose are considerably smaller than in vacuo. Furthermore, in water environment the van der Waals interactions prevail over the electrostatic interactions in the adsorption. Variation in one side chain does not have significant influence on the interaction energy and the binding affinity, but does affect the equilibrium structural properties of the adsorbed XGs to facilitate the interaction between both the backbone and the side chain residues with the cellulose surface. Together, this analysis provides new insights into the nature of the XG\u2013cellulose interaction, which helps to further refine current molecular models of the composite plant cell wall.",

Glucosamine derivative 8 was obtained from 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-desoxy-\u03b2-d-glucopyranose (1) in five steps. Mannoside 9 was converted into the corresponding imidate 12 and coupled with 8 to give disaccharide octyl-S-glycoside 13 which was further mannosylated to afford trisaccharide 19 upon deprotection. Likewise, mannoside 9 was galactosylated, converted into the corresponding imidate and coupled with 8 to give trisaccharide 25. Mannosylation of the latter afforded tetrasaccharide 27 upon deprotection. Condensation of 25 with disaccharide imidate 35 gave, upon deprotection of the intermediates, the corresponding pentasaccharide octyl-S-glycoside 37.

In general higher ammonia and/or ammonium salt concentrations led to a faster conversion of the starting sugar into intermediate species and of the latter into the final products. Yet, some interesting trends and exceptions were observed. The use of saturated ammonium carbamate led to the fastest rates and the highest final yields of \u03b2-d-glucopyranuronosylamine/carbamate. With the exception of 1\u00a0M ammonia and 0.6\u00a0M ammonium salt, after 24\u00a0h of reaction all tested protocols led to higher yields of \u03b2-glycosylamine/carbamate than concentrated commercial ammonia alone.

Results were compared in presence of 2-deoxy-d-glucose, a potent glycosylation inhibitor in the secreting media. Inclusion of 2-deoxy-d-glucose in presence of succinate caused about 10 to 100 times decrease in titers of the metabolic enzymes hexokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, isocitrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase leading to increased secretion of cellobiase by more than 100 times.

In this suppressed metabolic state, a 10-fold increase in the titer of the secreted cellobiase was noticed.

     "abstract": "All eight d-aldohexoses and aldohexoses derived from the non-reducing end of disaccharides were investigated by variable-wavelength infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) as anions in the negative-ion mode. Spectroscopic evidence supports the existence of a relatively abundant open-chain configuration of the anions in the gas phase, based on the observation of a significant carbonyl absorption band near 1710\u00a0cm\u22121. The abundance of the open-chain configuration of the aldohexose anions was approximately 1000-fold or greater than that of the neutral sugars in aqueous solution. This provides an explanation as to why it has not been possible to discriminate the anomeric configuration of aldohexose anions in the gas phase when derived from the non-reducing sugar of a disaccharide. Evidence from photodissociation spectra also indicates that the different aldohexoses yield product ions with maximal abundances at different wavelengths, and that the carbonyl stretch region is useful for differentiation of sugar stereochemistries. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate relatively low energy barriers to intramolecular proton transfer between hydroxyl groups and adjacent alkoxy sites located on open-chain sugar anions, suggesting that an ensemble of alkoxy charge locations contributes to their observed photodissociation spectra. Ring opening of monosaccharide anions and interconversion among configurations is an inherent property of the ions themselves and occurs in vacuo independent of solvent participation.",

In addition to being employed to assess relative amylose contents for starch samples, it has been used to look at the molecular mobility of the glucose polymers within intact starch granules based on exposure to iodine vapor equilibrated at different water activities. Starches of different botanical origin including corn, high amylose corn, waxy corn, potato, waxy potato, tapioca, wheat, rice, waxy rice, chick pea and mung bean were equilibrated to 0.33, 0.75, 0.97 water activities, exposed to iodine vapor and then absorbance spectra and LAB color were determined. In addition, a new iodine quantification method sensitive to <0.1% iodine (w/w) was employed to measure bound iodine within intact granular starch. Amylose content, particle size distribution of granules, and the density of the starch were also determined to explore whether high levels of long linear glucose chains and the surface area-to-volume ratio were important factors relating to the granular iodine binding. Results showed, in all cases, starches complexed more iodine as water content increased and waxy starches bound less iodine than their normal starch counterparts. However, much more bound iodine could be measured chemically with waxy starches than was expected based on colorimetric determination. Surface area appeared to be a factor as smaller rice and waxy rice starch granules complexed more iodine, while the larger potato and waxy potato granules complexed less than would be expected based on measured amylose contents. Corn, high amylose corn, and wheat, known to have starch granules with extensive surface pores, bound higher levels of iodine suggesting pores and channels may be an important factor giving iodine vapor greater access to bind within the granules. Exposing iodine vapor to moisture-equilibrated native starches is an effective tool to explore starch granule architecture.",

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed under several types of conditions varying in the consideration of ionization of amino groups, solvent effect, and temperature. Neural network clustering and asphericity calculations were performed on the basis of molecular dynamics data. It was shown that disaccharide fragments in the studied linear oligosaccharides were not rigid, and tended to have several conformers, thus determining the overall twisted shape with helical elements. In addition, it was found that the behavior of C5\u2013C6 bond depended significantly upon the simulation conditions. The cyclic di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides mostly had symmetrical ring-shaped conformations. The larger cycles tended to adopt more complicated shapes, and the conformational behavior of their disaccharide fragments was close to that in the linear oligosaccharides.",

The resulting products demonstrated the solvent-induced diastereoselectivity switching using diethyl ether (Et2O) or dichloromethane (CH2Cl2).

The anomeric diastereoselectivity switching was similarly observed in the alcohol galactosylation reaction. The larger spin-lattice relaxation time constant (T1) actually indicated that molecular motion of ethyl 9-hydroxynonanoate was more vigorous in Et2O than in CH2Cl2, suggesting its dissociation in Et2O and association in CH2Cl2.

We report a one-pot strategy for the fluorescent labeling of saccharides with fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTSC), which introduces the thiosemicarbazide group of FTSC to the aldehyde group at the reducing end of saccharides to form stable amino derivatives via reductive amination.

Saccharides were quantitatively labeled with FTSC at 75\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h under optimum reaction conditions.

In addition, the same sample was analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times as well as the dielectric strength of different processes has been critically examined. It has been observed that the slower secondary relaxation (designated as \u03b2-) process shifts to lower frequencies with increasing applied pressure, but not the faster one. This pressure dependence indicates that the observed slower secondary relaxation (\u03b2-) is Johari\u2013Goldstein relaxation process and faster one (\u03b3-process) is probably the rotation of hydroxymethyl (\u2013CH2OH) side group attached to the sugar ring, that is, of intramolecular origin.",

Using capillary electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detector coupled to a mass spectrometer (CE\u2013LIF\u2013MSn), we studied the fecal oligosaccharide profiles of 27 two-month-old breast-, formula- and mixed-fed preterm babies. The interpretation of the complex oligosaccharide profiles was facilitated by beforehand clustering the CE\u2013LIF data points by agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). In the feces of breast-fed babies, characteristic human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) profiles, showing genetic fingerprints known for human milk of secretors and non-secretors, were recognized. Alternatively, advanced degradation and bioconversion of HMOs, resulting in an accumulation of acidic HMOs or HMO bioconversion products was observed. Independent of the prebiotic supplementation of the formula with galactooligosaccharides (GOS) at the level used, similar oligosaccharide profiles of low peak abundance were obtained for formula-fed babies. Feeding influences the presence of diet-related oligosaccharides in baby feces and gastrointestinal adaptation plays an important role herein. Four fecal oligosaccharides, characterized as HexNAc-Hex-Hex, Hex-[Fuc]-HexNAc-Hex, HexNAc-[Fuc]-Hex-Hex and HexNAc-[Fuc]-Hex-HexNAc-Hex-Hex, highlighted an active gastrointestinal metabolization of the feeding-related oligosaccharides.

Analogously to some monosaccharides which act as intracellular antioxidants, cell-wall polysaccharides may be in charge of buffering free-radical production in the extracellular compartment under pronounced prooxidative settings. Although a wide range of plant polysaccharides have been examined for their antioxidative properties, this usually has not been done in a coherent and comparative manner and against biologically relevant reactive species. Here we show that different cell-wall polysaccharides, cellulose, pectin, d-galacto-d-mannan, arabinogalactan, and xylan, exhibit distinctive antioxidative activities against the hydroxyl radical (OH)-generating Fenton reaction and superoxide. We found, using an EPR spin-trapping method, that the main carriers of \u2018anti-Fenton\u2019 activity in the plant cell wall are pectin and xylan. They most likely act by binding metal ions in such a manner to allow the Fenton reaction, after which they scavenge OH. Such a mode of action is preferred by cells resulting in a safe degradation of H2O2. On the other hand, the polysaccharides examined showed similar superoxide scavenging capacities. We propose that plants may employ different antioxidative characteristics of polysaccharides to regulate their redox status by modifying the composition of the cell wall.",

The experimental observations showed first-order dependences in permanganate and fractional first-order kinetics with respect to both carrageenans concentration for both the induction and autoacceleration periods. The results obtained at various hydrogen ion concentrations showed that the oxidation processes in these redox systems are acid-catalyzed throughout the two stages of oxidation reactions. The added salts lead to the prediction that MnIII is the reactive species throughout the autoacceleration periods. Kinetic evidence for the formation of 1:1 intermediate complexes was revealed.

Fitting the rate constants to the Eyring equation results in values of 62.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 and \u221277.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0J\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0K\u22121 for \u0394H\u2021 and \u0394S\u2021, respectively. The impedance effect on the loss of water vapor has also been investigated to determine the values for activation energy, enthalpy, and entropy for diffusion of water. The results obtained for the activation parameters are interpreted in terms of the absolute entropies of anhydrous glucose and the monohydrate.",

The inhibitor 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-6-sulfo-d-glucose (d-glucosamine-6-sulfonate) is an analog of glucosamine-6-phosphate in which the phosphate group in the latter is replaced with a sulfonic acid group. The inhibitor is designed to function by three different modes which together reduce UDP-N-acetylglucosamine synthesis. This reduction was confirmed by evaluating the effect of the inhibitor on bacterial cell-wall synthesis and by demonstrating that it inhibits acetylation of glucosamine-6-phosphate competitively and by acting as a surrogate substrate. Inhibition of glucosamine production or suitably activated glucosamine in bacteria leads to disruption of the peptidoglycan structure, which results in softening, bulging, deformation, fragility and lysis of the cells. These modifications were documented by scanning electron microscopy for bacteria treated with the inhibitor. They were observed for inhibitor concentrations in the 20\u00a0mg/mL range for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the 5\u00a0mg/mL range for Rhizobium trifolii.",

The structure of the bis-chelates was affected by the bulk of the DTBS groups and the requirement of flat silacycles in the case of five-membered chelate rings. These restrictions resulted in unusual cyclic bis-chelates for ribofuranose (\u03baO1,5,\u03baO2,3 bis-chelate) and lyxopyranose (\u03baO1,4,\u03baO2,3 bis-chelate of a twisted boat conformation). Most importantly, all aldopentoses formed bis-chelates of their open-chain aldehydo isomers. The bis-chelates of aldehydo-arabinose and -xylose were \u03baO2,3,\u03baO4,5-bonded and thus exhibited five-membered chelate rings. The bis-chelates of aldehydo-lyxose and -ribose were \u03baO2,4,\u03baO3,5-bonded and resembled six-membered chelate rings. For lyxose, the aldehydo bis-chelate was isolated as a solid. The molecular structures were assigned by a combined 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopic approach, which was supported by X-ray analyses on crystals of the bis-DTBS chelates of \u03baO1,2,\u03baO3,5-bonded rac-xylofuranose, \u03baO1,5,\u03baO2,3-bonded d-ribofuranose, and \u03baO2,4,\u03baO3,5-bonded aldehydo-d-lyxose.",

Therefore, we prepared an affinity adsorbent having immobilized Gal\u03b21-4Fuc in order to capture carbohydrate-binding proteins of C. elegans, which interact with this disaccharide unit. Adsorbed C. elegans proteins were eluted with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and followed by lactose (Gal\u03b21-4Glc), digested with trypsin, and were then subjected to proteomic analysis using LC\u2013MS/MS.

The affinity of annexins for Gal\u03b21-4Fuc was further confirmed by adsorption of recombinant NEX-1, -2, and -3 proteins to the Gal\u03b21-4Fuc column in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, frontal affinity chromatography analysis using an immobilized NEX-1 column showed that NEX-1 has an affinity for Gal\u03b21-4Fuc, but no affinity toward Gal\u03b21-3Fuc and Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc.

We have previously reported a panosyl unit transglycosylation reaction by pullulan-hydrolyzing amylase II (TVA II) cloned from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47 (Tonozuka et al., Carbohydr. Res., 1994, 261, 157\u2013162). The acceptor specificity of the TVA II transglycosylation reaction was investigated using pullulan as the donor and sugar alcohols as the acceptor. TVA II transferred the \u03b1-panosyl unit to the C-1 hydroxyl group of meso-erythritol, C-1 and C-2 of xylitol, and C-1 and C-6 of d-sorbitol. TVA II differentiated between the sugar alcohols\u2019 hydroxyl groups to produce five novel non-reducing branched oligosaccharides, 1-O-\u03b1-panosylerythritol, 1-O-\u03b1-panosylxylitol, 2-O-\u03b1-panosylxylitol, 1-O-\u03b1-panosylsorbitol, and 6-O-\u03b1-panosylsorbitol. The Trp356\u2192Ala mutant showed similar transglycosylation reactions; however, panose production by the mutant was 4.0\u20134.5-fold higher than that of the wild type. This suggests that Trp356 is important for recognizing both water and the acceptor molecules in the transglycosylation and the hydrolysis reaction.",

     "abstract": "Stachybotrys microspora is a filamentous fungus that produces various \u03b2-glucosidases, of which two have already been characterized. The present study reports on the production of a third one, named bglG, in the presence of d-glucose used as a sole carbon source, and on its subsequent purification and characterization. Although efficiently produced in the presence of d-glucose, bglG continues to be highly inhibited by this sugar. In fact, the addition of d-glucose significantly decreases the glucose formation rates during the hydrolysis of pNPG. This work reports on the effect of various carbohydrates on bglG activity in order to understand the mechanisms adopted by d-glucose to inhibit this enzyme. The findings indicate that bglG is strongly inhibited by d-glucose (44% of the relative activity at 5\u00a0mM), d-glucitol (96% of the relative activity), d-mannose (56% of the relative activity), cellobiose and maltose (72% and 71% of the relative activity, respectively). On the other hand, d-galactose, d-fructose, lactose, and sucrose have no effect on bglG activity. Similarly, several isomers, such as 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose and 2-deoxy-d-arabino-hexose (2-deoxy-d-glucose) were noted to bring no change on the relative activity of bglG. d-xylose and xylitol, on the other hand, enhanced bglG activity up to 123% and 120% of relative activity, respectively. Accordingly, the configuration, epimerisation, isomerisation, and substitutions played key roles in bglG inhibition. The effect of the combination of iron (the best activator of bglG, 161%) with some of those additives was also investigated. The findings revealed that, while a combination of iron at a concentration of 10\u00a0mM with d-glucose resulted in a two-fold decrease in bglG inhibition (84% at 5\u00a0mM), iron maintained the same effect with the remainder of the additives being tested.",

Only a few of those additives behaved like classical inhibitors of the enzymatic reaction under investigation because the values of the Michaelis constants that were obtained, as well as the maximum velocity values depended mostly atypically on the concentrations of those additives. In most cases cyclodextrins caused mixed inhibition, both competitive and noncompetitive, but they also acted as activators for selected concentrations. This atypical behaviour of cyclodextrins is caused by three different and independent effects. The inhibitory effect of cyclodextrins is connected with the decrease of substrate concentration and unfavourable influence on the flexibility of the enzyme molecules. On the other hand, the activating effect is connected with the decrease of product concentration (the product is an inhibitor of the enzymatic reaction under investigation). All these effects are caused by the ability of the cyclodextrins to form inclusion complexes.",

Screening of the enzymes\u2019 specificity then revealed that the vast majority of acceptors are transglucosylated very slowly by SP, at a rate that is comparable to the contaminating hydrolytic reaction. The enzyme from S. mutans displayed the narrowest acceptor specificity and the one from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B1355 the broadest. However, high activity could only be detected on l-sorbose and l-arabinose, besides the native acceptors d-fructose and phosphate.

The chitosan obtained was then further depolymerized by cellulase or lysozyme with cellulase giving a higher degradation ratio, lower relative viscosity, and a larger amount of reducing-end formations than that of lysozyme due to its higher susceptibility.

The latter evidence might explain the power of S. maltophilia to produce persistent lung infections, despite intensive antibiotic treatment. In addition to being important components of the extracellular biofilm matrix, polysaccharides are involved in virulence, as they contribute to bacterial survival in a hostile environment. With the aim of contributing to the elucidation of S. maltophilia virulence factors, the exopolysaccharides produced by two mucoid clinical isolates of S. maltophilia obtained from two cystic fibrosis patients were completely characterised, mainly by means of ESI-MS and NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that, although the two isolates were recovered from two different patients living in different countries (Italy and France), the exopolysaccharides produced have an identical primary structure, with the following repeating unit: Download full-size imageThe exopolysaccharide is highly negatively charged for the presence of three uronic acids on four residues in the repeating unit.

Among the chemical compounds now widely examined is fucoidan (fucan, fucosan, sulfate fucan or sulfated fucan), a fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharide. Fucoidans isolated from different species have been extensively studied because of their varied biological properties, including anticoagulant and antitumor effects. Methodology based on mild acid hydrolysis can be used as an efficient tool to study the relationship between molecular weight of the sulfated polysaccharides and their biological activities. Anticancer activity of fucoidans can be significantly enhanced by lowering their molecular weight only when they are depolymerized under mild conditions. In this study, fucoidan was identified during extraction with H2SO4 and HCl; its presence was confirmed by FT-Raman spectroscopy in aqueous solution. In particular, shifts at 840\u00a0cm\u22121 were analysed, which are due to the presence of sulfate at the axial C-4 position, as were the shifts at about 811\u2013809\u00a0cm\u22121, for which the sulfated fucoidan is responsible. Shifts of electrophoretic bands of fucoidan resulting from mild acid hydrolysis in H2SO4 and HCl were also analysed.

The main advantage of benzylidene acetal is the ability for regioselective openings. 4,6-benzylidene acetal can be opened selectively under reductive conditions to yield either free 4-OH or 6-OH. There are a plethora of methods available for regioselective openings, but only a few of these are widely used. In recent years, the mechanism has been investigated for borane mediated openings and it seems likely that the regioselectivity is determined by borane, rather than Lewis acid. When borane is activated by Lewis acids, borane is the most electrophilic species that consequently coordinates to the most nucleophilic oxygen of the acetals, usually O-6. This results in the formation of 6-O-benzyl ethers. If borane is not activated, Lewis acid is the most electrophilic species that thus adds to O-6 and hence generates the 4-O-benzyl ether.",

Sialic acid in the surface of the parasite plays an important role in the infectious process, however, T. cruzi is unable to synthesize sialic acid or the usual donor CMP-sialic acid. Instead, T. cruzi expresses a unique enzyme, the trans-sialidase (TcTS) involved in the transfer of sialic acid from host glycoconjugates to mucins of the parasite. The mucins are the major glycoproteins in the insect stage epimastigotes and in the infective trypomastigotes. Both, the mucins and the TcTS are anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Thus, TcTS may be shed into the bloodstream of the mammal host by the action of a parasite phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, affecting the immune system. The composition and structure of the sugars in the parasite mucins is characteristic of each differentiation stage, also, interstrain variations were described for epimastigote mucins.

There is no human vaccine against LD currently available. Our approach to a vaccine is based on its surface-exposed glycolipids. One group of these glycolipids termed BBGL-2 consists of 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-(\u03b1-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol congeners having palmitic, oleic, stearic, linoleic, and myristic acids. In order to delineate the immunodominant region(s) of the BBGL-2 components, we embarked on a synthetic project to provide available structurally defined, homogeneous analogs of BBGL-2 that might help identify the best vaccine candidate. The antigenicity of the synthetic glycolipids was examined by dot-blot analysis using mice sera obtained by immunization with killed B. burgdorferi cells, with native BBGL-2 in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, as well as sera obtained from patients with Lyme disease. We found that the presence of two acyl groups in the glycerol moiety was essential for antigenicity. At least one of these groups must be an oleoyl moiety. Neither the anomeric configuration of the galactose nor the configuration of the glycerol at C-2 was a decisive factor. Based on these findings we designed an \u2018unnatural\u2019 BBGL-2 analog having the structure 3-O-(\u03b2-d-galactopyranosyl)-1,2-di-O-oleoyl-dl-glycerol which is easier and less expensive to synthesize than the other BBGL-2 congeners prepared in this study.

In addition, biofilm biomass were markedly reduced after treating with two kinds of acid-soluble chitosan at concentrations of 2.0 and 1.0\u00a0mg/mL for 3 and 12\u00a0h, indicating the importance of biofilm formation in the antibacterial mechanism of chitosan.

     "abstract": "Along with \u03b2-glucans, chitin is the dominant component of the fungal cell wall. Chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, has found quite a number of biomedical and biotechnological applications recently. Mushroom chitin could be an important source for chitosan production. A direct determination of chitin and chitosan in mushrooms is of expedient interest. In this paper, a new method for the quantification of chitin and chitosan is described. This method is based on the specific reaction between polyiodide anions and chitosan and on measuring the optical density of the insoluble polyiodide\u2013chitosan complex. After deacetylation, chitin can also be quantified. The specificity of the reaction is used to quantify the polymers in the presence of complex matrices. With this new spot assay, the chitin content of mycelia and fruiting bodies from several basidiomycetes and an ascomycete were analysed. The presented method could also be used for the determination in other samples as well. The chitin content of the analysed species varies between 0.4 and 9.8\u00a0g chitin per 100\u00a0g of dry mass. Chitosan could not be detected in our mushroom samples, indicating that the glucosamine units are mostly acetylated.",

In order to improve the quality of these predictions the 1H and 13C, as well as 31P when applicable, NMR chemical shifts of 30 mono-, di-, and trisaccharides were assigned. The reducing sugars gave two distinct sets of NMR resonances due to the \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomeric forms. In total 35 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift data sets were obtained from the oligosaccharides. One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were used for the chemical shift assignments and special techniques were employed in some cases such as 2D 1H,13C-HSQC Hadamard Transform methodology which was acquired approximately 45 times faster than a regular t1 incremented 1H,13C-HSQC experiment and a 1D 1H,1H-CSSF-TOCSY experiment which was able to distinguish spin-systems in which the target protons were only 3.3\u00a0Hz apart. The 1H NMR chemical shifts were subsequently refined using total line-shape analysis with the PERCH NMR software. The acquired NMR data were then utilized in the casper program (http://www.casper.organ.su.se/casper/) for NMR chemical shift predictions of the O-antigen polysaccharides from Klebsiella O5, Shigella flexneri serotype X, and Salmonella arizonae O62.

This inhibitor exhibited strong anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity with an IC50 value of 170.62\u00a0nM and stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the uptake of a fluorescent d-glucose analog, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG), in HepG2 cells at a rate higher than that of insulin controls. It was also found to be associated with adipocyte differentiation and moderate increases in 2-NBDG uptake by 3T3-L1 cells. These findings suggest that vomifoliol 9-O-\u03b1-arabinofuranosyl (1\u21926)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside could augment peripheral glucose as an insulin-sensitizing agent against Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

The chemical structure and physical properties of the chitosan derivatives were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, and XRD. XRD analysis showed that the derivatives were amorphous. The lysozyme enzymatic degradation results revealed that the NSCS was of higher susceptibility to lysozyme. The degradation rate and the solubility of the chitosan derivatives were strongly determined by the degree of substitution and the position of the substitution. The results of antithrombotic properties, hemolytic properties and anticoagulant properties of WSCs indicated that the blood compatibility was dramatically improved, and the carboxyl group introduced on the C-6 or C-2 hydroxyl group appeared to impact anticoagulant activity in different ways.",

     "abstract": "A comparative study of nine assay methods for dextransucrase and related enzymes has been made. A relatively widespread method for the reaction of dextransucrase with sucrose is the measurement of the reducing value of d-fructose by alkaline 3,5-dinitrosalicylate (DNS) and thereby the amount of d-glucose incorporated into dextran. Another method is the reaction with 14C-sucrose with the addition of an aliquot to Whatman 3MM paper squares that are washed three times with methanol to remove 14C-d-fructose and unreacted 14C-sucrose, followed by counting of 14C-dextran on the paper by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). It is shown that both methods give erroneous results. The DNS reducing value method gives extremely high values due to over-oxidation of both d-fructose and dextran, and the 14C-paper square method gives significantly low values due to the removal of some of the 14C-dextran from the paper by methanol washes. In the present study, we have examined nine methods and find two that give values that are identical and are an accurate measurement of the dextransucrase reaction. They are (1) a 14C-sucrose/dextransucrase digest in which dextran is precipitated three times with three volumes of ethanol, dissolved in water, and added to paper and counted in a toluene cocktail by LSC; and (2) precipitation of dextran three times with three volumes of ethanol from a sucrose/dextransucrase digest, dried, and weighed. Four reducing value methods were examined to measure the amount of d-fructose. Three of the four (two DNS methods, one with both dextran and d-fructose and the other with only d-fructose, and the ferricyanide/arsenomolybdate method with d-fructose) gave extremely high values due to over-oxidation of d-fructose, d-glucose, leucrose, and dextran.",

     "abstract": "Although insects are among the most diverse groups of the animal kingdom and may be found in nearly all environments, one can observe an obvious lack of structural data on their glycosylation ability. Hymenoptera is the second largest of all insect orders with more than 110.000 identified species and includes the most famous examples of social insects\u2019 species such as wasps, bees and ants. In this report, the structural variety of O-glycans has been studied in two Hymenoptera species. In a previous study, we showed that major O-glycans from common wasp (Vespula germanica) salivary mucins correspond to T and Tn antigen, eventually substituted by phosphoethanolamine or phosphate groups. More detailed structural analysis performed by mass spectrometry revealed numerous minor O-glycan structures bearing Gal, GlcNAc, GalNAc and Fuc residues. Thus, in order to investigate glycosylation diversity in insects, we used common wasp nest (V. germanica) and hornet nest (Vespa cabro) as starting materials. These materials were submitted to reductive \u03b2-elimination and the released oligosaccharide\u2013alditols further fractionated by multidimensional HPLC. Tandem mass spectrometry analyses combined with NMR data revealed the presence of various families of complex O-glycans differing accordingly to both core structures and external motifs. Glycans from wasp were characterized by the presence of core types 1 and 2, Lewis X and internal Gal-Gal motifs. We also observed unusual O-glycans containing a reducing GalNAc unit directly substituted by a fucose residue. In contrast, hornet O-glycans appeared as a rather homogeneous family of core 1 type O-glycans extended by galactose oligomers.",

Alcohol-insoluble residues were prepared from the plant sources and sequentially extracted with water, cyclohexane-trans-1,2-diamine tetra-acetic acid, sodium carbonate, and potassium hydroxide solutions, to obtain individual fractions, each containing polysaccharides bound to the cell wall in a specific manner. Structural characterization of the polysaccharide fractions was conducted using colorimetric and chromatographic approaches. Sugar ratios were defined to ameliorate data interpretation. These ratios allowed gaining information concerning polysaccharide structure from sugar composition data. Structural analysis of broccoli revealed organ-specific characteristics: the pectin degree of methoxylation (DM) of stem and florets differed, the sugar composition data inferred differences in polymeric composition. On the other hand, the molar mass (MM) distribution profiles of the polysaccharide fractions were virtually identical for both organs. Carrot root displayed a different MM distribution for the polysaccharides solubilized by potassium hydroxide compared to broccoli and tomato, possibly due to the high contribution of branched pectins to this otherwise hemicellulose-enriched fraction. Tomato fruit showed the pectins with the broadest range in DM, the highest MM, the greatest overall linearity and the lowest extent of branching of rhamnogalacturonan I, pointing to particularly long, linear pectins in tomato compared with the other vegetable organs studied, suggesting possible implications toward functional behavior.",

Three TNM parameters: x, \u0394h\u2217 and A were determined experimentally using, respectively, the peak shift method (x) and the dependency of T f \u2032 (the limiting value of Tf) on the cooling rate (\u0394h\u2217 and A). The non-linearity parameter x and the non exponential parameter \u03b2 were also estimated by optimising a fit of the experimental normalised specific heat at different ageing times and temperatures to curves generated using the TNM model. The TNM model successfully described the normalised experimental data. It was found that the intermolecular forces were strong and the relaxation times depended more strongly on the glass structure than the glass temperature. The hydration level of the starch had a direct impact of the breadth of the relaxation time distribution. A dependency of the non-linearity parameter x on ageing temperature (peak shift method) was observed. This suggests that physical ageing is more complex than is described by TNM formalism.",

In its current form, the program operates with several versions of the MM3 and MM4 molecular mechanics programs and has a module to calculate hydrogen\u2013hydrogen coupling constants. The routine was used to study the low-energy exo-cyclic substituents of \u03b2-d-glucopyranose and the conformers of d-glucaramide, both of which had been previously studied with MM3 by full conformational searches. For these molecules, the program found all previously reported low-energy structures. The routine was also used to find favorable conformers of 2,3,4,5-tetra-O-acetyl-N,N\u2032-dimethyl-d-glucaramide and d-glucitol, the latter of which is believed to have many low-energy forms. Finally, the technique was used to study the inter-ring conformations of \u03b2-gentiobiose, a \u03b2-(1\u21926)-linked disaccharide of d-glucopyranose. The program easily found conformers in the 10 previously identified low-energy regions for this disaccharide. In 6 of the 10 local regions, the same previously identified low-energy structures were found. In the remaining four regions, the search identified structures with slightly lower energies than those previously reported. The approach should be useful for extending modeling studies on acyclic monosaccharides and possibly oligosaccharides.",

The alkaline reaction conditions, however, resulted in a partial breakdown of reducing sugars. This breakdown could easily be bypassed by a preceding sugar reduction step converting them to polyols. Hydroxy-arylated products were purified by using solid phase extraction, based on the number of hydroxy-aryl moieties attached. Monohydroxy-arylated saccharose was subsequently linked to a tyrosine-containing tripeptide using horseradish peroxidase, as monitored by LC\u2013MSn.

It was found that one of them could form hydrogels efficiently, while the other two precipitated from water. The stability of the resulting hydrogel was tested, and the supramolecular nanofiber with fiber diameters in the range of 80\u2013300\u00a0nm was characterized as the structural element by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that extensive hydrogen bonds between sugar rings assisted the formation of efficient \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking between aromatic naphthalene groups, thus resulting in the formation of a stable hydrogel in aqueous solution. When the gel was applied for mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH 3T3), human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), AD293 and HeLa cells culture in two dimensional environments, all of them showed a very good adhesion and good proliferation rate on the top of the hydrogel.

Anion metathesis of the ionic liquids with inexpensive alkylammonium halides also resulted in silver N-heterocyclic carbene formation and subsequent O-glycosidation in the presence of silver carbonate. Effective utility of this methodology has been demonstrated with biologically relevant acceptors (including flavones and steroids) where O-\u03b2-glycoside products were obtained selectively in moderate to good yields. We have also demonstrated that the Ag\u2013NHC complex is a superior promoter to traditionally used silver carbonate for the glycosidation of polyphenolic acceptors. The ionic liquids used in the study could be recycled three times without apparent loss in activity.",

The synthesis applied a simple protection scheme based on benzylidenation for the glycolipid, and cation templating for the macrocycle. A sequential build-up of the crown ether by bis-hydroxylethylation of the glucoside followed by reaction with di-, tri-, or tetraethylene glycol ditosylate provided better yields of the macrocycle compared to a single step cyclization with tetraethylene glycole ditosylate. The macrocycles containing up to six oxygens showed significantly higher affinity for sodium than for potassium, while more effective potassium complexation was found for the 21-crown-7 compound. The ion binding affinity leads to a slight but significant increase of the CMC of the crown ether containing surfactant in water upon the addition of sodium electrolyte.",

     "abstract": "Fructose is commonly used as an industrial sweetener and has been excessively consumed in human diets in the last decades. High fructose intake is causative in the development of metabolic disorders, but the mechanisms underlying fructose-induced disturbances are under debate. Fructose compared to glucose has been found to be a more potent initiator of the glycation reaction. Therefore, we supposed that glucose and fructose might have different vital effects. Here we compare the effects of glucose and fructose on yeast cell viability and markers of carbonyl/oxidative stress. Analysis of the parameters in cells growing on glucose and fructose clearly reveals that yeast growing on fructose has higher levels of carbonyl groups in proteins, \u03b1-dicarbonyl compounds and reactive oxygen species. This may explain the observation that fructose-supplemented growth as compared with growth on glucose resulted in more pronounced age-related decline in yeast reproductive ability and higher cell mortality. The results are discussed from the point of view that fructose rather than glucose is more extensively involved in glycation and ROS generation in vivo, yeast aging and development of carbonyl/oxidative stress. It should be noted that carbohydrate restriction used in this study does not reveal a significant difference between markers of aging and carbonyl/oxidative stress in yeasts cultivated on glucose and fructose.",

     "abstract": "Lectins are able to recognize specific carbohydrate structures through their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The lectin from the mushroom Agaricus bisporus (ABL) has the remarkable ability of selectively recognizing the TF-antigen, composed of Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc, Ser/Thr linked to proteins, specifically exposed in neoplastic tissues. Strikingly, the recently solved crystal structure of tetrameric ABL in the presence of TF-antigen and other carbohydrates showed that each monomer has two CRDs, each being able to bind specifically to different monosaccharides that differ only in the configuration of a single hydroxyl, like N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Understanding how lectin CRDs bind and discriminate mono and/or (poly)-saccharides is an important issue in glycobiology, with potential impact in the design of better and selective lectin inhibitors with potential therapeutic properties. In this work, and based on the unusual monosaccharide epimeric specificity of the ABL CRDs, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the natural (crystallographic) and inverted (changing GalNAc for GlcNAc and vice-versa) ABL\u2013monosaccharide complexes in order to understand the selective ligand recognition properties of each CRD. We also performed a detailed analysis of the CRD local solvent structure, using previously developed methodology, and related it with the recognition mechanism. Our results provide a detailed picture of each ABL CRD specificity, allowing a better understanding of the carbohydrate selective recognition process in this particular lectin.",

Analysis of the theoretical bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) values for all OH sites of rutin in solution clearly shows the importance of the B-ring and the 3\u2032-OH and 4\u2032-OH groups in the antioxidant activity. We have also investigated the spin density of the radicals to determine the delocalization possibilities. The results of the calculations showed that the oxidation of rutin by both the hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical is an exothermic reaction.

     "abstract": "The catalytic potential of \u03b2-galactosidase is usually determined by its hydrolytic activity over natural or synthetic substrates. However, this method poorly predicts enzyme behavior when transglycosylation instead of hydrolysis is being performed. A system for determining the transgalactosylation activity of \u03b2-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae was developed, and its activity was determined under conditions for the synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose. Transgalactosylation activity increased with temperature up to 55\u00a0\u00b0C while the effect of pH was mild in the range from pH 2.5 to 5.5, decreasing at higher values. The effect of glucose and galactose on transgalactosylation activity was also assessed both in the reactions for the synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose and also in the reaction of hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl \u03b2-d-galactopiranoside. Galactose was a competitive inhibitor and its effect was stronger in the reactions of transgalactosylation than in the reaction of hydrolysis. Glucose was a mild activator of \u03b2-galactosidase in the reaction of hydrolysis, but its mechanism of action was more complex in the reactions of transgalactosylation, having this positive effect only at low concentrations while acting as an inhibitor at high concentrations. This information is relevant to properly assess the effect of monosaccharides during the reactions of the synthesis of lactose-derived oligosaccharides, such as galacto-oligosaccharides and lactulose.",

The content of Fe3+ in the complex was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) and elemental analysis (EA), the results of which suggested that the content of Fe3+ in the complex can be controlled by the concentration of the ferric salts during coordination.

The direct sprinkling of samples on a two-sided adhesive tape allows investigations in an in situ environment of the un-embedded starch granule surface and thus provides high-resolution images of granule morphology and phase changes of starches in the presence of humidity and with iodine vapor. These observations demonstrate that this novel in situ AFM imaging technique allows us to visualize the hair-like structures on the surface of granular starches when starches are exposed to iodine vapor under humid environments.

The ethylenediamine derivative of alginic acid (ALG-EDA) exhibited good fluorescent activity, which upon cross linking was enhanced threefold. The other amide derivatives, for example, ALG-HY, ALG-HDA, and ALG-CHDA, were not fluorescent, but their respective crosslinked products exhibited excellent fluorescent activity. The fluorescence intensity had an inverse correlation with the number of carbon atoms present in the amine, which in turn was a function of degree of substitution (DS). These fluorescent polysaccharide derivatives are of potential utility in the domain of sensor applications.",

The chitosan scaffolds having the pore size of \u223c100\u00a0\u03bcm were prepared by a freeze-drying method. Two different methods for immobilization of heparin to chitosan scaffolds were successfully performed. In the first method, functionalization of the scaffolds was achieved by means of electrostatic interactions between negatively charged heparin and positively charged chitosan. The covalent immobilization of heparin to chitosan scaffolds by 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDAC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was used as a second immobilization method. Morphology, proliferation, and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts on heparin-functionalized chitosan scaffolds were investigated in vitro. The results indicate that covalently bound heparin containing chitosan scaffolds (CHC) stimulate osteoblast proliferation compared to other scaffolds, that is, unmodified chitosan scaffolds (CH), electrostatically bound heparin containing chitosan scaffolds (EHC), and CH+free heparin (CHF). SEM images also proved the stimulative effect of covalently bound heparin on the proliferation of preosteoblasts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) levels of cells proliferated on CHC and EHC were also higher than those for CH and CHF. In vitro studies have demonstrated that chitosan scaffolds increase viability and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells especially in the presence of immobilized heparin.",

In order to examine the predictive ability of COSMO on this carbohydrate, constant energy dynamics, DFTMD, simulations were carried out on low energy syn and \u03c6H-anti conformations with and without COSMO included during the dynamics. The resulting analysis confirmed that when COSMO is included in the dynamics, the syn conformations become energetically favored over the \u03c6H-anti forms suggesting that both solvent and entropy play roles in dictating the solution conformation of cellobiose.

The quantum mechanical calculations are performed at the PM3 theory level. We find that the reaction proceeds via intramolecular proton and hydride transfers.

We also find that in some instances intramolecular proton transfer is facilitated by mediating water, whereas in others the presence of quantum mechanical water has no effect. From a micro-kinetic point of view, we find that the rate-determining step of the reaction involves a hydride transfer prior to the third dehydration step, requiring an activation free energy of 31.8\u00a0kcal/mol, and the respective rate is found in good agreement with reported experimental values in zeolites.

Potentiometric and conductometric titrations of myo-inositol phosphates show that addition of iron increases acidity and consumption of hydroxide titrant. By increasing the Fe(III)/InsP6 ratio (from 0.5 to 4) 3\u00a0mol of protons are released per 2\u00a0mol of iron(III). At first, phytates coordinate iron octahedrally between P2 and P1,3.

At higher concentration of iron(III) intermolecular P\u2013O\u2013Fe\u2013O\u2013P bonds trigger formation of a polymeric network and precipitation of the amorphous Fe(III)\u2013InsP6 aggregates. 31P NMR titration data complement the above results and display the largest chemical shift changes at pD values between 5 and 10 in agreement with strong interactions between iron and myo-inositol phosphates. The differences in T1 relaxation times of phosphorous atoms have shown that phosphate groups at positions 1, 2 and 3 are complexated with iron(III). The interactions between iron(III) ions and inositol phosphates depend significantly on the metal to ligand ratio and an attempt to coordinate more than two irons per InsP6 molecule results in an unstable heterogeneous system.",

The selectivity and efficacy of a chitin-based imprinting polymer for steroid binding were assessed by a chromatographic screening process. The results of binding experiments showed that this molecular imprinting polymer (MIP) has a high binding capacity with cholesterol. The target discrimination towards cholesterol over its close structural analogue suggested that the polymer recognition site was possible on the basis of the inversion of configuration of a single hydroxyl group. In addition, non-covalent imprinting was done using chitin as a precursor and its binding properties for cholesterol were also evaluated.",

Interaction energies between enzymes and carbohydrate substrates were calculated after short energy minimization by a molecular mechanics program.

Calculations for training set resulted in good correlation in case of subsite binding energies (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.827\u20130.929) and bond cleavage frequencies (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.727\u20130.835).

F16BP shows very efficient cytoprotective activity in astroglial cells exposed to H2O2-provoked oxidative stress and during neuronal injury caused by hypoxic conditions. As most of the aforementioned processes involve iron activity-related conditions, we investigated the ferric and ferrous iron binding properties of F16BP under physiological conditions using 31P NMR and EPR spectroscopy. Our results indicate that cytoprotective F16BP activity is predominantly based on ferrous iron sequestration. 31P NMR spectroscopy of F16BP employing paramagnetic properties of iron clearly showed that F16BP forms stabile complexes with Fe2+ which was verified by EPR of another divalent cation\u2014Mn2+. On the other hand, F16BP does not sequester ferric iron nor does it increase its redox activity as shown by 31P NMR and EPR spin-trapping. Therefore, F16BP may be beneficial in neurodegenerative and other conditions that are characterised by ferric iron stores and deposits.",

The conformational study of the compound shows that the \u03b1 -anomeric form is more stable than the \u03b2 -anomeric form from a thermodynamic point of view after including solvent effects. This fact suggests that the synthesis reaction could take place mainly under thermodynamic control as the main experimental product is the \u03b1 -anomeric form of the sulfamide. Calculated \u03b1 / \u03b2 ratio is about 95:5, in excellent agreement with experimental data. Optimized geometries of the \u03b1 -anomeric form agree quite well with crystallographic data. The inclusion of a solvent has negligible effects on the conformations. A detailed analysis of some geometric parameters shed light into the conformational behavior of the sulfamide in terms of both exo- and endo-anomeric effects and antiperiplanar relationships. Natural bond orbital calculations confirm those findings. Several intramolecular hydrogen bonds, characterized through the Atoms-in-Molecules theory, were found in the stable conformers. They, however, seem to play no relevant role in determining the relative stability of \u03b1 conformers with respect to the \u03b2 ones. Calculated 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts support previous findings concerning configuration and conformation assignments of the title sulfamide. The IR spectrum of the compound is recorded and reported for the first time and the assignment of some of the most important bands is accomplished with the aid of calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies.",

The number of NH2 groups was determined from fluorescence analysis. TGA analysis shows that the moisture absorption is three times higher in the PMCh structure. Ch and PMCh in PVA solutions were used to produce nanofibers by the electrospinning method; average fiber diameters were 480 and 280\u00a0nm for Ch and PMCh, respectively. It was found that the antibacterial effect of PMCh is better than the Ch for Gram-positive strains.",

     "abstract": "Mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) produced by yeasts are one of the most promising glycolipid biosurfactants. In this study, we succeeded in the preparation of a novel MEL homolog having no acetyl groups, namely MEL-D. MEL-D was synthesized by lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl groups from a known MEL, and identified as 4-O-[2\u2032,3\u2032-di-O-alka(e)noyl-\u03b2-d-mannopyranosyl]-(2R,3S)-erythritol. The obtained MEL-D showed a higher critical aggregation concentration (CAC\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0M) and hydrophilicity compared to known MELs, retaining an excellent surface tension lowering activity (the surface tension at the CAC was 24.5\u00a0mN/m). In addition, we estimated the binary phase diagram of the MEL-D\u2013water system based on a combination of visual inspection, polarized optical microscopy, and SAXS measurement. From these results, MEL-D was found to self-assemble into a lamellar (L\u03b1) structure over all ranges of concentration. Meanwhile, the one-phase L\u03b1 region of MEL-D was extended wider than those of known MELs. MEL-D might keep more water between the polar layers in accordance with the extension of the interlayer spacing (d). These results suggest that the newly obtained MEL-D would facilitate the application of MELs in various fields as a lamellar-forming glycolipid with higher hydrate ability.",

In the presence of glycerol (heating time, 10\u00a0min), the reducing ends were converted into glycosides when the temperature of the glycerol was >140\u00a0\u00b0C without the addition of any catalysts. A temperature of 140\u00a0\u00b0C is close to that required for the initiation of thermal polymerization (glycosylation). Although the conversion was only around 20% in the range of 140\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C, the reactivity increased above 200\u2013240\u00a0\u00b0C where the thermal expansion of cellulose crystals is reported to become significant. Finally, all reducing ends were converted into glycosides at 260\u00a0\u00b0C. Such heterogeneous reactivity likely arose from the lower reactivities of the reducing ends in the crystalline region due to their lower accessibility to glycerol, although the reactivity in the non-crystalline region was similar to that of glucose. Alcohols that have a lower OH/C ratio did not react with the reducing ends, suggesting that the hydrophilicity of the alcohol was critical for the glycosylation reaction to proceed. The glycosylated cellulose samples were found to be significantly stabilized against pyrolytic coloration. The results of neat cellulose pyrolysis indicated that two competitive reactions, thermal glycosylation and degradation, formed a dark-colored substance at the reducing ends while the internal glucose units in the cellulose were comparatively stable.",

The highest amount of enzyme (50\u00a0U/mL), with the lowest concentration of sucrose (20\u00a0mM), and the lower temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C gave the lowest number-average molecular weight (MWn) of 20,630\u00a0Da, respectively.

The products were characterized by means of scanning electronic microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, viscosimetry, and NMR spectroscopy. Methanolysis products were studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The higher the concentration of CHPTAC employed, a higher degree of substitution was obtained, if the optimum concentration of NaOH in each case was employed. Insufficient quantities of NaOH reduced epoxide formation and the reacting alkoxides of the polysaccharide, whereas an excess of NaOH favored degradation of the epoxide and decrease in the molecular weight of the product. A reaction time of 2\u00a0h was sufficient to obtain products with the maximum degree of substitution for each case. The addition of NaBH4 gave products with a slightly higher molecular weight, but the extra cost involved should not justify its use for large-scale application.",

Our exploratory studies included a number of readily available glucans, which were oxidized with several combinations of TEMPO-sodium hypochlorite preparations followed by conjugation to BSA. Following these investigations, more structurally complex bacterial capsular PSs were stoichiometrically oxidized with TEMPO-sodium hypochlorite and conjugated to BSA. Hypochlorite was deemed to be the reaction component responsible for the extent of oxidation.

The amounts and positions of sulphate groups are often determined by HPLC analysis of disaccharides resulting from enzymatic degradation of the GAG chains. While heparan sulphate (HS) and heparin are specifically degraded by heparitinases, chondroitinases not only degrade chondroitin sulphate (CS) and dermatan sulphate (DS), but also the protein-free and unsulphated GAG hyaluronan (HA). Thus, disaccharide preparations derived by chondroitinase degradation may be contaminated by HA disaccharides. The latter will often comigrate in HPLC chromatograms with unsulphated disaccharides derived from CS. We have investigated how variation of pH, amount of enzyme, and incubation time affects disaccharide formation from CS and HA GAG chains. This allowed us to establish conditions where chondroitinase degrades CS completely for quantification of all the resulting disaccharides, with negligible degradation of HA, allowing subsequent HA analysis. In addition, we present simple methodology for disaccharide analysis of small amounts of CS attached to a hybrid PG carrying mostly HS after immune isolation.

To overcome this source of discrimination and to enhance signal intensity, labeling studies with cellobiose as model compound were performed with the goal to develop a rapid, easy, and robust method. Hydrazone formation with the permanently charged Girard\u2019s T reagent as well as reductive amination with five different charge providing amines were studied under various conditions. In both reaction types, the removal of water turned out to be the critical step because only under these conditions are the reactions pushed to completion. By working with only a slight excess of reagents, no purification is necessary to achieve excellent signal/noise ratios, avoiding further sources of discrimination. Comparing various reducing agents with respect to their selectivity and stability in the acidic reaction medium, 2-picoline borane turned out to be superior to the commonly used sodium cyanoborohydride. Thus, by replacement of the toxic NaCNBH3 by the more selective and stable, non-toxic 2-picoline borane, complete reductive amination with low amounts of reagents and without unlabeled alditol formation was achieved with o-aminobenzoic acid, a useful reagent for ESI MS in negative mode.

     "abstract": "Cryopreservation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) typically involves the cryoprotectant dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), however, infusional toxicity and reductions in cell viability remain a concern. Ice recrystallization (IR) is an important source of cryopreservation-induced cellular injury and limits the stem cell dose in UCB units. Carbohydrates have wide-ranging intrinsic IR inhibition (IRI) activity related to structural properties. We investigated the impact of carbohydrate IRI on cell viability, induction of apoptosis and hematopoietic progenitor function in cryopreserved UCB. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from UCB were cryopreserved in storage media containing specific carbohydrates (200\u00a0mM) and compared to 5% DMSO. Samples were analyzed under conditions of high IR (\u2018slow\u2019 thaw) and low IR (\u2018fast\u2019 thaw). Thawed samples were analyzed for viability and apoptosis by flow cytometry and hematopoietic function using colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. IRI of carbohydrate solutions was determined using the \u2018splat cooling\u2019 assay. Greater IRI capacity of carbohydrates correlated with increased yield of viable MNCs (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.92, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and CD34(+) cells (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) after thawing under conditions of high IR. The correlations were less apparent under conditions of low IR. Carbohydrates with greater IRI modulate the induction of early apoptosis during thawing, especially in CD34+ cells (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) as compared to total mononuclear cells (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and preserve CFU capacity in vitro (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.92, p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.0001).

Based on FTIR analysis, the chitosan was depolymerized randomly along the backbone; no other structural change was observed during the acid depolymerization process. Revealed in the TGA study, the degradation temperature and char yield of LMWCs (low molecular weight chitosan) were molecular weight dependent. The blood compatibility of LMWCs was also investigated: rouleaux formation was observed when erythrocyte contacted with LMWCs, which showed that LMWCs are able to interfere with the negatively charged cell membrane through its polycationic properties. Furthermore, as regards a kinetics investigation, the values of Mn (number-average molecular weight) were obtained from an experimentally determined relationship. The kinetics study showed that the complex salt, formed by amine on chitosan and acetic acid, acted as catalyst. Finally, the activation energy for the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage on chitosan was calculated to be 40\u00a0kJ/mol; the mechanism of acid depolymerization is proposed.

Nitrobenzene oxidation revealed that the hemicelluloses obtained are mostly free of bound lignins.

CS\u2013Cas III-ia mixtures were characterized by viscosity curves, UV\u2013vis, EPR, and in vivo activity against HeLa cell line. Rheological behavior showed a decrease of viscosity when the drug was present due to diminished electrostatic interactions of charged amine group. UV\u2013vis results illustrate that Cas III-ia is not stable at low pH as a result of interaction with acetic acid. However, when chitosan is present at the acidic solution Cas III-ia is stable. These results are supported by EPR studies. Finally, activity of the drug against HeLa cell line was not modified. Therefore, the present work presents evidence that there is no breaking of copper complex due to interaction between CS and Cas III-ia in acidic media.

     "abstract": "Pectin methylesterase (PME) catalyses the demethoxylation of pectin, a major plant cell wall polysaccharide. Through modification of the number and distribution of methyl-esters on the pectin backbone, PME affects the susceptibility of pectin towards subsequent (non-) enzymatic conversion reactions (e.g., pectin depolymerisation) and gel formation, and, hence, its functionality in both plant cell wall and pectin-containing food products. The enzyme plays a key role in vegetative and reproductive plant development in addition to plant\u2013pathogen interactions. In addition, PME action can impact favourably or deleteriously on the structural quality of plant-derived food products. Consequently, PME and also the proteinaceous PME inhibitor (PMEI) found in several plant species and specifically inhibiting plant PMEs are highly relevant for plant biologists as well as for food technologists and are intensively studied in both fields. This review paper provides a structured, comprehensive overview of the knowledge accumulated over the years with regard to PME and PMEI. Attention is paid to both well-established and novel data concerning (i) their occurrence, polymorphism and physicochemical properties, (ii) primary and three-dimensional protein structures, (iii) catalytic and inhibitory activities, (iv) physiological roles in vivo and (v) relevance of (endogenous and exogenous) enzyme and inhibitor in the (food) industry.

However, this system was unsuitable for large-scale production because of its complexity and low productivity. To overcome these problems, we constructed a recombinant E. coli simultaneously overexpressing slr1975 and neuB. This recombinant E. coli produced 81\u00a0mM (25\u00a0g/L) NeuAc in 22\u00a0h without the addition of C. ammoniagenes cells. For manufacturing on an industrial scale, it is preferable to use unconcentrated culture broth as the source of enzymes, and therefore, a high-density cell culture is required. An acetate-resistant mutant strain of E. coli (HN0074) was selected as the host strain because of its ability to grow to a high cell density. The NeuAc aldolase gene of E. coli HN0074 was disrupted by homologous recombination yielding E. coli N18-14, which cannot degrade NeuAc. After a 22\u00a0h reaction with 540\u00a0mM (120\u00a0g/L) GlcNAc in a 5\u00a0L jar fermenter, the culture broth of E. coli N18-14 overexpressing slr1975 and neuB contained 172\u00a0mM (53\u00a0g/L) NeuAc.",

This was accomplished by first introducing an azide functionality to a carboxymethyldextran surface, followed by reaction with a phosphane-modified carbohydrate ligand. The chemistry employed is extremely mild and was easily adapted to a commercial biosensor system. Using this approach, we investigated the binding of jacalin and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) to galactose, lactose, and N-acetyl-lactosamine.

Identification and quantification of EtI is carried out by extraction and injection of the EtI so generated in CH2Cl2 into a gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometer (GC\u2013MS). Routine quantification of EtI was then performed using GC with a flame ionization detector (GC\u2013FID). Results for different iodine:potassium iodide ratios of the initially bound iodine and for seven different starch matrices showed that in all cases regression coefficients for the standards were high (R2\u00a0>0.96).",

     "abstract": "We have synthesized four 6-thio pseudo glycolipid analogues and assessed how two of them self-assembled on a gold surface. These structures were designed as candidate tethers molecules to anchor bilayer lipid membranes on gold. 6-Deoxy-6-thiogalactose was chosen to anchor the macromolecule to the gold and define an aqueous zone at the gold surface. A long alkane chain (C-12 or C-18) linked to the anomeric position of the sugar residue was chosen to anchor a bilayer lipid membrane. The linkage between the carbohydrate and the hydrophobic chains is either a glycosidic bond or a 1,4-disubstituted triazole formed by copper(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) of the propargyl glycoside with azido-dodecane and azido-octadecane. We are expecting that the hydrocarbon chains will orient themselves perpendicular to the gold surface and be incorporated into the first leaflet of the bilayer membrane. We have studied self assembled monolayers of the C-12 aglycone analogues on gold using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). We compared the results given by the IRRAS experiments to the IR spectra recorded by attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectroscopy on films of the randomly oriented analogues.

Out of 10 glycoconjugates, the galactosyl\u2013naphthyl imine (1c) was found to be most effective toward agglutination inhibition (260 times better than galactose), quenching fluorescence intensity, and exhibiting greater binding (Ka, 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0M\u22121) with jacalin.

     "abstract": "Ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) is a sugar known to undergo the Maillard reaction (glycation) at a rapid rate. In a reaction with the lysines of bovine heart cytochrome c, R5P generates superoxide ( O 2 - ) that subsequently reduces ferri-cytochrome c to ferro-cytochrome c. The rate equation for the observed cytochrome c reduction is first order in respect to cytochrome c and half order in respect to R5P. The addition of amines to the cytochrome c-R5P system greatly increases the O 2 - generation with rates of approximately 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0min\u22121 being observed with millimolar levels of R5P and amine at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Pre-incubation of R5P with the amine prior to cytochrome c addition further enhances the rate of cytochrome c reduction approximately twofold for every 30\u00a0min of incubation. While clearly accounting for a portion of the reduction of cytochrome c, O 2 - is not the sole reductant of the system as the use of superoxide dismutase only partially limits cytochrome c reduction, and the contribution of O 2 - proportionally decreases with longer amine-R5P incubation times. The remainder of the cytochrome c reduction is attributed to either the Amadori product or a cross-linked Schiff base created when a Maillard reaction-derived dicarbonyl compound(s) reacts with the amine. It is believed that these compounds directly transfer electrons to ferri-cytochrome c and subsequently become stable free-radical cations. ATP, a putative regulator of cytochrome c activity, does not inhibit electron transport from O 2 - or the cross-linked Schiff base but does prevent R5P from reacting with surface lysines to generate superoxide. The spontaneous reaction between R5P and amines could serve as an alternative system for generating O 2 - in solution.",

We use a mechanistic model of hydrolysis and transglycosylation to derive an expression for the rate of pNP-formation as a function of enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, and several lumped kinetics parameters. The derivation assumes that the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) applies for three intermediate species in the mechanism; we determine conditions under which this assumption is rigorously justified. We integrate the rate expression and compare its integral form to pNP-versus-time data collected for a range of enzyme and substrate concentrations. The integral comparison gives a stringent test of the mechanistic model, and it serves to quantify the lumped kinetics parameters with good statistical precision, particularly a previously unidentified parameter that determines the selectivity of hydrolysis versus transglycosylation. The integrated rate expression accounts well for pNP-versus-time data under all circumstances we have investigated.",

Knockdown of FUT3 expression in MDA PCa2b cells by small interference RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced FUT3 expression. Cell-surface sialyl Lewis antigens were largely abolished. Cell adhesion and cell rolling on the blood vessel wall were simulated by perfusing cancer cells through microtubes coated with recombinant human E-selectin. At physiological levels of wall shear stress, the number of flowing cancer cells recruited to the microtube surface was dramatically reduced by FUT3 knockdown. Higher rolling velocity was also observed, which is consistent with reduced E-selectin binding activity. Interestingly, FUT3 siRNA treatment also significantly reduced the cell growth rate. Combined with the novel siRNA delivery platform recently developed in our laboratory, FUT3 siRNA could be a promising conjunctive therapy aiming at reducing the metastatic virulence of circulating epithelial cancer cells.",

No fluctuating chelate was found for the arabinopyranoside (the free arabinopyranoside being non-fluctuating as well), or for the xylopyranoside (no cis-vicinal diol function). In addition, syn-diaxial chelation (\u03baO2,4) was observed for the ribopyranoside and the xylopyranoside. The spectroscopic results were supplemented by X-ray analyses.",

The ions have been shown to be glycosyl-glycolaldehydes. All 16 stereochemical variants of their pyranosides were prepared and evaluated by infrared photodissociation, in addition to HexNAc-glycolaldehyde variants (m/z 262) of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose. The stereochemistry and anomeric configuration of these ions were differentiated in the gas phase using a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer with infrared multiphoton dissociation at 10.6\u00a0\u03bcm. Results were compared to those obtained by collision-induced dissociation. In some cases, differentiation was far preferable using infrared photodissociation; in others, collision-induced dissociation was preferred. Using an instrument that interfaced a linear trap with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance spectrometer, either dissociation technique could be used to optimally discriminate between isomers. With infrared photodissociation, spectral differences were highly statistically significant, even between pairs of isomers having spectra that appeared to be visually somewhat similar (p\u00a0<1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129, student\u2019s t-test for key discriminatory ions). Comparisons among different instruments suggest that physical standards of the stereochemical variants of these ions will be required for their detailed structural assignments in unknowns, as some variation was observed among instruments, both using infrared photodissociation and collision-induced dissociation.",

Chondroitin sulfate (CS) or heparan sulfate (HS) can attach to the first site, Ser535, whereas only CS attaches to the second, Ser546. Although the mechanism behind the assembly of CS and HS is not fully understood, it has been reported that the assembly of HS requires not only a cluster of acidic residues but also hydrophobic residues located near the Ser-Gly attachment sites (Esko, J. D. Zhang, L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.1996, 6, 663\u2013670). To further understand the effects of amino acids close to the Ser residues of the GAG-attachment sites on the glycosyltransferases, two tetraosyl peptides derived from the CS attachment sites of betaglycan, GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-SerGlyAspAsnGly (1) and GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-SerGlyAspAsnGlyPheProGly (2), were synthesized, and used as donor substrates for \u03b21,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-I (\u03b24GalNAcT-I) and \u03b11,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (\u03b14GlcNAcT-I).

Even characterization of smaller heparin and heparan sulfate oligosaccharide or disaccharide fragments using simple 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy is often complicated by the extensive signal overlap. 13C NMR signals, on the other hand, overlap less and therefore, 13C NMR spectroscopy can greatly facilitate the structural elucidation of the complex heparanome and provide finer insights into the structural basis for biological functions. This is the first report of the preparation of anomeric carbon-specific 13C-labeled heparin and heparan sulfate precursors from the Escherichia coli K5 strain. Uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled precursors were also produced and characterized by 13C NMR spectroscopy. Mass spectrometric analysis of enzymatically fragmented disaccharides revealed that anomeric carbon-specific labeling efforts resulted in a minor loss/scrambling of 13C in the precursor backbone, whereas uniform labeling efforts resulted in greater than 95% 13C isotope enrichment in the precursor backbone.

     "abstract": "Recently, various branched arabino-oligosaccharides as present in a sugar beet arabinan digest were characterized using NMR. Although HPAEC often has been the method of choice to monitor the enzymatic degradation reactions of polysaccharides, it was shown that HPAEC was incapable to separate all known linear and branched arabino-oligosaccharides present. As this lack of resolution might result in an incorrect interpretation of the results, other separation techniques were explored for the separation of linear and branched arabino-oligosaccharides. The use of porous-graphitized carbon liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering and mass detection as well as capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence and mass detection demonstrated the superiority of both the techniques toward HPAEC by enabling the separation and unambiguous identification of almost all the linear and branched arabino-oligosaccharides available. The elution behavior of all arabino-oligosaccharides for the three tested separation techniques was correlated with their chemical structures and conclusions were drawn for the retention mechanisms of the arabino-oligosaccharides on the different chromatographic and electrophoretic systems. The combination of the elution/migration behavior on LC/CE and the MS fragmentation patterns of the arabino-oligosaccharides led to the prediction of structures for new DP6 arabino-oligosaccharides in complex enzyme digests.",

To enable experimental approaches to study interactions of the Tn antigen with the immune system and analyze anti-Tn antibody responses in infection or disorders, we generated a Tn-expressing resource that can be used for high-throughput screening.

Several 2D procedures, including HSQC, HMQC-TOCSY, and HMQC-NOESY, were used to obtain reliable structural information from the complex spectra, and the signal assignments were additionally confirmed by comparison with the literature spectra of the related polysaccharides and synthetic oligosaccharides. In accordance with the previous data, the main polysaccharide component was shown to be a fucan sulfate containing a backbone of 3-linked \u03b1-l-fucopyranose residues sulfated at C-4 and/or at C-2 and branched at C-2 by single sulfated \u03b1-l-fucopyranose residues. In addition, three other types of sulfated polysaccharide molecules were detected in the total fucoidan preparation: (i) a fucogalactan having a backbone of 6-linked \u03b2-d-galactopyranose residues branched mainly at C-4 and containing both terminal galactose and fucose residues; (ii) a fucoglucuronomannan having a backbone of alternating 4-linked \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid and 2-linked \u03b1-d-mannopyranose residues with \u03b1-l-fucopyranose residues as single branches at C-3 of \u03b1-d-Manp; and (iii) a fucoglucuronan having a backbone of 3-linked \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid residues with \u03b1-l-fucopyranose residues as single branches at C-4.

     "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the potentials of mean force for separating short cellooligomers in aqueous solution as a means of estimating the contributions of hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen bonding to the insolubility of crystalline cellulose. A series of four potential of mean force (pmf) calculations for glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose in aqueous solution were performed for situations in which the molecules were initially placed with their hydrophobic faces stacked against one another, and another for the cases where the molecules were initially placed adjacent to one another in a co-planar, hydrogen-bonded arrangement, as they would be in cellulose I\u03b2. From these calculations, it was found that hydrophobic association does indeed favor a crystal-like structure over solution, as might be expected. Somewhat more surprisingly, hydrogen bonding also favored the crystal packing, possibly in part because of the high entropic cost for hydrating glucose hydroxyl groups, which significantly restricts the configurational freedom of the hydrogen-bonded waters. The crystal was also favored by the observation that there was no increase in chain configurational entropy upon dissolution, because the free chain adopts only one conformation, as previously observed, but against intuitive expectations, apparently due to the persistence of the intramolecular O3\u2013O5 hydrogen bond.",

The dissociation of the inclusion complex was monitored with a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer. The increase in relative humidity generally triggered the complex dissociation.

The constants of stepwise ionization of the dye ( H 3 R + \u21c6 H 2 R \u21c6 HR - \u21c6 R 2 - ), Ka0, Ka1, and Ka2 were determined using vis-spectroscopy at ionic strength 0.05\u00a0M (NaCl\u00a0+\u00a0buffer) and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. In the presence of 0.0086\u00a0M \u03b2-CD, the indices of ionization constants are as follows: pKa0\u00a0=\u00a01.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, pKa1\u00a0=\u00a05.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, pKa2\u00a0=\u00a06.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02. The changes in these pKas, as compared with the values determined without cyclodextrin, are unequal. Namely, the pKa0 value decreases by 1.0, while the pKa1 value increases by 0.7. Thus, the introduction of \u03b2-CD allows to govern the ratios Ka0/Ka1 and Ka1/Ka2, which are equal to, respectively, 141 and 151 in water, and 7.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 and 18.6 with cyclodextrin added. Rationalization of the observed phenomenon is possible taking into account the detailed scheme of protolytic equilibrium. Conclusions concerning tautomerism of dye molecules were deduced from absorption spectra; the fractions of tautomers, tautomerization constants, and microscopic ionization constants were evaluated. These data allow concluding that the main reason for the aforementioned pKa alterations is the binding of H2R by the cyclodextrin cavity accompanied by turning these neutral species into the colorless lactone. The host\u2013guest interaction of neutral species of fluorescein isothiocyanate, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein, and 3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032,6\u2032-tetrachlorofluorescein also results in the cyclodextrin-assisted shift of tautomeric equilibrium.

     "abstract": "Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) from the Burkholderia genus are proposed to be involved in pathological conditions in humans, such as cystic fibrosis and septicemia, as well as in the stability of soil aggregates. Hence, considering that the conformational and dynamic aspects of such EPSs may influence their biological activity, the current work employs a series of molecular dynamics simulations on di-, oligo-, and polysaccharide fragments of three EPSs, from Burkholderia caribensis, Burkholderia cepacia, and Burkholderia pseudomallei, with previously determined NOE data, to obtain a conformational description of such EPSs at the atomic level. As the obtained results show good agreement with the experimental data, pointing to the adequacy of the employed methodology to accurately describe the dynamics of polysaccharides, the strategy was also employed to predict the conformational behavior of an additional compound, from Burkholderia tropica, for which NOE signals are not available. Taking into account the potential importance of EPSs on the interaction of Burkholderia bacteria with distinct environments, it may be expected that a greater understanding of their structural aspects may contribute to controlling their pathological roles and potential agricultural applications.",

     "abstract": "Water uptake by amorphous sugars is an issue of high importance for the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, while the processes associated with sorption-induced crystallisation have been widely studied, little is known regarding the uptake mechanisms associated with pre-crystallisation water levels. In the present investigation we use dynamic vapour sorption to study the water uptake mechanisms associated with amorphous trehalose. More specifically, we have prepared spray-dried amorphous trehalose with three initial water contents and studied water uptake as a function of time and relative humidity. We model the data obtained prior to crystallisation and suggest two mechanisms that are based on Type II diffusion (using the Peleg equation), which predominates under high humidity conditions (50% RH and above), while we use a Type I Fickian diffusion expression to model uptake under low relative humidity conditions (40% RH and below). The model allows prediction of equilibrium sorption values which correlate well with previously published data calculated from equilibrium vapour pressure data. We also note that the water content following recrystallisation is greater than that predicted by the stoichiometric ratio. A novel model is suggested whereby recrystallisation onset times may be estimated from the vapour sorption data. In conclusion the study has demonstrated that pre-crystallisation water sorption may be associated with two mechanisms depending on the humidity conditions and that such modelling allows insights into both the mechanisms of uptake and the storage behaviour of amorphous sugar samples.",

Glycosylation is a promising route for their functional diversification into useful fine chemicals.

Systematic investigation for optimization of the biocatalytic synthesis included prevention of sucrose hydrolysis, which occurs in the process as a side reaction of the phosphorylase.

The reactivity of other acceptors decreased in the order, 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol\u00a0>\u00a01,2-propanediol\u00a0>\u00a03-allyloxy-1,2-propanediol\u00a0>\u00a03-(o-methoxyphenoxy)-1,2-propanediol\u00a0>\u00a03-tert-butoxy-1,2-propanediol. Glucosylated 1,2-propanediols were not detectably hydrolyzed by sucrose phosphorylase so that their synthesis by transglucosylation occurred simply under quasi-equilibrium reaction conditions.",

     "abstract": "Exploring non-covalent interactions, such as C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking and classical hydrogen bonding (H-bonding), between carbohydrates and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) is an important task in glycobiology. The present study focuses on intermolecular interactions, such as C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 (sugar\u2013aromatic stacking) and H-bonds, between methyl \u03b2-d-glucopyranoside and l-tyrosine\u2014a proxy model system for a cellulose\u2013CBM complex. This work has made use of various types of quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM) methods to determine which is the most accurate and computationally efficient. The calculated interaction potential energies ranged between \u221224 and \u221238\u00a0kJ/mol. The larger interaction energy is due to H-bonding between the phenyl hydroxyl of tyrosine and the O4 of the sugar. Density functional theory (DFT) methods, such as BHandHLYP and B3LYP, exaggerate the H-bond. Although one of the MM methods (viz. MM+) considered in this study does maintain the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 stacking configuration, it underestimates the interaction energy due to the loss of the H-bond. When the O\u2013H bond vector is in the vicinity of O4 (O\u2013H\u22efO4\u00a0\u2248\u00a02\u00a0\u00c5, e.g., in the case of MP2/6-31G(d)), the torsional energy drops to a minimum. For this configuration, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis also supports the presence of this H-bond which arises due to orbital interaction between one lone pair of the sugar O4 and the \u03c3\u2217(O\u2013H) orbital of the phenyl group of tyrosine. The stabilization energy due to orbital delocalization of the H-bonded system is \u223c13\u00a0kJ/mol. This H-bond interaction plays an important role in controlling the CH/\u03c0 interaction geometry. Therefore, the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 dispersive interaction is the secondary force, which supports the stabilization of the complex. The meta-hybrid DFT method, M05-2X, with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set agrees well with the MP2 results and is less computationally expensive. However, the M05-2X method is strongly basis set dependent in describing this CH/\u03c0 interaction. Computed IR spectra with the MP2/6-31G(d) method show blue shifts for C1\u2013H, C3\u2013H, and C5\u2013H stretching frequencies due to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction. However, the M05-2X/6-311++G(d,p) method shows a small red shift for the C1\u2013H stretching region and blue shifts for the C2\u2013H and C3\u2013H stretches. For the aromatic tyrosine C\u03b41\u2013C\u03b51 and C\u03b42\u2013C\u03b52 bonds in the complex, the calculated IR spectra show red shifts of 12\u00a0cm\u22121 (MP2/6-31G(d)) and 5\u00a0cm\u22121 (M05-2X/6-311++G(d,p)). This study also reports the upfield shifts of computed 1H NMR chemical shifts due to the C\u2013H\u22ef\u03c0 interaction.",

     "abstract": "Explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the 11 glucose-based disaccharides in water at 300\u00a0K and 1\u00a0bar are reported. The simulations were carried out with the GROMOS 45A4 force-field and the sampling along the glycosidic dihedral angles \u03d5 and \u03c8 was artificially enhanced using the local elevation umbrella sampling (LEUS) method. The trajectories are analyzed in terms of free-energy maps, stable and metastable conformational states (relative free energies and estimated transition timescales), intramolecular H-bonds, single molecule configurational entropies, and agreement with experimental data. All disaccharides considered are found to be characterized either by a single stable (overwhelmingly populated) state ((1\u2192n)-linked disaccharides with n\u00a0=\u00a01, 2, 3, or 4) or by two stable (comparably populated and differing in the third glycosidic dihedral angle \u03c9 \u02dc ; gg or gt) states with a low interconversion barrier ((1\u21926)-linked disaccharides). Metastable (anti-\u03d5 or anti-\u03c8) states are also identified with relative free energies in the range of 8\u201322\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121. The 11 compounds can be classified into four families: (i) the \u03b1(1\u21921)\u03b1-linked disaccharide trehalose (axial\u2013axial linkage) presents no metastable state, the lowest configurational entropy, and no intramolecular H-bonds; (ii) the four \u03b1(1\u2192n)-linked disaccharides (n\u00a0=\u00a01, 2, 3, or 4; axial\u2013equatorial linkage) present one metastable (anti-\u03c8) state, an intermediate configurational entropy, and two alternative intramolecular H-bonds; (iii) the four \u03b2(1\u2192n)-linked disaccharides (n\u00a0=\u00a01, 2, 3, or 4; equatorial\u2013equatorial linkage) present two metastable (anti-\u03d5 and anti-\u03c8) states, an intermediate configurational entropy, and one intramolecular H-bond; (iv) the two (1\u21926)-linked disaccharides (additional glycosidic dihedral angle) present no (isomaltose) or a pair of (gentiobiose) metastable (anti-\u03d5) states, the highest configurational entropy, and no intramolecular H-bonds. The observed conformational preferences appear to be dictated by four main driving forces (ring conformational preferences, exo-anomeric effect, steric constraints, and possible presence of a third glycosidic dihedral angle), leaving a secondary role to intramolecular H-bonding and specific solvation effects. In spite of the weak conformational driving force attributed to solvent-exposed H-bonds in water (highly polar protic solvent), intramolecular H-bonds may still have a significant influence on the physico-chemical properties of the disaccharide by decreasing its hydrophilicity. Along with previous work, the results also complete the suggestion of a spectrum of approximate transition timescales for carbohydrates up to the disaccharide level, namely: \u223c30\u00a0ps (hydroxyl groups), \u223c1\u00a0ns (free lactol group, free hydroxymethyl groups, glycosidic dihedral angle \u03c9 \u02dc in (1\u21926)-linked disaccharides), \u223c10\u00a0ns to 2\u00a0\u03bcs (ring conformation, glycosidic dihedral angles \u03d5 and \u03c8). The calculated average values of the glycosidic torsional angles agree well with the available experimental data, providing validation for the force-field and simulation methodology employed.",

     "abstract": "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) was purified for the first time from the bones of sturgeon and analyzed to evaluate its structure and properties. A single polysaccharide was extracted from sturgeon bone in a concentration of 0.28\u20130.34% for dry tissue and characterized as CS. By means of specific chondroitinases and HPLC separation of generated unsaturated repeating disaccharides, this polymer was found to be composed of \u223c55% of disaccharide monosulfated in position 6 of the GalNAc, \u223c38% of disaccharide monosulfated in position 4 of the GalNAc, and \u223c7% of nonsulfated disaccharide. The charge density was 0.93 and the ratio of 4:6 sulfated residues was equal to 0.69, a value confirmed by 13C NMR experiments. Chondroitinase B confirmed that the purified sturgeon CS contained mainly GlcA (>99.5%) as uronic acid. PAGE analysis showed a CS having a high molecular mass with an average value of 39,880 according to HPSEC values producing a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 37,500. On the basis of the data collected, it is reasonable to assume that CS isolated from sturgeon bone might be potentially useful for scientific and pharmacological applications, making this bony fish, which is generally discarded after ovary collection, a useful source of this polymer. Finally, this newly identified source of CS would enable the production of this macromolecule having a particular repeating disaccharide composition, structure, and biological properties.",

The results show that only the first hydrate amorphizes while the other two remain structurally invariant. These different behaviours are attributed to the plasticizing effect of the structural water molecules which can decrease the glass transition temperature below the milling temperature. The results reveal clearly the fundamental role of the glass transition in the solid-state amorphization process induced by milling, and they also explain why crystalline hydrates are systematically more difficult to amorphize by milling than their anhydrous counterpart.

     "abstract": "The expanding field of glycobiology requires tools for the synthesis of structurally defined oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, while any potential therapeutic applications of sugar-based derivates would require access to substantial quantities of such compounds. Classical chemical approaches are not well suited for such large-scale syntheses, thus enzymatic approaches are sought. Traditional routes to the enzymatic assembly of oligosaccharides have involved the use of either Nature\u2019s own biosynthetic enzymes, the glycosyl transferases, or glycosidases run in transglycosylation mode. However, each approach has drawbacks that have limited its application. Glycosynthases are mutant glycosidases in which the catalytic nucleophile has been replaced by mutation, inactivating them as hydrolases. When used in conjunction with glycosyl fluorides of the opposite anomeric configuration to that of the substrate, these enzymes function as highly efficient transferases, frequently giving stoichiometric yields of products. Further improvements can be obtained through directed evolution of the gene encoding the enzyme in question, but this requires the ability to screen very large libraries of catalysts. In this review we survey new screening methods for the formation of glycosidic linkages using high-throughput techniques, such as FACS, chemical complementation, and robot-assisted ELISA assays. Enzymes were evolved to have higher catalytic activity with their natural substrates, to show altered substrate specificities or to be promiscuous for efficient application in oligosaccharide, glycolipid, and glycoprotein synthesis.",

Despite the expected participating effect of the Fmoc group, the reaction solvent was found to be decisive for obtaining highly selective \u03b1-mannosylations. The Fmoc 2-O-protecting group can be then simply removed from the obtained di-oligosaccharide in the same vessel where the glycosidation is conducted. The resulting oligosaccharide can thus be directly employed as a glycosyl acceptor for further elongation. The preparation of biologically important linear and branched oligomannoses incorporated into HIV gp120 demonstrates that iteration of this one-pot sequence leads to very straightforward oligosaccharide assembly. As an additional result, a rapid approach has been disclosed for accessing a 3,6-OH mannose building-block to be incorporated in branched structures. This relies on a double reductive opening of a di-O-benzylidene mannose intermediate whose regioselectivity appears to be independent of the configuration of the five-membered benzylidene.",

To synthesize the glycosylated whole polypeptide chain of the AILIM/ICOS extracellular domain, the target polypeptide chain was divided into four segments, each containing a cysteine residue. Those peptide segments were synthesized by conventional SPPS, followed by thioesterification of the C-terminus. The oligosaccharide moiety, a biantennary complex type disialyloligosaccharide, was attached to the cysteine thiol in the peptide backbone using the haloacetamide method. These peptides, as well as a glycosylated peptide, were sequentially coupled by use of native chemical ligation.

     "abstract": "Changes in cell surface glycosylation are common modifications that occur during oncogenesis, leading to the over-expression of tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACA). Most of these antigens are sialylated and the increase of sialylation is a well-known feature of transformed cells. In breast cancer, expression of TACA such as sialyl-Lewisx or sialyl-Tn is usually associated with a poor prognosis and a decreased overall survival of patients. However, the specific role of these sialylated antigens in breast tumour development and aggressiveness is not clearly understood. These glycosylation changes result from the modification of the expression of genes encoding specific glycosyltransferases involved in glycan biosynthesis and the level of expression of sialyltransferase genes has been proposed to be a prognostic marker for the follow-up of breast cancer patients. Several human cellular models have been developed in order to explain the mechanisms by which carbohydrate antigens can reinforce breast cancer progression and aggressiveness. TACA expression is associated with changes in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and tumour growth. In addition, recent data on glycolipid biosynthesis indicate an important role of GD3 synthase expression in breast cancer progression. The aim of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of sialylation changes that occur in breast cancer and to describe the cellular models developed to analyze the consequences of these changes on disease progression and aggressiveness.",

In particular iGb3 is attracting considerable attention as it is believed to serve as a ligand for natural killer T cells. Whether or not iGb3 is present in humans and which enzyme might be responsible for its synthesis is at present a matter of lively debate. In the current investigation we evaluated human blood group B galactosyltransferase (GTB) for its ability to catalyze the formation of iGb3 from lactosylceramide and UDP-Galp. GTB is a retaining glycosyltransferase that in vivo catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Galp donors to OH-3 of Galp on the H-antigen (\u03b1-l-Fucp-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-d-Galp) acceptor forming the blood group B antigen. GTB tolerates modifications in donor and acceptor substrates and its ability to accept lactosides as acceptors makes it a possible candidate for iGb3 production in humans. For comparison iGb3 and Gb3 were also synthesized from the same acceptor using an \u03b1-(1\u21923)- and \u03b1-(1\u21924)-specific galactosyltransferase, respectively. All the enzymes tested catalyzed the desired reactions. Product characterization by NMR analysis clearly differentiated between the \u03b1-Galp-(1\u21923)-Galp and \u03b1-Galp-(1\u21924)-Galp product, with the GTB product being identical to that of the \u03b1-(1\u21923)-GalT-catalyzed reaction. The rate of transfer by GTB however was very low, only 0.001% of the rate obtained with a good substrate, H antigen disaccharide (octyl \u03b1-l-Fucp-(1\u21922)-\u03b2-d-Galp).

Using LC\u2013MS, we found that both cytokines increased overall sialylation of N- and O-glycans and induced a shift towards \u03b1-(2\u21923)-linked sialic acid residues in chondrocyte glycoproteins. These results were supported by quantitative PCR showing increased expression of \u03b1-(2\u21923) sialyltransferases in treated cells. Moreover, we found that both IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 induced a considerable shift from oligomannosidic glycans towards complex-type N-glycans. In contrast, core \u03b1-(1\u21926)-fucosylation of chondrocyte N-glycans was found to be reduced particularly by TNF-\u03b1.

J. Biotechnol. 2008, 134, 261\u2013265.]. First attempts to use a similar strategy to produce 6\u2032-sialyllactose with a strain expressing \u03b1-(2\u21926)-sialyltransferase from the Photobacterium sp. JT-ISH-224 led to the production of a trisaccharide that was identified as KDO-lactose (2-keto-3-deoxy-manno-octonyllactose). This result showed that \u03b1-(2\u21926)-sialyltransferase was able to use CMP-KDO as sugar donor and preferentially used CMP-KDO over CMP-Neu5Ac. By reducing the expression level of the sialyltransferase gene and increasing that of the neuABC genes, we have been able to favour the formation of 6\u2032-sialyllactose and to prevent the formation of KDO-lactose. However, in this case, a third lactose derivative, which was identified as 6,6\u2032-disialyllactose, was also produced. Formation of 6,6\u2032-disialyllactose was mainly observed under conditions of lactose shortage.

For this polymer, several putative biosynthesis enzymes were identified upstream of the spaA gene. For in vivo cell surface display, the hexahistidine tag and the enhanced green fluorescent protein, respectively, were translationally fused to the C-terminus of SpaA. Immunoblot analysis, immunofluorescence staining, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the fused epitopes were efficiently expressed and successfully displayed via the S-layer glycoprotein matrix on the surface of P. alvei CCM 2051T cells.

The UV-RR spectra were acquired at 325\u00a0nm laser beam excitation, which was shown to be appropriate for selective analysis of chromophore structures in polysaccharides. The proposed approach allowed the monitoring of chromophores in pulps and to track the extent of polysaccharide oxidation. However, precaution was suggested while performing a quantitative analysis of chromophores at the characteristic band of \u223c1600\u00a0cm\u22121 because of charge transfer complexes (CTCs) that exist in the pulp. These CTCs can affect the intensity of the aforementioned band by diminishing the conjugate state in the chromophore moieties. The amount of carbonyl and carboxyl groups in polysaccharides correlated with the intensity of the band at 1093\u00a0cm\u22121. The analysis of UV-RR spectra revealed xylan as an important source of chromophores in eucalypt kraft pulp.",

Moreover, mass spectra recorded on the native sample revealed that acetyl substitution was very variable, producing a mixture of repeating units containing zero to four acyl groups. At the same time, finding acetylated oligosaccharides showed that binding of these substituents occurred in the cellular periplasmic space, before the polymerisation process took place. In the chromatographic peak containing the repeating unit, oligosaccharides shorter than the repeating unit co-eluted.

The mutant peptide is able to bind chitin oligomers, but with significant decreases in the association constants with chito-oligosaccharides. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the peptide mutant, by using NMR, has permitted us to deduce that the topology of the backbone is very similar to that of the parent Hev32 peptide. The same is true regarding the orientations of the key aromatic residues Trp21, Trp23, and Tyr30. The decrease in the association constants can be attributed to the different topological orientation of key side chains and to the importance of protein\u2013sugar intermolecular essential hydrogen bonds and CH\u2013\u03c0 stacking interactions.

We report here a study of the electron density of trehalose with X-ray diffraction and quantum mechanics calculations, similar to a recent study of sucrose, also a non-reducing molecule. In particular we studied the electron density around the glycosidic linkage and the hydrogen bonding with both deformation density and Atoms in Molecules (AIM) analyses.

We have previously reported the influence of the molecular size and the effects of various O-sulfo and N-acetyl groups of HP on growth-inhibitory activity. In this study, to understand the influence of carboxyl groups in the HP structure required for endogenous activity, a chemically modified derivative of native HP was prepared by converting the carboxyl groups of hexuronic acid residues in HP to primary hydroxyl groups. This modification procedure involves the treatment of HP with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide followed by reduction with NaBH4 to yield carboxyl-reduced heparin (CR-HP). When compared to the antiproliferative potency of native HP on cultured BPASMC\u2019s at three dose levels (1, 10, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), the CR-HP showed significantly less potency at all the doses.

The peak temperature assigned to the decomposition of wood components increases, while the global kinetic parameters for the main peak decrease with increasing exposure time of the wood to the attack by microorganisms.The increased characteristic temperatures of water desorption and cellulose decomposition processes and lower thermal stability could be explained by newly formed structures, mainly the oxidized ones.",

It is well known that gel strength increases with increasing Ca concentration, and it is hypothesised that this would also be the case for other cations. Pectins are a critical component of plant cell walls, imparting various physicochemical properties. Furthermore, the mechanism of metal toxicity in plants is hypothesised to be, in the short term, related to metal interactions with cell wall pectin. This study investigated the influence of Ca, Cu, Al and La ion concentrations at pH 4 on the storage modulus as a function of frequency for metal-pectin gels prepared from pectin (1%) with a degree of esterification of 30%. Gels were formed in situ over 6\u00a0d in metal chloride solution adjusted daily to pH 4. Cation concentration was varied to develop a relationship between gel strength and cation concentration. At similar levels of cation saturation, gel strength increased in the order of La\u00a0<\u00a0Ca\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a0Al\u00a0\u226a\u00a0Cu.

The fucosylation at O-3 of the glucosamine acceptor was accomplished using a thiofucoside donor activated with copper(II) bromide and tetrabutylammonium bromide. Thus, syntheses of the protected tri- and tetrasaccharides were achieved easily and efficiently using known building blocks. Of particular interest, we also report that these protected oligosaccharides were submitted to dissolving metal conditions (Na\u2013NH3) to provide in one single step the corresponding deprotected compounds. Under these conditions all protecting groups (O-acyl, benzylidene, benzyl, and N-trichloroacetyl) were efficiently cleaved. The work-up procedure for such reactions usually involves quenching with excess methanol and then neutralization with acetic acid. In our work the neutralization was carried out using acetic anhydride rather than acetic acid to ensure N-acetylation of the glucosamine residue. Both fully deprotected compounds were then simply purified and desalted by gel permeation chromatography on a Biogel P2 column eluted with water.",

These enzymes differ from each other with respect to substrate and linkage specificities. These enzymes have been grouped into the GH13 (GH, Glycoside Hydrolase) family in the CAZy database on the basis of similarity in amino acid sequence. Members of this family share three domains viz., A, B, and C, which have several binding subsites to accommodate monomeric units of the polysaccharide substrate. Among these subsites, \u22122, \u22121, +1, and +2 subsites are the most critical subsites for catalytic activity. In the present study, the substrate analog-, inhibitor-, or product-bound 3-D structures of 24 members of GH13 family have been analyzed to identify the features of the \u22122, \u22121, +1, and +2 subsites shared by all the members for recognition of the common substrate. It is found that neither the number nor the nature of the potential hydrogen bond-forming residues is conserved with the exception of the presence of tyrosine as a stacking residue in the \u22121 subsite. The relative spatial disposition of the conserved subsite residues are conserved as judged by distance matrices. The backbone of the \u22122, \u22121, +1, and +2 subsites does not undergo conformational change for the recognition of the substrate. This analysis suggests that these enzymes recognize their substrate on the basis of shape of the substrate rather than on the basis of specific interactions within the binding site.",

The adsorption of water on the degassed chitosan and its carbonizate as well the oxidation process was also investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. The surface morphology of initial chitosan and obtained carbonaceous material was observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The results indicate reduced crystallinity of the cellulose following the organosolv pretreatment, which renders the substrate easily hydrolyzable by cellulase. The degree of crystallinity increases and the relative proportion of para-crystalline and amorphous cellulose decreases after enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating preferential hydrolysis of these regions by cellulase. The structural and compositional changes in this material resulting from the organosolv pretreatment and cellulase enzyme hydrolysis of the pretreated wood were studied with solid-state CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy.

Its low molecular weight derivatives were first prepared by free radical depolymerization with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of copper(II) ion. The parameters of the process were investigated by a high-performance gel permeation chromatography. Analyses of chemical composition and molecular weight distribution indicated that the fragmentation of the main-chain of THG occurred randomly, obeyed pseudo first-order kinetics, and produced species with rather narrow and unimodal distribution of molar mass. The characterization of different molecular weight fractions was investigated by using viscometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Analysis of molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity in terms of the known theories for unperturbed wormlike cylinder yielded 1201\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0110\u00a0nm\u22121, 15.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0nm, and 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nm for molar mass per unit contour length ML, persistence length q, and diameter d, respectively.

SCOS III (MW 3\u20135\u00a0kDa) was found to be the most effective compound to inhibit HIV-1 replication. At nontoxic concentrations, SCOS III exhibited remarkable inhibitory activities on HIV-1-induced syncytia formation (EC50 2.19\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), lytic effect (EC50 1.43\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), and p24 antigen production (EC50 4.33\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 7.76\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for HIV-1RF and HIV-1Ba-L, respectively).

The ability of molecular mechanics force fields to reproduce ring-puckering conformational equilibrium is important for the successful prediction of the free energies of interaction of these carbohydrates with proteins. Here we report unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations of IdoA2S monosaccharide that were carried out to investigate the ability of commonly used force fields to reproduce its ring conformational flexibility in aqueous solution. In particular, the distribution of ring conformer populations of IdoA2S was determined. The GROMOS96 force field with the SPC/E water potential can predict successfully the dominant skew-boat to chair conformational transition of the IdoA2S monosaccharide in aqueous solution. On the other hand, the GLYCAM06 force field with the TIP3P water potential sampled transitional conformations between the boat and chair forms. Simulations using the GROMOS96 force field showed no pseudorotational equilibrium fluctuations and hence no inter-conversion between the boat and twist boat ring conformers. Calculations of theoretical proton NMR coupling constants showed that the GROMOS96 force field can predict the skew-boat to chair conformational ratio in good agreement with the experiment, whereas GLYCAM06 shows worse agreement. The omega rotamer distribution about the C5\u2013C6 bond was predicted by both force fields to have torsions around 10\u00b0, 190\u00b0, and 360\u00b0.",

The simulations revealed two stable minima for both compounds. For methyl \u03b2-cellobioside, the simulation minima in aqueous solution were shifted from their adiabatic map counterparts, while the simulation minima for methyl \u03b2-laminarabioside coincided with the corresponding adiabatic map minima. To validate the simulation results, NMR-derived NOEs and coupling constants across the glycoside linkage, 3JHC and 3JCH, were compared with values calculated from the MD trajectories. For each disaccharide, the best agreement was obtained for the simulations started at the A minimum. For both compounds, inter-ring water bridges in combination with the direct hydrogen bonds between the same groups were found to be determining factors for the overall solution structure of the disaccharides which differed from solid-state structures. Comparison with helical parameters showed that the preferred glycosidic dihedral configurations in the methyl \u03b2-cellobioside simulation were not highly compatible with the structure of cellulose, but that curdlan helix structures agreed relatively well with the methyl \u03b2-laminarabioside simulation.

     "abstract": "Individual pectin polymers and complexes, isolated from the pericarp of unripe tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Rutgers), were subjected to a mild acid hydrolysis and visualised and characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images confirm earlier studies showing that individual pectic polysaccharides often possess long branches. The AFM data have been used to construct size and molecular weight distributions for the single molecules and complexes, from which the calculated number-average and weight-average molecular weights can then be compared directly with the published literature data on the rheology of bulk samples. Loss of the neutral sugars arabinose, galactose and rhamnose from the pectin samples does not significantly alter either the size or the branching density of the individual polymers, but is reflected in a breakdown of the complexes. Significant loss of galacturonic acid at long hydrolysis times was found to be accompanied by changes in the size and branching of the single polymers and further breakdown of the complexes. The results suggest that rhamnose, arabinose and galactose are not the major components of the individual polymers but are, instead, confined to the complexes. The polysaccharides represent a previously unrecognised branched homogalacturonan with a minimum mean size some three times larger than that previously reported. The complexes consist of homogalacturonans (HGs) held together by rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) regions. Comparison of the rate of depolymerisation of the homogalacturonans and complexes with the published data on changes in the intrinsic viscosity of bulk pectin samples, subjected to similar acid hydrolysis, suggests that the different rates of depolymerisation of RG-I and HG contribute separately to the observed changes in intrinsic viscosity during acid hydrolysis. Thus data obtained using a single molecule microscopy technique provides new insights into the behaviour in the bulk.",

Analysis of the DFTMD results includes the following: energies averaged over the simulation time, calculated anomeric ratios, hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl rotamer populations, and hydration energies. Hydrogen-bonding networks persistence times were examined, and the effects of solvation on rotamer populations were described. Anomeric ratios calculated from energy optimization of an ensemble of low-energy conformers are compared to those obtained from ensemble averages from molecular dynamics, with dynamics simulations giving populations in best agreement with experimental anomeric ratios. Ensemble results in vacuo were not in agreement with experimental anomeric ratios or hydroxymethyl populations, producing in some cases reversal of the \u03b1:\u03b2 ratios. The difficulty in obtaining correct \u03b1:\u03b2 ratios increases with the number of axial groups; the mono-axial epimers being best represented, epimers with two axial groups being more difficult, and the epimers with three axial hydroxyl groups being most difficult to analyze, the result of a large number of very strong hydrogen-bonding networks that form the ensemble of low-energy conformations in the multi-axial structures.",

Monomeric DHAP was obtained in the form of four crystalline salts: CaCl(DHAP)\u00b72.9H2O (7a), Ca2Cl3(DHAP)\u00b75H2O (7b), CaCl(DHAP)\u00b72H2O (7c), and CaBr(DHAP)\u00b75H2O (7d) by crystallization from aqueous solutions containing DHAP acid and CaCl2 or CaBr2, or by direct crystallization from a solution containing DHAP precursor and CaCl2. At least one of the salts is stable and may be stored in the crystalline state at room temperature for several months. The dimeric form was obtained by slow saturation of free DHAP syrup with ammonia at \u221218\u00a0\u00b0C and isolated in the form of its hydrated diammonium salt (NH4)2(DHAP-dimer)\u00b74H2O (8).

In all 7a\u2013d monomeric DHAP exists in the monoanionic form in an extended (in-plane) cisoid conformation, with both hydroxyl and ester oxygen atoms being synperiplanar to the carbonyl O atom. The crucial structural feature is the coordination manner, in which the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms act as chelating as well as bridging atoms for the calcium cations. Additionally, the DHAP monoanions chelate another Ca2+ by the \u03b1-hydroxycarbonyl moiety, in a manner observed previously in dihydroxyacetone (DHA) calcium chloride complexes. In dimeric 8 the anion is a trans isomer with the dioxane ring in a chair conformation with the hydroxyl groups in axial positions and the phosphomethyl group in an equatorial position.",

All three force fields model the 4C1 conformation as the most stable by at least 6\u00a0kJ/mol, as compared to other conformations. Interconversion from the 4C1 to any other conformation is associated with a barrier of no lower than 26\u00a0kJ/mol.

     "abstract": "Differences in amylase action pattern on amylopectin were demonstrated by the relation between the decrease in potassium iodide\u2013iodine binding of waxy maize starch and the increase in reducing value during hydrolysis, as expressed by the RV80 value (i.e., the reducing value for a potassium iodide\u2013iodine binding value of 80% of that of the starting material). In the initial stages of the hydrolysis, the ratio of the increase in the level of reducing polysaccharides to the increase in the total level of reducing sugars formed during amylolysis of amylopectin can be considered as a measure of the level of inner chain attack (LICA) in the overall hydrolysis of the amylopectin structure and correlated with the respective RV80 value. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens \u03b1-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae \u03b1-amylase, with the lowest RV80 and the highest LICA values, hydrolysed the inner chains of amylopectin to a greater extent than did porcine pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. In the initial stages of hydrolysis, Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase, like the Bacillus cereus \u03b2-amylase, did not display any significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, in line with the high RV80 and very low LICA values for these enzymes. However, at the later stages of hydrolysis, the maltogenic amylase probably exhibited a significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, which itself seems to depend on temperature. The temperature dependence of the hydrolysis pattern of this enzyme is relevant for interpretation of its action as antifirming enzyme in bread-making applications.",

The [\u03b7] and Mw values, especially the conformation parameter \u03c1 (\u2261Rg/Rh), of the renatured lentinan were close to those of the originally extracted one, suggesting that random lentinan chains in DMSO were reassembled into triple helical structures. Moreover, the renatured lentinan in 95% water/5% DMSO solution exhibited a unique behavior of triple helical glucans that shear modulus G\u2032 decreased sharply at temperature from 8.4\u00a0\u00b0C to 13.3\u00a0\u00b0C with increasing temperature, which was ascribed to the intramolecular conformation transition from ordered triple helical I to disordered triple helical II. The AFM images gave was suggested intuitively evidence that the renatured lentinan mainly existed as rod-like chains, supporting that formation of triple helical structure. The optimal lentinan concentration for triple helical configuration formation was estimated to be over 0.04%. The time dependence of Rh and UV absorption of the water-diluted lentinan/DMSO solution with an indicator of azo dye of Congo red suggested that renaturation of triple helix was a very rapid process. Moreover, the blue-shift of UV\u2013vis absorption spectra suggested that the dye molecules of Congo red were assembled into supramolecular structure in the hydrophobic cavity of the renatured triple helical lentinan.

     "abstract": "Amylopectin fine structures were studied following limited hydrolysis of gelatinised waxy maize starch by amylases with a different level of inner chain attack (LICA). This was done by size exclusion chromatography as well as by debranching the (partially hydrolysed) amylopectin samples and studying the size distributions of the released chains. \u03b1-Amylases from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Aspergillus oryzae, with a relatively high LICA, drastically altered amylopectin chain length distribution and reduced the amylopectin molecular size (MS) significantly even at a low to moderate degree of hydrolysis (DH). Porcine pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (PPA), with a rather low LICA but a high multiple attack action on amylose, reduced the amylopectin MS much slower. Following hydrolysis by PPA to a DH of 10% and enzymic debranching of the amylopectin residue, several subpopulations of chains consisting of 2\u201312 glucose units were detected, indicating a multiple attack action on the amylopectin side chains. During the early stages of hydrolysis, the maltogenic Bacillus stearothermophilus \u03b1-amylase (BStA) preferentially hydrolysed the exterior chains of amylopectin. However, during the later phases, BStA also hydrolysed inner chains, presumably with a high multiple attack action. The present results clearly show that different enzymes can be used for (limited) conversion of amylopectin into structures differing in molecular weight and chain length distributions.",

     "abstract": "The glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate is essential in human health and disease but exactly how sulfation dictates its 3D-strucutre at the atomic level is unclear. To address this, we have purified homogenous oligosaccharides of unsulfated chondroitin (with and without 15N-enrichment) and analysed them by high-field NMR to make a comparison published chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan 3D-structures. The result is the first full assignment of the tetrasaccharide and an experimental 3D-model of the hexasaccharide (PDB code 2KQO). In common with hyaluronan, we confirm that the amide proton is not involved in strong, persistent inter-residue hydrogen bonds. However, in contrast to hyaluronan, a hydrogen bond is not inferred between the hexosamine OH-4 and the glucuronic acid O5 atoms across the \u03b2(1\u21923) glycosidic linkage. The unsulfated chondroitin bond geometry differs slightly from hyaluronan by rotation about the \u03b2(1\u21923) \u03c8 dihedral (as previously predicted by simulation), while the \u03b2(1\u21924) linkage is unaffected. Furthermore, comparison shows that this glycosidic linkage geometry is similar in chondroitin-4-sulfate. We therefore hypothesise that both hexosamine OH-4 and OH-6 atoms are solvent exposed in chondroitin, explaining why it is amenable to sulfation and hyaluronan is not, and also that 4-sulfation has little effect on backbone conformation. Our conclusions exemplify the value of the 3D-model presented here and progress our understanding of glycosaminoglycan molecular properties.",

However, present experiments demonstrated that in single sugar systems, if relative humidity is enough for sugar crystallization, the amorphous phase will have a short life. In the conditions of the present experiments, more than 75% of amorphous phase crystallized in less than one month. The good performance of sugars that form hydrated crystals (trehalose and raffinose) as bioprotectants in dehydrated systems is related to the high amount of water needed to form crystals, but not to the decreased water content or increased Tg of the amorphous phase. The latter effect is only temporary, and presumably shorter than the expected shelf life of pharmaceuticals or food ingredients, and is related to thermodynamic reasons: if there is enough water for the crystal to form, it will readily form.",

     "abstract": "Three sweetpotato cultivars were investigated for their starch content and amylose/amylopectin ratio. Ym starch contains 87.2% amylopectin and 12.8% amylose, when total starch was calculated as 100%. The Zm cultivar contains 33.6% amylopectin and 18.2% amylose, and its total starch was calculated as 51.8% of that of Ym. The Hm cultivar contains 39.1% amylopectin and 30.5% amylose, and its total starch was 69.6%. We analyzed the expression levels of starch and sucrose biosynthesis-related genes including AGPases a, b, and c; sucrose synthases I and II; starch synthase I; GBSS I; and SBEs I and II. All genes tested in this experiment were detected only in Ym, while several genes showed very faint or no expression in Zm and Hm. We also measured tissue-specific expression of these genes in whole plants of Ym. Most of the genes are expressed in the stem and roots of the plants. Expression profiles of starch synthesis-related genes of the sweetpotato leaves were investigated after supplementing the different concentrations of sucrose solution. All genes in Ym were clearly induced by sucrose, but the expression levels of some of these genes did not change in Zm and Hm. The total starch content of Ym, Zm, and Hm gradually increased over time on addition of 3%, 6%, and 9% sucrose concentrations. The greatest accumulation was observed in Ym at 48\u00a0h, and it was almost 2.24 times higher than that of the (0%) control, while Zm and Hm showed 1.76 and 1.91 times higher levels of starch, respectively. These results indicate that cooperative expression of all related genes is essential for starch biosynthesis from sucrose. This is the first report on different sucrose contents and the efficiency with which exogenous sucrose switches on gene expression of starch biosynthesis-related genes among cultivars.",

The antioxidant properties of five different polysaccharides, high molecular weight alginate (H-ALG), low molecular weight alginate (L-ALG), high molecular weight chitosan (H-chitosan), low molecular weight chitosan (L-chitosan), and pectic acid (PA) were examined using N-centered radicals from 1,1\u2032-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2\u2032-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and reducing power, based on their ability to reduce Cu2+. L-chitosan and PA had acceptable scavenging abilities and were good radical scavengers, with good reducing power, but the H-chitosan and alginate derivatives were much less effective. The results suggest that L-chitosan and PA could be useful in combating oxidative stress. A PA and L-chitosan interpolymer complex (IPC) tablet was prepared and evaluated as an extended-release tablet matrix using theophylline (TPH) as a model drug. The release of TPH from the matrix tablet (TPH/PA/L-chitosan\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0mg:150\u00a0mg:50\u00a0mg) was slower than that from PA only (TPH/PA/chitosans\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0mg:200\u00a0mg:0\u00a0mg) or L-chitosan only (TPH/PA/L-chitosan\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0mg:0\u00a0mg:200\u00a0mg) tablet. Turbidity measurements also indicated the optimum complexation ratio for IPC between PA/L-chitosan to be 1/3, indicating an acceptable relationship between the turbidity of the complex and the release ratio of TPH. These results suggest that an L-chitosan/PA complex would be potentially useful in an extended-release IPC tablet with high antioxidant activity.",

Since cellulose makes up more than 40\u201345% of the components found in most wood species, a series of experiments were also carried out using pure cellulose as a model for woody biomass. Several parameters such as temperature and residence time, as well as pH effects, were investigated in detail. The best temperature for decomposition and hydrolysis of pure cellulose was found around 270\u00a0\u00b0C. The effects of the initial pH of the solution which ranged from 1.5 to 6.5 were studied. It was found that the pH has a considerable effect on the hydrolysis and decomposition of the cellulose. Several products in the aqueous phase were identified and quantified. The conditions obtained from the subcritical water treatment of pure cellulose were applied for the Japanese red pine wood chips. As a result, even in the absence of acid catalyst, a large amount of wood sample was hydrolyzed in water; however, by using phosphate buffer at pH 2, there was an increase in the hydrolysis and dissolution of the wood chips. In addition to the water-soluble phase, acetone-soluble and water\u2013acetone-insoluble phases were also isolated after subcritical water treatment (which can be attributed mainly to the degraded lignin, tar, and unreacted wood chips, respectively). The initial wood:acid ratio in the case of reactions catalyzed by phosphate buffer was also investigated. The results showed that this weight ratio can be as high as 3:1 without changing the catalytic activity. The size of the wood chips as one of the most important experimental parameters was also investigated.",

     "abstract": "1l-1,5-Di-O-p-hydroxyphenylacetyl-chiro-inositol was isolated from the leaves of Taraxacumudum, along with seven other secondary metabolites. Identification of the inositol derivative, based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (1H, 13C and 2D NMR) in two solvents, allowed the correction of previously published data and conformational studies. This is the second report on the presence of inositol esters with p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in plants.",
