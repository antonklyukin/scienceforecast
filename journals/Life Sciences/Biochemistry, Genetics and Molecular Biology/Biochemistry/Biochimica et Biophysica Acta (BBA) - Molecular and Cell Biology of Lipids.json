     "abstract": "Free fatty acids (FFAs) are energy-generating nutrients that act as signaling molecules in various cellular processes. Several orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act as FFA receptors (FFARs) have been identified and play important physiological roles in various diseases. FFA ligands are obtained from food sources and metabolites produced during digestion and lipase degradation of triglyceride stores. FFARs can be grouped according to ligand profiles, depending on the length of carbon chains of the FFAs. Medium- and long-chain FFAs activate FFA1/GPR40 and FFA4/GPR120. Short-chain FFAs activate FFA2/GPR43 and FFA3/GPR41. However, only medium-chain FFAs, and not long-chain FFAs, activate GPR84 receptor. A number of pharmacological and physiological studies have shown that these receptors are expressed in various tissues and are primarily involved in energy metabolism. Because an impairment of these processes is a part of the pathology of obesity and type 2 diabetes, FFARs are considered as key therapeutic targets. Here, we reviewed recently published studies on the physiological functions of these receptors, primarily focusing on energy homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been proposed to enhance \u03b2-cell functions. Clinical studies have suggested that apolipoprotein M (apoM), which rides mainly on HDL, is involved in diabetes; however, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Recently, apoM was shown to be a carrier for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator. In the present study, we investigated the modulation of insulin secretion by apoM through the action of S1P.We overexpressed apoM in the livers of C57BL6 mice using adenovirus gene transfer and found that the blood glucose levels under ad libitum feeding conditions were lower in the apoM-overexpressing mice. While an insulin tolerance test revealed that insulin sensitivity was not significantly affected, a glucose tolerance test revealed that apoM-overexpressing mice had a better glucose tolerance because of enhanced insulin secretion, a phenomenon that was reversed by treatment with VPC 23019, an antagonist against S1P1 and S1P3 receptor. In vitro experiments with MIN6 cells also revealed that apoM-containing lipoproteins enhanced insulin secretion, which was again inhibited by VPC 23019. ApoM retarded the degradation of S1P, and an increase in Pdx1 expression, the attenuation of endoreticulum stress, and the phosphorylation of Akt, AmpK, and Erk were observed as possible underlying mechanisms for the effect of S1P, maintained at a high concentration by apoM, on the increase in insulin secretion.ApoM augmented insulin secretion by maintaining the S1P concentration under both in vivo and in vitro conditions.",

The potent DES activities have been detected before in the leaves of the meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris L.) and few other Ranunculaceae species. The nature of these DESs and their genes remained unrevealed. The PCR with degenerate primers enabled to detect the transcript of unknown P450 gene assigned as CYP74Q1. Besides, two more CYP74Q1 isoforms with minimal sequence variations have been found. The full length recombinant CYP74Q1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The preferred substrates of this enzyme are the 13-hydroperoxides of \u03b1-linolenic and linoleic acids, which are converted to the divinyl ether oxylipins (\u03c95Z)-etherolenic acid, (9Z,11E)-12-[(1\u2032Z,3\u2032Z)-hexadienyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, and (\u03c95Z)-etheroleic acid, (9Z,11E)-12-[(1\u2032Z)-hexenyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, respectively, as revealed by the data of mass spectrometry, NMR and UV spectroscopy.

     "abstract": "We previously identified cytosolic lipid\u2013protein particles (CLPP) having size and density of HDL in rat astrocytes, to which apoA-I induces translocation of cholesterol, caveolin-1 and protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) following its association with microtubules prior to cholesterol release/biogenesis of HDL (JBC 277: 7929, 2002; JLR 45: 2269, 2004). To further understand the physiological relevance of these findings, we investigated the CLPP/microtubule association and its role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking by using a technique of reconstituted microtubule-like filaments (rMT) in rat astrocyte cytosol. When the cells were pretreated with apoA-I, \u03b1-tubulin as a 52-kDa protein in rMT was found phosphorylated while \u03b1-tubulin in a soluble monomeric form was little phosphorylated. The phosphorylation took place coincidentally to apoA-I-induced association with rMT of CLPP, a complex containing PKC\u03b1, and was suppressed by a PKC inhibitor, Bis indolylmaleimide 1 (BIM). \u03b1-Tubulin dissociated from CLPP when phosphorylated, and it poorly bound to CLPP once dissociated. BIM did not influence association of PKC\u03b1 with rMT but suppressed apoA-I-induced cholesterol translocation to the cytosol from the ER/Golgi apparatus and apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release. We thereby concluded that \u03b1-tubulin phosphorylation by PKC\u03b1 on CLPP is involved in reversible CLPP association with the microtubules and intracellular cholesterol trafficking for apoA-I-dependent HDL biogenesis/cholesterol release in rat astrocytes.",

     "abstract": "Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is pivotal in the return of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion in bile and eventually feces. RCT from macrophages is a critical anti-atherogenicity mechanism of HDL. As the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe promoted RCT in mice, which lack cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), we investigated its effects in hamsters, which have CETP.A high-cholesterol diet (HC) increased cholesterol levels throughout lipoprotein fractions and ezetimibe markedly reduced VLDL/LDL cholesterol levels under both normal chow (NC) and HC. However, ezetimibe did not affect and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels under NC and HC, respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of 3H-cholesterol pre-labeled macrophages in an in vivo RCT assay increased tracer accumulation in the liver but reduced it in bile under HC, and these changes were completely cancelled by ezetimibe. Under both NC and HC, ezetimibe reduced tracer levels in the liver but increased them in feces, indicating promotion of RCT in vivo. We performed a RCT assay using hamsters subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) to clarify whether a transintestinal cholesterol efflux (TICE) pathway contributes to ezetimibe's enhancement of RCT. BDL markedly inhibited macrophage-derived 3H-cholesterol excretion to feces and cancelled ezetimibe's stimulatory effect on RCT, suggesting that biliary cholesterol excretion is a major contributor in RCT promotion by ezetimibe but the contribution of the TICE pathway is minimal.In conclusions, ezetimibe exerts an additive anti-atherogenic property by enhancing RCT in hamsters. Our findings suggest that this property is independent of the TICE pathway.",

We showed before that a metabolically stabilized cPA derivative, 2-carba-cPA, relieved osteoarthritis pathogenesis in vivo and induced hyaluronic acid synthesis in human osteoarthritis synoviocytes in vitro. This study focused on hyaluronic acid synthesis in human fibroblasts, which retain moisture and maintain health in the dermis. We investigated the effects of cPA and LPA on hyaluronic acid synthesis in human fibroblasts (NB1RGB cells). Using particle exclusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found that both cPA and LPA dose-dependently induced hyaluronic acid synthesis. We revealed that the expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 messenger RNA and protein is up-regulated by cPA and LPA treatment time dependently. We then characterized the signaling pathways up-regulating hyaluronic acid synthesis mediated by cPA and LPA in NB1RGB cells. Pharmacological inhibition and reporter gene assays revealed that the activation of the LPA receptor LPAR1, Gi/o protein, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) but not nuclear factor \u03baB induced hyaluronic acid synthesis by the treatment with cPA and LPA in NB1RGB cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that cPA and LPA induce hyaluronic acid synthesis in human skin fibroblasts mainly through the activation of LPAR1-Gi/o followed by the PI3K, ERK, and CREB signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, phospholipids are synthesized exclusively in the defined organelles specific for each phospholipid species. To explain the reason for this compartmental specificity in the case of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, we constructed and characterized a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that lacked endogenous phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferases but had a recombinant PE methyltransferase from Acetobacter aceti, which was fused with a mitochondrial targeting signal from yeast Pet100p and a 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0HA epitope tag. This fusion protein, which we named as mitopmt, was determined to be localized to the mitochondria by fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. The expression of mitopmt suppressed the choline auxotrophy of a double deletion mutant of PEM1 and PEM2 (pem1\u0394pem2\u0394) and enabled it to synthesize PC in the absence of choline. This growth suppression was observed even if the Kennedy pathway was inactivated by the repression of PCT1 encoding CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, suggesting that PC synthesized in the mitochondria is distributed to other organelles without going through the salvage pathway. The pem1\u0394pem2\u0394 strain deleted for PSD1 encoding the mitochondrial phosphatidylserine decarboxylase was able to grow because of the expression of mitopmt in the presence of ethanolamine, implying that PE from other organelles, probably from the ER, was converted to PC by mitopmt. These results suggest that PC could move out of the mitochondria, and raise the possibility that its movement is not under strict directional limitations.",

     "abstract": "Eicosanoids play an important role in inducing complex and crucial physiological processes in animals. Eicosanoid biosynthesis in animals is widely reported; however, eicosanoid production in invertebrate tissue is remarkably different to vertebrates and in certain respects remains elusive. We, for the first time, compared the orthologs involved in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in 14 species of invertebrates and 3 species of vertebrates. Based on parsimony, a complex AA-metabolic system may have existed in the common ancestor of the Metazoa, and then expanded and diversified through invertebrate lineages. A primary vertebrate-like AA-metabolic system via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways was further identified in the basal chordate, amphioxus. The expression profiling of AA-metabolic enzymes and lipidomic analysis of eicosanoid production in the tissues of amphioxus supported our supposition. Thus, we proposed that the ancestral complexity of AA-metabolic network diversified with the different lineages of invertebrates, adapting with the diversity of body plans and ecological opportunity, and arriving at the vertebrate-like pattern in the basal chordate, amphioxus.",

Our previous work identified lipid analogs that counteract plasma membrane barrier function for a series of amphiphilic drugs. For example, short-chain sphingolipids (SCS), like N-octanoyl-glucosylceramide, effectively elevated doxorubicin accumulation in tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and in endothelial cells, whereas other (normal) cells remained unaffected. We hypothesize here that local membrane lipid composition and the degree of lipid ordering define SCS efficacy in individual cells. To this end, we study the differential effect of SCS on bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in its confluent versus proliferative state, as a model system. While their (plasma membrane) lipidome stays remarkably unaltered when BAECs reach confluency, their lipids segregate to form apical and basolateral domains. Using probe NR12S, we reveal that lipids in the apical membrane are more condensed/liquid-ordered. SCS preferentially attenuate the barrier posed by these condensed membranes and facilitate doxorubicin influx in these particular membrane regions. We confirm these findings in MDCK cells and artificial membranes. In conclusion, SCS-facilitated drug traversal acts on condensed membrane domains, elicited by confluency in resting endothelium.",

DHA-mediated stimulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis was associated with extensive engagement of mitochondrial pathway (Bax/Bak activation, drop of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release), activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response (CHOP upregulation, changes in PERK level), decrease of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP, cIAP1) levels and significant changes in sphingolipid metabolism (intracellular levels of ceramides, hexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelines, sphingosines; HPLC/MS/MS). Interestingly, we found significant differences in representation of various classes of ceramides (especially C16:0, C24:1) between the cancer and normal colon cells treated with DHA and TRAIL, and suggested their potential role in the regulation of the cell response to the drug combination. These study outcomes highlight the potential of DHA for a new combination therapy with TRAIL for selective elimination of colon cancer cells via simultaneous targeting of multiple steps in apoptotic pathways.",

     "abstract": "Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2) is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TG). DGAT2 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and also localizes to lipid droplets when cells are stimulated with oleate. Previous studies have shown that DGAT2 can interact with membranes and lipid droplets independently of its two transmembrane domains, suggesting the presence of an additional membrane binding domain. In order to identify additional membrane binding regions, we confirmed that DGAT2 has only two transmembrane domains and demonstrated that the loop connecting them is present in the ER lumen. Increasing the length of this short loop from 5 to 27 amino acids impaired the ability of DGAT2 to localize to lipid droplets. Using a mutagenesis approach, we were able to identify a stretch of amino acids that appears to have a role in binding DGAT2 to the ER membrane. Our results confirm that murine DGAT2 has only two transmembrane domains but also can interact with membranes via a previously unidentified helical domain containing its active site.",

     "abstract": "Macrophage polarization elicits various metabolic alterations which in turn influence the polarized phenotype. Activation of glycolytic metabolism accompanies and supports macrophage pro-inflammatory M1 polarization. In contrast, M2 polarization of murine macrophages in response to the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) was linked to the up-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which was necessary for coining an IL-4-polarized phenotype. Here we investigated whether similar mechanisms operate in human macrophages stimulated with IL-4. IL-4 causes only moderate changes of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and FAO, correlating with an unaltered expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1 \u03b1/\u03b2 (PGC-1\u03b1/\u03b2), the master transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore, attenuating FAO had no effect on IL-4-induced polarization-associated gene expression. Apparently, FAO is dispensable for IL-4-induced polarization of human macrophages, pointing to fundamental differences in the metabolic requirements of macrophage phenotype alterations between mice and humans.",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the fetal brain is accomplished predominantly via a highly selective flow of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, AA) through the placenta. Little is known regarding the endogenous capability of the fetus to generate its own DHA and AA from lower homologues such as linolenic (18:3n-3, ALA) and linoleic (18:2n-6, LA) acids, respectively. Deuterium-labeled d5-ALA and d5-LA at millimolar concentrations were injected directly into the amniotic fluid in order to investigate maternal-independent metabolic conversion of the stable isotopes in brain and liver of the fetus near delivery. After 48\u00a0h under adequate maternal diet, the levels of d5-ALA metabolites in the fetal brain and fetal liver were 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 pmol/mg and 86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 pmol/mg of which 79% and 63.6% were comprised of d5-DHA.

Following sustained maternal dietary ALA deficiency, the levels of total d5-ALA derived metabolites in the fetal brain and fetal liver were increased to 231 pmol/mg and 696 pmol/mg of which 71% and 26% were comprised of d5-DHA. From the time course and relative rates of d5-ALA precursor displacement by d5-DHA in cellular phosphoglycerides, it is concluded that the fetal rat brain can generate its own DHA from its d5-ALA precursors particularly under dietary stress.",

     "abstract": "BRITE (brown-in-white) cells are brown adipocyte-like cells found in white adipose tissue (WAT) of rodents and/or humans. The recruitment of BRITE adipocytes, referred to as the browning of WAT, is hallmarked by the expression of UCP1 and exerts beneficial metabolic effects. Here we address whether beyond systemic cues depot- and strain-specific variation in BRITE recruitment is determined by a cellular program intrinsic to progenitors. Therefore we compared the browning capacity of serum and investigated brown and BRITE adipogenesis in primary cultures of stromal-vascular cells isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in two inbred mouse strains C57BL/6J (B6, a strain with low browning propensity) and 129/S6SvEv (129, a strain with high browning propensity). Paradoxically, serum collected from B6 mice was more potent in the promotion of browning than serum collected from 129 mice. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that depot- and strain-specific differences observed in vivo are pheno-copied in primary cultures in vitro, as judged by UCP1 expression and by functional analysis. Notably, primary adipocytes from 129 mice had a higher capacity for isoproterenol-induced uncoupled respiration than B6. We conclude that cues intrinsic to the progenitor cells contribute to differential BRITE adipogenesis. Further analyses demonstrate that these cues are independent of autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, BRITE progenitor abundance and genetic variation in the gene regulatory region of Ucp1 but rather depend on trans-acting factors. These results provide new insights on the molecular basis of strain and depot-specific differences in BRITE adipogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Genome sequencing efforts have identified many uncharacterized lipase/esterase enzymes that have potential to be drug targets for metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. However, sequence information and associated structural predictions provide only a loose framework for linking enzyme function to disease risk. We are now confronted with the challenge of functionally annotating a large number of uncharacterized lipases, with the goal of generating new therapies for metabolic diseases. This daunting challenge involves gathering not only sequence-driven predictions, but also more importantly structural, biochemical (substrates and products), and physiological data. At the center of such drug discovery efforts are accurately identifying physiologically relevant substrates and products of individual lipases, and determining whether newly identified substrates/products can modulate disease in appropriate preclinical animal model systems. This review describes the importance of coupling in vivo metabolite profiling to in vitro enzymology as a powerful means to assign lipase function in disease specific contexts using animal models. In particular, we highlight recent examples using this multidisciplinary approach to functionally annotate genes within the \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold domain (ABHD) family of enzymes.

     "abstract": "Modern optical microscopy has granted biomedical scientists unprecedented access to the inner workings of a cell, and revolutionized our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological and disease states. In spite of these advances, however, visualization of certain classes of molecules (e.g. lipids) at the sub-cellular level has remained elusive. Recently developed chemical imaging modalities \u2013 Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy \u2013 have helped bridge this gap. By selectively imaging the vibration of a specific chemical group, these non-invasive techniques allow high-resolution imaging of individual molecules in vivo, and circumvent the need for potentially perturbative extrinsic labels. These tools have already been applied to the study of fat metabolism, helping uncover novel regulators of lipid storage. Here we review the underlying principle of CARS and SRS microscopy, and discuss the advantages and caveats of each technique. We also review recent applications of these tools in the study of lipids as well as other biomolecules, and conclude with a brief guide for interested researchers to build and use CARS/SRS systems for their own research.

There is a tremendous variety of lipid molecules in the membrane and so far it is often unclear which component of the lipid matrix is essential for the function of a respective protein. Lipid molecules and proteins mutually influence each other; parameters such as acyl chain order, membrane thickness, membrane elasticity, permeability, lipid-domain and annulus formation are strongly modulated by proteins. More recent data also indicates that the influence of proteins goes beyond a single annulus of next-neighbor boundary lipids. Therefore, a mesoscopic approach to membrane lipid\u2013protein interactions in terms of elastic membrane deformations has been developed. Solid-state NMR has greatly contributed to the understanding of lipid\u2013protein interactions and the modern view of biological membranes. Methods that detect the influence of proteins on the membrane as well as direct lipid\u2013protein interactions have been developed and are reviewed here.

     "abstract": "Traditional methods of cancer treatment are limited in their efficacy due to both inherent and acquired factors. Many different studies have shown that the generation of ceramide in response to cytotoxic therapy is generally an important step leading to cell death. Cancer cells employ different methods to both limit ceramide generation and to remove ceramide in order to become resistant to treatment. Furthermore, sphingosine kinase activity, which phosphorylates sphingosine the product of ceramide hydrolysis, has been linked to multidrug resistance, and can act as a strong survival factor. This review will examine several of the most frequently used cancer therapies and their effect on both ceramide generation and the mechanisms employed to remove it. The development and use of inhibitors of sphingosine kinase will be focused upon as an example of how targeting sphingolipid metabolism may provide an effective means to improve treatment response rates and reduce associated treatment toxicity.

     "abstract": "Reprogramming energy metabolism constitutes one of the hallmarks of cancer. Changes in lipid composition of cell membranes also appear early in carcinogenesis. Quantification of various molecules such as lipids evidences the modifications in the metabolism of tumour cells and can serve as potential markers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool used for the detection and characterization of various types of molecules. This technique remains an attractive approach as it is cheap (equipment and reagents), does not require high grade solvents or expensive internal standards, equipment is widely available in standard laboratories and the method is robust and suitable for routine analyses. In this work we established partial least square (PLS) models based on FTIR spectra able to quantify lipids in complex mixtures such as cell extracts. In the first part, we attempted to build PLS models with FTIR spectra of 53 mixtures of 8 well-characterized pure lipids. Second, the PLS models were verified using FTIR spectra of mixtures that did not contribute to the calibration. The third step was the validation of the models on lipid cell extracts. In order to obtain reference values for cell extracts, high performance liquid chromatography was carried out by AVANTI. The lipid distribution were globally similar with both techniques, PLS models and chromatography. Finally, the models were applied to determine the lipid composition of cells exposed to four treatments. We could not evidence significant changes in the lipid composition of cell extracts after treatment, in terms of polar head groups. However, the models established in this study appear reliable and could be applied for high throughput measurements. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Tools to study lipid functions.",

In contrast, the saturated fatty acid, stearic acid, with the same carbon chain length as linoleic acid does not inhibit these responses. Consistent with this inhibition of store-operated Ca2\u00a0+ entry (SOCE), linoleic acid inhibits antigen-stimulated granule exocytosis to a similar extent. Using the fluorescently labeled plasma membrane Ca2\u00a0+ channel protein, AcGFP\u2013Orai1, together with the labeled ER Ca2\u00a0+ sensor protein, STIM1\u2013mRFP, we monitor stimulated coupling of these proteins that is essential for SOCE with a novel spectrofluorimetric resonance energy transfer method. We find effective inhibition of this stimulated coupling by linoleic acid that accounts for the inhibition of SOCE. Moreover, we find that linoleic acid induces some STIM1\u2013STIM1 association, while inhibiting stimulated STIM1 oligomerization that precedes STIM1\u2013Orai1 coupling. We hypothesize that linoleic acid and related PUFAs inhibit STIM1\u2013Orai1 coupling by a mechanism that involves perturbation of ER membrane structure, possibly by disrupting electrostatic interactions important in STIM1 oligomerization.

     "abstract": "The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), originally identified as the clearing factor lipase, hydrolyzes triglycerides present in the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins VLDL and chylomicrons. LPL is primarily expressed in tissues that oxidize or store fatty acids in large quantities such as the heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue and white adipose tissue. Upon production by the underlying parenchymal cells, LPL is transported and attached to the capillary endothelium by the protein GPIHBP1. Because LPL is rate limiting for plasma triglyceride clearance and tissue uptake of fatty acids, the activity of LPL is carefully controlled to adjust fatty acid uptake to the requirements of the underlying tissue via multiple mechanisms at the transcriptional and post-translational level. Although various stimuli influence LPL gene transcription, it is now evident that most of the physiological variation in LPL activity, such as during fasting and exercise, appears to be driven via post-translational mechanisms by extracellular proteins. These proteins can be divided into two main groups: the liver-derived apolipoproteins APOC1, APOC2, APOC3, APOA5, and APOE, and the angiopoietin-like proteins ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and ANGPTL8, which have a broader expression profile. This review will summarize the available literature on the regulation of LPL activity in various tissues, with an emphasis on the response to diverse physiological stimuli.",

A vertebrate Fad with \u03944 activity catalyzing the direct conversion of 22:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 to DHA was discovered in the marine teleost rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. Recent studies in vertebrates have shown that miRNAs may participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism at post-transcription level. However, their roles in LC-PUFA biosynthesis were not known. In the present study, in silico analysis predicts that the rabbitfish \u03944 Fad may be a target of miR-17 and thus we cloned miR-17, which is located at the forepart of the miR-17\u201392 cluster. Dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-17 targeted the 3\u2032UTR of \u03944 Fad directly. Furthermore, the expression level of miR-17 displayed an inverse pattern with that of \u03944 Fad mRNA in gill, liver and eyes, and also the \u03944 Fad protein quantity in rabbitfish liver. Incubation of rabbitfish primary hepatocytes with linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06), \u03b1-linolenic acid (LNA; 18:3n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03), EPA or DHA showed differential effects on miR-17, \u03944 Fad and \u03946/\u03945 Fad expression. LNA promoted the expression of miR-17 and \u03946/\u03945 Fad, but suppressed the expression of \u03944 Fad. In contrast, LA and EPA decreased the expression of miR-17 and \u03946/\u03945 Fad, but had no effect on \u03944 Fad. However, all the above were down-regulated by DHA. These data indicate that miR-17 was involved in the regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in rabbitfish liver by targeting \u03944 Fad.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibiting drug rapamycin (Sirolimus) has severe side effects in patients including hyperlipidemia, an established risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recently, it was shown that rapamycin decreases hepatic LDL receptor (LDL-R) expression, which likely contributes to hypercholesterolemia. Scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI) is the major HDL receptor and consequently regulating HDL-cholesterol levels and the athero-protective effects of HDL. By using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, we show that SR-BI is down-regulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This reduction of SR-BI protein as well as mRNA levels by about 50% did not alter HDL particle uptake or HDL-derived lipid transfer. However, rapamycin reduced HDL-induced activation of eNOS and stimulation of endothelial cell migration. The effects on cell migration could be counteracted by SR-BI overexpression, indicating that decreased SR-BI expression is in part responsible for the rapamycin-induced effects. We demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR leads to endothelial cell dysfunction and decreased SR-BI expression, which may contribute to atherogenesis during rapamycin treatment.",

The epoxide hydrolase and phosphatase activities of purified sEH were investigated. The Xenopus sEH did not show phosphatase activity toward 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate or several lysophosphatidic acids although it had EH activity. The amino acid sequence of Xenopus sEH was compared with that reported previously. We found amino acid substitutions of the 29th Thr to Asn and the 146th Arg to His and prepared a sEH mutant (N29T/H146R), designed as mutant 1. Neither wild-type sEH nor mutant 1 had phosphatase activity. Additional substitution of the 11th Gly with Asp was found by comparison with human sEH which has phosphatase activity, but the Xenopus sEH mutant G11D prepared as mutant 2 did not have phosphatase activity. The epoxide hydrolase activity of sEH seemed to be similar to that of human sEH, while Xenopus sEH did not have phosphatase activity toward several substrates that human sEH metabolizes.",

     "abstract": "The S447X polymorphism in lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which shortens LPL by two amino acids, is associated with low plasma triglyceride levels and reduced risk for coronary heart disease. S447X carriers have higher LPL levels in the pre- and post-heparin plasma, raising the possibility that the S447X polymorphism leads to higher LPL levels within capillaries. One potential explanation for increased amounts of LPL in capillaries would be more avid binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 (the protein that binds LPL dimers and shuttles them to the capillary lumen). This explanation seems plausible because sequences within the carboxyl terminus of LPL are known to mediate LPL binding to GPIHBP1. To assess the impact of the S447X polymorphism on LPL binding to GPIHBP1, we compared the ability of internally tagged versions of wild-type LPL (WT-LPL) and S447X-LPL to bind to GPIHBP1 in both cell-based and cell-free binding assays. In the cell-based assay, we compared the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 on the surface of cultured cells. This assay revealed no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1. In the cell-free assay, we compared the binding of internally tagged WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to soluble GPIHBP1 immobilized on agarose beads. Again, no differences in the binding of WT-LPL and S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 were observed. We conclude that increased binding of S447X-LPL to GPIHBP1 is unlikely to be the explanation for more efficient lipolysis and lower plasma triglyceride levels in S447X carriers.",

In light of our previous findings concerning the biological effects of certain epoxidated all-trans-polyisoprenes, the effects of squalene carrying epoxy moieties on the second and third isoprene residues were investigated here. In cultures of HepG2 cells both monoepoxides of squalene and one of their hydrolytic products inhibited cholesterol synthesis and stimulated the synthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ). Upon prolonged treatment the cholesterol content of these cells and its labeling with [3H]mevalonate were reduced, while the amount and labeling of CoQ increased. Injection of the squalene monoepoxides into mice once daily for 6\u00a0days elevated the level of CoQ in their blood, but did not change the cholesterol level. The same effects were observed upon treatment of apoE-deficient mice and diabetic GK-rats. This treatment increased the hepatic level of CoQ10 in mice, but the amount of CoQ9, which is the major form, was unaffected. The presence of the active compounds in the blood was supported by the finding that cholesterol synthesis in the white blood cells was inhibited. Since the ratio of CoQ9/CoQ10 varies depending on the experimental conditions, the cells were titrated with substrate and inhibitors, leading to the conclusion that the intracellular isopentenyl-PP pool is a regulator of this ratio. Our present findings indicate that oxidosqualenes may be useful for stimulating both the synthesis and level of CoQ both in vitro and in vivo.",

Fasting affected acylcarnitine levels in all tissues. These changes varied substantially between the different tissue compartments. No significant correlations were found between plasma acylcarnitine species and their tissue counterparts in both mouse strains, with the exception of plasma C4OH-carnitine in BALB mice. We suggest that this lack of correlation is due to differences in acylcarnitine turnover rates between plasma and tissue compartments and the fact that the plasma acylcarnitine profile is a composition of acylcarnitines derived from different compartments. Therefore, plasma acylcarnitine levels do not reflect tissue levels and should be interpreted with caution. A focus on tissue acylcarnitine levels is warranted in metabolic studies.",

     "abstract": "Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a major structural protein in caveolae in the plasma membranes of many cell types, particularly endothelial cells and adipocytes. Loss of Cav-1 function has been implicated in multiple diseases affecting the cardiopulmonary and central nervous systems, as well as in specific aspects of sterol and lipid metabolism in the liver and intestine. Lungs contain an exceptionally high level of Cav-1. Parameters of cholesterol metabolism in the lung were measured, initially in Cav-1-deficient mice (Cav-1\u2212/\u2212), and subsequently in Cav-1\u2212/\u2212 mice that also lacked the lysosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann\u2013Pick C1 (Npc1) (Cav-1\u2212/\u2212:Npc1\u2212/\u2212). In 50-day-old Cav-1\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a low- or high-cholesterol chow diet, the total cholesterol concentration (mg/g) in the lungs was marginally lower than in the Cav-1+/+ controls, but due to an expansion in their lung mass exceeding 30%, whole-lung cholesterol content (mg/organ) was moderately elevated. Lung mass (g) in the Cav-1\u2212/\u2212:Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice (0.356\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.022) markedly exceeded that in their Cav-1+/+:Npc1+/+ controls (0.137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009), as well as in their Cav-1\u2212/\u2212:Npc1+/+ (0.191\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.013) and Cav-1+/+:Npc1\u2212/\u2212 (0.213\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.022) littermates.

The exacerbation of the Npc1 lung phenotype and increase in the UC level in the Cav-1\u2212/\u2212:Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice imply a regulatory role of Cav-1 in pulmonary cholesterol metabolism when lysosomal sterol transport is disrupted.",

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids constitute bioactive molecules with functional implications in homeostasis and pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the role of sphingolipids as possible disease biomarkers in chronic liver disease remains largely unexplored. In the present study we used mass spectrometry and spectrofluorometry methods in order to quantify various sphingolipid metabolites and also assess the activity of an important corresponding regulating enzyme in the serum of 72 healthy volunteers as compared to 69 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 69 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Our results reveal a significant upregulation of acid sphingomyelinase in the serum of patients with chronic liver disease as compared to healthy individuals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Especially in chronic hepatitis C infection acid sphingomyelinase activity correlated significantly with markers of hepatic injury (r\u00a0=\u00a00.312, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and showed a high discriminative power. Accumulation of various (dihydro-) ceramide species was identified in the serum of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and correlated significantly to cholesterol (r\u00a0=\u00a00.448, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but showed a significant accumulation in patients with normal cholesterol values as well (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Sphingosine, a further bioactive metabolite, was also upregulated in chronic liver disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, no significant correlation to markers of hepatic injury was identified. Conclusion: Chronic hepatitis C virus infection and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease induce a significant upregulation of serum acid sphingomyelinase which appears as a novel biomarker in chronic hepatopathies.

     "abstract": "Liver X receptors (LXR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b2) are key transcription factors in cholesterol metabolism that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux and bile acid metabolism/excretion in the liver and numerous organs. In macrophages, LXR signaling modulates cholesterol handling and the inflammatory response, pathways involved in atherosclerosis. Since regulatory pathways of LXR transcription control are well understood, in the present study we aimed at identifying post-transcriptional regulators of LXR activity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are such post-transcriptional regulators of genes that in the canonical pathway mediate mRNA inactivation. In silico analysis identified miR-206 as a putative regulator of LXR\u03b1 but not LXR\u03b2. Indeed, as recently shown, we found that miR-206 represses LXR\u03b1 activity and expression of LXR\u03b1 and its target genes in hepatic cells. Interestingly, miR-206 regulates LXR\u03b1 differently in macrophages. Stably overexpressing miR-206 in THP-1 human macrophages revealed an up-regulation and miR-206 knockdown led to a down-regulation of LXR\u03b1 and its target genes. In support of these results, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from miR-206 KO mice also exhibited lower expression of LXR\u03b1 target genes. The physiological relevance of these findings was proven by gain- and loss-of-function of miR-206; overexpression of miR-206 enhanced cholesterol efflux in human macrophages and knocking out miR-206 decreased cholesterol efflux from MPMs. Moreover, we show that miR-206 expression in macrophages is repressed by LXR\u03b1 activation, while oxidized LDL and inflammatory stimuli profoundly induced miR-206 expression. We therefore propose a feed-back loop between miR-206 and LXR\u03b1 that might be part of an LXR auto-regulatory mechanism to fine tune LXR activity.",

Results showed that the plasma S1P levels were significantly higher in women than those in men within the age of 16\u201355\u00a0years old and higher in pre-menopausal than post-menopausal women. The experiment in C57 BL/6 mice confirmed the gender difference of plasma S1P level. In vitro study demonstrated that after the stimulation of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), S1P levels both in EA.hy926 cells and the culture media were increased about 9 and 3 times, respectively; the mRNA expression, the protein level and the activity of sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1, not SphK2, were markedly increased; the mRNA and protein expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) C1, G2 and S1P transporter spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) were significantly elevated; furthermore, the mRNA and protein expressions of S1P receptors (S1PRs) 1\u20132 were increased in a time-dependent manner. This study suggests that E2 markedly improves S1P synthesis by activating SphK1 and induces S1P export via activating ABCC1, G2 and Spns2 from endothelium system, which may consequently lead to the gender difference of plasma S1P in adult human and mouse. The results of this study suggest that E2 may exert its vasculoprotective function by activation of the SphK1\u2013S1P\u2013S1PR signaling axis.",

Knockdown of CAV1 expression using siRNAs significantly reduced ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux without detectable effect on ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Disruption of the putative CAV1 binding site in ABCG1, through replacement of tyrosine residues at positions 487 and 489 or at positions 494 and 495 with alanine (Y487AY489A and Y494AY495A), impaired the interaction of ABCG1 with CAV1 and significantly decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. The substitution of Tyr494 and Tyr495 with Phe or Trp that resulted in an intact CAV1 binding site had no effect. Furthermore, Y494AY495A affected trafficking of ABCG1 to the cell surface. The mutant protein is mainly located intracellularly.

Both CK activity and CK\u03b1 expression in MG-63 cells were significantly higher than those in HOB cells. Silencing of CK\u03b1 in MG-63 cells had no significant effect on PC concentration but decreased the amount of phosphocholine by approximately 80%.

     "abstract": "Inflammatory responses to infection and injury must be restrained and negatively regulated to minimize damage to host tissue. One proposed mechanism involves enzymatic inactivation of the pro-inflammatory mediator leukotriene B4, but it is difficult to dissect the roles of various metabolic enzymes and pathways. A primary candidate for a regulatory pathway is omega oxidation of leukotriene B4 in neutrophils, presumptively by CYP4F3A in humans and CYP4F18 in mice. This pathway generates \u03c9, \u03c9-1, and \u03c9-2 hydroxylated products of leukotriene B4, depending on species. We created mouse models targeting exons 8 and 9 of the Cyp4f18 allele that allows both conventional and conditional knockouts of Cyp4f18. Neutrophils from wild-type mice convert leukotriene B4 to 19-hydroxy leukotriene B4, and to a lesser extent 18-hydroxy leukotriene B4, whereas these products were not detected in neutrophils from conventional Cyp4f18 knockouts. A mouse model of renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury was used to investigate the consequences of loss of CYP4F18 in vivo. There were no significant changes in infiltration of neutrophils and other leukocytes into kidney tissue as determined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, or renal injury as assessed by histological scoring and measurement of blood urea nitrogen. It is concluded that CYP4F18 is necessary for omega oxidation of leukotriene B4 in neutrophils, and is not compensated by other CYP enzymes, but loss of this metabolic pathway is not sufficient to impact inflammation and injury following renal ischemia\u2013reperfusion in mice.",

These metabolic changes result in the development of both a spontaneous cardiac hypertrophy and increased phosphorylated S6 kinase (S6K), a substrate of the mechanistic target of rapamycin, mTOR. Doppler echocardiography revealed evidence of significant diastolic dysfunction, indicated by a reduced E/A ratio and increased mean performance index, although the deceleration time and the expression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and phospholamban showed no difference between genotypes. To determine the role of mTOR in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, we treated Acsl1H\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice with rapamycin. Six to eight week old Acsl1H\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice and their littermate controls were given i.p. tamoxifen to eliminate cardiac Acsl1, then concomitantly treated for 10\u00a0weeks with i.p. rapamycin or vehicle alone. Rapamycin completely blocked the enhanced ventricular S6K phosphorylation and cardiac hypertrophy and attenuated the expression of hypertrophy-associated fetal genes, including \u03b1-skeletal actin and B-type natriuretic peptide. mTOR activation of the related Acsl3 gene, usually associated with pathologic hypertrophy, was also attenuated in the Acsl1H\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 hearts, indicating that alternative pathways of fatty acid activation did not compensate for the loss of Acsl1. Compared to controls, Acsl1H\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 hearts exhibited an 8-fold higher uptake of 2-deoxy[1-14C]glucose and a 35% lower uptake of the fatty acid analog 2-bromo[1-14C]palmitate.

This study sought to identify a mechanism for lysophosphatidylcholine-mediated inhibition of hepatic oxidative function. Results showed that in vitro incubation of isolated mitochondria with 40\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine caused cyclosporine A-resistant swelling in a concentration-dependent manner. However, when mitochondria were challenged with 220\u00a0\u03bcM CaCl2, cyclosporine A protected against permeability transition induced by 40\u00a0\u03bcM, but not 80\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine. Incubation with 40\u2013120\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine also increased mitochondrial permeability to 75\u00a0\u03bcM CaCl2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, despite incubation with 80\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine, the mitochondrial membrane potential was steady in the presence of succinate, and oxidation rates and respiratory control indices were similar to controls in the presence of succinate, glutamate/malate, and palmitoyl-carnitine. However, mitochondrial oxidation rates were inhibited by 30\u201350% at 100\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine. Finally, while 40\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine has no effect on fatty acid oxidation and mitochondria remained impermeable in intact hepatocytes, 100\u00a0\u03bcM lysophosphatidylcholine inhibited fatty acid stimulated oxidation and caused intracellular mitochondrial permeability.

     "abstract": "Alterations in muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics during cancer cachexia were previously suggested; however, the underlying mechanisms are not known. So, the goal of this study was to evaluate mitochondrial phospholipid remodeling in cancer-related muscle wasting and its repercussions to respiratory chain activity and fiber susceptibility to apoptosis.An animal model of urothelial carcinoma induced by exposition to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) and characterized by significant body weight loss due to skeletal muscle mass decrease was used. Morphological evidences of muscle atrophy were associated to decreased respiratory chain activity and increased expression of mitochondrial UCP3, which altogether highlight the lower ability of wasted muscle to produce ATP. Lipidomic analysis of isolated mitochondria revealed a significant decrease of phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in BBN mitochondria, counteracted by increased phosphatidylcholine levels. Besides the impact on membrane fluidity, this phospholipid remodeling seems to justify, at least in part, the lower oxidative phosphorylation activity observed in mitochondria from wasted muscle and their increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Curiously, no evidences of lipid peroxidation were observed but proteins from BBN mitochondria, particularly the metabolic ones, seem more prone to carbonylation with the consequent implications in mitochondria functionality.Overall, data suggest that bladder cancer negatively impacts skeletal muscle activity specifically by affecting mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics and its interaction with proteins, ultimately leading to the dysfunction of this organelle. The regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways might be seen as potential therapeutic targets for the management of cancer-related muscle wasting.",

Since cardiac and vascular dysfunction have been closely related in numerous studies we investigated endothelium-dependent and -independent vessel function of ATGL knockout mice. Aortic relaxation studies and Langendorff perfusion experiments of isolated hearts showed that ATGL knockout mice suffer from pronounced micro- and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction. Experiments with agonists directly targeting vascular smooth muscle cells revealed the functional integrity of the smooth muscle cell layer. Loss of vascular reactivity was restored ~\u00a050% upon treatment of ATGL knockout mice with the PPAR\u03b1 agonist Wy14,643, indicating that this phenomenon is partly a consequence of impaired cardiac contractility. Biochemical analysis revealed that aortic endothelial NO synthase expression and activity were significantly reduced in ATGL deficiency. Enzyme activity was fully restored in ATGL mice treated with the PPAR\u03b1 agonist. Biochemical analysis of perivascular adipose tissue demonstrated that ATGL knockout mice suffer from perivascular inflammatory oxidative stress which occurs independent of cardiac dysfunction and might contribute to vascular defects.

     "abstract": "Diseases including cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and immune dysfunction and neurodegeneration become more prevalent as we age, and combined with the increase in average human lifespan, place an ever increasing burden on the health care system. In this chapter we focus on finding ways of modulating sphingolipids to prevent the development of age-associated diseases or delay their onset, both of which could improve health in elderly, fragile people. Reducing the incidence of or delaying the onset of diseases of aging has blossomed in the past decade because of advances in understanding signal transduction pathways and cellular processes, especially in model organisms, that are largely conserved in most eukaryotes and that can be modulated to reduce signs of aging and increase health span. In model organisms such interventions must also increase lifespan to be considered significant, but this is not a requirement for use in humans. The most encouraging interventions in model organisms involve lowering the concentration of one or more sphingolipids so as to reduce the activity of key signaling pathways, one of the most promising being the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) protein kinase pathway. Other potential ways in which modulating sphingolipids may contribute to improving the health profile of the elderly is by reducing oxidative stresses, inflammatory responses and growth factor signaling. Lastly, perhaps the most interesting way to modulate sphingolipids and promote longevity is by lowering the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase, the first enzyme in the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. Available data in yeasts and rodents are encouraging and as we gain insights into molecular mechanisms the strategies for improving human health by modulating sphingolipids will become more apparent.

     "abstract": "Ceramidase (CDase) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the N-acyl linkage between the sphingoid base and fatty acid of ceramide. These enzymes are classified into three distinct groups, acid (Asah1), neutral (Asah2), and alkaline (Asah3) CDases, based on their primary structure and optimum pH. Acid CDase catabolizes ceramide in lysosomes and is found only in vertebrates. In contrast, the distribution of neutral and alkaline CDases is broad, with both being found in species ranging from lower eukaryotes to mammals; however, only neutral CDase is found in prokaryotes, including some pathogenic bacteria. Neutral CDase is thought to have gained a specific domain (mucin box) in the N-terminal region after the vertebrate split, allowing the enzyme to be stably expressed at the plasma membrane as a type II membrane protein. The X-ray crystal structure of neutral CDase was recently solved, uncovering a unique structure and reaction mechanism for the enzyme. Neutral CDase contains a zinc ion in the active site that functions as a catalytic center, and the hydrolysis of the N-acyl linkage in ceramide proceeds through a mechanism that is similar to that described for zinc-dependent carboxypeptidase. This review describes the structure, reaction mechanism, and biological functions of neutral CDase in association with the molecular evolution, topology, and mechanical conformation.

     "abstract": "Sphingomyelin constitutes membrane microdomains such as lipid raft, caveolae, and clathrin-coated pits and implicates in the regulation of trans-membrane signaling. On the other hand, sphingomyelin emerges as an important molecule to generate bioactive sphingolipids through ceramide. Sphingomyelin synthase is an enzyme that generates sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylcholine and ceramide. Although ceramide has a well-known role as a lipid mediator to regulate cell death and survival, the only known biological role of sphingomyelin regulated by sphingomyelin synthases was limited to being a source of bioactive lipids. Here, we describe the basic characters of sphingomyelin synthases and discuss additional roles for sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin synthase in biological functions including cell migration, apoptosis, autophagy, and cell survival/proliferation as well as in human disorders such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. It is expected that a better understanding of the role of sphingomyelin regulated by sphingomyelin synthase will shed light on new mechanisms in cell biology, physiology and pathology. In the future, novel therapeutic procedures for currently incurable diseases could be developed through modifying the function of not only sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin and ceramide, but also of their regulatory enzymes.

     "abstract": "Life creates many varieties of lipids. The choline-containing sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) exists ubiquitously or widely in vertebrates and lower animals, but is absent or rare in bacteria, fungi, protists, and plants. In the biosynthesis of SM, ceramide, which is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, is transported to the Golgi region by the ceramide transport protein CERT, probably in a non-vesicular manner, and is then converted to SM by SM synthase, which catalyzes the reaction of phosphocholine transfer from phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) to ceramide. Recent advances in genomics and lipidomics indicate that the phylogenetic occurrence of CERT and its orthologs is nearly parallel to that of SM. Based on the chemistry of lipids together with evolutionary aspects of SM and CERT, several concepts are here proposed. SM may serve as a chemically inert and robust, but non-covalently interactive lipid class at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The functional domains and peptidic motifs of CERT are separated by exon units, suggesting an exon-shuffling mechanism for the generation of an ancestral CERT gene. CERT may have co-evolved with SM to bypass a competing metabolic reaction at the bifurcated point in the anabolism of ceramide. Human CERT is identical to the splicing variant of human Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP) annotated as an extracellular non-canonical serine/threonine protein kinase. The relationship between CERT and GPBP has also been discussed from an evolutionary aspect. Moreover, using an analogy of \u201ccompatible (or osmoprotective) solutes\u201d that can accumulate to very high concentrations in the cytosol without denaturing proteins, choline phospholipids such as PtdCho and SM may act as compatible phospholipids in biomembranes.

     "abstract": "Sphingomyelin (SM) is one of the major lipids in the mammalian plasma membrane. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that SM plays at least two functional roles in the cell, as a reservoir of lipid second messengers and as a platform for signaling molecules. To understand the molecular organization and dynamics of the SM-rich membrane domains, new approaches have been developed utilizing newly characterized specific SM-binding probes and state-of-the-art microscopy techniques. The toxic protein from the sea anemone, equinatoxin II, has been characterized as a specific probe for SM. The cytolytic protein from the earthworm, lysenin, has also been used as a SM-specific probe for the analysis of the heterogeneity of SM-rich membrane domains. Recently, using a non-toxic form of lysenin, we showed the spatial and temporal localization of SM in the plasma membrane by confocal and super-resolution microscopy. New microscopy techniques have also been introduced by other groups to help visualize membrane lipid domains. Here we review the most recent studies on imaging the SM-rich domains in biological membranes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled New Frontiers in Sphingolipid Biology.",

     "abstract": "A key but poorly studied domain of sphingolipid functions encompasses endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular trafficking, and cell movement. Recently, the ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM) family of proteins emerged as novel potent targets regulated by sphingolipids. ERMs are structural proteins linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, also forming a scaffold for signaling pathways that are used for cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and cell division. Opposing functions of the bioactive sphingolipid ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), contribute to ERM regulation. S1P robustly activates whereas ceramide potently deactivates ERM via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, respectively. This recent dimension of cytoskeletal regulation by sphingolipids opens up new avenues to target cell dynamics, and provides further understanding of some of the unexplained biological effects mediated by sphingolipids. In addition, these studies are providing novel inroads into defining basic mechanisms of regulation and action of bioactive sphingolipids. This review describes the current understanding of sphingolipid regulation of the cytoskeleton, it also describes the biologies in which ERM proteins have been involved, and finally how these two large fields have started to converge.

     "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system (CNS) through demyelination and neurodegeneration. Until recently, major therapeutic treatments have relied on agents requiring injection delivery. In September 2010, fingolimod/FTY720 (Gilenya, Novartis) was approved as the first oral treatment for relapsing forms of MS. Fingolimod causes down-modulation of S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes which prevents the invasion of autoaggressive T cells into the CNS. In astrocytes, down-modulation of S1P1 by the drug reduces astrogliosis, a hallmark of MS, thereby allowing restoration of productive astrocyte communication with other neural cells and the blood brain barrier. Animal data further suggest that the drug directly supports the recovery of nerve conduction and remyelination. In human MS, such mechanisms may explain the significant decrease in the number of inflammatory markers on brain magnetic resonance imaging in recent clinical trials, and the reduction of brain atrophy by the drug. Fingolimod binds to 4 of the 5 known S1P receptor subtypes, and significant efforts were made over the past 5\u00a0years to develop next generation S1P receptor modulators and determine the minimal receptor selectivity needed for maximal therapeutic efficacy in MS patients. Other approaches considered were competitive antagonists of the S1P1 receptor, inhibitors of the S1P lyase to prevent S1P degradation, and anti-S1P antibodies. Below we discuss the current status of the field, and the functional properties of the most advanced compounds.

     "abstract": "The sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a well-known lipid mediator. As a lipid mediator, S1P must be present in extracellular space and bind to its cell surface receptors (S1P1\u20135). However, most S1P, synthesized intracellularly, is metabolized without being released into extracellular space, in other words, without functioning as a lipid mediator in the vast majority of cells except those supplying plasma and lymph S1P such as blood cells and endothelial cells. Instead, intracellular S1P plays an important role as an intermediate of the sole sphingolipid-to-glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway. The degradation of S1P by S1P lyase is the first irreversible reaction (committed step) of this pathway. This metabolic pathway is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human, indicating its much older origin than the function of S1P as a lipid mediator, which is found to be present only in vertebrates and chordates. The sphingolipid-to-glycerophospholipid metabolism takes place ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, and its defect causes an aberration of several tissue functions as well as abnormal lipid metabolism. Although this metabolic pathway has been known for over four decades, only recently the precise reactions and enzymes involved in this pathway have been revealed. This review will focus on the recent advances in our understanding of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway via S1P and its physiological and pathological roles.

Sphingolipids play essential roles in numerous cellular functions, including controlling cell inflammation, proliferation, death, migration, senescence, tumor metastasis and/or autophagy. Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism has been also implicated in many human cancers. Macroautophagy (referred to here as autophagy) \u201cself-eating\u201d is characterized by nonselective sequestering of cytosolic materials by an isolation membrane, which can be either protective or lethal for cells. Ceramide (Cer), a central molecule of sphingolipid metabolism, has been extensively implicated in the control of autophagy. The increasing evidence suggests that Cer is highly involved in mediating two opposing autophagic pathways, which regulate either cell survival or death, which is referred here as autophagy paradox. However, the underlying mechanism that regulates the autophagy paradox remains unclear. Therefore, this review focuses on recent studies with regard to the regulation of autophagy by Cer and elucidates the roles and mechanisms of action of Cer in controlling autophagy paradox.

Sphingolipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, where they are known to form several types of microdomains, and are potent regulators for a variety of physiological processes.

Aberrant sphingolipid profiles have been observed in human AD brains, and accumulated evidence has demonstrated that changes in membrane properties induced by defective sphingolipid metabolism impair generation and degradation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), a pathogenic agent of AD.

The MAM consist of a region of the ER that is enriched in several lipid biosynthetic enzyme activities and becomes reversibly tethered to mitochondria. Specific proteins are localized, sometimes transiently, in the MAM. Several of these proteins have been implicated in tethering the MAM to mitochondria. In mammalian cells, formation of these contact sites between MAM and mitochondria appears to be required for key cellular events including the transport of calcium from the ER to mitochondria, the import of phosphatidylserine into mitochondria from the ER for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine, the formation of autophagosomes, regulation of the morphology, dynamics and functions of mitochondria, and cell survival. This review focuses on the functions proposed for MAM in mediating these events in mammalian cells. In light of the apparent involvement of MAM in multiple fundamental cellular processes, recent studies indicate that impaired contact between MAM and mitochondria might underlie the pathology of several human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, MAM has been implicated in modulating glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, as well as in some viral infections.",

Blood flukes use the host plasma lipoproteins as nutrient sources through the lipoprotein receptor-like systems. Its Asian-specific species, Schistosoma (S) japonicum, which has been endemic in East Asia, takes up cholesteryl ester (CE) from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) for the embryonation of their eggs to miracidia, a critical step of the hepatic pathogenesis of this parasite, but poorly from HDL of CETP-deficiency. CD36-related protein (CD36RP) was cloned from the adults and the eggs of S. japonicum, with 1880-bp encoding 506 amino-acid residues exhibiting the CD36 domains and two transmembrane regions. Its extracellular domain selectively bound human HDL but neither LDL nor CETP-deficiency HDL, and the antibody against the extracellular domain suppressed the selective HDL-CE uptake and embryonation of the eggs. When infected with S. japonicum, wild-type mice developed less hepatic granulomatosis than CETP-transgenic mice by the ectopic egg embryonation. CD36RP is thus a candidate receptor of S. japonicum to facilitate uptake of HDL-CE necessary for egg embryonation. Abnormal HDL caused by CETP-deficiency retards this process and thereby protects the patients from development of hepatic lesions. S. japonicum infection is a potential screening factor for high prevalence of CETP deficiency in East Asia.",

     "abstract": "Normal cellular function is dependent on a number of highly regulated homeostatic mechanisms, which act in concert to maintain conditions suitable for life. During periods of nutritional deficit, cells initiate a number of recycling programs which break down complex intracellular structures, thus allowing them to utilize the energy stored within. These recycling systems, broadly named \u201cautophagy\u201d, enable the cell to maintain the flow of nutritional substrates until they can be replenished from external sources. Recent research has shown that a number of regulatory components of the autophagy program are controlled by lysine acetylation. Lysine acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that can alter the activity of enzymes in a number of cellular compartments. Strikingly, the main substrate for this modification is a product of cellular energy metabolism: acetyl-CoA. This suggests a direct and intricate link between fuel metabolites and the systems which regulate nutritional homeostasis. In this review, we examine how acetylation regulates the systems that control cellular autophagy, and how global protein acetylation status may act as a trigger for recycling of cellular components in a nutrient-dependent fashion. In particular, we focus on how acetylation may control the degradation and turnover of mitochondria, the major source of fuel-derived acetyl-CoA.",

The mutant had healthy thylakoid membranes and normal pigment content. The membrane lipid composition of the mutant was similar with that of WT except lack of monoglucosyldiacylglycerol and a slight increase in the level of phosphatidylglycerol at both normal and low temperatures. However, the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol was reduced in the mutant compared with WT. Although the growth of the mutant was indistinguishable with that of WT at normal growth temperature, it was markedly retarded at low temperature compared with that of WT. Our data indicated the possibility that cyanobacterial monogalactosyldiacylglycerol-synthesis pathway might be required for the adequate unsaturation level of fatty acids in galactolipids and affect the low-temperature sensitivity.",

     "abstract": "Dermal fibroblasts are important regulators of inflammatory and immune responses in the skin. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the interaction between two key players in inflammation, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in normal human fibroblasts in the context of inflammation, fibrosis and cell migration. We demonstrate that TLR2 ligation strongly enhances the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. S1P significantly induces pro-inflammatory cytokines time- and concentration-dependently via S1P receptor (S1PR)2 and S1PR3. The TLR2/1 agonist Pam3CSK4 and S1P (>\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM) or TGF-\u03b2 markedly upregulate IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Pam3CSK4 and S1P alone promote myofibroblast differentiation as assessed by significant increases of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and collagen I expression. Importantly, costimulation with S1P (>\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM) induces differentiation into myofibroblasts. In contrast, Pam3CSK4 and low S1P concentrations (<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM) accelerate cell migration. These results suggest that TLR2/1 signaling and S1P cooperate in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and myofibroblast differentiation and promote cell migration of skin fibroblasts in a S1P-concentration dependent manner. Our findings provide significant insights into how infectious stimuli or danger signals and sphingolipids contribute to dermal inflammation which may be relevant for skin tissue repair after injury or disease.",

We here describe the characterization of a lysophospholipid acyltransferase in the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Expression of this gene, C.a.

In vitro, lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity in these strains showed acyl-CoA substrate specificity, as measured by apparent Vmax/Km ratios, to be linolenoyl-CoA\u00a0>\u00a0oleoyl-CoA\u00a0>\u00a0linoleoyl-CoA\u00a0>\u00a0stearoyl-CoA.

Lysophospholipid acyltransferase activity with amine containing lysophospholipids was dramatically reduced while lysophosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidic acid esterification was not significantly lowered. However, C.a. LPT1 over-expression yielded an increased amount of lysophosphatidic acyltransferase activity, suggesting a role in de novo phospholipid synthesis. LPT1 deletion strains showed slightly slowed growth in standard liquid media but no phenotype in media containing three antifungals that target sterols. To assess the role of C.a. Lpt1 in phospholipid remodeling, an in vivo, pulse\u2013chase assay utilizing polysorbitan palmitate and mass spectrometry was developed. Cellular phospholipid composition became atypical with the provision of palmitate and gradually returned to the typical distribution when palmitate was removed. Deletion of C.a.

     "abstract": "Fructose ingestion is associated with the production of hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia. For fructose to attain these effects in rats, simultaneous induction of fatty acid synthesis and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is required. We aimed to determine the mechanism involved in the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation by fructose and whether this effect occurs also in human liver cells. Female rats were supplemented or not with liquid fructose (10% w/v) for 7 or 14\u00a0days; rat (FaO) and human (HepG2) hepatoma cells, and human hepatocytes were incubated with fructose 25\u00a0mM for 24\u00a0h. The expression and activity of the enzymes and transcription factors relating to fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation were evaluated. Fructose inhibited the activity of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation only in livers of 14-day fructose-supplemented rats, as well as the expression and activity of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1). Similar results were observed in FaO and HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes. PPAR\u03b1 downregulation was not due to an osmotic effect or to an increase in protein-phosphatase 2A activity caused by fructose. Rather, it was related to increased content in liver of inactive and acetylated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1\u03b1, due to a reduction in sirtuin 1 expression and activity. In conclusion, fructose inhibits liver fatty acid oxidation by reducing PPAR\u03b1 expression and activity, both in rat and human liver cells, by a mechanism involving sirtuin 1 down-regulation.",

Considering the structural similarity to \u03b1-LA, we conjectured that lactoferrin (LF) could also bind OA to obtain a complex with anti-tumor activity. In this study, LF\u2013OA was prepared and its activity and structural changes were compared with \u03b1-LA\u2013OA. The anti-tumor activity was evaluated by methylene blue assay, while the apoptosis mechanism was analyzed using flow cytometry and Western blot. Structural changes of LF\u2013OA were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The interactions of OA with LF and \u03b1-LA were evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). LF\u2013OA was obtained by heat-treatment at pH\u00a08.0 with LD50 of 4.88, 4.95 and 4.62\u00a0\u03bcM for HepG2, HT29, and MCF-7 cells, respectively, all of which were 10 times higher than those of \u03b1-LA\u2013OA. Similar to HAMLET, LF\u2013OA induced apoptosis in tumor cells through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-mediated pathways. Exposure of tryptophan residues and the hydrophobic regions as well as the loss of tertiary structure were observed in LF\u2013OA. Besides these similarities, LF showed different secondary structure changes when compared with \u03b1-LA, with a decrease of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-turn and an increase of \u03b2-sheet and random coil. ITC results showed that there was a higher binding number of OA to LF than to \u03b1-LA, while both of the proteins interacted with OA through van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds.

This process is accompanied by changes in gene expression that mediate the redirection leading to neurite formation and function. Acceleration of membrane phospholipids synthesis is associated with neurite elongation, and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) is the major membrane phospholipid in mammalian cells. The transcription of two genes in particular encoding key enzymes in the CDP\u2013choline pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis are stimulated; the Chka gene for choline kinase (CK) alpha isoform and the Pcyt1a gene for the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) alpha isoform. We report that the stimulation of CK\u03b1 expression during retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation depends on a promoter region that contains two CCAAT/Enhancer-binding Protein-\u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) sites. We demonstrate that during neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells, RA induces Chka expression by a mechanism that involves ERK1/2 activation which triggers C/EBP\u03b2 expression. Elevated levels of C/EBP\u03b2 bind to the Chka proximal promoter (Box1) inducing CK\u03b1 expression. In addition we identified a downstream sequence named Box2 which together with Box1 is required for the promoter to reach the full induction. This is the first elucidation of the mechanism by which the expression of Chka is coordinately regulated during neuronal differentiation.",

In response to activation of the cAMP signaling cascade nuclear DGK activity is rapidly increased, facilitating PA-mediated, SF1-dependent transcription of genes required for cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) biosynthesis. Based on our previous work identifying DGK\u03b8 as the enzyme that produces the agonist for SF1, we generated a tetracycline-inducible H295R stable cell line to express a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against DGK\u03b8 and characterized the effect of silencing DGK\u03b8 on adrenocortical gene expression. Genome-wide DNA microarray analysis revealed that silencing DGK\u03b8 expression alters the expression of multiple genes, including steroidogenic genes, nuclear receptors and genes involved in sphingolipid, phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism. Interestingly, the expression of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) was also suppressed. Consistent with the suppression of SREBPs, we observed a down-regulation of multiple SREBP target genes, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA red) and CYP51, concomitant with a decrease in cellular cholesterol. DGK\u03b8 knockdown cells exhibited a reduced capacity to metabolize PA, with a down-regulation of lipin and phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms. In contrast, suppression of DGK\u03b8 increased the expression of several genes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, including acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and sphingosine kinases (SPHK). In summary, these data demonstrate that DGK\u03b8 plays an important role in steroid hormone production in human adrenocortical cells.",

     "abstract": "Peroxisomes play a major role in human cellular lipid metabolism, including fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Free fatty acids (FFAs) can enter peroxisomes through passive diffusion or by means of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including HsABCD1 (ALDP, adrenoleukodystrophy protein), HsABCD2 (ALDRP) and HsABCD3 (PMP70). The physiological functions of the different peroxisomal half-ABCD transporters have not been fully determined yet, but there are clear indications that both HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 are required for the breakdown of fatty acids in peroxisomes. Here we report that the phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2\u0394 yeast mutant, i.e. impaired oxidation of oleic acid, cannot only be partially rescued by HsABCD1, HsABCD2, but also by HsABCD3, which indicates that each peroxisomal half-transporter can function as homodimer. Fatty acid oxidation measurements using various fatty acids revealed that although the substrate specificities of HsABCD1, HsABCD2 and HsABCD3 are overlapping, they have distinctive preferences. Indeed, most hydrophobic C24:0 and C26:0 fatty acids are preferentially transported by HsABCD1, C22:0 and C22:6 by HsABCD2 and most hydrophilic substrates like long-chain unsaturated-, long branched-chain- and long-chain dicarboxylic fatty acids by HsABCD3. All these fatty acids are most likely transported as CoA esters. We postulate a role for human ABCD3 in the oxidation of dicarboxylic acids and a role in buffering fatty acids that are overflowing from the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation system.",

N-BPs inactivate osteoclasts via inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), thereby preventing the prenylation of essential small GTPases. Not all patients respond to N-BP therapy to the same extent, and some patients, for example with tumour-associated bone disease or Paget's disease, appear to develop resistance to N-BPs. The extent to which upregulation of FPPS might contribute to these phenomena is not clear. Using quantitative PCR and western blot analysis we show that levels of FPPS mRNA and protein can be upregulated in HeLa cells by culturing in lipoprotein deficient serum (LDS) or by over-expression of SREBP-1a. Upregulated, endogenous FPPS was predominantly localised to the cytosol and did not co-localise with peroxisomal or mitochondrial markers. Upregulation of endogenous FPPS conferred resistance to the inhibitory effect of low concentrations of ZOL on the prenylation of the small GTPase Rap1a. These observations suggest that an increase in the expression of endogenous FPPS could confer at least partial resistance to the pharmacological effect of N-BP drugs such as ZOL in vivo.",

Molecular dynamics was applied to investigate PC binding modes within the catalytic cavity of PPL and human pancreatic lipase (HPL), aiming to explain the difference of specificity of these enzymes towards phospholipids. Results showed that with HPL, the oxyanion hole was not able to accommodate the PC molecule, suggesting that no activity could be obtained. With PPL, the formation of a large pocket involving Val260 allowed the PC molecule to come near the catalytic residues, suggesting that it could be hydrolyzed. One more interesting finding is that human pancreatic lipase related protein 2 could hydrolyze phospholipids through its PLA1 and PLA2 activities. Overall, our study shed the light on new structural features of the phospholipase activity of pancreatic lipase family members.",

     "abstract": "Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is required for efficient mobilization of triglyceride (TG) stores in adipose tissue and non-adipose tissues. Therefore, ATGL strongly determines the availability of fatty acids for metabolic reactions. ATGL activity is regulated by a complex network of lipolytic and anti-lipolytic hormones. These signals control enzyme expression and the interaction of ATGL with the regulatory proteins CGI-58 and G0S2. Up to date, it was unknown whether ATGL activity is also controlled by lipid intermediates generated during lipolysis. Here we show that ATGL activity is inhibited by long-chain acyl-CoAs in a non-competitive manner, similar as previously shown for hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), the rate-limiting enzyme for diglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue. ATGL activity is only marginally inhibited by medium-chain acyl-CoAs, diglycerides, monoglycerides, and free fatty acids. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that acyl-CoAs do not disrupt the protein\u2013protein interaction of ATGL and its co-activator CGI-58. Furthermore, inhibition of ATGL is independent of the presence of CGI-58 and occurs directly at the N-terminal patatin-like phospholipase domain of the enzyme. In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibition of the major lipolytic enzymes ATGL and HSL by long-chain acyl-CoAs could represent an effective feedback mechanism controlling lipolysis and protecting cells from lipotoxic concentrations of fatty acids and fatty acid-derived lipid metabolites.",

Peroxisomal disorders caused by defects in peroxisome biogenesis or peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation manifest as severe neural disorders of the central nervous system. Abnormal peroxisomal metabolism is thought to be responsible for the clinical symptoms of these diseases, but their molecular pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. We performed lipidomic analysis to identify aberrant metabolites in fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome (ZS), acyl-CoA oxidase1 (AOx) deficiency, D-bifunctional protein (D-BP) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), as well as in peroxisome-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants. In cells deficient in peroxisomal biogenesis, plasmenylethanolamine was remarkably reduced and phosphatidylethanolamine was increased. Marked accumulation of very-long-chain saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine was observed in all mutant cells. Very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (VLC-PUFA) levels were significantly elevated, whilst phospholipids containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6n-3) were reduced in fibroblasts from patients with ZS, AOx deficiency, and D-BP deficiency, but not in fibroblasts from an X-ALD patient. Because patients with AOx deficiency suffer from more severe symptoms than those with X-ALD, accumulation of VLC-PUFA and/or reduction of DHA may be associated with the severity of peroxisomal diseases.",

     "abstract": "Apolipoprotein-derived peptides are promising candidates for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. The beneficial effects of these peptides are based on multiple mechanisms; prominent among them being high-affinity binding to pro-inflammatory oxidized phospholipids (Ox-PLs) and facilitating their sequestration/metabolism/clearance in the body. This indicates that peptides which can bind exclusively to Ox-PLs without recognizing normal, non-oxidized phospholipids (non-Ox-PLs) will be more potent anti-inflammatory agent than that of the peptides that bind to both Ox-PLs and non-Ox-PLs. In order to develop such Ox-PL-specific peptides, the knowledge about the properties (molecular determinants) of peptides that govern their Ox-PL preference is a must. In this study we have synthesized eleven peptides corresponding to the conserved regions of human apolipoprotein E and compared their biochemical properties, lipid-binding specificities, and anti-inflammatory properties. Our results show that these peptides exhibit considerably different specificities towards non-Ox-PL and different species of Ox-PLs. Some of these peptides bind exclusively to the Ox-PLs and inhibit the pro-inflammatory function of Ox-PLs in human blood. Biochemical characterization revealed that the peptides possess substantially different properties. Our results suggest that physicochemical properties of peptides play an important role in their lipid-binding specificity.",

     "abstract": "Coenzyme Q biosynthesis in yeast requires a multi-subunit Coq polypeptide complex. Deletion of any one of the COQ genes leads to respiratory deficiency and decreased levels of the Coq4, Coq6, Coq7, and Coq9 polypeptides, suggesting that their association in a high molecular mass complex is required for stability. Over-expression of the putative Coq8 kinase in certain coq null mutants restores steady-state levels of the sensitive Coq polypeptides and promotes the synthesis of late-stage Q-intermediates. Here we show that over-expression of Coq8 in yeast coq null mutants profoundly affects the association of several of the Coq polypeptides in high molecular mass complexes, as assayed by separation of digitonin extracts of mitochondria by two-dimensional blue-native/SDS PAGE. The Coq4 polypeptide persists at high molecular mass with over-expression of Coq8 in coq3, coq5, coq6, coq7, coq9, and coq10 mutants, indicating that Coq4 is a central organizer of the Coq complex. Supplementation with exogenous Q6 increased the steady-state levels of Coq4, Coq7, and Coq9, and several other mitochondrial polypeptides in select coq null mutants, and also promoted the formation of late-stage Q-intermediates. Q supplementation may stabilize this complex by interacting with one or more of the Coq polypeptides. The stabilizing effects of exogenously added Q6 or over-expression of Coq8 depend on Coq1 and Coq2 production of a polyisoprenyl intermediate. Based on the observed interdependence of the Coq polypeptides, the effect of exogenous Q6, and the requirement for an endogenously produced polyisoprenyl intermediate, we propose a new model for the Q-biosynthetic complex, termed the CoQ-synthome.",

     "abstract": "The major function of the skin is to form a barrier between the internal milieu and the hostile external environment. A permeability barrier that prevents the loss of water and electrolytes is essential for life on land. The permeability barrier is mediated primarily by lipid enriched lamellar membranes that are localized to the extracellular spaces of the stratum corneum. These lipid enriched membranes have a unique structure and contain approximately 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids with very little phospholipid. Lamellar bodies, which are formed during the differentiation of keratinocytes, play a key role in delivering the lipids from the stratum granulosum cells into the extracellular spaces of the stratum corneum. Lamellar bodies contain predominantly glucosylceramides, phospholipids, and cholesterol and following the exocytosis of lamellar lipids into the extracellular space of the stratum corneum these precursor lipids are converted by beta glucocerebrosidase and phospholipases into the ceramides and fatty acids, which comprise the lamellar membranes. The lipids required for lamellar body formation are derived from de novo synthesis by keratinocytes and from extra-cutaneous sources. The lipid synthetic pathways and the regulation of these pathways are described in this review. In addition, the pathways for the uptake of extra-cutaneous lipids into keratinocytes are discussed.

     "abstract": "Deficiency of sterol C4 methyl oxidase, encoded by the SC4MOL gene, has recently been described in four patients from three different families. All of the patients presented with microcephaly, congenital cataracts, and growth delay in infancy. The first patient has suffered since the age of six years from severe, diffuse, psoriasiform dermatitis, sparing only her palms. She is now 20\u00a0years old. The second patient is a 5\u00a0year old girl who has just started to develop dry skin and hair changes. The third and fourth patients are a pair of affected siblings with a severe skin condition since infancy. Quantitative sterol analysis of plasma and skin scales from all four patients showed marked elevation of 4\u03b1-methyl- and 4, 4\u2032-dimethylsterols, consistent with a deficiency in the first step of sterol C4 demethylation in cholesterol biosynthesis. Mutations in the SC4MOL have been identified in all of the patients. SC4MOL deficiency is the first autosomal recessive disorder identified in the sterol demethylation complex. Cellular studies with patient-derived fibroblasts have shown a higher mitotic rate than control cells in cholesterol-depleted medium, with increased de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and accumulation of methylsterols. Immunologic analyses of granulocytes and B cells from patients and obligate carriers in the patients' families indicated dysregulation of immune-related receptors. Inhibition of sterol C4 methyl oxidase in human transformed lymphoblasts induced activation of the cell cycle. Additional studies also demonstrated diminished EGFR signaling and disrupted vesicular trafficking in cells from the affected patients. These findings suggest that methylsterols play an important role in epidermal biology by their influence on cell proliferation, intracellular signaling, vesicular trafficking and immune response. SC4MOL is situated within the psoriasis susceptibility locus PSORS9, and may be a genetic risk factor for common skin conditions.

It exhibits intense phenotypic variation and primarily affects the skin, bones and eyes. The ichthyosis following Blaschko's lines, chondrodysplasia punctata and cataracts are the typical clinical findings. The cardinal biochemical features are an increase in 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol (8DHC), which suggest a deficiency in 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid-\u03948,\u03947-isomerase, also called emopamil binding protein (EBP). The EBP gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.22\u2013p11.23) and encodes a 230 amino acid protein with dual function. Explaining the clinical phenotype in CDPX2 implies an understanding of both the genetics and biochemical features of this disease. CDPX2 displays an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance, which is responsible for the distribution of lesions in some tissues. The clinical phenotype in CDPX2 results directly from impairment in cholesterol biosynthesis, and indirectly from abnormalities in the hedgehog signaling protein pathways.

     "abstract": "CHILD syndrome (Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosiform erythroderma and Limb Defects) is a rare X-linked dominant ichthyotic disorder. CHILD syndrome results from loss of function mutations in the NSDHL gene, which leads to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates in affected tissues. The CHILD syndrome skin is characterized by plaques topped by waxy scales and a variety of developmental defects in extracutaneous tissues, particularly limb hypoplasia or aplasia. Strikingly, these alterations are commonly segregated to either the right or left side of the body midline with little to no manifestations on the ipsilateral side. By understanding the underlying disease mechanism of CHILD syndrome, a pathogenesis-based therapy has been developed that successfully reverses the CHILD syndrome skin phenotype and has potential applications to the treatment of other ichthyoses.

     "abstract": "Fatty acids in the epidermis can be incorporated into complex lipids or exist in a free form, and they are crucial to proper functions of the epidermis and its appendages, such as sebaceous glands. Epidermal fatty acids can be synthesized de novo by keratinocytes or taken up from extracutaneous sources in a process that likely involves protein transporters. Several proteins that are expressed in the epidermis have been proposed to facilitate the uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in mammalian cells, including fatty acid translocase/CD36, fatty acid binding protein, and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)/very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms by which these candidate transporters facilitate the uptake of fatty acids. We will then discuss the clinical implications of defects in these transporters and relevant animal models, including the FATP4 animal models and ichthyosis prematurity syndrome, a congenital ichthyosis caused by FATP4 deficiency.

     "abstract": "The acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) is a 10\u00a0kDa intracellular protein expressed in all eukaryotic species and mammalian tissues investigated. It binds acyl-CoA esters with high specificity and affinity and is thought to act as an intracellular transporter of acyl-CoA esters between different enzymatic systems; however, the precise function remains unknown. ACBP is expressed at relatively high levels in the epidermis, particularly in the suprabasal layers, which are highly active in lipid synthesis. Targeted disruption of the ACBP gene in mice leads to a pronounced skin and fur phenotype, which includes tousled and greasy fur, development of alopecia and scaling of the skin with age. Furthermore, epidermal barrier function is compromised causing a ~\u00a050% increase in transepidermal water loss relative to that of wild type mice. Lipidomic analyses indicate that this is due to significantly reduced levels of non-esterified very long chain fatty acids in the stratum corneum of ACBP\u2212/\u2212 mice. Here we review the current knowledge of ACBP with special focus on the function of ACBP in the epidermal barrier.

     "abstract": "Normal fatty aldehyde and alcohol metabolism is essential for epidermal differentiation and function. Long-chain aldehydes are produced by catabolism of several lipids including fatty alcohols, sphingolipids, ether glycerolipids, isoprenoid alcohols and certain aliphatic lipids that undergo \u03b1- or \u03c9-oxidation. The fatty aldehyde generated by these pathways is chiefly metabolized to fatty acid by fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH, alternately known as ALDH3A2), which also functions to oxidize fatty alcohols as a component of the fatty alcohol:NAD oxidoreductase (FAO) enzyme complex. Genetic deficiency of FALDH/FAO in patients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2013Larsson syndrome (SLS) results in accumulation of fatty aldehydes, fatty alcohols and related lipids (ether glycerolipids, wax esters) in cultured keratinocytes. These biochemical changes are associated with abnormalities in formation of lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum and impaired delivery of their precursor membranes to the stratum corneum (SC). The defective extracellular SC membranes are responsible for a leaky epidermal water barrier and ichthyosis. Although lamellar bodies appear to be the pathogenic target for abnormal fatty aldehyde/alcohol metabolism in SLS, the precise biochemical mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Nevertheless, studies in SLS highlight the critical importance of FALDH and normal fatty aldehyde/alcohol metabolism for epidermal function.

     "abstract": "Lipoxygenases (LOX) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of a variety of highly active oxylipins which act as signaling molecules involved in the regulation of many biological processes. LOX are also able to oxidize complex lipids and modify membrane structures leading to structural changes that play a role in the maturation and terminal differentiation of various cell types. The mammalian skin represents a tissue with highly abundant and diverse LOX metabolism. Individual LOX isozymes are thought to play a role in the modulation of epithelial proliferation and/or differentiation as well as in inflammation, wound healing, inflammatory skin diseases and cancer. Emerging evidence indicates a structural function of a particular LOX pathway in the maintenance of skin permeability barrier. Loss-of-function mutations in the LOX genes ALOX12B and ALOXE3 have been found to represent the second most common cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis and targeted disruption of the corresponding LOX genes in mice resulted in neonatal death due to a severely impaired permeability barrier function. Recent data indicate that LOX action in barrier function can be traced back to the oxygenation of linoleate-containing ceramides which constitutes an important step in the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope.

     "abstract": "This review covers the background to discovery of the two key lipoxygenases (LOX) involved in epidermal barrier function, 12R-LOX and eLOX3, and our current views on their functioning. In the outer epidermis, their consecutive actions oxidize linoleic acid esterified in \u03c9-hydroxy-ceramide to a hepoxilin-related derivative. The relevant background to hepoxilin and trioxilin biochemistry is briefly reviewed. We outline the evidence that linoleate in the ceramide is the natural substrate of the two LOX enzymes and our proposal for its importance in construction of the epidermal water barrier. Our hypothesis is that the oxidation promotes hydrolysis of the oxidized linoleate moiety from the ceramide. The resulting free \u03c9-hydroxyl of the \u03c9-hydroxyceramide is covalently bound to proteins on the surface of the corneocytes to form the corneocyte lipid envelope, a key barrier component. Understanding the role of the LOX enzymes and their hepoxilin products should provide rational approaches to ameliorative therapy for a number of the congenital ichthyoses involving compromised barrier function.

     "abstract": "Survival in a terrestrial, dry environment necessitates a permeability barrier for regulated permeation of water and electrolytes in the cornified layer of the skin (the stratum corneum) to minimize desiccation of the body. This barrier is formed during cornification and involves a cross-linking of corneocyte proteins as well as an extensive remodeling of lipids. The cleavage of precursor lipids from lamellar bodies by various hydrolytic enzymes generates ceramides, cholesterol, and non-esterified fatty acids for the extracellular lipid lamellae in the stratum corneum. However, the important role of epidermal triacylglycerol (TAG) metabolism during formation of a functional permeability barrier in the skin was only recently discovered. Humans with mutations in the ABHD5/CGI-58 (\u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain containing protein 5, also known as comparative gene identification-58, CGI-58) gene suffer from a defect in TAG catabolism that causes neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. In addition, mice with deficiencies in genes involved in TAG catabolism (Abhd5/Cgi-58 knock-out mice) or TAG synthesis (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, Dgat2 knock-out mice) also develop severe skin permeability barrier dysfunctions and die soon after birth due to increased dehydration. As a result of these defects in epidermal TAG metabolism, humans and mice lack \u03c9-(O)-acylceramides, which leads to malformation of the cornified lipid envelope of the skin. In healthy skin, this epidermal structure provides an interface for the linkage of lamellar membranes with corneocyte proteins to maintain permeability barrier homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of biochemical mechanisms involved in epidermal neutral lipid metabolism and the generation of a functional skin permeability barrier.

     "abstract": "The mammalian epidermis provides both an interface and a protective barrier between the organism and its environment. Lipid, processed into water-impermeable bilayers between the outermost layers of the epidermal cells, forms the major barrier that prevents water from exiting the organism, and also prevents toxins and infectious agents from entering. The secretory phospholipase 2 (sPLA2) enzymes control important processes in skin and other organs, including inflammation and differentiation. sPLA2 activity contributes to epidermal barrier formation and homeostasis by generating free fatty acids, which are required both for formation of lamellar membranes and also for acidification of the stratum corneum (SC). sPLA2 is especially important in controlling SC acidification and establishment of an optimum epidermal barrier during the first postnatal week. Several sPLA2 isoforms are present in the epidermis. We find that two of these isoforms, sPLA2 IIA and sPLA2 IIF, localize to the upper stratum granulosum and increase in response to experimental barrier perturbation. sPLA2F\u2212/\u2212 mice also demonstrate a more neutral SC pH than do their normal littermates, and their initial recovery from barrier perturbation is delayed. These findings confirm that sPLA2 enzymes perform important roles in epidermal development, and suggest that the sPLA2IIF isoform may be central to SC acidification and barrier function.

     "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters form a large superfamily of transporters that bind and hydrolyze ATP to transport various molecules across limiting membranes or into vesicles. The ABCA subfamily members are thought to transport lipid materials. ABCA12 is a keratinocyte transmembrane lipid transporter protein associated with the transport of lipids via lamellar granules. ABCA12 is considered to transport lipids including ceramides to form extracellular lipid layers in the stratum corneum of the epidermis, which is essential for skin barrier function. ABCA12 mutations are known to underlie the three major types of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses: harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. ABCA12 mutations result in defective lipid transport via lamellar granules in the keratinocytes, leading to ichthyosis phenotypes from malformation of the stratum corneum lipid barrier. Studies on ABCA12-deficient bioengineered models have revealed that lipid transport by ABCA12 is required for keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal morphogenesis. Defective lipid transport due to loss of ABCA12 function leads to the accumulation of intracellular lipids, including glucosylceramides and gangliosides, in the epidermal keratinocytes. The accumulation of gangliosides seems to result in the apoptosis of Abca12\u2212/\u2212 keratinocytes. It was reported that AKT activation occurs in Abca12\u2212/\u2212 granular-layer keratinocytes, which suggests that AKT activation serves to prevent the cell death of Abca12\u2212/\u2212 keratinocytes.

     "abstract": "The epidermal permeability barrier of mammalian skin is localized in the stratum corneum. Corneocytes are embedded in an extracellular, highly ordered lipid matrix of hydrophobic lipids consisting of about 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol and 15% long and very long chain fatty acids. The most important lipids for the epidermal barrier are ceramides. The scaffold of the lipid matrix is built of acylceramides, containing \u03c9-hydroxylated very long chain fatty acids, acylated at the \u03c9-position with linoleic acid. After glucosylation of the acylceramides at Golgi membranes and secretion, the linoleic acid residues are replaced by glutamate residues originating from proteins exposed on the surface of corneocytes. Removal of their glucosyl residues generates a hydrophobic surface on the corneocytes used as a template for the formation of extracellular lipid layers of the water permeability barrier. Misregulation or defects in the formation of extracellular ceramide structures disturb barrier function. Important anabolic steps are the synthesis of ultra long chain fatty acids, their \u03c9-hydroxylation, and formation of ultra long chain ceramides and glucosylceramides. The main probarrier precursor lipids, glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins, are packed in lamellar bodies together with hydrolytic enzymes such as glucosylceramide-\u03b2-glucosidase and acid sphingomyelinase and secreted into the intercelullar space between the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum. Inherited defects in the extracellular hydrolytic processing of the probarrier acylglucosylceramides impair epidermal barrier formation and cause fatal diseases: such as prosaposin deficiency resulting in lack of lysosomal lipid binding and transfer proteins, or the symptomatic clinical picture of the \u201ccollodion baby\u201d in the absence of glucocerebrosidase.

     "abstract": "Ceramide, the backbone structure of all sphingolipids, as well as a minor component of cellular membranes, has a unique role in the skin, by forming the epidermal permeability barrier at the extracellular domains of the outermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, which is required for terrestrial mammalian survival. In contrast to the role of ceramide in forming the permeability barrier, the signaling roles of ceramide and its metabolites have not yet been recognized. Ceramide and/or its metabolites regulate proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in epidermal keratinocytes. Recent studies have further demonstrated that a ceramide metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate, modulates innate immune function. Ceramide has already been applied to therapeutic approaches for treatment of eczema associated with attenuated epidermal permeability barrier function. Pharmacological modulation of ceramide and its metabolites' signaling can also be applied to cutaneous disease prevention and therapy. The author here describes the signaling roles of ceramide and its metabolites in mammalian cells and tissues, including the epidermis.

     "abstract": "Epidermal lipid synthesis and metabolism are regulated by nuclear hormone receptors (NHR) and in turn epidermal lipid metabolites can serve as ligands to NHR. NHR form a large superfamily of receptors modulating gene transcription through DNA binding. A subgroup of these receptors is ligand-activated and heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR). Several isotypes of these receptors exist, all of which are expressed in skin. In keratinocytes, ligand activation of PPARs and LXRs stimulates differentiation, induces lipid accumulation, and accelerates epidermal barrier regeneration. In the cutaneous immune system, ligand activation of all three receptors, PPAR, LXR, and PXR, has inhibitory properties, partially mediated by downregulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. PXR also has antifibrotic effects in the skin correlating with TGF-beta inhibition. In summary, ligands of PPAR, LXR and PXR exert beneficial therapeutic effects in skin disease and represent promising targets for future therapeutic approaches in dermatology.

Interestingly, cell organelles which play an important role in this process have so far been insufficiently investigated. For this reason, we started a systematic approach to isolate and characterize organelles from P. pastoris. In this study, we present a procedure to isolate microsomal membranes at high purity. These samples represent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fractions which were subjected to molecular analysis of lipids and proteins. Organelle lipidomics included a detailed analysis of glycerophospholipids, fatty acids, sterols and sphingolipids. The microsomal proteome analyzed by mass spectrometry identified typical proteins of the ER known from other cell types, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but also a number of unassigned gene products. The lipidome and proteome analysis of P. pastoris microsomes are prerequisite for a better understanding of functions of this organelle and for modifying this compartment for biotechnological applications.",

     "abstract": "The acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) has been implicated in carcinogenesis and neuronal development. Acyl-CoA synthetases are essential enzymes of lipid metabolism, and ACSL4 is distinguished by its preference for arachidonic acid. Two human ACSL4 isoforms arising from differential splicing were analyzed by ectopic expression in COS cells. We found that the ACSL4_v1 variant localized to the inner side of the plasma membrane including microvilli, and was also present in the cytosol. ACSL4_v2 contains an additional N-terminal hydrophobic region; this isoform was located at the endoplasmic reticulum and on lipid droplets. A third isoform was designed de novo by appending a mitochondrial targeting signal. All three ACSL4 variants showed the same specific enzyme activity. Overexpression of the isoenzymes increased cellular uptake of arachidonate to the same degree, indicating that the metabolic trapping of fatty acids is independent of the subcellular localization. Remarkably, phospholipid metabolism was changed by ACSL4 expression. Labeling with arachidonate showed that the amount of newly synthesized phosphatidylinositol was increased by all three ACSL4 isoenzymes but not by ACSL1. This was dependent on the expression level and the localization of the ACSL4 isoform. We conclude that in our model system exogenous fatty acids are channeled preferentially towards phosphatidylinositol by ACSL4 overexpression. The differential localization of the endogenous isoenzymes may provide compartment specific precursors of this anionic phospholipid important for many signaling processes.",

The chain-length specificity of a particular plant CPT is in most cases unknown despite the composition of the accumulated isoprenoids in the tissue of interest being well established. In this report AtCPT6, one of the nine Arabidopsis thaliana CPTs, is shown to catalyze the synthesis of a family of very short-chain polyisoprenoid alcohols of six, seven, and eight isoprenoid units, those of seven units dominating. The product specificity of AtCPT6 was established in vivo following its expression in the heterologous system of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was confirmed by the absence of specific products in AtCPT6 T-DNA insertion mutants and their overaccumulation in AtCPT6-overexpressing plants. These observations are additionally validated in silico using an AtCPT6 model obtained by homology modeling. AtCPT6 only partially complements the function of the yeast homologue of CPT-Rer2 since it restores the growth but not protein glycosylation in rer2\u0394 yeast. This is the first in planta characterization of specific products of a plant CPT producing polyisoprenoids. Their distribution suggests that a joint activity of several CPTs is required to produce the complex mixture of polyisoprenoid alcohols found in Arabidopsis roots.",

     "abstract": "Fetal serum cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations differ between preterm and term born neonates. An imbalance of the flow of cholesterol from the sites of synthesis or efflux from cells of peripheral organs to the liver, the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), is linked to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preterm delivery is a risk factor for the development of CVD. Thus, we hypothesized that RCT is affected by a diminished cholesterol acceptor capacity in preterm as compared to term fetuses. Cholesterol efflux assays were performed in RAW264.7, HepG2, and HUVEC cell lines. In the presence and absence of ABC transporter overexpression by TO-901317, umbilical cord sera of preterm and term born neonates (n\u00a0=\u00a028 in both groups) were added. Lipid components including high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein E were measured and related to fractional cholesterol efflux values. We found overall, fractional cholesterol efflux to remain constant between the study groups, and over gestational ages at delivery, respectively. However, correlation analysis revealed cholesterol efflux values to be predominantly related to HDL concentration at term, while in preterm neonates, cholesterol efflux was mainly associated with LDL. In conclusion cholesterol acceptor capacity during fetal development is kept in a steady state with different mechanisms and lipid fractions involved at distinct stages during the second half of fetal development. However, RCT mechanisms in preterm neonates seem not to be involved in the development of CVD later in life suggesting rather changes in the lipoprotein pattern causative.",

     "abstract": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids resulting from a \u03b2-oxidation defect. Oxidative stress and inflammation are also key components of the pathogenesis. X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, which encodes for a peroxisomal half ABC transporter predicted to participate in the entry of VLCFA-CoA into the peroxisome, the unique site of their \u03b2-oxidation. Two homologous peroxisomal ABC transporters, ABCD2 and ABCD3 have been proven to compensate for ABCD1 deficiency when overexpressed. Pharmacological induction of these target genes could therefore represent an alternative therapy for X-ALD patients. Since LXR activation was shown to repress ABCD2 expression, we investigated the effects of LXR antagonists in different cell lines. Cells were treated with GSK(17) (a LXR antagonist recently discovered from the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection), 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol (22S-HC, another LXR antagonist) and 22R-HC (an endogenous LXR agonist). We observed up-regulation of ABCD2, ABCD3 and CTNNB1 (the gene encoding for \u03b2-catenin, which was recently demonstrated to induce ABCD2 expression) in human HepG2 hepatoma cells and in X-ALD skin fibroblasts treated with LXR antagonists. Interestingly, induction in X-ALD fibroblasts was concomitant with a decrease in oxidative stress. Rats treated with 22S-HC showed hepatic induction of the 3 genes of interest. In human, we show by multiple tissue expression array that expression of ABCD2 appears to be inversely correlated with NR1H3 (LXR\u03b1) expression. Altogether, antagonists of LXR that are currently developed in the context of dyslipidemia may find another indication with X-ALD.",

     "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) accompanies obesity and insulin resistance. Recent meta-analysis suggested omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA to decrease liver fat in NAFLD patients. Anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and insulin-sensitizing effects of DHA/EPA depend on their lipid form, with marine phospholipids showing better efficacy than fish oils. We characterized the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of DHA/EPA phospholipids, alone or combined with an antidiabetic drug, on hepatosteatosis. C57BL/6N mice were fed for 7\u00a0weeks an obesogenic high-fat diet (cHF) or cHF-based interventions: (i) cHF supplemented with phosphatidylcholine-rich concentrate from herring (replacing 10% of dietary lipids; PC), (ii) cHF containing rosiglitazone (10\u00a0mg/kg diet; R), or (iii) PC\u00a0+\u00a0R. Metabolic analyses, hepatic gene expression and lipidome profiling were performed. Results showed that PC and PC\u00a0+\u00a0R prevented cHF-induced weight gain and glucose intolerance, while all interventions reduced abdominal fat and plasma triacylglycerols. PC and PC\u00a0+\u00a0R also lowered hepatic and plasma cholesterol and reduced hepatosteatosis. Microarray analysis revealed integrated down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways by PC, while R-induced lipogenesis was fully counteracted in PC\u00a0+\u00a0R. Gene expression changes in PC and PC\u00a0+\u00a0R were associated with preferential enrichment of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions by DHA/EPA. The complex down-regulation of hepatic lipogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes and the antisteatotic effects were unique to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids, since they were absent in mice fed soy-derived phosphatidylcholine. Thus, inhibition of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis associated with potent antisteatotic effects in the liver in response to DHA/EPA-containing phospholipids support their use in NAFLD prevention and treatment.",

     "abstract": "Exosomes are nanovesicles that have emerged as a new intercellular communication system between an intracellular compartment of a donor cell towards the periphery or an internal compartment of a recipient cell. The bioactivity of exosomes resides not only in their protein and RNA contents but also in their lipidic molecules. Exosomes display original lipids organized in a bilayer membrane and along with the lipid carriers such as fatty acid binding proteins that they contain, exosomes transport bioactive lipids. Exosomes can vectorize lipids such as eicosanoids, fatty acids, and cholesterol, and their lipid composition can be modified by in-vitro manipulation. They also contain lipid related enzymes so that they can constitute an autonomous unit of production of various bioactive lipids. Exosomes can circulate between proximal or distal cells and their fate can be regulated in part by lipidic molecules. Compared to their parental cells, exosomes are enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and their accumulation in cells might modulate recipient cell homeostasis. Exosome release from cells appears to be a general biological process. They have been reported in all biological fluids from which they can be recovered and can be monitors of specific pathophysiological situations. Thus, the lipid content of circulating exosomes could be useful biomarkers of lipid related diseases. Since the first lipid analysis of exosomes ten years ago detailed knowledge of exosomal lipids has accumulated. The role of lipids in exosome fate and bioactivity and how they constitute an additional lipid transport system are considered in this review.",

These proteins are thought to participate in most aspects of the biology of lipids, regulating its availability for specific metabolic pathways, targeting and vectorial trafficking of lipids to specific subcellular compartments. The present study is based on the ability of IFABP to interact with phospholipid membranes, and we characterized its immersion into the bilayer's hydrophobic central region occupied by the acyl-chains. We constructed a series of Trp-mutants of IFABP to selectively probe the interaction of different regions of the protein, particularly the elements forming the portal domain that is proposed to regulate the exit and entry of ligands to/from the binding cavity. We employed several fluorescent techniques based on selective quenching induced by soluble or membrane confined agents. The results indicate that the portal region of IFABP penetrates deeply into the phospholipid bilayer, especially when CL-containing vesicles are employed. The orientation of the protein and the degree of penetration were highly dependent on the lipid composition, the superficial net charge and the ionic strength of the medium. These results may be relevant to understand the mechanism of ligand transfer and the specificity responsible for the unique functions of each member of the FABP family.",

In this study, we have tested the resilience properties of a plant and a mammalian LOX, by using high pressure fluorescence measurements at different temperatures. The binding of LOXs to the lipid bilayer has been characterized using both large and giant unilamellar vesicles and electron transfer particles (inner mitochondrial membranes) as model membranes. The data indicate that the degree of LOXs' flexibility is strictly dependent on the two distinct N- and C-terminal domains that characterize the 3D structure of these enzymes. Furthermore, they demonstrate that increasing the rigidity of protein scaffolding by the presence of an active site ligand impairs the membrane binding ability of LOXs.

Pharmacological and molecular biology approaches revealed that the S1P-dependent increase of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression was mediated via activation of S1P receptor 2 (S1P2). Further, inhibition of Gi and p42/p44 MAPK signaling, both downstream of S1P2, abolished the S1P-induced COX-2 expression. In addition, S1P/S1P2-dependent upregulation of COX-2 led to significantly elevated PGE2 levels, which were further potentiated in the presence of Ang II and IL-1\u03b2. A functional consequence downstream of S1P/S1P2 signaling is mesangial cell migration that is stimulated by S1P. Interestingly, inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib and SC-236 completely abolished the migratory response.Overall, our results demonstrate that extracellular S1P induces COX-2 expression via activation of S1P2 and subsequent Gi and p42/p44 MAPK-dependent signaling in renal mesangial cells leading to enhanced PGE2 formation and cell migration that essentially requires COX-2. Thus, targeting S1P/S1P2 signaling pathways might be a novel strategy to treat renal inflammatory diseases.",

     "abstract": "Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) induce hepatocyte cell death, wherein oxidative stress is mechanistically involved. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a master transcriptional regulator of cellular antioxidant defense enzymes. Therefore, Nrf2 activation is regarded as an effective strategy against oxidative stress-triggered cellular damage. In this study, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), a widely used Nrf2 activator, was initially employed to investigate the potential protective role of Nrf2 activation in SFA-induced hepatoxicity. As expected, SFA-induced hepatocyte cell death was prevented by tBHQ in both AML-12 mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 human hepatoma cells. However, the protective effect of tBHQ is Nrf2-independent, because the siRNA-mediated Nrf2 silencing did not abrogate tBHQ-conferred protection. Alternatively, our results revealed that autophagy activation was critically involved in the protective effect of tBHQ on lipotoxicity. tBHQ induced autophagy activation and autophagy inhibitors abolished tBHQ's protection. The induction of autophagy by tBHQ exposure was demonstrated by the increased accumulation of LC3 puncta, LC3-II conversion, and autophagic flux (LC3-II conversion in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors). Subsequent mechanistic investigation discovered that tBHQ exposure activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and siRNA-mediated AMPK gene silencing abolished tBHQ-induced autophagy activation, indicating that AMPK is critically involved in tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction. Furthermore, our study provided evidence that tBHQ-induced autophagy activation is required for its Nrf2-activating property. Collectively, our data uncover a novel mechanism for tBHQ in protecting hepatocytes against SFA-induced lipotoxicity. tBHQ-triggered autophagy induction contributes not only to its hepatoprotective effect, but also to its Nrf2-activating property.",

In addition, LC/MS lipidomics analysis of the CMOI\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 embryos showed reduced levels of four phosphatidylcholine and three phosphatidylethanolamine acyl chain species, and of eight triacylglycerol species with four or more unsaturations and fifty-two or more carbons in the acyl chains. Cholesteryl esters of arachidonate, palmitate, linoleate, and DHA were also reduced to less than 30% of control. Analysis of the fatty acyl CoA species ruled out a loss in fatty acyl CoA synthetase capability. Comparison of acyl species suggested significantly decreased 18:2, 18:3, 20:1, 20:4, or 22:6 acyl chains within the above lipids in CMOI-null embryos. Furthermore, LCAT, ACAT1 and DGAT2 mRNA levels were also downregulated in CMOI\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 embryos.

Here we show the role of ACSL isozymes in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-induced arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Treatment of 3Y1 cells with triacsin C, an ACSL inhibitor, markedly enhanced the IL-1\u03b2-induced prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Acsl4 expression increased significantly the release of AA metabolites, including PGE2, PGD2, and PGF2\u03b1, compared with replicated control cells, whereas knockdown of Acsl1 expression reduced the IL-1\u03b2-induced release of AA metabolites. Experiments with double knockdown of Acsl4 and intracellular phospholipase A2 (PLA2) isozymes revealed that cytosolic PLA2\u03b1, but not calcium-independent PLA2s, is involved in the Acsl4 knockdown-enhanced PG biosynthesis. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of cellular phospholipids bearing AA showed that the levels of some, if not all, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol species in Acsl4 knockdown cells were decreased after IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, while those in control cells were not so obviously decreased. In Acsl1 knockdown cells, the levels of some AA-bearing PC species were reduced even in the unstimulated condition. Collectively, these results suggest that Acsl isozymes play distinct roles in the control of AA remodeling in rat fibroblasts: Acsl4 acts as the first step of enzyme for AA remodeling following IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, and Acsl1 is involved in the maintenance of some AA-containing PC species.",

Loss of function of either protein results in the progressive accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in every tissue leading to cell death and organ damage. Most literature on NPC disease focuses on neurological and liver manifestations. Pulmonary dysfunction is less well described. The present studies investigated how Npc1 deficiency impacts the absolute weight, lipid composition and histology of the lungs of Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Npc1nih) at different stages of the disease, and also quantitated changes in the rates of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in the lung over this same time span (8 to 70\u00a0days of age). Similar measurements were made in Npc2\u2212/\u2212 mice at 70\u00a0days. All mice were of the BALB/c strain and were fed a basal rodent chow diet. Well before weaning, the lung weight, cholesterol and phospholipid (PL) content, and cholesterol synthesis rate were all elevated in the Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice and remained so at 70\u00a0days of age. In contrast, lung triacylglycerol content was reduced while there was no change in lung fatty acid synthesis. Despite the elevated PL content, the composition of PL in the lungs of the Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice was unchanged. H&E staining revealed an age-related increase in the presence of lipid-laden macrophages in the alveoli of the lungs of the Npc1\u2212/\u2212 mice starting as early as 28\u00a0days. Similar metabolic and histologic changes were evident in the lungs of the Npc2\u2212/\u2212 mice.

     "abstract": "A hallmark of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the accumulation of lipids. We developed a mathematical model of the hepatic lipid dynamics to simulate the fate of fatty acids in hepatocytes. Our model involves fatty acid uptake, lipid oxidation, and lipid export. It takes into account that storage of triacylglycerol within hepatocytes leads to cell enlargement reducing the sinusoids radius and impairing hepatic microcirculation. Thus oxygen supply is reduced, which impairs lipid oxidation. The analysis of our model revealed a bistable behavior (two stable steady states) of the system, in agreement with histological observations showing distinct areas of lipid accumulation in lobules. The first (healthy) state is characterized by intact lipid oxidation and a low amount of stored lipids. The second state in our model may correspond to the steatotic cell; it is marked by a high amount of stored lipids and a reduced lipid oxidation caused by impaired oxygen supply. Our model stresses the role of insufficient oxygen supply for the development of steatosis. We discuss implications of our results in regard to the experimental design aimed at exploring lipid metabolism reactions under steatotic conditions. Moreover, the model helps to understand the reversibility of lipid accumulation and predicts the reversible switch to show hysteresis. The system can switch from the steatotic state back to the healthy state by reduction of fatty acid uptake below the threshold at which steatosis started. The reversibility corresponds to the observation that caloric restriction can reduce the lipid content in the liver.",

By applying two injections of 10\u00a0\u03bcl, the developed method detects all major SC lipids using RPLC and negative ion mode APCI-MS for detection of FFAs, and NPLC using positive ion mode APCI-MS to analyze CERs and cholesterol. Validation showed this lipid platform to be robust, reproducible, sensitive, and fast. The method was successfully applied on ex vivo human SC, human SC obtained from tape strips and human skin substitutes (porcine SC and human skin equivalents). In conjunction with FFA profiles, clear differences in CER profiles were observed between these different SC sources. Human skin equivalents more closely mimic the lipid composition of human stratum corneum than porcine skin does, although noticeable differences are still present. These differences gave biologically relevant information on some of the enzymes that are probably involved in SC lipid processing. For future research, this provides an excellent method for (semi-)quantitative, \u2018high-throughput\u2019 profiling of SC lipids and can be used to advance the understanding of skin lipids and the biological processes involved.",

Human apoA-I has two tertiary structural domains and the C-terminal domain (approximately amino acids 190\u2013243) plays a key role in lipid binding. Although the high lipid affinity region of the C-terminal domain of apoA-I (residues 223\u2013243) is essential for the HDL formation, the function of low lipid affinity region (residues 191\u2013220) remains unclear. To evaluate the role of residues 191\u2013220, we analyzed the structure, lipid binding properties, and HDL formation activity of \u0394191\u2013220 apoA-I, in comparison to wild-type and \u0394223\u2013243 apoA-I. Although deletion of residues 191\u2013220 has a slight effect on the tertiary structure of apoA-I, the \u0394191\u2013220 variant showed intermediate behavior between wild-type and \u0394223\u2013243 regarding the formation of hydrophobic sites and lipid interaction through the C-terminal domain. Physicochemical analysis demonstrated that defective lipid binding of \u0394191\u2013220 apoA-I is due to the decreased ability to form \u03b1-helix structure which provides the energetic source for lipid binding. In addition, the ability to form HDL particles in vitro and induce cholesterol efflux from ABCA1-expressing cells of \u0394191\u2013220 apoA-I was also intermediate between wild-type and \u0394223\u2013243 apoA-I. These results suggest that despite possessing low lipid affinity, residues 191\u2013220 play a role in enhancing the ability of apoA-I to bind to and solubilize lipids by forming \u03b1-helix upon lipid interaction.

Here, we investigate signaling pathways triggered by TLR2, the involvement of co-receptors and lipid rafts in the mechanism of PPAR\u03b3 expression, lipid body formation and cytokine synthesis in macrophages during BCG infection. BCG induces NF-\u03baB activation and increased PPAR\u03b3 expression in a TLR2-dependent manner. Furthermore, BCG-triggered increase of lipid body biogenesis was inhibited by the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662, but not by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor JSH-23. In contrast, KC/CXCL1 production was largely dependent on NF-\u03baB but not on PPAR\u03b3. BCG infection induced increased expression of CD36 in macrophages in vitro. Moreover, CD36 co-immunoprecipitates with TLR2 in BCG-infected macrophages, suggesting its interaction with TLR2 in BCG signaling. Pretreatment with CD36 neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited PPAR\u03b3 expression, lipid body formation and PGE2 production induced by BCG. Involvement of CD36 in lipid body formation was further confirmed by decreased BCG-induced lipid body formation in CD36 deficient macrophages. Similarly, CD14 and CD11b/CD18 blockage also inhibited BCG-induced lipid body formation, whereas TNF-\u03b1 synthesis was not affected. Disruption of rafts recapitulates the latter result, inhibiting lipid body formation, but not TNF-\u03b1 synthesis in BCG-infected macrophages. In conclusion, our results suggest that CD36-TLR2 cooperation and signaling compartmentalization within rafts, divert host response signaling through PPAR\u03b3-dependent and NF-\u03baB-independent pathways, leading to increased macrophage lipid accumulation and down-modulation of macrophage response.",

We showed that genistein induced the expression of genes of fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle of Zucker fa/fa rats and in leptin receptor (ObR)-silenced C2C12 myotubes through AMPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, the genistein-mediated AMPK phosphorylation occurred via JAK2, which was possibly activated through a mechanism that involved cAMP. Additionally, the genistein-mediated induction of fatty acid oxidation genes involved PGC1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4. As a result, we observed that genistein increased fatty acid oxidation in both the control and silenced C2C12 myotubes, as well as a decrease in the RER in mice, suggesting that genistein can be used in strategies to decrease lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium is known to harm rat testis by causing the dose-dependent apoptotic or necrotic death of seminiferous epithelium cells. Here we investigated how this affects the lipids with long-chain (C18\u2013C22) and very-long-chain (C24\u2013C32) polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFA) typical of spermatogenic and Sertoli cells. A severe acute inflammatory reaction resulted from the massive necrotic death of these cells two days after a single high (4\u00a0mg/kg) dose of CdCl2. This led to the conversion of most testicular glycerophospholipids to diradylglycerols (DRG) and free fatty acids (FFA) and of most sphingomyelins to ceramides (Cer). By day 30 the testis weight had decreased three-fold. The DRG and FFA had been metabolized but, unexpectedly, ceramides persisted. Also slow to disappear were VLCPUFA-containing triacylglycerols from former germ cells and ether-linked triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (CE) from former Sertoli cells. Similar results were observed 30 and 45\u00a0days after administering repeated small non pro-inflammatory CdCl2 doses (1\u00a0mg/kg). At day 30 after both treatments, an amorphous material replaced the original seminiferous tubules and the interstitium was populated by macrophages. Species of CE and ether-linked triglycerides containing fatty acids other than VLCPUFA steadily accumulated in the irreversibly damaged testis, a manifestation of the activity of these cells. The long-term permanence of original VLCPUFA-containing neutral lipids, especially ceramides, indicates that these phagocytes were slow to clear out the acellular material contained in seminiferous tubules, pointing to a form of silent chronic inflammation as an additional outcome of the multifactorial commotion caused in the testis by experimentally administered cadmium.",

ABCA2 is the most abundant ABC transporter in human and rodent brain with highest expression in oligodendrocytes, although it is also expressed in neurons. Several groups have studied a possible connection between ABCA2 and Alzheimer's disease as well as early atherosclerosis. ABCA2 expression levels have been associated with changes in cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism. In this paper, we hypothesized that ABCA2 expression level may regulate esterification of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol by modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. ABCA2 overexpression in N2a neuroblastoma cells was associated with an altered bilayer distribution of the sphingolipid ceramide that inhibited acylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and cholesterol esterification. In contrast, depletion of endogenous ABCA2 in the rat schwannoma cell line D6P2T increased esterification of plasma membrane cholesterol following treatment with exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase. These findings suggest that control of ABCA2 expression level may be a key locus of regulation for esterification of plasma membrane-derived cholesterol through modulation of sphingolipid metabolism.",

However, a configuration with helix 5 of one monomer juxtaposed with helix 2 of the other (5/2 registry) would predominate in D-HDL generated by DM.

DHA is known to have poor affinity for cholesterol and it influences lipid rafts. Here, we investigated a mechanism underlying the anti-cancer effects of DHA using a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. We found that DHA decreased cell surface levels of lipid rafts via their internalization, which was partially reversed by cholesterol addition. With DHA treatment, caveolin-1, a marker for rafts, and EGFR were colocalized with LAMP-1, a lysosomal marker, in a cholesterol-dependent manner, indicating that DHA induces raft fusion with lysosomes. DHA not only displaced several raft-associated onco-proteins, including EGFR, Hsp90, Akt, and Src, from the rafts but also decreased total levels of those proteins via multiple pathways, including the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways, thereby decreasing their activities. Hsp90 overexpression maintained its client proteins, EGFR and Akt, and attenuated DHA-induced cell death. In addition, overexpression of Akt or constitutively active Akt attenuated DHA-induced apoptosis. All these data indicate that the anti-proliferative effect of DHA is mediated by targeting of lipid rafts via decreasing cell surface lipid rafts by their internalization, thereby decreasing raft-associated onco-proteins via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways and decreasing Hsp90 chaperone function.",

Mead acid is thought to be produced by the same enzymes that synthesize arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, but the genes and the pathways involved in the conversion of oleic acid to Mead acid have not been fully elucidated. The levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in cultured cells are generally very low compared to those in mammalian tissues. In this study, we found that cultured cells, such as NIH3T3 and Hepa1\u20136 cells, have significant levels of Mead acid, indicating that cells in culture are in an EFAD state under normal culture conditions. We then examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of fatty acid desaturases and elongases on the level of Mead acid, and found that knockdown of Elovl5, Fads1, or Fads2 decreased the level of Mead acid.

Because AC regulates the levels of pro-apoptotic ceramide and mitogenic sphingosine-1-phosphate, it is considered an apt target in cancer therapy. The present study reveals, for the first time, that the prominent antiestrogen, tamoxifen, is a pan-effective AC inhibitor in the low, single digit micromolar range, as demonstrated in a wide spectrum of cancer cell types, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, and breast. Prostate cancer cells were chosen for the detailed investigations. Treatment of intact PC-3 cells with tamoxifen produced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of AC activity. Tamoxifen did not impact cell viability nor did it inhibit AC activity in cell-free assays. In pursuit of mechanism of action, we demonstrate that tamoxifen induced time-, as early as 5\u00a0min, and dose-dependent, as low as 5\u00a0\u03bcM, increases in lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), and time- and dose-dependent downregulation of AC protein expression. Assessing various protease inhibitors revealed that a cathepsin B inhibitor blocked tamoxifen-elicited downregulation of AC protein; however, this action failed to restore AC activity unless assayed in a cell-free system at pH\u00a04.5. In addition, pretreatment with tamoxifen inhibited PC-3 cell migration. Toremifene, an antiestrogen structurally similar to tamoxifen, was also a potent inhibitor of AC activity. This study reveals a new, off-target action of tamoxifen that may be of benefit to enhance anticancer therapies that either incorporate ceramide or target ceramide metabolism.",

Many of these signaling pathways depend on the presence of specialized membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts. Sphingomyelin (SM), one of the main raft constituents, can be formed de novo or supplied from exogenous sources. The present study aimed to characterize fluorescently-labeled SL turnover in a murine neuronal cell line (CATH.a). Our results demonstrate that at 4\u00a0\u00b0C exogenously added BODIPY-SM accumulates exclusively at the plasma membrane. Treatment of cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) and back-exchange experiments revealed that 55\u201367% of BODIPY-SM resides in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of BODIPY-SM occurs via caveolae with part of internalized BODIPY-fluorescence ending up in the Golgi and the ER. Following endocytosis BODIPY-SM undergoes hydrolysis, a reaction substantially faster than BODIPY-SM synthesis from BODIPY-ceramide. RNAi demonstrated that both, acid (a)SMase and neutral (n)SMases contribute to BODIPY-SM hydrolysis. Finally, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated BODIPY-SM was efficiently taken up by CATH.a cells. Our findings indicate that endocytosis of exogenous SM occurs almost exclusively via caveolin-dependent pathways, that both, a- and nSMases equally contribute to neuronal SM turnover and that HDL-like particles might represent physiological SM carriers/donors in the brain.",

Recently, we demonstrated in HepG2 cells that T3 controls the expression of SREBP-1, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. This occurs by activation of a cap-independent translation mechanism of its mRNA. Such a process is dependent on non-genomic activation of both MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. The physiological role of 3,5-diiodo-l-thyronine (T2), previously considered only as a T3 catabolite, is of growing interest. Evidences have been reported that T2 rapidly affects some metabolic pathways through non-genomic mechanisms. Here, we show that T2, unlike T3, determines the block of proteolytic cleavage of SREBP-1 in HepG2 cells, without affecting its expression at the transcriptional or translational level. Consequently, Fatty Acid Synthase expression is reduced. T2 effects depend on the concurrent activation of MAPKs ERK and p38, of Akt and PKC-\u03b4 pathways. Upon the activation of these signals, apoptosis of HepG2 cells seems to occur, starting at 12\u00a0h of T2 treatment. PKC-\u03b4 appears to act as a switch between p38 activation and Akt suppression, suggesting that this PKC may function as a controller in the balance of pro-apoptotic (p38) and anti-apoptotic (Akt) signals in HepG2 cells.",

Although the generation of NAPE by N-acylation of phosphatidylethanolamine is thought to be the rate-limiting step of NAE biosynthesis, the enzyme responsible, N-acyltransferase, remains poorly characterized. Recently, we found that five members of the HRAS-like suppressor (HRASLS) family, which were originally discovered as tumor suppressors, possess phospholipid-metabolizing activities including NAPE-forming N-acyltransferase activity, and proposed to call HRASLS1\u20135 phospholipase A/acyltransferase (PLA/AT)-1\u20135, respectively. Among the five members, PLA/AT-1 attracts attention because of its relatively high N-acyltransferase activity and predominant expression in testis, skeletal muscle, brain and heart of human, mouse and rat. Here, we examined the formation of NAPE by PLA/AT-1 in living cells. As analyzed by metabolic labeling with [14C]ethanolamine or [14C]palmitic acid, the transient expression of human, mouse and rat PLA/AT-1s in COS-7 cells as well as the stable expression of human PLA/AT-1 in HEK293 cells significantly increased the generation of NAPE and NAE. Liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry also exhibited that the stable expression of PLA/AT-1 enhanced endogenous levels of NAPE, N-acylplasmenylethanolamine, NAE and glycerophospho-NAE. Furthermore, the knockdown of endogenous PLA/AT-1 in mouse ATDC5 cells lowered NAPE levels. Interestingly, the dysfunction of peroxisomes, which was caused by PLA/AT-2 and -3, was not observed in the PLA/AT-1-expressing HEK293 cells. Altogether, these results suggest that PLA/AT-1 is at least partly responsible for the generation of NAPE in mammalian cells.",

In silico mutagenesis experiments suggest that most mutations at hGly422 have the potential to induce sterical clash, which might be considered a reason for protein misfolding. hGly422 is conserved among ALOX5, ALOX12 and ALOX15 isoforms and corresponding hALOX12 and hALOX5 mutants also exhibited a reduced catalytic activity.

In many disease conditions the oxidized phospholipid (Ox-PL) content of HDL is found to be increased and an inverse correlation between the activity of PON1 and oxidation of the HDL is observed. However, the molecular details of the inhibitory action of the Ox-PL-containing HDL on the function of PON1 are not clear yet. In this study we have assembled reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles with and without Ox-PL and compared their effect on the structure and function of 13C-labeled recombinant PON1 (13C-rPON1) by employing attenuated total reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and enzymatic assay. Our results show that the presence of the Ox-PL in the rHDL particles alters the structure of rPON1 and decreases its lactonase activity.",

     "abstract": "Previously, we showed an inverse correlation between HSP27 serum levels and experimental atherogenesis in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice that over-express HSP27 and speculated that the apparent binding of HSP27 to scavenger receptor-A (SR-A) was of mechanistic importance in attenuating foam cell formation. However, the nature and importance of the interplay between HSP27 and SR-A in atheroprotection remained unclear. Treatment of THP-1 macrophages with recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) inhibited acLDL binding (\u2212\u00a034%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) and uptake (\u2212\u00a038%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). rHSP27 reduced SR-A mRNA (\u2212\u00a039%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), total protein (\u2212\u00a056%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and cell surface (\u2212\u00a053%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) expression. The reduction in SR-A expression by rHSP27 was associated with a 4-fold increase in nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 versus control), while an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB signaling, BAY11-7082, attenuated the negative effects of rHSP27 on both SR-A expression and lipid uptake. To determine if SR-A is required for HSP27 mediated atheroprotection in vivo, ApoE\u2212/\u2212 and ApoE\u2212/\u2212 SR-A\u2212/\u2212 mice fed with a high fat diet were treated for 3\u00a0weeks with rHSP25. Compared to controls, rHSP25 therapy reduced aortic en face and aortic sinus atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice by 39% and 36% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), respectively, but not in ApoE\u2212/\u2212SR-A\u2212/\u2212 mice. In conclusion, rHSP27 diminishes SR-A expression, resulting in attenuated foam cell formation in vitro. Regulation of SR-A by HSP27 may involve the participation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Lastly, SR-A is required for HSP27-mediated atheroprotection in vivo.",

In addition, endocytosis of HDL holo-particles has been debated for nearly 40\u00a0years. However, neither the connection between HDL endocytosis and selective lipid uptake, nor the physiological relevance of HDL uptake has been delineated clearly. This review will focus on HDL endocytosis and resecretion and its relation to cholesterol transfer. We will discuss the role of HDL endocytosis in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in tissues and cell types involved in atherosclerosis, focusing on liver, macrophages and endothelium. We will critically summarize the current knowledge on the receptors mediating HDL endocytosis including SR-BI, F1-ATPase and CD36 and on intracellular HDL transport routes. Dependent on the tissue, HDL is either resecreted (retro-endocytosis) or degraded after endocytosis. Finally, findings on HDL transcytosis across the endothelial barrier will be summarized. We suggest that HDL endocytosis and resecretion is a rather redundant pathway under physiologic conditions. In case of disturbed lipid metabolism, however, HDL retro-endocytosis represents an alternative pathway that enables tissues to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "STARD5 is a member of the STARD4 sub-family of START domain containing proteins specialized in the non-vesicular transport of lipids and sterols. We recently reported that STARD5 binds primary bile acids. Herein, we report on the biophysical and structural characterization of the binding of secondary and conjugated bile acids by STARD5 at physiological concentrations. We found that the absence of the 7\u03b1-OH group and its epimerization increase the affinity of secondary bile acids for STARD5. According to NMR titration and molecular modeling, the affinity depends mainly on the number and positions of the steroid ring hydroxyl groups and to a lesser extent on the presence or type of bile acid side-chain conjugation. Primary and secondary bile acids have different binding modes and display different positioning within the STARD5 binding pocket. The relative STARD5 affinity for the different bile acids studied is: DCA\u00a0>\u00a0LCA\u00a0>\u00a0CDCA\u00a0>\u00a0GDCA\u00a0>\u00a0TDCA\u00a0>\u00a0CA\u00a0>\u00a0UDCA.

     "abstract": "Cardiac oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Systemic deletion of the gene encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of triglyceride lipolysis, results in a phenotype characterized by severe steatotic cardiac dysfunction. The objective of the present study was to investigate a potential role of oxidative stress in cardiac ATGL deficiency. Hearts of mice with global ATGL knockout were compared to those of mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL and to those of wildtype littermates. Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress, measured as lucigenin chemiluminescence, was increased ~\u00a06-fold in ATGL-deficient hearts. In parallel, cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits p67phox and p47phox were upregulated 4\u20135-fold at the protein level. Moreover, a prominent upregulation of different inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, monocyte chemotactant protein-1, interleukin 6, and galectin-3) was observed in those hearts. Both the oxidative and inflammatory responses were abolished upon cardiomyocyte-restricted overexpression of ATGL. Investigating the effect of oxidative and inflammatory stress on nitric oxide/cGMP signal transduction we observed a ~\u00a02.5-fold upregulation of soluble guanylate cyclase activity and a ~\u00a02-fold increase in cardiac tetrahydrobiopterin levels. Systemic treatment of ATGL-deficient mice with the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III)tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin did not ameliorate but rather aggravated cardiac oxidative stress. Our data suggest that oxidative and inflammatory stress seems involved in lipotoxic heart disease. Upregulation of soluble guanylate cyclase and cardiac tetrahydrobiopterin might be regarded as counterregulatory mechanisms in cardiac ATGL deficiency.",

     "abstract": "In this study we have used mass spectrometry in order to characterize the HDL lipidome in three groups of women from the DIWA cohort; one control group, plus two groups with type 2 diabetes with insulin resistance; one dyslipidemic and one normolipidemic. The aim was to investigate whether dyslipidemia is required in addition to insulin resistance for the occurrence of an altered HDL lipidome, which in turn might impact HDL functionality. The dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic subjects were distinguished by obesity, hypertriglyceridemia with elevated apoC3, low HDL-cholesterol and chronic low grade inflammation. In a stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, including biomarkers of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as independent variables, only dyslipidemia showed a significant correlation with HDL lipid classes. Small HDL-particles predominated in dyslipidemic subjects in contrast to the normolipidemic diabetic and control groups, and were enriched in lysophosphatidylcholine (+\u00a013%), a product of proinflammatory phospholipases, and equally in two core lipids, palmitate-rich triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols (+\u00a077 %), thereby reflecting elevated CETP activity. Dyslipidemic small HDL particles were further distinguished not only as the primary carrier of ceramides, which promote inflammation and insulin resistance, but also by a subnormal plasmalogen/apoAI ratio, consistent with elevated oxidative stress typical of type 2 diabetes. From these data we conclude that in type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia predominates relative to hyperglycemia for the occurrence of an altered HDL lipidome. Furthermore, dyslipidemia alters the cargo of bioactive lipids, with implications for HDL function.",

In order to identify the PPAR regulating breast cancer cell growth, we tested the impact of siRNA, selected to suppress PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2 or PPAR\u03b3 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. The siPPAR\u03b2 was the most effective to inhibit breast cancer cell growth in both cell lines. Using PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2 and PPAR\u03b3 pharmacological antagonists, we showed that PPAR\u03b2 regulated DHA-induced inhibition of growth in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. In addition, the expressions of all 3 PPAR mRNA were co-regulated in both cell lines, upon treatments with siRNA or PPAR antagonists. PPAR mRNA expression was also examined in the NitrosoMethylUrea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model. The expressions of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b2 mRNAs were correlated in the control group but not in the n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 PUFA group in which the expression of PPAR\u03b2 mRNA was reduced. Although PPAR\u03b1 expression was also increased in the n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 PUFA-enriched diet group under docetaxel treatment, it is only the expression of PPAR\u03b2 mRNA that correlated with the regression of mammary tumors: those that most regressed displayed the lowest PPAR\u03b2 mRNA expression. Altogether, these data identify PPAR\u03b2 as an important player capable of modulating other PPAR mRNA expressions, under DHA diet, for inhibiting breast cancer cell growth and mammary tumor growth.",

     "abstract": "We previously identified peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) agonists (thiazolidinediones, TZDs) as modulators of the sphingolipid metabolism in renal mesangial cells. TZDs upregulated sphingosine kinase 1 (SK-1) and increased the formation of intracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which in turn reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic connective tissue growth factor. Since S1P also acts as extracellular ligand at specific S1P receptors (S1PR, S1P1\u20135), we investigated here the effect of TZDs on S1PR expression in mesangial cells and evaluated the functional consequences by measuring S1P-induced increases in intracellular free Ca2\u00a0+ concentration ([Ca2\u00a0+]i). Treatment with two different TZDs, troglitazone and rosiglitazone, enhanced S1P1 mRNA and protein expression in rat mesangial cells, whereas S1P2\u20135 expression levels were not altered. Upregulation of S1P1 mRNA upon TZD treatment was also detected in human mesangial cells and mouse glomeruli. PPAR\u03b3 antagonism and promoter studies revealed that the TZD-dependent S1P1 mRNA induction involved a functional PPAR response element in the S1P1 promoter. Pharmacological approaches disclosed that S1P-induced [Ca2\u00a0+]i increases in rat mesangial cells were predominantly mediated by S1P2 and S1P3. Interestingly, the transcriptional upregulation of S1P1 by TZDs resulted in a reduction of S1P-induced [Ca2\u00a0+]i increases, which was reversed by the S1P1/3 antagonist VPC-23019, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor PKC-412, and by S1P1 siRNA. These data suggest that PPAR\u03b3-dependent upregulation of S1P1 leads to an inhibition of S1P-induced Ca2\u00a0+ signaling in a PKC-dependent manner. Overall, these results reveal that TZDs not only modulate intracellular S1P levels but also regulate S1PR signaling by increasing S1P1 expression in mesangial cells.",

In this study, we investigated the mechanism as to how CETP induces the generation of lipid-poor particles (pre-\u03b2-HDL) from HDL, which increases ATP-binding cassette transporter 1-mediated cholesterol efflux. This CETP-dependent HDL remodeling is enhanced by the CETP modulator dalcetrapib both in plasma and isolated HDL. The interaction of dalcetrapib with cysteine 13 of CETP is required, since this effect was abolished when using mutant CETP in which cysteine 13 was substituted for a serine residue. Other thiol-containing compounds were identified as CETP modulators interacting with cysteine 13 of CETP. In order to mimic dalcetrapib-bound CETP, mutant CETP proteins were prepared by replacing cysteine 13 with the bulky amino acid tyrosine or tryptophan. The resultant mutants showed virtually no CETP-dependent lipid transfer activity but demonstrated preserved CETP-dependent pre-\u03b2-HDL generation. Overall, these data demonstrate that the two functions of CETP i.e., cholesteryl ester transfer and HDL remodeling can be uncoupled by interaction of thiol-containing compounds with cysteine 13 of CETP or by introducing large amino acid residues in place of cysteine 13.",

     "abstract": "The 53-kDa insulin receptor substrate protein (IRSp53) organizes the actin cytoskeleton in response to stimulation of small GTPases, promoting the formation of cell protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia. IMD is the N-terminal 250 amino acid domain (IRSp53/MIM Homology Domain) of IRSp53 (also called I-BAR), which can bind to negatively charged lipid molecules. Overexpression of IMD induces filopodia formation in cells and purified IMD assembles finger-like protrusions in reconstituted lipid membranes. IMD was shown by several groups to bundle actin filaments, but other groups showed that it also binds to membranes. IMD binds to negatively charged lipid molecules with preference to clusters of PI(4,5)P2. Here, we performed a range of different in vitro fluorescence experiments to determine the binding properties of the IMD to phospholipids. We used different constructs of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVETs), containing neutral or negatively charged phospholipids. We found that IMD has a stronger binding interaction with negatively charged PI(4,5)P2 or PS lipids than PS/PC or neutral PC lipids. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the IMD\u2013lipid interaction falls into the 78\u2013170\u00a0\u03bcM range for all the lipids tested. The solvent accessibility of the fluorescence labels on the IMD during its binding to lipids is also reduced as the lipids become more negatively charged. Actin affects the IMD\u2013lipid interaction, depending on its polymerization state. Monomeric actin partially disrupts the binding, while filamentous actin can further stabilize the IMD\u2013lipid interaction.",

However, more recently an epidemiological relationship between obesity and the prevalence of a variety of cancers has also been uncovered. The shift of the paradigm surrounding white adipose tissue function from purely an energy storage tissue, to one that has both endocrine and metabolic relevance, has led to several mechanisms implicated in how obesity drives cancer prevalence and cancer deaths. Currently, there are four categories into which these mechanisms fall \u2014 increased lipids and lipid signaling, inflammatory responses, insulin resistance, and adipokines.

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) metabolism appears to be unique in comparison with other types of solid cancers. Normal prostate cells mainly rely on glucose oxidation to provide precursors for the synthesis and secretion of citrate, resulting in an incomplete Krebs cycle and minimal oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. In contrast, during transformation, PCa cells no longer secrete citrate and they reactivate the Krebs cycle as energy source. Moreover, primary PCas do not show increased aerobic glycolysis and therefore they are not efficiently detectable with 18F-FDG-PET. However, increased de novo lipid synthesis, strictly intertwined with deregulation in classical oncogenes and oncosuppressors, is an early event of the disease. Up-regulation and increased activity of lipogenic enzymes (including fatty acid synthase and choline kinase) occurs throughout PCa carcinogenesis and correlates with worse prognosis and poor survival. Thus, lipid precursors such as acetate and choline have been successfully used as alternative tracers for PET imaging. Lipid synthesis intermediates and FA catabolism also emerged as important players in PCa maintenance. Finally, epidemiologic studies suggested that systemic metabolic disorders including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes as well as hypercaloric and fat-rich diets might increase the risk of PCa. However, how metabolic disorders contribute to PCa development and whether dietary lipids and de novo lipids synthesized intra-tumor are differentially metabolized still remains unclear. In this review, we examine the switch in lipid metabolism supporting the development and progression of PCa and we discuss how we can exploit its lipogenic nature for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

     "abstract": "Adipose tissue influences tumor development in two major ways. First, obese individuals have a higher risk of developing certain cancers (endometrial, esophageal, and renal cell cancer). However, the risk of developing other cancers (melanoma, rectal, and ovarian) is not altered by body mass. In obesity, hypertrophied adipose tissue depots are characterized by a state of low grade inflammation. In this activated state, adipocytes and inflammatory cells secrete adipokines and cytokines which are known to promote tumor development. In addition, the adipocyte mediated conversion of androgens to estrogen specifically contributes to the development of endometrial cancer, which shows the greatest relative risk (6.3-fold) increase between lean and obese individuals. Second, many tumor types (gastric, breast, colon, renal, and ovarian) grow in the anatomical vicinity of adipose tissue. During their interaction with cancer cells, adipocytes dedifferentiate into pre-adipocytes or are reprogrammed into cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA). CAA secrete adipokines which stimulate the adhesion, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Cancer cells and CAA also engage in a dynamic exchange of metabolites. Specifically, CAA release fatty acids through lipolysis which are then transferred to cancer cells and used for energy production through \u03b2-oxidation. The abundant availability of lipids from adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment, supports tumor progression and uncontrolled growth. Given that adipocytes are a major source of adipokines and energy for the cancer cell, understanding the mechanisms of metabolic symbiosis between cancer cells and adipocytes, should reveal new therapeutic possibilities.

The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway depends on the BCL-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic members whose interactions form a complex network of checks and balances in regulating cell fate. A diverse set of signals recruits distinct BH3-domain only BCL-2 proteins to trigger activation of the executioner proteins BAX and BAK. In addition to protein components of the apoptotic machinery, literature of the past several decades supports crucial functions for lipids in apoptosis and cooperation between lipid metabolism and BCL-2 proteins.

     "abstract": "Obesity is associated with an increased risk for malignant lymphoma development. We used Bcr/Abl transformed B cells to determine the impact of aggressive lymphoma formation on systemic lipid mobilization and turnover. In wild-type mice, tumor size significantly correlated with depletion of white adipose tissues (WAT), resulting in increased serum free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations which promote B-cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover, B-cell tumor development induced hepatic lipid accumulation due to enhanced hepatic fatty acid (FA) uptake and impaired FA oxidation. Serum triglyceride, FFA, phospholipid and cholesterol levels were significantly elevated. Consistently, serum VLDL/LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were drastically increased. These findings suggest that B-cell tumors trigger systemic lipid mobilization from WAT to the liver and increase VLDL/LDL release from the liver to promote tumor growth. Further support for this concept stems from experiments where we used the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) agonist and lipid-lowering drug fenofibrate that significantly suppressed tumor growth independent of angiogenesis and inflammation. In addition to WAT depletion, fenofibrate further stimulated FFA uptake by the liver and restored hepatic FA oxidation capacity, thereby accelerating the clearance of lipids released from WAT. Furthermore, fenofibrate blocked hepatic lipid release induced by the tumors. In contrast, lipid utilization in the tumor tissue itself was not increased by fenofibrate which correlates with extremely low expression levels of PPAR\u03b1 in B-cells. Our data show that fenofibrate associated effects on hepatic lipid metabolism and deprivation of serum lipids are capable to suppress B-cell lymphoma growth which may direct novel treatment strategies.

We show that cancer cells and tumors robustly incorporate and remodel exogenous palmitate into structural and oncogenic glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and ether lipids. We also find that fatty acid incorporation into oxidative pathways is reduced in aggressive human cancer cells, and instead shunted into pathways for generating structural and signaling lipids.

     "abstract": "\u03949-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active ingredient of marijuana, and other cannabinoids inhibit tumor growth in animal models of cancer. This effect relies, at least in part, on the up-regulation of several endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins including the pseudokinase tribbles homologue-3 (TRIB3), which leads in turn to the inhibition of the AKT/mTORC1 axis and the subsequent stimulation of autophagy-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells. Here, we took advantage of the use of cells derived from Trib3-deficient mice to investigate the precise mechanisms by which TRIB3 regulates the anti-cancer action of THC. Our data show that RasV12/E1A-transformed embryonic fibroblasts derived from Trib3-deficient mice are resistant to THC-induced cell death. We also show that genetic inactivation of this protein abolishes the ability of THC to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT and several of its downstream targets, including those involved in the regulation of the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) axis. Our data support the idea that THC-induced TRIB3 up-regulation inhibits AKT phosphorylation by regulating the accessibility of AKT to its upstream activatory kinase (the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; mTORC2). Finally, we found that tumors generated by inoculation of Trib3-deficient cells in nude mice are resistant to THC anticancer action. Altogether, the observations presented here strongly support that TRIB3 plays a crucial role on THC anti-neoplastic activity.

     "abstract": "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is responsible for the hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabinoid (CB) receptor ligand anandamide. Here we have investigated whether the expression levels of FAAH and CB1 receptors influence the prognostic value of markers of angiogenesis in prostate cancer. Data from a cohort of 419 patients who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms, of whom approximately 2/3 had been followed by expectancy, were used. Scores for the angiogenesis markers endoglin and von Willebrand factor (vWf), the endocannabinoid markers fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cannabinoid CB1 receptors and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 were available in the database. For the cases followed by expectancy, the prognostic value of endoglin was dependent upon the tumour epithelial FAAH immunoreactivity (FAAH-IR) and CB1IR scores, and the non-malignant epithelial FAAH-IR scores, but not the non-malignant CB1IR scores or the tumour blood vessel FAAH-IR scores. This dependency upon the tumour epithelial FAAH-IR or CB1IR scores was less apparent for vWf, and was not seen for Ki-67. Using an endoglin cut-off value of 10 positively stained vessels per core and a median split of tumour FAAH-IR, four groups could be generated, with 15\u00a0year of disease-specific survival (%) of 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 (low endoglin, low FAAH), 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 (high endoglin, low FAAH), 77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 (low endoglin, high FAAH) and 21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010 (high endoglin, high FAAH). Thus, the cases with high endoglin and high FAAH scores have the poorest rate of disease-specific survival. At diagnosis, the number of cases with tumour stages 1a\u20131b relative to stages 2\u20134 was sensitive to the endoglin score in a manner dependent upon the tumour FAAH-IR. It is concluded that the prognostic value of endoglin as a marker of neovascularisation in prostate cancer can be influenced by the expression level of markers of the endocannabinoid system.

In many mammalian newborns, pancreatic lipase related protein 2 (PLRP2) is the predominant duodenal lipase. Pigs may be an exception since PLRP2 expression has been documented in the intestine but not in the pancreas. Because of the differences in tissue-specific expression, we hypothesized that the kinetic properties of porcine PLRP2 would differ from those of other mammals. To characterize its properties, recombinant porcine PLRP2 was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified to homogeneity. Porcine PLRP2 had activity against tributyrin, trioctanoin and triolein. The activity was not inhibited by bile salts and colipase, which is required for the activity of pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL), minimally stimulated PLRP2 activity. Similar to PLRP2 from other species, PLRP2 from pigs had activity against galactolipids and phospholipids. Importantly, porcine PLRP2 hydrolyzed a variety of dietary substrates including pasteurized human mother's milk and infant formula and its activity was comparable to that of PTL. In conclusion, porcine PLRP2 has broad substrate specificity and has high triglyceride lipase activity even in the absence of colipase. The data suggest that porcine PLRP2 would be a suitable lipase for inclusion in recombinant preparations for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.",

An important difference, however, is that both enzymatic activities may be combined in a single bifunctional enzyme. These types of enzymes are named Psi-factor producing oxygenases (Ppo). Here, the spatial organization of the two domains of PpoA from Aspergillus nidulans was analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering and the obtained data show that the enzyme exhibits a relatively flat trimeric shape. Atomic structures of the single domains were obtained by template-based structure prediction and docked into the enzyme envelope of the low resolution structure obtained by SAXS. EPR-based distance measurements between the tyrosyl radicals formed in the activated dioxygenase domain of the enzyme supported the trimeric structure obtained from SAXS and the previous assignment of Tyr374 as radical-site in PpoA.

The relative proportion of phosphatidyl choline to neutral lipids (triglyceride\u00a0+\u00a0total cholesterol) in Y79 RB cancer cells was found to be higher than the non-neoplastic cells, indicative of altered lipid distribution and utilization in tumor cells.

While peroxisomes oxidize specific carboxylic acids such as very long-chain fatty acids, branched-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and fatty dicarboxylic acids, mitochondria oxidize long-, medium-, and short-chain fatty acids. Oxidation of long-chain substrates requires the carnitine shuttle for mitochondrial access but medium-chain fatty acid oxidation is generally considered carnitine-independent. Using control and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2)- and carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT)-deficient human fibroblasts, we investigated the oxidation of lauric acid (C12:0). Measurement of the acylcarnitine profile in the extracellular medium revealed significantly elevated levels of extracellular C10- and C12-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient fibroblasts. The accumulation of C12-carnitine indicates that lauric acid also uses the carnitine shuttle to access mitochondria. Moreover, the accumulation of extracellular C10-carnitine in CPT2- and CACT-deficient cells suggests an extramitochondrial pathway for the oxidation of lauric acid. Indeed, in the absence of peroxisomes C10-carnitine is not produced, proving that this intermediate is a product of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation. In conclusion, when the carnitine shuttle is impaired lauric acid is partly oxidized in peroxisomes. This peroxisomal oxidation could be a compensatory mechanism to metabolize straight medium- and long-chain fatty acids, especially in cases of mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation deficiency or overload.",

The two proteins are localised in lipid bodies, and YlTgl4 was mainly found at the interface between LBs. Surprisingly, the spatial organisation of YlTgl3 and YlTgl4 depends on the culture medium and on the physiological phase of the cell. Inactivation of one or both genes doubles the lipid accumulation capacity of Y. lipolytica, increasing the cell's capacity to accumulate TAGs. The amino acid sequence of YlTgl4 contains the consensus sequence motif (G/A)XSXG, typical of serine hydrolases, whereas YlTgl3 does not. Single and double mutants are unable to degrade TAGs, and higher expression of YlTgl4 correlates with TAG degradation. Therefore, we propose that YlTgl4 is the main lipase responsible for TAG degradation and that YlTgl3 may act as a positive regulator of YlTgl4 rather than a functional lipase. Thus, contrary to S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica possesses two intracellular lipases with distinct roles and with distinct localisations in the LB.",

     "abstract": "How dietary fatty acids are absorbed into the enterocyte and transported to the ER is not established. We tested the possibility that caveolin-1 containing lipid rafts and endocytic vesicles were involved. Apical brush border membranes took up 15% of albumin bound 3H-oleate whereas brush border membranes from caveolin-1 KO mice took up only 1%. In brush border membranes, the 3H-oleate was in the detergent resistant fraction of an OptiPrep gradient. On OptiPrep gradients of intestinal cytosol, we also found the 3H-oleate in the detergent resistant fraction, separate from OptiPrep gradients spiked with 3H-oleate or 3H-triacylglycerol. Caveolin-1 immuno-depletion of cytosol removed 91% of absorbed 3H-oleate whereas immuno-depletion using IgG, or anti-caveolin-2 or -3 or anti-clathrin antibodies removed 20%. Electron microscopy showed the presence of caveolin-1 containing vesicles in WT mouse cytosol that were 4 fold increased by feeding intestinal sacs 1\u00a0mM oleate. No vesicles were seen in caveolin-1 KO mouse cytosol. Caveolin-1 KO mice gained less weight on a 23% fat diet and had increased fat in their stool compared to WT mice. We conclude that dietary fatty acids are absorbed by caveolae in enterocyte brush border membranes, are endocytosed, and transported in cytosol in caveolin-1 containing endocytic vesicles.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Growing evidence suggests that human tumours undergo abnormal lipid metabolism, characterised by an alteration in the mechanisms that regulate cholesterol homeostasis. We have investigated the effect that different antitumoural alkylphospholipids (APLs) exert upon cholesterol metabolism in the U-87 MG glioblastoma cell line. APLs altered cholesterol homeostasis by interfering with its transport from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus hindering its esterification. At the same time they stimulated the synthesis of cholesterol from radiolabelled acetate and its internalisation from low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), inducing both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and LDL receptor (LDLR) genes. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that these effects promoted the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Filipin staining demonstrated that this accumulation was not confined to the late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartment since it did not colocalise with LAMP2 lysosomal marker. Furthermore, APLs inhibited cell growth, producing arrest at the G2/M phase. We also used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate ultrastructural alterations induced by APLs and found an abundant presence of autophagic vesicles and autolysosomes in treated cells, indicating the induction of autophagy. Thus our findings clearly demonstrate that antitumoural APLs interfere with the proliferation of the glioblastoma cell line via a complex mechanism involving cholesterol metabolism, cell-cycle arrest or autophagy. Knowledge of the interrelationship between these processes is fundamental to our understanding of tumoural response and may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics to improve treatment of glioblastoma and other types of cancer.",

     "abstract": "Bile acids play multiple roles in the physiology of vertebrates; they facilitate lipid absorption, serve as signaling molecules to control carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and provide a disposal route for cholesterol. Unexpectedly, the \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) deficient mice, which are unable to complete the peroxisomal cleavage of C27-precursors to the mature C24-bile acids, are physiologically asymptomatic when maintained on a standard laboratory diet. The aim of this study was to uncover the underlying adaptive mechanism with special reference to cholesterol and bile acid metabolism that allows these mice to have a normal life span. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in Amacr\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice is decreased resulting in a 2-fold increase in daily cholesterol excretion. Also fecal excretion of bile acids (mainly C27-sterols) is enhanced 3-fold. However, the body cholesterol pool remains unchanged, although Amacr-deficiency accelerates hepatic sterol synthesis 5-fold. Changes in lipoprotein profiles are mainly due to decreased phospholipid transfer protein activity. Thus Amacr-deficient mice provide a unique example of metabolic regulation, which allows them to have a normal lifespan in spite of the disruption of a major metabolic pathway. This metabolic adjustment can be mainly explained by setting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism to a new balanced level in the Amacr-deficient mouse.",

The two redox-sensitive neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) and sphingosine kinase-1 (SK1) participate in transducing stress signaling to ceramide and S1P, respectively; however, whether these key enzymes are coordinately regulated is not known. We investigated whether a signaling link coordinates nSMase2 and SK1 activation by H2O2. In mesenchymal cells, H2O2 elicits a dose-dependent biphasic effect, mitogenic at low concentration (5\u00a0\u03bcM), and anti-proliferative and toxic at high concentration (100\u00a0\u03bcM).Low H2O2 concentration triggered activation of nSMase2 and SK1 through a nSMase2/Cer-dependent signaling pathway that acted upstream of activation of SK1. Further results implicated src and the trans-activation of PDGFR\u03b2, as supported by the blocking effect of specific siRNAs, pharmacological inhibitors, and genetically deficient cells for nSMase2, src and SK1. The H2O2-induced src/PDGFR\u03b2/SK1 signaling cascade was impaired in nSMase2-deficient fro/fro cells and was rescued by exogenous C2Cer that activated src/PDGFR\u03b2/SK1. Thus, the results define a nSMase2/SK1 signaling pathway implicated in the mitogenic response to low oxidative stress. On the other hand, high oxidative stress induced inhibition of SK1. The results also showed that the toxicity of high H2O2 concentration was comparable in control and nSMase2-deficient cells. Taken together the results identify a tightly coordinated nSMase2/SK1 pathway that mediates the mitogenic effects of H2O2 and may sense the degree of oxidative stress.",

Our aim was to elucidate whether hepatic lipid droplets (LDs) are involved in the adaptations of lipid metabolism to endotoxemia. We characterized the lipid content and several enzymatic activities in subcellular fractions and subpopulations of LDs from livers of mice 24\u00a0h after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment and analyzed the expression of key genes involved in lipid management. Endotoxemic mice showed lower lipid content in LDs with decreased molar fraction of cholesteryl ester and higher diacylglycerol/triacylglycerol ratio as compared to their controls. They also showed a decrease in cytosolic triacylglycerol hydrolase activity, specifically in dense LDs, and in microsomal and cytosolic diacylglycerol hydrolase activity; concomitantly neutral lipid biosynthetic capacity and triacylglycerol levels in plasma lipoproteins increased. Together with the overexpression of genes involved in lipogenesis and HDL formation our results suggest that altered hepatic management of LD lipids in LPS-treated mice might be related to the channeled mobilization of triacylglycerol for very low density lipoprotein assembly and to the induction of cholesterol export.",

This study was to elucidate the role of PTP1B in adipocyte differentiation and its implication in obesity. During differentiation of 3T3-L1 white preadipocytes, PTP1B decreased progressively with adipocyte maturation. Lentivirus-mediated PTP1B overexpression in preadipocytes delayed adipocyte differentiation, shown as lack of mature adipocytes, low level of lipid accumulation, and down-regulation of main markers (PPAR\u03b32, SREBP-1c, FAS and LPL). In contrast, lentivirus-mediated PTP1B knockdown accelerated adipocyte differentiation, demonstrated as full of mature adipocytes, high level of lipid accumulation, and up-regulation of main markers. Dominant-negative inhibition on endogenous PTP1B by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of PTP1B double mutant in Tyr-46 and Asp-181 residues (LV-D/A-Y/F) also stimulated adipogenesis, more efficient than PTP1B knockdown. Diet-induced obesity mice exhibited an up-regulation of PTP1B and TNF\u03b1 accompanied by a down-regulation of PPAR\u03b32 in white adipose tissue. TNF\u03b1 recombinant protein impeded PTP1B reduction and inhibited adipocyte differentiation in vitro; this inhibitory effect was prevented by LV-D/A-Y/F. Moreover, PTP1B inhibitor treatment improved adipogenesis and suppressed TNF\u03b1 in adipose tissue of obese mice. All together, PTP1B negatively regulates adipocyte development and may mediate TNF\u03b1 action to impair adipocyte differentiation in obesity. Our study provides novel evidence for the importance of PTP1B in obesity and for the potential application of PTP1B inhibitors.",

To determine the effect of increased intestinal DGAT2 on cellular and physiological responses to acute and chronic dietary fat challenges, we generated mice with intestine-specific overexpression of DGAT2 and compared them with intestine-specific overexpression of DGAT1 and wild-type (WT) mice. We found that when intestinal DGAT2 is present in excess, triacylglycerol (TG) secretion from enterocytes is enhanced compared to WT mice; however, TG storage within enterocytes is similar compared to WT mice. We found that when intestinal DGAT2 is present in excess, mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation were reduced. This result suggests that reduced fatty acid oxidation may contribute to increased TG secretion by overexpression of DGAT2 in intestine. Furthermore, this enhanced supply of TG for secretion in Dgat2Int mice may be a significant contributing factor to the elevated fasting plasma TG and exacerbated hepatic TG storage in response to a chronic HFD. These results highlight that altering fatty acid and TG metabolism within enterocytes has the capacity to alter systemic delivery of dietary fat and may serve as an effective target for preventing and treating metabolic diseases such as hepatic steatosis.",

However, the subtype-specific functions for LPA1 and LPA3 receptors in LPA-induced hypertrophy have not been distinguished. Growing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy by down-regulating target molecules. The present work therefore aimed at elucidating the functions mediated by different subtypes of LPA receptors and investigating the modulatory role of miRNAs during LPA induced hypertrophy. Experiments were done with cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) exposed to LPA and we showed that knockdown of LPA1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, whereas LPA3 silencing repressed hypertrophy. miR-23a, a pro-hypertrophic miRNA, was up-regulated by LPA in cardiomyocytes and its down-regulation reduced LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Importantly, luciferase reporter assay confirmed LPA1 to be a target of miR-23a, indicating that miR-23a is involved in mediating the LPA-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting LPA1. In addition, knockdown of LPA3, but not LPA1, eliminated miR-23a elevation induced by LPA. And PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, effectively prevented LPA-induced miR-23a expression in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that LPA might induce miR-23a elevation by activating LPA3 and PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings identified opposite subtype-specific functions for LPA1 and LPA3 in mediating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and indicated LPA1 to be a target of miR-23a, which discloses a link between miR-23a and the LPA receptor signaling in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) detoxify aldehydes by oxidizing them to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, ALDH3A2 is the only known ALDH that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain fatty aldehydes including C16 aldehydes (hexadecanal and trans-2-hexadecenal) generated through sphingolipid metabolism. In the present study, we have identified that ALDH3B1 is also active in vitro toward C16 aldehydes and demonstrated that overexpression of ALDH3B1 restores the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells. In addition, we have determined that ALDH3B1 is localized in the plasma membrane through its C-terminal dual lipidation (palmitoylation and prenylation) and shown that the prenylation is required particularly for the activity toward hexadecanal. Since knockdown of ALDH3B1 does not cause further impairment of the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells, the likely physiological function of ALDH3B1 is to oxidize lipid-derived aldehydes generated in the plasma membrane and not to be involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether SCD1 affects macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in mice. Compared to the control, adenoviral-mediated SCD1 overexpression in RAW264.7 macrophages increased cholesterol efflux to HDL, but not to apoA-I, without clear changes in ABCA1, ABCG1 and SR-BI expressions. While knockdown of ABCG1 and SR-BI did not affect the SCD1-induced cholesterol efflux to HDL, SCD1-overexpressing macrophages promoted the formation of both normal- and large-sized HDL in media, accompanying increased apolipoprotein A-I levels in HDL fractions. Transformation to larger particles of HDL was independently confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance-based lipoprotein analysis. Interestingly, media transfer assays revealed that HDL generated by SCD1 had enhanced cholesterol efflux potential, indicating that SCD1 transformed HDL to a more anti-atherogenic phenotype. To study macrophage RCT in vivo, 3H-cholesterol-labeled RAW264.7 cells overexpressing SCD1 or the control were intraperitoneally injected into mice. Supporting the in vitro data, injection of SCD1-macrophages resulted in significant increases in 3H-tracer in plasma, liver, and feces compared to the control. Moreover, there was a shift towards larger particles in the 3H-tracer distribution of HDL fractions obtained from the mice.In conclusion, macrophage-specific SCD1 overexpression promotes overall RCT through increased cholesterol efflux to HDL, suggesting that macrophage SCD1 achieves an anti-atherogenic effect by enhancing RCT.",

     "abstract": "We previously reported that transplantation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) treated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enhances capillary density in the myocardium and improves myocardial function in the ischemic heart. This effect may be mediated through the release of paracrine factors by MSC and potentially involves pro-angiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this study, we examined the pharmacological and molecular regulation of VEGF secretion induced by LPA in rat MSCs. We showed that LPA stimulated VEGF secretion in MSCs but not in cardiomyocytes or cardiac fibroblasts. LPA-induced VEGF secretion occurred at the post-transcriptional levels and was mediated through the classical ER/Golgi-dependent protein secretory route. LPA also increased ORP150 protein expression. Inhibition of ORP150 upregulation by siRNA knockdown attenuated LPA-induced VEGF secretion. On the other hand, diazoxide, an activator of KATP channel, markedly inhibited LPA-induced ORP150 expression and VEGF secretion. Meanwhile, ATP concentration dependently increased VEGF secretion. In addition, l-Glutamate and NH4Cl significantly reduced VEGF secretion. Furthermore, inhibition of two major subtypes of LPA receptors by Ki16425 and specific siRNA for LPA receptors prevented LPA-induced VEGF secretion and ORP150 expression. Lastly, inhibition of Gi protein that couples with LPA receptors by PTX and siRNA knockdown had no effect on LPA-induced VEGF secretion. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LPA promotes VEGF secretion at the post-translation level by up-regulating ORP150 expression. Both LPA1 and LPA3 are involved in the LPA-induced VEGF secretion that is independent of Gi protein coupling but associated with the inactivation of KATP channels and inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase activity.",

     "abstract": "Obesity results in increased macrophage recruitment to adipose tissue that promotes a chronic low-grade inflammatory state linked to increased fatty acid efflux from adipocytes. Activated macrophages produce a variety of pro-inflammatory lipids such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and 5-, 12-, and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) suggesting the hypothesis that fatty acids may stimulate eicosanoid synthesis. To assess if eicosanoid production increases with obesity, adipose tissue of leptin deficient ob/ob mice was analyzed. In ob/ob mice, LTC4 and 12-HETE levels increased in the visceral (but not subcutaneous) adipose depot while the 5-HETE levels decreased and 15-HETE abundance was unchanged. Since macrophages produce the majority of inflammatory molecules in adipose tissue, treatment of RAW264.7 or primary peritoneal macrophages with free fatty acids led to increased secretion of LTC4 and 5-HETE, but not 12- or 15-HETE. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) facilitate the intracellular trafficking of fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands and in vitro stabilize the LTC4 precursor leukotriene A4 (LTA4) from non-enzymatic hydrolysis. Consistent with a role for FABPs in LTC4 synthesis, treatment of macrophages with HTS01037, a specific FABP inhibitor, resulted in a marked decrease in both basal and fatty acid-stimulated LTC4 secretion but no change in 5-HETE production or 5-lipoxygenase expression. These results indicate that the products of adipocyte lipolysis may stimulate the 5-lipoxygenase pathway leading to FABP-dependent production of LTC4 and contribute to the insulin resistant state.",

It is well established that enlarged adipocytes exhibit malfunctions that contribute to whole body insulin resistance, a key factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying molecular cause for dysfunctional adipocyte behavior and signaling is poorly understood. Since the adipocyte cell surface proteome, or surfaceome, represents the cellular signaling gateway to the microenvironment, we studied the contribution of this subproteome to adipocyte malfunctions in obesity. By using the chemoproteomic Cell Surface Capture (CSC) technology, we established surfaceome maps of primary adipocytes derived from different mouse models for metabolic disorders. Relative quantitative comparison between these surfaceome maps revealed a set of cell surface glycoproteins with modulated location-specific abundance levels. RNAi mediated targeting of a subset of the detected obesity modulated cell surface glycoproteins in an in vitro model system provided functional evidence for their role in adiponectin secretion and the lipolytic activity of adipocytes. Thus, we conclude that the identified cell surface glycoproteins which exhibit obesity induced abundance changes and impact adipocyte function at the same time contribute to adipocyte malfunction in obesity. The regulation of their concerted activities could improve adipocyte function in obesity.",

     "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase 2 and release of prostaglandin E2 are involved in many responses including inflammation and are upregulated during cellular senescence. However, little is known about the role of lipid inflammatory mediators in senescence. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the COX-2/PGE2 axis induces senescence. Using the NS398 specific inhibitor of COX-2, we provide evidence that reactive oxygen species by-produced by the COX-2 enzymatic activity are negligible in front of the total senescence-associated oxidative stress. We therefore investigated the role of PGE2 by invalidating the PGE2 synthases downstream of COX-2, or the specific PGE2 receptors, or by applying PGE2 or specific agonists or antagonists. We evaluated the effect on senescence by evaluating the senescence-associated proliferation arrest, the percentage of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase-positive cells, and the expression of senescent molecular markers such as IL-6 and MCP1. We show that PGE2 acting on its EP specific receptors is able to induce both the onset of senescence and the maintenance of the phenotype. It did so only when the PGE2/lactate transporter activity was enhanced, indicating that PGE2 acts on senescence more via the pool of intracellular EP receptors than via those localized at the cell surface. Treatment with agonists, antagonists and silencing of the EP receptors by siRNA revealed that EP3 was the most involved in transducing the intracrine effects of PGE2. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that EP3 was more localized in the cytoplasm than at the cell surface. Taken together, these results suggest that COX-2 contributes to the establishment and maintenance of senescence of normal human fibroblasts via an independent-ROS and a dependent-PGE2/EPs intracrine pathway.",

     "abstract": "How cholesterol, a key membrane constituent, affects membrane surface area dynamics in secretory cells is unclear. Using methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) to deplete cholesterol, we imaged melanotrophs from male Wistar rats in real-time and monitored membrane capacitance (Cm), fluctuations of which reflect exocytosis and endocytosis. Treatment with M\u03b2CD reduced cellular cholesterol and caused a dose-dependent attenuation of the Ca2+-evoked increase in Cm (IC50\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u00a0mM) vs. untreated cells. Cytosol dialysis of M\u03b2CD enhanced the attenuation of Cm increase (IC50\u00a0=\u00a03.3\u00a0mM), suggesting cholesterol depletion at intracellular membrane sites was involved in attenuating exocytosis. Acute extracellular application of M\u03b2CD resulted in an immediate Cm decline, which correlated well with the cellular surface area decrease, indicating the involvement of cholesterol in the regulation of membrane surface area dynamics. This decline in Cm was three-fold slower than M\u03b2CD-mediated fluorescent cholesterol decay, implying that exocytosis is the likely physiological means for plasma membrane cholesterol replenishment. M\u03b2CD had no effect on the specific Cm and the blockade of endocytosis by Dyngo 4a, confirmed by inhibition of dextran uptake, also had no effect on the time-course of M\u03b2CD-induced Cm decline. Thus acute exposure to M\u03b2CD evokes a Cm decline linked to the removal of membrane cholesterol, which cannot be compensated for by exocytosis. We propose that the primary contribution of cholesterol to surface area dynamics is via its role in regulated exocytosis.",

While the lipids of other S. mutans strains have been identified and characterized, lipid analyses of UA159 have been limited to a few studies on its fatty acids. Here we report the structures of the four major glycolipids from stationary-phase S. mutans UA159 cells grown in standing cultures.

The structures were determined by high performance thin-layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The glycolipids were identified by accurate, high resolution, and tandem mass spectrometry. The identities of the sugar units in the glycolipids were determined by a novel and highly efficient NMR method. All sugars were shown to have \u03b1-glycosidic linkages and DGMAG was shown to be acylated in the sn-1 position by NMR.

The lipid A from free-living R. etli is structurally heterogeneous and exists as a mixture of species which are either pentaacylated or tetraacylated. In contrast, the lipid A from R. etli bacteroids is reported to consist exclusively of tetraacylated lipid A species. The tetraacylated lipid A species in both cases lack a \u03b2-hydroxymyristoyl chain at the 3-position of lipid A. Here, we show that the lipid A modification enzyme responsible for 3-O deacylation in R. etli is a homolog of the PagL protein originally described in Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. In contrast to the PagL proteins described from other species, R. etli PagL displays a calcium dependency. To determine the importance of the lipid A modification catalyzed by PagL, we isolated and characterized a R. etli mutant deficient in the pagL gene. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that the mutant strain was exclusively tetraacylated and radiochemical analysis revealed that 3-O deacylase activity was absent in membranes prepared from the mutant. The R. etli mutant was not impaired in its ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris but it displayed slower nodulation kinetics relative to the wild-type strain. The lipid A modification catalyzed by R. etli PagL, therefore, is not required for nodulation but may play other roles such as protecting bacterial endosymbionts from plant immune responses during infection.",

     "abstract": "The melanocortin system has a clear effect on the mobilisation of stored lipids in adipocytes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R) on \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH)-induced lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To this end, MC5R expression was decreased by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which significantly impaired the \u03b1-MSH stimulation of lipolysis, as determined by glycerol and nonesterified fatty-acid (NEFA) quantification. The functional role of \u03b1-MSH/MC5R on triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis was mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), perilipin 1 (PLIN1) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that phosphorylated HSL clearly surrounded lipid droplets in \u03b1-MSH-stimulated adipocytes, whereas PLIN1 left the immediate periphery of lipids. These observations were lost when the expression of MC5R was suppressed.In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, \u03b1-MSH-activated MC5R signals through the cAMP/PKA and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways. PKA was fundamental for HSL and PLIN1 activation and lipolysis regulation. ERK1/2 inhibition strongly interfered with the release of NEFAs but not glycerol. In addition, the intracellular TG levels, which were decreased after MC5R activation, were restored after ERK1/2 inhibition, indicating that these kinases are involved in NEFA re-esterification rather than lipolysis regulation. This notion is also supported by the observation that the \u03b1-MSH-mediated activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was abolished in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitors.Altogether, these results indicate that \u03b1-MSH-activated MC5R regulates two tightly coupled pathways in adipocytes: lipolysis and re-esterification.

Greater than 70% of the body's retinoid reserves are stored in the liver as retinyl ester (RE). Chronic alcohol consumption induces depletion of hepatic retinoid stores, and the extent of this has been correlated with advancing stages of alcoholic liver disease. The goal of this study was to analyze the mechanisms responsible for depletion of hepatic RE stores by alcohol consumption. A change in the fatty-acyl composition of RE in alcohol-fed mice was observed within two weeks after the start of alcohol consumption. Specifically, alcohol-feeding was associated with a significant decline in hepatic retinyl palmitate levels; however, total RE levels were maintained by a compensatory increase in levels of usually minor RE species, particularly retinyl oleate. Our data suggests that alcohol feeding initially stimulates a futile cycle of RE hydrolysis and synthesis, and that the change in RE acyl composition is associated with a change in the acyl composition of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. The alcohol-induced change in RE acyl composition was specific to the liver, and was not seen in lung or white adipose tissue. This shift in hepatic RE fatty acyl composition is a sensitive indicator of alcohol consumption and may be an early biomarker for events associated with the development of alcoholic liver disease.",

     "abstract": "The HDL associated apolipoprotein M (apoM) protects against experimental atherosclerosis but the mechanism is unknown. ApoM increases pre\u03b2-HDL formation. We explored whether plasma apoM affects mobilization of cholesterol from peripheral cells in mice.ApoM-enriched HDL from apoM-transgenic mice increased the in vitro efflux of 3H-cholesterol from macrophages by 24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as compared with HDL from wild type (WT) mice, thus confirming previous findings. However, apoM-free HDL was not poorer than that of WT HDL to mobilize 3H-cholesterol. 3H-cholesterol-labeled foam cells were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of apoM\u2212/\u2212, WT and apoM-transgenic mice to assess the mobilization of cholesterol from foam cells in vivo and subsequent excretion into feces. The results showed a statistically non-significant trend towards increased mobilization of cellular cholesterol to plasma with increasing plasma apoM. However, the apoM-genotype did not affect the excretion of 3H-cholesterol in feces. Nevertheless, when apoM\u2212/\u2212, apoM-transgenic and WT mice received a constant intravenous infusion of 13C2-cholesterol/intralipid for 5\u00a0h, the rate of enrichment of blood free cholesterol with free 13C2-cholesterol was significantly lower (consistent with an increase in flux of unlabeled free cholesterol into the plasma) in the apoM-transgenic (3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u2030/h) as compared to WT (5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u2030/h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and apoM\u2212/\u2212 (6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u2030/h, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) mice.The present data indicate that the plasma apoM levels modulate the ability of plasma to mobilize cellular cholesterol, whereas apoM has no major effect on the excretion of cholesterol into feces.",

     "abstract": "Structural studies on pancreatic lipase have revealed a complex architecture of surface loops surrounding the enzyme active site and potentially involved in interactions with lipids. Two of them, the lid and \u03b29 loop, expose a large hydrophobic surface and are considered as acyl chain binding sites based on their interaction with an alkyl phosphonate inhibitor. While the role of the lid in substrate recognition and selectivity has been extensively studied, the implication of \u03b29 loop in acyl chain stabilization remained hypothetical. The characterization of an enzyme with a natural deletion of the lid, guinea pig pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (GPLRP2), suggests however an essential contribution of the \u03b29 loop in the stabilization of the acyl enzyme intermediate formed during the lipolysis reaction. A GPLRP2 mutant with a seven-residue deletion of \u03b29 loop (GPLRP2-\u0394\u03b29) was produced and its enzyme activity was measured using various substrates (triglycerides, monoglycerides, galactolipids, phospholipids, vinyl esters) with short, medium and long acyl chains. Whatever the substrate tested, GPLRP2-\u0394\u03b29 activity is drastically reduced compared to that of wild-type GPLRP2 and this effect is more pronounced as the length of substrate acyl chain increases. Changes in relative substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity remained however weak. The deletion within \u03b29 loop has also a negative effect on the rate of enzyme inhibition by alkyl phosphonates. All these findings indicate that the reduced enzyme turnover observed with GPLRP2-\u0394\u03b29 results from a weaker stabilization of the acyl enzyme intermediate due to a loss of hydrophobic interactions.",

In this study, sophisticated shotgun and targeted molecular lipidomic assays were performed for in-depth analysis of the lipidomes of the metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC-3, and their released exosomes. This study, based in the quantification of approximately 280 molecular lipid species, provides the most extensive lipid analysis of cells and exosomes to date. Interestingly, major differences were found in the lipid composition of exosomes compared to parent cells. Exosomes show a remarkable enrichment of distinct lipids, demonstrating an extraordinary discrimination of lipids sorted into these microvesicles. In particular, exosomes are highly enriched in glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and phosphatidylserine (mol% of total lipids). Furthermore, lipid species, even of classes not enriched in exosomes, were selectively included in exosomes. Finally, it was found that there is an 8.4-fold enrichment of lipids per mg of protein in exosomes. The detailed lipid composition provided in this study may be useful to understand the mechanism of exosome formation, release and function. Several of the lipids enriched in exosomes could potentially be used as cancer biomarkers.",

The pathway, which is frequently hyperactive in cancer cells, is considered an important target in cancer therapy, since prenylated members of the Ras superfamily are crucially involved in the control of proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis of tumour cells. Upstream accumulation and downstream depletion of mevalonate pathway intermediates as induced for instance by aminobisphosphonates translate into different effects in cancer and immune cells. Thus, mevalonate pathway regulation can affect tumour biology either directly or exhibit indirect antitumour effects through stimulating cancer immune surveillance. The present review summarizes major effects of pharmacologic mevalonate pathway regulation in cancer and immune cells that may collaboratively contribute to the efficacy of cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Inflammation is a complex biological process involving a variety of locally produced molecules, as well as different types of white blood cells. Some of the so-called inflammatory mediators include cytokines, chemokines, interleukins, prostaglandins, or bioactive lipids, all of which provide protection from infection and foreign substances, such as bacteria, yeast, viruses or some chemicals. Under some circumstances, however, the organism inappropriately activates the immune system triggering an inflammatory response in the absence of foreign insults thereby leading to the establishment of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, inflammation must be tightly regulated in order to ensure sufficient protection to the organism in the absence of unwanted, and at times dangerous, side effects. Increasing experimental evidence implicates sphingolipids as major inducers of inflammatory responses and regulators of immune cell functions. In particular, ceramides and sphingosine 1-phosphate have been extensively implicated in inflammation, and ceramide 1-phosphate has also been shown to participate in these processes. The present review highlights novel aspects on the regulation of inflammation by sphingolipids, with special emphasis to the role played by ceramide 1-phoshate and ceramide kinase, the enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis, in inflammatory responses.",

     "abstract": "Ceramide is a major molecule among the sphingolipid metabolites which are produced in the brain and other organs and act as intracellular second messengers. Although a variety of physiological roles of ceramide have been reported in the periphery and central nervous systems, the role of ceramide in microglial activation has not been clearly demonstrated. In the present study, we examined the effects of exogenous cell permeable short chain ceramides on microglial activation in vitro and in vivo. We found that C2, C6, and C8 ceramide and C8 ceramide-1-phosphate inhibited iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and rat primary microglia. In addition, the administration of C2 ceramide suppressed microglial activation in the brains of LPS-exposed mice. By HPLC and LC/MS/MS analyses, we found that C2 ceramide on its own, rather than its modified form (i.e. ceramide-1-phosphate or long chain ceramides), mainly work by penetrating into microglial cells. Further mechanistic studies by using the most effective C2 ceramide among the short chain ceramides tested, revealed that C2 ceramide exerts anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of the ROS, MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and Jak/STAT pathways with upregulation of PKA and hemeoxygenase-1 expressions. Interestingly, we found that C2 ceramide inhibits TLR4 signaling by interfering with LPS and TLR4 interactions. Therefore, our data collectively suggests the therapeutic potential of short chain ceramides such as C2 for neuroinflammatory disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",

     "abstract": "The citrate carrier (CIC), a nuclear-encoded protein located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays an important metabolic role in the transport of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondrion to the cytosol in the form of citrate for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Citrate has been reported to be essential for fibroblast differentiation into fat cells. Because peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) is known to be one of the master regulators of adipogenesis, we aimed to study the regulation of CIC by the PPAR\u03b3 ligand rosiglitazone (BRL) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and in adipocytes. We demonstrated that BRL up-regulated CIC mRNA and protein levels in fibroblasts, while it did not elicit any effects in mature adipocytes. The enhancement of CIC levels upon BRL treatment was reversed using the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662, addressing how this effect was mediated by PPAR\u03b3. Functional experiments using a reporter gene containing rat CIC promoter showed that BRL enhanced CIC promoter activity. Mutagenesis studies, electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that upon BRL treatment, PPAR\u03b3 and Sp1 are recruited on the Sp1-containing region within the CIC promoter, leading to an increase in CIC expression. In addition, mithramycin, a specific inhibitor for Sp1-DNA binding activity, abolished the PPAR\u03b3-mediated up-regulation of CIC in fibroblasts. The stimulatory effects of BRL disappeared in mature adipocytes in which PPAR\u03b3/Sp1 complex recruited SMRT corepressor to the Sp1 site of the CIC promoter. Taken together, our results contribute to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which PPAR\u03b3 regulates CIC expression during the differentiation stages of fibroblasts into mature adipocytes.",

Although relevant literature has reported that YY1 expression can induce the down-regulation of C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP-10) and then allow the transactivation of certain transcription factors required for lipogenesis, similar properties of YY1 are poorly understood in animal model systems. In this study, we demonstrate hepatic lipid accumulation in YY1 transgenic zebrafish (GY). Oil-red staining cells were predominantly increased in the livers of both GY larvae and adults, indicating that YY1 functionally promoted lipid accumulation in GY livers. Molecular analysis revealed that YY1 over-expression contributed to the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (TGs) by inhibiting CHOP-10 expression in the juvenile GY and 3 other fish cell lines; the decreased CHOP-10 expression then induced the transactivation of C/EBP-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3\uf020 expression. CHOP-10 morpholino (MO)-injected and rosiglitazone-treated G-liver larvae showed liver steatosis by transactivating PPAR-\u03b3. PPAR-\u03b3 MO-injected, and GW9662- and astaxanthin-treated GY larvae showed no liver steatosis by inhibiting PPAR-\u03b3. Moreover, a fatty acid (FA) accumulation and a TG decrease were found in the liver of aged GY, leading to the induction of FA-oxidizing systems that increased hepatic oxidative stress and liver damage. This study is the first to examine YY1 as a potential stimulator for GY liver steatosis and lipotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "The adsorption of colipase is essential for pancreatic triglyceride lipase activity and efficient dietary fat digestion. Yet, little is known about which specific amino acids in the hydrophobic surface of colipase influence adsorption. In this study, we systematically substituted alanine or tryptophan at residues implicated in adsorption of colipase to an interface. We expressed, purified recombinant colipase mutants and characterized the ability of each alanine mutant to restore activity to lipase in the presence of bile salts. The functions of L16A, Y55A, I79A and F84A colipase were most impaired with activities ranging from 20 to 60% of wild-type colipase. We next characterized the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan mutants in the absence and presence of bile\u2013salt\u2013oleic acid mixed micelles. We performed steady-state emission spectra to determine peak shift and I330/I350 ratio and acrylamide quenching curves to characterize the environment of the residues. The analysis supports a model of adsorption that includes residues Leu 34 and Leu 36 on the 2nd loop, Tyr 55 and Tyr 59 on the 3rd loop and Ile 75 and Ile 79 on the 4th loop. The analysis confirms that Phe 84 is not part of the adsorption surface and likely stabilizes the conformation of colipase. Contrary to the predictions of computer modeling, the results provide strong support for an essential role of Tyr 55 in colipase adsorption to mixed micelles. The results indicate that the adsorption of colipase to mixed micelles is mediated by specific residues residing in a defined surface of colipase.",

However, the mechanism by which ABCG1 mediates cholesterol translocation is unclear. Protein palmitoylation regulates many functions of proteins such as ABCA1. Here we investigated if ABCG1 is palmitoylated and the subsequent effects on ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We demonstrated that ABCG1 is palmitoylated in both human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in mouse macrophage, J774. Five cysteine residues located at positions 26, 150, 311, 390 and 402 in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic region of ABCG1 were palmitoylated. Removal of palmitoylation at Cys311 by mutating the residue to Ala (C311A) or Ser significantly decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. On the other hand, removal of palmitoylation at sites 26, 150, 390 and 402 had no significant effect. We further demonstrated that mutations of Cys311 affected ABCG1 trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, our data suggest that palmitoylation plays a critical role in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux through the regulation of trafficking.",

Early mutagenesis data and structural modeling of enzyme\u2013substrate complexes suggested that Arg403, which is localized at the entrance of the putative substrate binding pocket, might interact with the fatty acid carboxylic group. On the other hand, side-chain of Arg403 is a part of an ionic network with the residues of \u03b12-helix, which undergoes pronounced conformation changes upon inhibitor binding. To explore the role of Arg403 for catalysis in more detail we exchanged positively charged Arg403 to neutral Leu and quantified structural and functional consequences of the alteration at the site of mutation using fluorometric techniques. We found that a loss of electrostatic interaction between Arg403 and negatively charged amino acid residues of \u03b12-helix has only minor impact on protein folding, but partially destabilized the tertiary structure of the enzyme. We hypothesize that interaction of Arg403 with the substrate's carboxylate might be involved in a complex mechanism triggering conformational changes of the \u03b12-helix, which are required for formation of the catalytically competent dimer r12/15-LOX complex at pre-catalytic stages.",

Co-localization experiments demonstrated that SOPG coated GNPs localize in acidic compartments in a time dependent manner and that the number of these increase as the cells are exposed to the GNPs suggesting that they induce formation of lamellar bodies (LBs) which in A549 cells in turn can serve as a means of exporting the GNPs.",

Although the actions of prostaglandins have been extensively studied, little is known about the physiological or pathophysiological effects of prostamides. Since prostaglandin E2 has potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulating actions, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the derivative, prostaglandin E2 ethanolamide (PGE2-EA), could modulate the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 in human blood and human monocytic cells and indicate whether this action involved the same receptor systems/signals as PGE2.Whole human blood, monocytes isolated from the blood or the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was incubated with LPS and the level of TNF-\u03b1 produced was measured by ELISA assay. The actions of PGE2-EA were assessed on the LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 release. In addition, in order to ascertain the receptors involved, the levels of cyclic AMP in cells were measured in monocytes and THP-1 cells in response to PGE2-EA and directly compared to those of PGE2. The effect of PGE2-EA on the binding of radiolabelled PGE2 to cells was also measured. Cells were incubated with radiolabelled arachidonic acid and ethanolamine to estimate the production of PGE2-EA.PGE2-EA potently suppressed TNF-\u03b1 production in blood, monocytes and the cell line THP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. This occurred via cyclic AMP pathways as indicated by agents which interfere with these pathways and also direct ligand binding experiments. It was also shown that the cells were able to endogenously produce PGE2-EA.This study reports that PGE2-EA can downregulate the production of TNF-\u03b1 by human mononuclear cells in response to an immune stimulus, i.e. LPS-activated TLR4, and that this appears to occur via a cAMP-dependent mechanism that most likely involves binding to the EP2 receptor.",

ABCA1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by activation of liver X receptor (LXR). Both etoposide and teniposide are DNA topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitors and are chemotherapeutic medications used in the treatment of various cancers. Interestingly, etoposide inhibits atherosclerosis in rabbits by unclear mechanisms. Herein, we report the effects of etoposide and teniposide on macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. Both etoposide and teniposide increased macrophage free cholesterol efflux. This increase was associated with increased ABCA1 mRNA and protein expression. Etoposide and teniposide also increased ABCA1 promoter activity in an LXR-dependent manner and formation of the LXRE-LXR/RXR complex indicating that transcriptional induction had occurred. Expression of ABCG1 and fatty acid synthase (FAS), another two LXR-targeted genes, was also induced by etoposide and teniposide. In vivo, administration of mice with either etoposide or teniposide induced macrophage ABCA1 expression and enhanced reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages to feces. Taken together, our study indicates that etoposide and teniposide increase macrophage ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux that may be attributed to the anti-atherogenic properties of etoposide. Our study also describes a new function for Topo II inhibitors in addition to their role in anti-tumorigenesis.",

Doxycycline (Dox)-induced expression of cPLA2\u03b1 led to an increase in pAKT, pGSK3\u03b2 and cyclin D1 levels in LNCaP cells that possess a PTEN frame-shift mutation. In contrast, silencing cPLA2\u03b1 expression with siRNA decreased pAKT, pGSK3\u03b2 and cyclin D1 levels in both PC-3 (PTEN deletion) and LNCaP cells. Silencing of cPLA2\u03b1 decreased pERK and AR protein levels. The inhibitory effect of cPLA2\u03b1 siRNA on pAKT and AR protein levels was reduced by the addition of arachidonic acid (AA), whereas the stimulatory effect of AA on pAKT, pERK and AR levels was decreased by an inhibitor of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Pharmacological blockade of cPLA2\u03b1 with Efipladib reduced pAKT and AR levels with a concomitant inhibition of PC-3 and LNCaP cell proliferation.

     "abstract": "In yeast like in many other eukaryotes, fatty acids are stored in the biologically inert form of triacylglycerols (TG) and steryl esters (SE) as energy reserve and/or as membrane building blocks. In the present study, we identified gene products catalyzing formation of TG and SE in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Based on sequence homologies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two diacylglycerol acyltransferases Dga1p and Lro1p and one acyl CoA:sterol acyltransferase Are2p from P. pastoris were identified. Mutants bearing single and multiple deletions of the respective genes were analyzed for their growth phenotype, lipid composition and the ability to form lipid droplets. Our results indicate that the above mentioned gene products are most likely responsible for the entire TG and SE synthesis in P. pastoris. Lro1p which has low fatty acid substrate specificity in vivo is the major TG synthase in this yeast, whereas Dga1p contributes less to TG synthesis although with some preference to utilize polyunsaturated fatty acids as substrates. In contrast to S. cerevisiae, Are2p is the only SE synthase in P. pastoris. Also this enzyme exhibits some preference for certain fatty acids as judged from the fatty acid profile of SE compared to bulk lipids. Most interestingly, TG formation in P. pastoris is indispensable for lipid droplet biogenesis. The small amount of SE synthesized by Are2p in a dga1\u2206lro1\u2206 double deletion mutant is insufficient to initiate the formation of the storage organelle. In summary, our data provide a first insight into the molecular machinery of non-polar lipid synthesis and storage in P. pastoris and demonstrate specific features of this machinery in comparison to other eukaryotic cells, especially S. cerevisiae.",

Overexpression of the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase Sct1p was recently shown to induce a strong increase in the cellular content of palmitate (C16:0). Using stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry, the present study shows that wild type yeast overexpressing Sct1p incorporates excess C16:0 into PC via the methylation of PE, the CDP-choline route, and post-synthetic acyl chain remodeling. Overexpression of Sct1p increased the extent of remodeling of PE-derived PC, providing a novel tool to perform mechanistic studies on PC acyl chain exchange. The exchange of acyl chains occurred at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone of PC, and required the phospholipase B Plb1p for optimal efficiency. Sct1p-catalyzed acyl chain exchange, the acyl-CoA binding protein Acb1p, the Plb1p homologue Plb2p, and the glycerophospholipid:triacylglycerol transacylase Lro1p were not required for PC remodeling.

It is reported that several bacterial sphingolipids composed of ceramide are recognized by CD1-restricted T and NKT cells and that a non-peptide antigen is recognized by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. In this study, we demonstrated that these bacterial SPLs activated murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 but not TLR2, although they slightly activated CD1d-restricted NKT and \u03b3\u03b4T cells.

A non-hydroxy fatty acid composed of ceramide was necessary to activate murine BMMs. The bacterial survival was significantly higher in TLR4-KO mice than in TLR2-KO and wild-type mice.

As such, adipose tissue is capable of extensive expansion or retraction depending on the energy balance or disease state of the host, a plasticity that is unparalleled in other organs and \u2013 under conditions of excessive energy intake \u2013 significantly contributes to the afore mentioned obesity pandemic. Expansion of adipose tissue is driven by both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes, which can renew frequently to compensate for cell death. This underlines the importance of adipocyte progenitor cells within the distinct adipose tissue depots to control both energy storage and endocrine functions of adipose tissue.

     "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has long been thought to be absent or very scarce in human adults so that its contribution to energy expenditure was not considered as relevant. The recent discovery of thermogenic BAT in human adults opened the field for innovative strategies to combat overweight/obesity and associated diseases. This energy-dissipating function of BAT is responsible for adaptive thermogenesis in response to cold stimulation. In this context, adipocytes can be converted, within white adipose tissue (WAT), into multilocular adipocytes expressing UCP1, a mitochondrial protein that plays a key role in heat production by uncoupling the activity of the respiratory chain from ATP synthesis. These adipocytes have been named \u201cbrite\u201d or \u201cbeige\u201d adipocytes. Whereas BAT has been studied for a long time in murine models both in vivo and in vitro, there is now a strong demand for human cellular models to validate and/or identify critical factors involved in the induction of a thermogenic program within adipocytes. In this review we will discuss the different human cellular models described in the literature and what is known regarding the regulation of their differentiation and/or activation process. In addition, the role of microRNAs as novel regulators of brown/\u201cbrite\u201d adipocyte differentiation and conversion will be depicted. Finally, investigation of both the conversion and the metabolism of white-to-brown converted adipocytes is required for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting overweight/obesity and associated diseases.

     "abstract": "The morphological and functional differences between lipid droplets (LDs) in brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues will largely be determined by their associated proteins. Analysing mRNA expression in mice fat depots we have found that most LD protein genes are expressed at higher levels in BAT, with the greatest differences observed for Cidea and Plin5. Prolonged cold exposure, which induces the appearance of brown-like adipocytes in mice WAT depots, was accompanied with the potentiation of the lipolytic machinery, with changes in ATGL, CGI-58 and G0S2 gene expression. However the major change detected in WAT was the enhancement of Cidea mRNA. Together with the increase in Cidec, it indicates that LD enlargement through LD\u2013LD transference of fat is an important process during WAT browning. To study the dynamics of this phenotypic change, we have applied 4D confocal microscopy in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells under sustained \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Under these conditions the cells experienced a LD remodelling cycle, with progressive reduction on the LD size by lipolysis, followed by the formation of new LDs, which were subjected to an enlargement process, likely to be CIDE-triggered, until the cell returned to the basal state. This transformation would be triggered by the activation of a thermogenic futile cycle of lipolysis/lipogenesis and could facilitate the molecular mechanism for the unilocular to multilocular transformation during WAT browning.

     "abstract": "Efficient storage of dietary and endogenous fatty acids is a prerequisite for a healthy adipose tissue function. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the master regulator of fatty acid uptake from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In addition to LPL-mediated fatty acid uptake, adipocytes are able to synthesize fatty acids from non-lipid precursor, a process called de novo lipogenesis (DNL). As the physiological relevance of fatty acid uptake versus DNL for brown and white adipocyte function remains unclear, we studied the role of adipocyte LPL using adipocyte-specific LPL knockout animals (aLKO). ALKO mice displayed a profound increase in DNL-fatty acids, especially palmitoleate and myristoleate in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) depots while essential dietary fatty acids were markedly decreased. Consequently, we found increased expression in adipose tissues of genes encoding DNL enzymes (Fasn, Scd1, and Elovl6) as well as the lipogenic transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein-\u03b2. In a high-fat diet (HFD) study aLKO mice were characterized by reduced adiposity and improved plasma insulin and adipokines. However, neither glucose tolerance nor inflammatory markers were ameliorated in aLKO mice compared to controls. No signs of increased BAT activation or WAT browning were detected in aLKO mice either on HFD or after 1\u00a0week of \u03b23-adrenergic stimulation using CL316,243. We conclude that despite a profound increase in DNL-derived fatty acids, proposed to be metabolically favorable, aLKO mice are not protected from metabolic disease per se. In addition, induction of DNL alone is not sufficient to promote browning of WAT. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Brown and White Fat: From Signaling to Disease.",

     "abstract": "Because of the possible role of brown adipose tissue and UCP1 in metabolic regulation, even in adult humans, there is presently considerable interest in quantifying, from in-vitro data, the thermogenic capacities of brown and brite/beige adipose tissues. An important issue is therefore to establish which parameters are the most adequate for this. A particularly important issue is the relevance of UCP1 mRNA levels as estimates of the degree of recruitment and of the thermogenic capacity resulting from differences in physiological conditions and from experimental manipulations. By solely following UCP1 mRNA levels in brown adipose tissue, the conclusion would be made that the tissue's highest activation occurs after only 6\u00a0h in the cold and then successively decreases to being only some 50% elevated after 1\u00a0month in the cold. However, measurement of total UCP1 protein levels per depot (\"mouse\") reveals that the maximal thermogenic capacity estimated in this way is reached first after 1\u00a0month but represents an approx. 10-fold increase in thermogenic capacity. Since this in-vitro measure correlates quantitatively and temporally with the acquisition of nonshivering thermogenesis, this must be considered the most physiologically relevant parameter. Similarly, observations that cold acclimation barely increases UCP1 mRNA levels in classical brown adipose tissue but leads to a 200-fold increase in UCP1 mRNA levels in brite/beige adipose tissue depots may overemphasise the physiological significance of these depots, as the high fold-increases are due to very low initial levels, and the UCP1 mRNA levels reached are at least an order of magnitude lower than in brown adipose tissue; furthermore, based on total UCP1 protein amounts, the brite/beige depots attain only about 10% of the thermogenic capacity of the classical brown adipose tissue depots. Consequently, inadequate conclusions may be reached if UCP1 mRNA levels are used as a proxy for the metabolic significance of recruited versus non-recruited brown adipose tissue and for estimating the metabolic significance of brown versus brite/beige adipose tissues.

     "abstract": "In all mammals, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are found together in several fat depots, forming a multi-depot organ. Adrenergic stimulation induces an increase in BAT usually referred to as \u201cbrowning\u201d. This phenomenon is important because of its potential use in curbing obesity and related disorders; thus, understanding its cellular mechanisms in humans may be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Data in rodents have supported the direct transformation of white into brown adipocytes. Biopsies of pure white omental fat were collected from 12 patients affected by the catecholamine-secreting tumor pheochromocytoma (pheo-patients) and compared with biopsies from controls. Half of the omental fat samples from pheo-patients contained uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-immunoreactive-(ir) multilocular cells that were often arranged in a BAT-like pattern endowed with noradrenergic fibers and dense capillary network. Many UCP1-ir adipocytes showed the characteristic morphology of paucilocular cells, which we have been described as cytological marker of transdifferentiation. Electron microscopy showed increased mitochondrial density in multi- and paucilocular cells and disclosed the presence of perivascular brown adipocyte precursors. Brown fat genes, such as UCP1, PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) and \u03b23-adrenoreceptor, were highly expressed in the omentum of pheo-patients and in those cases without visible morphologic re-arrangement. Of note, the brown determinant PRDM16 was detected by immunohistochemistry only in nuclei of multi- and paucilocular adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Ki67 suggest an unlikely contribution of proliferative events to the phenomenon. The data support the idea that, in adult humans, white adipocytes of pure white fat that are subjected to adrenergic stimulation are able to undergo a process of direct transformation into brown adipocytes.

These brite (brown in white) adipocytes share characteristics with classical brown adipocytes including a multilocular appearance and the expression of the thermogenic protein uncoupling protein 1. In this study, we compared two inbred mouse strains 129S6sv/ev and C57BL6/N known for their different propensity to diet-induced obesity. We observed transient browning in retroperitoneal and inguinal adipose tissue depots of these two strains. From postnatal day 10 to 20 the increase in the abundance of multilocular adipocytes and uncoupling protein 1 expression was higher in 129S6sv/ev than in C57BL6/N pups. The parallel increase in the mass of the two fat depots was attenuated during this browning period. Conversely, epididymal white and interscapular brown adipose tissue displayed a steady increase in mass during the first 30\u00a0days of life. In this period, 129S6sv/ev mice developed a significantly higher total body fat mass than C57BL6/N. Thus, while on a local depot level a high number of brite cells is associated with the attenuation of adipose tissue expansion the strain comparison reveals no support for a systemic impact on energy balance.

     "abstract": "The role of brown adipose tissue in the regulation of energy balance and maintenance of body weight is well known in rodents. Recently, interest in this tissue has re-emerged due to the realization of active brown-like adipose tissue in adult humans and inducible brown-like adipocytes in white adipose tissue depots in response to appropriate stimuli (\u201cbrowning process\u201d). Brown-like adipocytes that appear in white fat depots have been called \u201cbrite\u201d (from brown-in-white) or \u201cbeige\u201d adipocytes and have characteristics similar to brown adipocytes, in particular the capacity for uncoupled respiration. There is controversy as to the origin of these brite/beige adipocytes, but regardless of this, induction of the browning of white fat represents an attractive potential strategy for the management and treatment of obesity and related complications. Here, the different physiological, pharmacological and dietary determinants that have been linked to white-to-brown fat remodeling and the molecular mechanisms involved are reviewed in detail. In the light of available data, interesting therapeutic perspectives can be expected from the use of specific drugs or food compounds able to induce a program of brown fat differentiation including uncoupling protein 1 expression and enhancing oxidative metabolism in white adipose cells. However, additional research is needed, mainly focused on the physiological relevance of browning and its dietary control, where the use of ferrets and other non-rodent animal models with a more similar adipose tissue organization and metabolism to humans could be of much help.

     "abstract": "We are facing a revival of the strategy to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders by inducing thermogenesis mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Thus, the main focus is on the adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis occurring both in the typical depots of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in UCP1-containing cells that could be induced in white adipose tissue (WAT). Because contribution of WAT to resting metabolic rate is relatively small, the possibility to reduce adiposity by enhancing energy expenditure in classical white adipocytes is largely neglected. However, several pieces of evidence support a notion that induction of energy expenditure based on oxidation of fatty acids (FA) in WAT may be beneficial for health, namely: (i) studies in both humans and rodents document negative association between oxidative capacity of mitochondria in WAT and obesity; (ii) pharmacological activation of AMPK in rats as well as cold-acclimation of UCP1-ablated mice results in obesity resistance associated with increased oxidative capacity in WAT; and (iii) combined intervention using long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated FA (omega 3) and mild calorie restriction exerted synergism in the prevention of obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet; this was associated with strong hypolipidemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, as well as prevention of inflammation, and synergistic induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FA oxidation, specifically in epididymal WAT. Importantly, these changes occurred without induction of UCP1 and suggested the involvement of: (i) futile substrate cycle in white adipocytes, which is based on lipolysis of intracellular triacylglycerols and re-esterification of FA, in association with the induction of mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, \u03b2-oxidation, and energy expenditure; (ii) endogenous lipid mediators (namely endocannabinoids, eicosanoids, prostanoids, resolvins, and protectins) and their cognate receptors; and (iii) AMP-activated protein kinase in WAT. Quantitatively, the strong induction of FA oxidation in WAT in response to the combined intervention is similar to that observed in the transgenic mice rendered resistant to obesity by ectopic expression of UCP1 in WAT. The induction of UCP1-independent FA oxidation and energy expenditure in WAT in response to the above physiological stimuli could underlie the amelioration of obesity and low-grade WAT inflammation, and it could reduce the release of FA from adipose tissue and counteract harmful consequences of lipid accumulation in other tissues. In this respect, new combination treatments may be designed using naturally occurring micronutrients (e.g. omega 3), reduced calorie intake or pharmaceuticals, exerting synergism in the induction of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and stimulation of lipid catabolism in white adipocytes, and improving metabolic flexibility of WAT. The role of mutual interactions between adipocytes and immune cells contained in WAT in tissue metabolism should be better characterised.

     "abstract": "Dysregulation of lipid metabolism underlies many chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Therefore, understanding enzymatic mechanisms controlling lipid synthesis and degradation is imperative for successful drug discovery for these human diseases. Genes encoding \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold domain (ABHD) proteins are present in virtually all reported genomes, and conserved structural motifs shared by these proteins predict common roles in lipid synthesis and degradation. However, the physiological substrates and products for these lipid metabolizing enzymes and their broader role in metabolic pathways remain largely uncharacterized. Recently, mutations in several members of the ABHD protein family have been implicated in inherited inborn errors of lipid metabolism. Furthermore, studies in cell and animal models have revealed important roles for ABHD proteins in lipid metabolism, lipid signal transduction, and metabolic disease. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary surrounding the current state of knowledge regarding mammalian ABHD protein family members. In particular, we will discuss how ABHD proteins are ideally suited to act at the interface of lipid metabolism and signal transduction. Although, the current state of knowledge regarding mammalian ABHD proteins is still in its infancy, this review highlights the potential for the ABHD enzymes as being attractive targets for novel therapies targeting metabolic disease.",

     "abstract": "Current evidence implicates autophagy in the regulation of lipid stores within the two main organs involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis, the liver and adipose tissue. Critical to this role in hepatocytes is the breakdown of cytoplasmic lipid droplets, a process referred to as lipophagy. Conversely, autophagy is required for adipocyte differentiation and the concurrent accumulation of lipid droplets. Autophagy also affects lipid metabolism through contributions to lipoprotein assembly. A number of reports have now implicated autophagy in the degradation of apolipoprotein B, the main structural protein of very-low-density-lipoprotein. Aberrant autophagy may also be involved in conditions of deregulated lipid homeostasis in metabolic disorders such as the metabolic syndrome. First, insulin signalling and autophagy activity appear to diverge in a mechanism of reciprocal regulation, suggesting a role for autophagy in insulin resistance. Secondly, upregulation of autophagy may lead to conversion of white adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue, thus regulating energy expenditure and obesity. Thirdly, upregulation of autophagy in hepatocytes could increase breakdown of lipid stores controlling triglyceride homeostasis and fatty liver. Taken together, autophagy appears to play a very complex role in lipid homeostasis, affecting lipid stores differently depending on the tissue, as well as contributing to pathways of lipoprotein metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a major coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor. In spite of the proven efficacy of statin drugs in reducing CHD burden, there is still much room for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to address the considerable residual cardiovascular risk that remains after treatment with currently available medications. In particular, there is an urgent demand for drugs capable of boosting the concentration and/or function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), thereby promoting reverse cholesterol transport. Phospholipids are naturally occurring fats that play indispensible role in human health via their structural, energy storage, signal transduction and metabolic functions. Supplementation with either purified or mixed preparations of bioactive phospholipids has been reported to ameliorate a range of nutritional and cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, several lines of evidence have supported the efficacy of dietary phospholipids in reducing serum and hepatic contents of cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL-C and apo A-I levels. These beneficial effects of phospholipids could be attributed to their ability in reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption, enhancing biliary cholesterol excretion and modulating the expression and activity of transcriptional factors and enzymes that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism. Given their extreme safety and biocompatibility, dietary supplementation with phospholipid preparations, in particular phosphatidylinositol, appears as a novel and effective strategy that could be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to the current medications. The present review outlines the in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical findings on the anti-dyslipidemic effects of three most abundant phospholipids in the human body and diet namely phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol.",

Although MDR1 shows high ATPase activity, attempts to demonstrate the ATPase activity of human MDR3 have not succeeded. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in the functions of these proteins is caused by their different ATPase activities. To test this hypothesis, a chimera protein containing the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of MDR1 and the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of MDR3 was constructed and analyzed. The chimera protein was expressed on the plasma membrane and conferred resistance against vinblastine and paclitaxel, indicating that MDR3 NBDs can support drug transport. Vanadate-induced ADP trapping of MDR3 NBDs in the chimera protein was stimulated by verapamil as was MDR1 NBDs. The purified chimera protein showed drug-stimulated ATPase activity like MDR1, while its Vmax was more than 10-times lower than MDR1. These results demonstrate that the low ATPase activity of human MDR3 cannot account for the difference in the functions of these proteins, and furthermore, that TMDs determine the features of NBDs. To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the features of human MDR3 NBDs.",

The protective effect of HDL is mostly attributed to their metabolic functions in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process whereby excess cell cholesterol is taken up from peripheral cells and processed in HDL particles, and is later delivered to the liver for further metabolism and bile excretion. We have previously demonstrated that P2Y13 receptor is critical for RCT and that intravenous bolus injection of cangrelor (AR-C69931MX), a partial agonist of P2Y13 receptor, can stimulate hepatic HDL uptake and subsequent lipid biliary secretion without any change in plasma lipid levels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of longer-term treatment with cangrelor on lipoprotein metabolism in mice. We observed that continuous delivery of cangrelor at a rate of 35\u00a0\u03bcg/day/kg body weight for 3\u00a0days markedly decreased plasma HDL-cholesterol level, by increasing the clearance of HDL particles by the liver. These effects were correlated to an increase in the rate of biliary bile acid secretion. An increased expression of SREBP-regulated genes of cholesterol metabolism was also observed without any change of hepatic lipid levels as compared to non-treated mice. Thus, 3-day cangrelor treatment markedly increases the flux of HDL-cholesterol from the plasma to the liver for bile acid secretion. Taken together our results suggest that P2Y13 appears a promising target for therapeutic intervention aimed at preventing or reducing cardiovascular risk.",

     "abstract": "Survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, like most microorganisms, requires switching from a rapidly dividing to a non-dividing or stationary state. To further understand how cells navigate this switch, we examined sphingolipids since they are key structural elements of membranes and also regulate signaling pathways vital for survival. During and after the switch to a non-dividing state there is a large increase in total free and sphingolipid-bound long chain-bases and an even larger increase in free and bound C20-long-chain bases, which are nearly undetectable in dividing cells. These changes are due to intrinsic factors including Orm1 and Orm2, ceramide synthase, Lcb4 kinase and the Tsc3 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase as well as extrinsic factors including glucose and iron. Lowering the concentration of glucose, a form of calorie restriction, decreases the level of LCBs, which is consistent with the idea that reducing the level of some sphingolipids enhances lifespan. In contrast, iron deprivation increases LCB levels and decreases long term survival; however, these phenomena may not be related because iron deprivation disrupts many metabolic pathways. The correlation between increased LCBs and shorter lifespan is unsupported at this time. The physiological rise in LCBs that we observe may serve to modulate nutrient transporters and possibly other membrane phenomena that contribute to enhanced stress resistance and survival in stationary phase.",

     "abstract": "In human high-density lipoprotein (HDL) represents the major cholesterol carrying lipoprotein class in cord blood, while cholesterol is mainly carried by low-density lipoprotein in maternal serum. Additionally, to carrying cholesterol, HDL also associates with a range of proteins as cargo. We tested the hypothesis that fetal HDL carries proteins qualitatively and quantitatively different from maternal HDL. These differences then contribute to distinct HDL functionality in both circulations. Shotgun proteomics and biochemical analyses were used to assess composition/function of fetal and maternal HDL isolated from uncomplicated human pregnancies at term of gestation. The pattern of analyzed proteins that were statistically elevated in fetal HDL (apoE, proteins involved in coagulation, transport processes) suggests a particle characteristic for the light HDL2 sub-fraction. In contrast, proteins that were enriched in maternal HDL (apoL, apoF, PON1, apoD, apoCs) have been described almost exclusively in the dense HDL3 fraction and relevant to its anti-oxidative function and role in innate immunity. Strikingly, PON1 mass and activity were 5-fold lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the fetus, which was accompanied by attenuation of anti-oxidant capacity of fetal HDL. Despite almost equal quantity of CETP in maternal and fetal HDL, its enzymatic activity was 55% lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the fetal circulation, whereas LCAT activity was not altered. These findings indicate that maternally derived HDL differs from fetal HDL with respect to its proteome, size and function. Absence of apoA-1, apoL and PON1 on fetal HDL is associated with decreased anti-oxidative properties together with deficiency in innate immunity collectively indicating distinct HDLs in fetuses.",

     "abstract": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene. Accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) that have been attributed to reduced peroxisomal VLCFA \u03b2-oxidation activity are the hallmark of the disease. Overexpression of ABCD2 gene, the closest homolog of ABCD1, has been shown to compensate for ABCD1, thus correcting the VLCFA derangement. The accumulation of VLCFA leads to a neuroinflammatory disease process associated with demyelination of the cerebral white matter. The present study underlines the importance of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in inducing the expression of ABCD2 (ALDRP), and normalizing the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation as well as the levels of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs in cultured human skin fibroblasts of X-ALD patients. The expression of ELOVL1, the single elongase catalyzing the synthesis of both saturated VLCFA (C26:0) and mono-unsaturated VLCFA (C26:1), was also reduced by CAPE treatment. Importantly, CAPE upregulated Abcd2 expression and peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation and lowered the VLCFA levels in Abcd1-deficient U87 astrocytes and B12 oligodendrocytes. In addition, using Abcd1/Abcd2-silenced mouse primary astrocytes we examined the effects of CAPE in VLCFA-induced inflammatory response. CAPE treatment decreased the inflammatory response as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, inflammatory cytokine, and activation of NF-\u03baB in Abcd1/Abcd2-silenced mouse primary astrocytes was reduced. The observations indicate that CAPE corrects both the metabolic disease of VLCFA as well as secondary inflammatory disease; therefore, it may be a potential drug candidate to be tested for X-ALD therapy in humans.",

In this study, we carried out to precise the effects of CLA isomers, c9,t11 and t10,c12 CLA, on mechanisms of cell death induction in colon cancer cells. We first showed that only t10,c12 CLA treatment (25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h triggered apoptosis in colon cancer cells without affecting viability of normal-derived colon epithelial cells. Exposure of colon cancer cells to t10,c12 CLA activated ER stress characterized by induction of eIF2\u03b1 phoshorylation, splicing of Xbp1 mRNA and CHOP expression. Furthermore, we evidenced that inhibition of CHOP expression and JNK signaling decreased t10,c12 CLA-mediated cancer cell death. Finally, we showed that CHOP induction by t10,c12 CLA was dependent on ROS production and that the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine reduced CHOP induction-dependent cell death. These results highlight that t10,c12 CLA exerts its cytotoxic effect through ROS generation and a subsequent ER stress-dependent apoptosis in colon cancer cells.",

Here, we investigated the association between cholesterol content, insulin secretion and Ca2\u00a0+ handling in these islets.Isolated islets from both LDLR\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice were used for measurements of insulin secretion (radioimmunoassay), cholesterol content (fluorimetric assay), cytosolic Ca2\u00a0+ level (fura-2AM) and SNARE protein expression (VAMP-2, SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1A). Cholesterol was depleted by incubating the islets with increasing concentrations (0\u201310\u00a0mmol/l) of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD).The first and second phases of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were lower in LDLR\u2212/\u2212 than in WT islets, paralleled by an impairment of Ca2\u00a0+ handling in the former. SNAP-25 and VAMP-2, but not syntaxin-1A, were reduced in LDLR\u2212/\u2212 compared with WT islets. Removal of excess cholesterol from LDLR\u2212/\u2212 islets normalized glucose- and tolbutamide-induced insulin release. Glucose-stimulated Ca2\u00a0+ handling was also normalized in cholesterol-depleted LDLR\u2212/\u2212 islets. Cholesterol removal from WT islets by 0.1 and 1.0\u00a0mmol/l M\u03b2CD impaired both GSIS and Ca2\u00a0+ handling. In addition, at 10\u00a0mmol/l M\u03b2CD WT islet showed a loss of membrane integrity and higher DNA fragmentation.Abnormally high (LDLR\u2212/\u2212 islets) or low cholesterol content (WT islets treated with M\u03b2CD) alters both GSIS and Ca2\u00a0+ handling.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq1\u2013coq9 mutants have defects in Q biosynthesis, lack Q6, are respiratory defective, and sensitive to stress imposed by polyunsaturated fatty acids. The hallmark phenotype of the Q-less yeast coq mutants is that respiration in isolated mitochondria can be rescued by the addition of Q2, a soluble Q analog. Yeast coq10 mutants share each of these phenotypes, with the surprising exception that they continue to produce Q6. Structure determination of the Caulobacter crescentus Coq10 homolog (CC1736) revealed a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain, a hydrophobic tunnel known to bind specific lipids in other START domain family members. Here we show that purified CC1736 binds Q2, Q3, Q10, or demethoxy-Q3 in an equimolar ratio, but fails to bind 3-farnesyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a farnesylated analog of an early Q-intermediate. Over-expression of C. crescentus CC1736 or COQ8 restores respiratory electron transport and antioxidant function of Q6 in the yeast coq10 null mutant. Studies with stable isotope ring precursors of Q reveal that early Q-biosynthetic intermediates accumulate in the coq10 mutant and de novo Q-biosynthesis is less efficient than in the wild-type yeast or rescued coq10 mutant. The results suggest that the Coq10 polypeptide:Q (protein:ligand) complex may serve essential functions in facilitating de novo Q biosynthesis and in delivering newly synthesized Q to one or more complexes of the respiratory electron transport chain.",

     "abstract": "Liver fatty acid binding protein (FABP1) prevents lipotoxicity of free fatty acids and regulates fatty acid trafficking and partition. Our objective is to investigate the transcription factors controlling the human FABP1 gene and their regulation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Adenovirus-mediated expression of multiple transcription factors in HepG2 cells and cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that FOXA1 and PPAR\u03b1 are among the most effective activators of human FABP1, whereas C/EBP\u03b1 is a major dominant repressor. Moreover, FOXA1 and PPAR\u03b1 induced re-distribution of FABP1 protein and increased cytoplasmic expression. Reporter assays demonstrated that the major basal activity of the human FABP1 promoter locates between \u2212\u00a096 and \u2212\u00a0229\u00a0bp, where C/EBP\u03b1 binds to a composite DR1-C/EBP element. Mutation of this element at \u2212\u00a0123\u00a0bp diminished basal reporter activity, abolished repression by C/EBP\u03b1 and reduced transactivation by HNF4\u03b1. Moreover, HNF4\u03b1 gene silencing by shRNA in HepG2 cells caused a significant down-regulation of FABP1 mRNA expression. FOXA1 activated the FABP1 promoter through binding to a cluster of elements between \u2212\u00a0229 and \u2212\u00a0592\u00a0bp, whereas PPAR\u03b1 operated through a conserved proximal element at \u2212\u00a059\u00a0bp. Finally, FABP1, FOXA1 and PPAR\u03b1 were concomitantly repressed in animal models of NAFLD and in human nonalcoholic fatty livers, whereas C/EBP\u03b1 was induced or did not change. We conclude that human FABP1 has a complex mechanism of regulation where C/EBP\u03b1 displaces HNF4\u03b1 and hampers activation by FOXA1 and PPAR\u03b1. Alteration of expression of these transcription factors in NAFLD leads to FABP1 gen repression and could exacerbate lipotoxicity and disease progression.",

     "abstract": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a target of therapeutic intervention for coronary heart disease. Anacetrapib, a potent inhibitor of CETP, has been shown to reduce LDL-cholesterol by 40% and increase HDL-cholesterol by 140% in patients, and is currently being evaluated in a phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial. HDL is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties, however with such large increases in HDL-cholesterol, it is unclear whether CETP inhibition perturbs HDL functionality such as anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether CETP inhibition by anacetrapib affects the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL. HDL was isolated from either hamsters treated with vehicle or anacetrapib for 2\u00a0weeks, or from normal human subjects treated either placebo, 20\u00a0mg, or 150\u00a0mg anacetrapib daily for 2\u00a0weeks. Anacetrapib treatment increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels by 65% and between 48 and 82% in hamsters and humans, respectively. Pre-incubation of human aortic endothelial cells with HDL isolated from both control and anacetrapib treated hamsters suppressed TNF\u03b1 induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin. Similar results were obtained with human HDL samples pre and post treatment with placebo or anacetrapib. Further, HDL inhibited TNF\u03b1-induced MCP-1 secretion, monocyte adhesion and NF-\u03baB activation in endothelial cells, and the inhibition was similar between control and anacetrapib treated groups. These studies demonstrate that anacetrapib treatment does not impair the ability of HDL to suppress an inflammatory response in endothelial cells.",

However, not much is known about how CLA isomers mediate their effect on angiogenesis and vascularization during early placentation. In this paper we demonstrate that cis-9,trans-11(c9,t11)-CLA stimulated the expression of angiopoietin like-4 (ANGPTL4) mRNA and protein accompanied by tube formation in first trimester placental trophoblast cells, HTR8/SVneo whereas the other CLA isomer, trans-10,cis-12 (t10,c12)-CLA had no such effects. c9,t11-CLA however did not stimulate expression of the most potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in these cells. Silencing ANGPTL4 in these cells significantly reduced the stimulatory effect of c9,t11-CLA on tube formation, indicating the involvement of ANGPTL4. In addition, c9,t11-CLA increased the mRNA expression of several pro-angiogenic factors such as fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) in HTR8/SVneo cells. c9,t11-CLA also induced the uptake of docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 (DHA), a stimulator of tube formation in these cells. Triacsin C, an acylCoA synthetase inhibitor, attenuated c9,t11-CLA induced DHA uptake, tube formation and cellular proliferation in HTR8/SVneo cells.Our data suggest that the c9,t11-CLA isomer may regulate angiogenic processes during early placentation via increased expression of ANGPTL4 and other pro-angiogenic factors such as FABP4, COX-2 and ADRP with concomitant increase in the uptake of DHA in these cells.",

     "publication date": "04-2013",
     "abstract": "Aims/hypothesis: While lipid deposition in the skeletal muscle is considered to be involved in obesity-associated insulin resistance, neutral intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) accumulation per se does not necessarily induce insulin resistance. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of the lipid droplet coat protein perilipin 2 augments intramyocellular lipid content while improving insulin sensitivity. Another member of the perilipin family, perilipin 5 (PLIN5), is predominantly expressed in oxidative tissues like the skeletal muscle. Here we investigated the effects of PLIN5 overexpression \u2013 in comparison with the effects of PLIN2 \u2013 on skeletal muscle lipid levels, gene expression profiles and insulin sensitivity. Methods: Gene electroporation was used to overexpress PLIN5 in tibialis anterior muscle of rats fed a high fat diet. Eight days after electroporation, insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle was measured by means of a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and lipid extractions were performed to investigate IMCL accumulation. Gene expression profiles were obtained using microarrays. Results: TAG storage and lipid droplet size increased upon PLIN5 overexpression. Despite the higher IMCL content, insulin sensitivity was not impaired and DAG and acylcarnitine levels were unaffected. In contrast to the effects of PLIN2 overexpression, microarray data analysis revealed a gene expression profile favoring FA oxidation and improved mitochondrial function. Conclusions/interpretation: Both PLIN2 and PLIN5 increase neutral IMCL content without impeding insulin-mediated glucose uptake. As opposed to the effects of PLIN2 overexpression, overexpression of PLIN5 in the skeletal muscle promoted expression of a cluster of genes under control of PPAR\u03b1 and PGC1\u03b1 involved in FA catabolism and mitochondrial oxidation.",

Binding of the peptides to LPS and LTA was monitored by CD spectroscopy. Effect of the peptides on the biological activity of lipids was studied by monitoring the inhibition of LPS- or LTA-induced up-regulation of the inflammatory markers in the human blood cells.

     "abstract": "Prostaglandin H synthases (PGHSs) have been identified in the majority of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, and most recently in the red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla. Here we report on the cloning, expression and characterization of the algal PGHS, which shares only about 20% of the amino acid sequence identity with its animal counterparts, yet catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin-endoperoxides, PGG2 and PGH2. The algal PGHS lacks structural elements identified in all known animal PGHSs, such as epidermal growth factor-like domain and helix B in the membrane binding domain. The key residues of animal PGHS, like catalytic Tyr-385 and heme liganding His-388 are conserved in the algal enzyme. However, the amino acid residues shown to be important for substrate binding and coordination, and the target residues for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Arg-120, Tyr-355, and Ser-530) are not found at the appropriate positions in the algal sequences. Differently from animal PGHSs the G. vermiculophylla PGHS easily expresses in Escherichia coli as a fully functional enzyme. The recombinant protein was identified as an oligomeric (evidently tetrameric) ferric heme protein. The preferred substrate for the algal PGHS is arachidonic acid with cyclooxygenase reaction rate remarkably higher than values reported for mammalian PGHS isoforms. Similarly to animal PGHS-2, the algal enzyme is capable of metabolizing ester and amide derivatives of arachidonic acid to corresponding prostaglandin products. Algal PGHS is not inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A single copy of intron-free gene encoding for PGHS was identified in the red algae G. vermiculophylla and Coccotylus truncatus genomes.",

To validate the novel method, a wide screening of viral lipids has been performed analysing highly purified intact bacterial and archaeal viruses displaying different virion architectures. Lipid profiles reported here contain all lipids previously detected by mass spectrometry analyses of virus lipid extracts. Novel details on the membrane lipid composition of selected viruses have also been obtained. In addition we show that this technique allows the study of lipid distribution easily in subviral particles during virus fractionation.

We tested whether non-teratogenic VPA analogues might also inhibit Acsl4 catalyzed acylation, and thus have a potential anti-BD action.Rat Acsl4-flag protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the ability of three VPA analogues, propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA), propylisopropylacetamide (PID) and N-methyl-2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxamide (MTMCD), and of sodium butyrate, to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 was quantified using Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics.Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA in vitro was inhibited uncompetitively by PIA, with a Ki of 11.4\u00a0mM compared to a published Ki of 25\u00a0mM for VPA, while PID, MTMCD and sodium butyrate had no inhibitory effect.PIA's ability to inhibit conversion of AA to AA-CoA by Acsl4 in vitro suggests that, like VPA, PIA may reduce AA turnover in brain phospholipids in unanesthetized rats, and if so, may be effective as a non-teratogenic mood stabilizer in BD patients.",

     "abstract": "Although the study of individual phospholipids and their synthesis began in the 1920s first in plants and then mammals, it was not until the early 1960s that Eugene Kennedy using Escherichia coli initiated studies of bacterial phospholipid metabolism. With the base of information already available from studies of mammalian tissue, the basic blueprint of phospholipid biosynthesis in E. coli was worked out by the late 1960s. In 1970s and 1980s most of the enzymes responsible for phospholipid biosynthesis were purified and many of the genes encoding these enzymes were identified. By the late 1990s conditional and null mutants were available along with clones of the genes for every step of phospholipid biosynthesis. Most of these genes had been sequenced before the complete E. coli genome sequence was available. Strains of E. coli were developed in which phospholipid composition could be changed in a systematic manner while maintaining cell viability. Null mutants, strains in which phospholipid metabolism was artificially regulated, and strains synthesizing foreign lipids not found in E. coli have been used to this day to define specific roles for individual phospholipid. This review will trace the findings that have led to the development of E. coli as an excellent model system to study mechanisms underlying the synthesis and function of phospholipids that are widely applicable to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.

     "abstract": "Membrane phospholipid synthesis is a vital facet of bacterial physiology. Although the spectrum of phospholipid headgroup structures produced by bacteria is large, the key precursor to all of these molecules is phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). Glycerol-3-phosphate derived from the glycolysis via glycerol-phosphate synthase is the universal source for the glycerol backbone of PtdOH. There are two distinct families of enzymes responsible for the acylation of the 1-position of glycerol-3-phosphate. The PlsB acyltransferase was discovered in Escherichia coli, and homologs are present in many eukaryotes. This protein family primarily uses acyl\u2013acyl carrier protein (ACP) endproducts of fatty acid synthesis as acyl donors, but may also use acyl-CoA derived from exogenous fatty acids. The second protein family, PlsY, is more widely distributed in bacteria and utilizes the unique acyl donor, acyl-phosphate, which is produced from acyl-ACP by the enzyme PlsX. The acylation of the 2-position is carried out by members of the PlsC protein family. All PlsCs use acyl-ACP as the acyl donor, although the PlsCs of the \u03b3-proteobacteria also may use acyl-CoA. Phospholipid headgroups are precursors in the biosynthesis of other membrane-associated molecules and the diacylglycerol product of these reactions is converted to PtdOH by one of two distinct families of lipid kinases. The central importance of the de novo and recycling pathways to PtdOH in cell physiology suggest that these enzymes are suitable targets for the development of antibacterial therapeutics in Gram-positive pathogens.

Usually, PC can be synthesized in bacteria by either of two pathways, the phospholipid N-methylation (Pmt) pathway or the phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs) pathway. The three subsequent enzymatic methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine are performed by a single phospholipid N-methyltransferase in some bacteria whereas other bacteria possess multiple phospholipid N-methyltransferases each one performing one or several distinct methylation steps. Phosphatidylcholine synthase condenses choline directly with CDP-diacylglycerol to form CMP and PC. Like in eukaryotes, bacterial PC also functions as a biosynthetic intermediate during the formation of other biomolecules such as choline, diacylglycerol, or diacylglycerol-based phosphorus-free membrane lipids. Bacterial PC may serve as a specific recognition molecule but it affects the physicochemical properties of bacterial membranes as well.

     "abstract": "Yeast Pah1p phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) catalyzes the penultimate step in the synthesis of triacylglycerol. PAP plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis by controlling the relative proportions of its substrate phosphatidate and its product diacylglycerol. The cellular amounts of these lipid intermediates influence the synthesis of triacylglycerol and the pathways by which membrane phospholipids are synthesized. Physiological functions affected by PAP activity include phospholipid synthesis gene expression, nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane growth, lipid droplet formation, and vacuole homeostasis and fusion. Yeast lacking Pah1p PAP activity are acutely sensitive to fatty acid-induced toxicity and exhibit respiratory deficiency. PAP is distinguished in its cellular location, catalytic mechanism, and physiological functions from Dpp1p and Lpp1p lipid phosphate phosphatases that utilize a variety of substrates that include phosphatidate. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a major mechanism by which Pah1p PAP activity is regulated. Pah1p is phosphorylated by cytosolic-associated Pho85p\u2013Pho80p, Cdc28p-cyclin B, and protein kinase A and is dephosphorylated by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated Nem1p\u2013Spo7p phosphatase.

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are metabolically related membrane aminophospholipids. In mammalian cells, PS is required for targeting and function of several intracellular signaling proteins. Moreover, PS is asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane. Although PS is highly enriched in the cytoplasmic leaflet of plasma membranes, PS exposure on the cell surface initiates blood clotting and removal of apoptotic cells. PS is synthesized in mammalian cells by two distinct PS synthases that exchange serine for choline or ethanolamine in phosphatidylcholine (PC) or PE, respectively. Targeted disruption of each PS synthase individually in mice demonstrated that neither enzyme is required for viability whereas elimination of both synthases was embryonic lethal. Thus, mammalian cells require a threshold amount of PS. PE is synthesized in mammalian cells by four different pathways, the quantitatively most important of which are the CDP-ethanolamine pathway that produces PE in the ER, and PS decarboxylation that occurs in mitochondria. PS is made in ER membranes and is imported into mitochondria for decarboxylation to PE via a domain of the ER [mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM)] that transiently associates with mitochondria. Elimination of PS decarboxylase in mice caused mitochondrial defects and embryonic lethality. Global elimination of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway was also incompatible with mouse survival. Thus, PE made by each of these pathways has independent and necessary functions. In mammals PE is a substrate for methylation to PC in the liver, a substrate for anandamide synthesis, and supplies ethanolamine for glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors of cell-surface signaling proteins. Thus, PS and PE participate in many previously unanticipated facets of mammalian cell biology. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Phospholipids and Phospholipid Metabolism.",

These include membrane biosynthesis, generation and maintenance of membrane asymmetry, cell and organelle shape determination, phagocytosis, vesicle trafficking, blood coagulation, lipid homeostasis, regulation of membrane protein function, apoptosis, etc. P4-ATPases and ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are the two principal classes of membrane proteins that actively transport phospholipids across cellular membranes. P4-ATPases utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to flip aminophospholipids from the exocytoplasmic (extracellular/lumen) to the cytoplasmic leaflet of cell membranes generating membrane lipid asymmetry and lipid imbalance which can induce membrane curvature. Many ABC transporters play crucial roles in lipid homeostasis by actively transporting phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exocytoplasmic leaflet of cell membranes or exporting phospholipids to protein acceptors or micelles. Recent studies indicate that some ABC proteins can also transport phospholipids in the opposite direction. The importance of P4-ATPases and ABC transporters is evident from the findings that mutations in many of these transporters are responsible for severe human genetic diseases linked to defective phospholipid transport.

     "abstract": "Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes. Cardiolipin acquires a characteristic composition of fatty acids by post-synthetic remodeling, a process that is crucial for cardiolipin homeostasis and function. The remodeling of cardiolipin depends on the activity of tafazzin, a non-specific phospholipid\u2013lysophospholipid transacylase. This review article discusses recent findings that suggest a novel function of tafazzin in mitochondrial membranes. By shuffling fatty acids between molecular species, tafazzin transforms the lipid composition and by doing so supports changes in the membrane conformation, specifically the generation of membrane curvature. Tafazzin activity is critical for the differentiation of cardiomyocytes, in which the characteristic cristae-rich morphology of cardiac mitochondria evolves.

     "abstract": "Lipid droplets are ubiquitous cellular organelles that allow cells to store large amounts of neutral lipids for membrane synthesis and energy supply in times of starvation. Compared to other cellular organelles, lipid droplets are structurally unique as they are made of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids and are separated to the cytosol only by a surrounding phospholipid monolayer. This phospholipid monolayer consists of over a hundred different phospholipid molecular species of which phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant lipid class. However, lipid droplets lack some indispensable activities of the phosphatidylcholine biogenic pathways suggesting that they partially depend on other organelles for phosphatidylcholine synthesis.Here, we discuss very recent data on the composition, origin, transport and function of the phospholipid monolayer with a particular emphasis on the phosphatidylcholine metabolism on and for lipid droplets. In addition, we highlight two very important quantitative aspects: (i) The amount of phospholipid required for lipid droplet monolayer expansion is remarkably small and (ii) to maintain the invariably round shape of lipid droplets, a cell must have a highly sensitive but so far unknown mechanism that regulates the ratio of phospholipid to neutral lipid in lipid droplets.

     "abstract": "Recent studies showed that the phospholipase subunits of Platelet Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) Ib, \u03b11 and \u03b12 partially localize to the Golgi complex and regulate its structure and function. Using siRNA knockdown of individual subunits, we find that \u03b11 and \u03b12 perform overlapping and unique roles in regulating Golgi morphology, assembly, and secretory cargo trafficking. Knockdown of either \u03b11 or \u03b12 reduced secretion of soluble proteins, but neither single knockdown reduced secretion to the same degree as knockdown of both. Knockdown of \u03b11 or \u03b12 inhibited reassembly of an intact Golgi complex to the same extent as knockdown of both. Transport of VSV-G was slowed but at different steps in the secretory pathway: reduction of \u03b11 slowed trans Golgi network to plasma membrane transport, whereas \u03b12 loss reduced endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi trafficking. Similarly, knockdown of either subunit alone disrupted the Golgi complex but with markedly different morphologies. Finally, knockdown of \u03b11, or double knockdown of \u03b11 and \u03b12, resulted in a significant redistribution of kinase dead protein kinase D from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, whereas loss of \u03b12 alone had no such effect. These studies reveal an unexpected complexity in the regulation of Golgi structure and function by PAFAH Ib.

This 22.3\u00a0kDa protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria associated membranes of liver. The supply of the substrates AdoMet and phosphatidylethanolamine, and the product AdoHcy, can regulate the activity of PEMT. Estrogen has been identified as a positive activator, and Sp1 as a negative regulator, of transcription of the PEMT gene. Targeted inactivation of the PEMT gene produced mice that had a mild phenotype when fed a chow diet. However, when Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed a choline-deficient diet steatohepatitis and liver failure developed after 3\u00a0days. The steatohepatitis was due to a decreased ratio of PC to phosphatidylethanolamine that caused leakage from the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited attenuated secretion of very low-density lipoproteins and homocysteine. Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice bred with mice that lacked the low-density lipoprotein receptor, or apolipoprotein E were protected from high fat/high cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected from high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance compared to wildtype mice. If the diet were supplemented with additional choline, the protection against obesity/insulin resistance in Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice was eliminated. Humans with a Val-to-Met substitution in PEMT at residue 175 may have increased susceptibility to nonalcoholic liver disease.

     "abstract": "Recessively-inherited deficiency in the catalytic activity of calcium-independent phospholipase A2-beta (iPLA2\u03b2) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE) causes infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and hereditary spastic paraplegia, respectively. Thus, these two related phospholipases have non-redundant functions that are essential for structural integrity of synapses and axons. Both enzymes are expressed in essentially all neurons and also have independent roles in glia. iPLA2\u03b2 liberates sn-2 fatty acid and lysophospholipids from diacyl-phospholipids. Ca2\u00a0+-calmodulin tonically-inhibits iPLA2\u03b2, but this can be alleviated by oleoyl-CoA. Together with fatty acyl-CoA-mediated conversion of lysophospholipid to diacyl-phospholipid this may regulate sn-2 fatty acyl composition of phospholipids. In the nervous system, iPLA2\u03b2 is especially important for the turnover of polyunsaturated fatty acid-associated phospholipid at synapses. More information is required on the interplay between iPLA2\u03b2 and iPLA2\u2010gamma in deacylation of neuronal mitochondrial phospholipids. NTE reduces levels of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) by degrading it to glycerophosphocholine and two free fatty acids. The substrate for NTE may be nascent PtdCho complexed with a phospholipid-binding protein. Protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation enhances PtdCho synthesis and may allow PtdCho accumulation by coordinate inhibition of NTE activity. NTE operates primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum in neuronal soma but is also present in axons. NTE-mediated PtdCho homeostasis facilitates membrane trafficking and this appears most critical for the integrity of axon terminals in the spinal cord and hippocampus. For maintenance of peripheral nerve axons, iPLA2\u03b2 activity may be able to compensate for NTE-deficiency but not vice-versa. Whether agonists acting at neuronal receptors modulate the activity of either enzyme remains to be determined.

     "abstract": "Synthetic alkylphospholipids (ALPs), such as edelfosine, miltefosine, perifosine, erucylphosphocholine and erufosine, represent a relatively new class of structurally related antitumor agents that act on cell membranes rather than on DNA. They selectively target proliferating (tumor) cells, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis, and are potent sensitizers of conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. ALPs easily insert in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and cross the membrane via an ATP-dependent CDC50a-containing \u2018flippase\u2019 complex (in carcinoma cells), or are internalized by lipid raft-dependent endocytosis (in lymphoma/leukemic cells). ALPs resist catabolic degradation, therefore accumulate in the cell and interfere with lipid-dependent survival signaling pathways, notably PI3K-Akt and Raf-Erk1/2, and de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. At the same time, stress pathways (e.g. stress-activated protein kinase/JNK) are activated to promote apoptosis. In many preclinical and clinical studies, perifosine was the most effective ALP, mainly because it inhibits Akt activity potently and consistently, also in vivo. This property is successfully exploited clinically in highly malignant tumors, such as multiple myeloma and neuroblastoma, in which a tyrosine kinase receptor/Akt pathway is amplified. In such cases, perifosine therapy is most effective in combination with conventional anticancer regimens or with rapamycin-type mTOR inhibitors, and may overcome resistance to these agents.

Recent studies have begun to reveal the functional aspects of G0S2 and its protein product in various cellular settings. To date the best-known function of G0S2 is its direct inhibitory capacity on the rate-limiting lipolytic enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL).

     "abstract": "One of the paradigms in cancer pathogenesis is the requirement of a cell to undergo transformation from respiration to aerobic glycolysis \u2013 the Warburg effect \u2013 to become malignant. The demands of a rapidly proliferating cell for carbon metabolites for the synthesis of biomass, energy and redox equivalents, are fundamentally different from the requirements of a differentiated, quiescent cell, but it remains open whether this metabolic switch is a cause or a consequence of malignant transformation. One of the major requirements is the synthesis of lipids for membrane formation to allow for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and cytokinesis. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were indeed found to play a major role in cancer cell proliferation, and most of these enzymes are conserved in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most notably, cancer cell physiology and metabolic fluxes are very similar to those in the fermenting and rapidly proliferating yeast. Both types of cells display highly active pathways for the synthesis of fatty acids and their incorporation into complex lipids, and imbalances in synthesis or turnover of lipids affect growth and viability of both yeast and cancer cells. Thus, understanding lipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae during cell cycle progression and cell proliferation may complement recent efforts to understand the importance and fundamental regulatory mechanisms of these pathways in cancer.",

     "abstract": "Sphingoid base-1-phosphates represent a very low portion of the sphingolipid pool but are potent bioactive lipids in mammals. This study was undertaken to determine whether these lipids are produced in palmitate-treated pancreatic \u03b2 cells and what role they play in palmitate-induced \u03b2 cell apoptosis. Our lipidomic analysis revealed that palmitate at low and high glucose supplementation increased (dihydro)sphingosine-1-phosphate levels in INS-1 \u03b2 cells. This increase was associated with an increase in sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) mRNA and protein levels. Over-expression of SphK1 in INS-1 cells potentiated palmitate-induced accumulation of dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate. N,N-dimethyl-sphingosine, a potent inhibitor of SphK, potentiated \u03b2-cell apoptosis induced by palmitate whereas over-expression of SphK1 significantly reduced apoptosis induced by palmitate with high glucose. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted SphK1 also partially inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate. Inhibition of INS-1 apoptosis by over-expressed SphK1 was independent of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors but was associated with a decreased formation of pro-apoptotic ceramides induced by gluco-lipotoxicity. Moreover, over-expression of SphK1 counteracted the defect in the ER-to-Golgi transport of proteins that contribute to the ceramide-dependent ER stress observed during gluco-lipotoxicity. In conclusion, our results suggest that activation of palmitate-induced SphK1-mediated sphingoid base-1-phosphate formation in the ER of \u03b2 cells plays a protective role against palmitate-induced ceramide-dependent apoptotic \u03b2 cell death.",

     "abstract": "Disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) has been associated with neurological, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The CNS is a closed system with regard to cholesterol homeostasis, as cholesterol-delivering lipoproteins from the periphery cannot pass the blood\u2013brain-barrier and enter the brain. Different cell types in the brain have different functions in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, with astrocytes producing and releasing apolipoprotein E and lipoproteins, and neurons metabolizing cholesterol to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. We present evidence that astrocytes and neurons adopt different mechanisms also in regulating cholesterol efflux. We found that in astrocytes cholesterol efflux is induced by both lipid-free apolipoproteins and lipoproteins, while cholesterol removal from neurons is triggered only by lipoproteins. The main pathway by which apolipoproteins induce cholesterol efflux is through ABCA1. By upregulating ABCA1 levels and by inhibiting its activity and silencing its expression, we show that ABCA1 is involved in cholesterol efflux from astrocytes but not from neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that ABCG1 is involved in cholesterol efflux to apolipoproteins and lipoproteins from astrocytes but not from neurons, while ABCG4, whose expression is much higher in neurons than astrocytes, is involved in cholesterol efflux from neurons but not astrocytes. These results indicate that different mechanisms regulate cholesterol efflux from neurons and astrocytes, reflecting the different roles that these cell types play in brain cholesterol homeostasis. These results are important in understanding cellular targets of therapeutic drugs under development for the treatments of conditions associated with altered cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS.",

In the present study we describe isolation and characterization of LD from the industrial yeast Pichia pastoris. We designed and adapted an isolation procedure which allowed us to obtain this subcellular fraction at high purity as judged by quality control using appropriate marker proteins. Components of P. pastoris LD were characterized by conventional biochemical methods of lipid and protein analysis, but also by a lipidome and proteome approach. Our results show several distinct features of LD from P. pastoris especially in comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. P. pastoris LD are characterized by their high preponderance of triacylglycerols over steryl esters in the core of the organelle, the high degree of fatty acid (poly)unsaturation and the high amount of ergosterol precursors. The high phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylserine of ~\u00a07.5 ratio on the surface membrane of LD is noteworthy. Proteome analysis revealed equipment of the organelle with a small but typical set of proteins which includes enzymes of sterol biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, phosphatidic acid synthesis and non-polar lipid hydrolysis.

     "abstract": "Reduced mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) \u03b2-oxidation can cause accumulation of triglyceride in liver, while intake of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been recommended as a promising novel therapy to decrease hepatic triglyceride content. However, reduced mitochondrial FA \u03b2-oxidation also facilitates accumulation of EPA. To investigate the interplay between EPA administration, mitochondrial activity and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, we investigated the effects of EPA administration to carnitine-deficient mice with impaired mitochondrial FA \u03b2-oxidation. C57BL/6J mice received a high-fat diet supplemented or not with 3% EPA in the presence or absence of 500\u00a0mg\u00a0mildronate/kg/day for 10\u00a0days. Liver mitochondrial and peroxisomal oxidation, lipid classes and FA composition were determined. Histological staining was performed and mRNA level of genes related to lipid metabolism and inflammation in liver and adipose tissue was determined. Levels of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines were measured in plasma. The results showed that mildronate treatment decreased hepatic carnitine concentration and mitochondrial FA \u03b2-oxidation and induced severe triglyceride accumulation accompanied by elevated systemic inflammation. Surprisingly, inclusion of EPA in the diet exacerbated the mildronate-induced triglyceride accumulation. This was accompanied by a considerable increase of EPA accumulation while decreased total n-3/n-6 ratio in liver. However, inclusion of EPA in the diet attenuated the mildronate-induced mRNA expression of inflammatory genes in adipose tissue. Taken together, dietary supplementation with EPA exacerbated the triglyceride accumulation induced by impaired mitochondrial FA \u03b2-oxidation. Thus, further thorough evaluation of the potential risk of EPA supplementation as a therapy for NAFLD associated with impaired mitochondrial FA oxidation is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Despite being banned in the U.S., organochlorine toxins such as DDT are frequently detected in human adipose tissue. The main route of exposure is through the consumption of contaminated foods and subsequent intestinal packaging of DDT into chylomicrons. These chylomicrons, which also contain dietary triacylglycerol (TG), are delivered directly to peripheral tissues without first being metabolized by the liver. The physiological process by which these compounds are delivered from chylomicrons to adipose is not well understood, but is clinically relevant since it bypasses first-pass metabolism. Based on its highly lipophilic nature, it has been assumed that DDT is transferred to peripheral tissues similar to TG; however, this has not been measured. Here, we use the lymph fistula rat to isolate chylomicrons containing both DDT and TG. These chylomicrons are the in vivo DDT delivery vehicle. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we investigated the rate at which DDT transfers from chylomicrons to adipocytes, and mediators of this process. This novel approach closely approximates the in vivo DDT exposure route. We show that: 1) DDT repartitions from chylomicrons to adipocytes, 2) this transport does not require hydrolysis of TG within the chylomicron, and is stimulated by the inhibition of LPL, 3) albumin does not inhibit DDT uptake, 4) DDT dissolved in DMSO does not appropriately mimic in vivo DDT transport; and most importantly, 5) DDT uptake from chylomicrons does not mimic the uptake of TG from the same particles. Understanding these factors is important for designing interventions for human populations exposed to DDT.",

     "abstract": "Many breast cancer cells express aberrantly activated receptor tyrosine kinases and are associated with deregulated phosphorylation of Akt (PKB). They are also often associated with a high level of free monounsaturated (MUFA) and saturated (SFA) fatty acids. We studied the effect of DHA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on these anomalies in a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. Inhibitors of the Akt T308 kinase (PDK1) or S473 kinase (mTORC2, DNA-dependent protein kinase and integrin-linked kinase) and combinations of two of them incompletely inhibited, or even enhanced, the phosphorylation in this cell line. In contrast, it was found that DHA as well as other PUFAs inhibited Akt phosphorylation on T308 after 24\u00a0h. These PUFAs also blocked phosphorylation of S473, although certain omega-6 PUFAs were ineffective. After 48\u00a0h, only DHA inhibited Akt phosphorylation on the both residues. DHA, and other PUFAs though less efficiently, also elevated the expression of a mitochondrial enzyme, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, which catalyzes process necessary for \u03b2-oxidation of PUFAs. These PUFAs were present in the cells at high concentrations and reduced the amount of free and phospholipid-bound MUFAs. DHA most efficiently blocked deregulated cell proliferation while the effects of other PUFAs were moderate. These results suggest that DHA suppressed the growth of the cancer cell through its specifically persistent block of Akt phosphorylation in conjunction with modulation of fatty acid metabolism.",

We show here that nuclear NL were organized into nonpolar domains in the form of nuclear-lipid droplets (nLD). By fluorescent confocal microscopy, representative nLD were observed in situ within the nuclei of rat hepatocytes in vivo and HepG2 cells, maintained under standard conditions in culture, and within nuclei isolated from rat liver. nLD were resistant to Triton X-100 and became stained with Sudan Red, OsO4, and BODIPY493/503. nLD and control cytosolic-lipid droplets (cLD) were isolated from rat-liver nuclei and from homogenates, respectively, by sucrose-gradient sedimentation. Lipids were extracted, separated by thin-layer chromatography, and quantified. nLD were composed of 37% lipids and 63% proteins. The nLD lipid composition was as follows: 19% triacylglycerols (TAG), 39% cholesteryl esters, 27% C, and 15% polar lipids; whereas the cLD composition contained different proportions of these same lipid classes, in particular 91% TAG. The TAG fatty acids from both lipid droplets were enriched in oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. The TAG from the nLD corresponded to a small pool, whereas the TAG from the cLD constituted the main cellular pool (at about 100% yield from the total homogenate). In conclusion, nLD are a domain within the nucleus where NL are stored and organized and may be involved in nuclear lipid homeostasis.",

Fungi of the genus Mortierella can accumulate highly unsaturated lipids in large amounts as lipid droplets.

Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be well suited to investigate biological samples on a micrometre scale. It also has been shown that the degree of unsaturation of lipids can be determined from Raman spectra. We applied micro-Raman spectroscopy to investigate the spatial distribution and composition of lipid vesicles inside intact hyphae. For Mortierella alpina and Mortierella elongata distinct differences in the degree of unsaturation and even the impact of growth conditions are determined from the Raman spectra. In both species we found that the fatty acid saturation in the vesicles is highly variable in the first 600\u00a0\u03bcm of the growing hyphal tip and fluctuates towards a constant composition and saturation ratio in all of the remaining mycelium. Our approach facilitates in vivo monitoring of the lipid production and allows us to investigate the impact of cultivation parameters on the oil composition directly in the growing hyphae without the need for extensive extraction procedures.",

However, molecular mechanisms that regulate ceramide-induced embryonic stem cell (ESC) migration are still not well understood. Thus, we investigated the effect of ceramide on migration and its related signal pathways in mouse ESCs. Among ceramide species with different fatty acid chain lengths, C16-Cer increased migration of mouse ESCs in a dose- (\u2265\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM) and time-dependent (\u2265\u00a08\u00a0h) manners, as determined by the cell migration assay. C16-Cer (10\u00a0\u03bcM) increased protein-kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation. Subsequently, C16-Cer increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Paxillin phosphorylation, which were inhibited by PKC inhibitor Bisindolylmaleimide I (1\u00a0\u03bcM). When we examined for the downstream signaling molecules, C16-Cer activated small G protein (Cdc42) and increased the formation of complex with Neural Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASP)/Cdc42/Actin-Related Protein 2/3 (Arp2/3). This complex formation was disrupted by FAK- and Paxillin-specific siRNAs. Furthermore, C16-Cer-induced increase of filamentous actin (F-actin) expression was inhibited by Cdc42-, N-WASP-, and Arp2/3-specific siRNAs, respectively. Indeed, C16-Cer increased cofilin-1/F-actin interaction or F-actin/\u03b1-actinin-1 and \u03b1-actinin-4 interactions in the cytoskeleton compartment, which was reversed by Cdc42-specific siRNA. Finally, C16-Cer-induced increase of cell migration was inhibited by knocking down each signal pathway-related molecules with siRNA or inhibitors. In conclusion, C16-Cer enhances mouse ESC migration through the regulation of PKC and FAK/Paxillin-dependent N-WASP/Cdc42/Arp2/3 complex formation as well as through promoting the interaction between cofilin-1 or \u03b1-actinin-1/-4 and F-actin.",

This strain which was crossed to a wildtype and daughter segregants showed an accumulation of squalene epoxides as well as ergosterol indicating that the mutation entailed a leaky block at ERG7. Upon sequencing the yeast ERG7 gene an A598S alteration was found in a conserved alpha helical region. We theorize that this mutation stabilizes Erg7p in a conformation that mimics Erg27p binding. This mutation, while decreasing OSC activity still retains sufficient residual OSC activity such that the strain in the presence of the mammalian 3-keto reductase enzyme functions and no longer requires the yeast Erg27p. Because sterol biosynthesis occurs in the ER, a fusion protein was synthesized combining Erg7p and Erg28p, a resident ER protein and scaffold of the C-4 demethyation complex. Both FGerg27 and erg27 strains containing this fusion plasmid and the mouse ERG27 orthologue showed restoration of ergosterol biosynthesis with minimal accumulation of squalene epoxides. These results indicate retention of Erg7p in the ER increases its activity and suggest a novel method of regulation of ergosterol biosynthesis.",

The aim of this work was to identify molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of l-carnitine biosynthesis and availability. Using 3\u2032 RACE, we identified four alternatively polyadenylated Bbox1 mRNAs in rat liver. We utilized a combination of in vitro experiments using hybrid constructs containing the Bbox1 3\u2032 UTR and in vivo experiments on rat liver mRNAs to reveal specificities in the different Bbox1 mRNA isoforms, especially in terms of polyadenylation efficiency, mRNA stability and translation efficiency. This complex maturation process of the Bbox1 mRNAs in the liver was studied on rats fed a high-fat diet. High-fat diet selectively increased the level of three Bbox1 mRNA isoforms in rat liver and the alternative use of polyadenylation sites contributed to the global increase in Bbox1 enzymatic activity and l-carnitine levels. Our results show that the maturation of Bbox1 mRNAs is nutritionally regulated in the liver through a selective polyadenylation process to adjust l-carnitine biosynthesis to the energy supply.",

     "abstract": "Macrophages are centrally involved during atherosclerosis development and are the predominant cell type that accumulates cholesterol in the plaque. Macrophages however, are heterogeneous in nature reflecting a variety of microenvironments and different phenotypes may be more prone to contribute towards atherosclerosis progression. Using primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, we sought to evaluate one aspect of atherogenic potential of different macrophage phenotypes by determining their propensity to associate with and accumulate oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Classically-activated macrophages treated simultaneously with interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) associated with less oxLDL and accumulated less cholesterol compared to untreated controls. The combined treatment of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 reduced the mRNA expression of CD36 and the expression of both cell surface CD36 and macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) protein. Under oxLDL loaded conditions, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 did not reduce macrophage protein expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) which is known to positively regulate CD36 expression. However, macrophages treated with IFN\u03b3 attenuated the ability of the PPAR\u03b3-specific agonist rosiglitazone from upregulating cell surface CD36 protein expression. Our results demonstrate that the observed reduction of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages treated with IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 following oxLDL treatment was due at least in part to reduced cell surface CD36 and MSR1 protein expression.",

However, if therapies are to be developed, it is essential that our knowledge gained from these systems is translatable to that of human. Here, we have characterized lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in primary human hepatocytes for comparison to rodent primary hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell lines. Primary human hepatocytes were maintained in collagen coated dishes in confluent monolayers for up to 3\u00a0days. We found primary human hepatocytes were viable, underwent lipid synthesis, and were able to secret lipoproteins up to 3\u00a0days in culture. Furthermore, the lipoprotein profile secreted by primary human hepatocytes was comparable to that found in human plasma; this contrasts with primary rodent hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells. We also investigated the pharmacological effects of nicotinic acid (niacin, NA), a potent dyslipidemic drug, on hepatic lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion. We found NA increased the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in primary human hepatocytes, which may potentially explain how NA increases plasma high-density lipoproteins in humans. In conclusion, primary human hepatocytes are a more relevant model to study lipid synthesis and lipoprotein secretion than hepatoma cells or rodent primary hepatocyte models. Further research needs to be done to maintain liver specific functions of primary human hepatocytes in prolonged cultures for these cells to be a viable model.",

However, the detailed mechanism of HDL formation remains unclear; in order to reveal it, chemicals that specifically block each step of HDL formation would be useful. Cyclosporine A inhibits ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, but it is not clear whether this is mediated via inhibition of calcineurin. We analyzed the effects of cyclosporine A and related compounds on ABCA1 function in BHK/ABCA1 cells. Cyclosporine A, FK506, and pimecrolimus inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 of 7.6, 13.6, and 7.0\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. An mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin also inhibited ABCA1, with IC50 of 18.8\u00a0\u03bcM. The primary targets for these drugs were inhibited at much lower concentrations in BHK/ABCA1 cells, suggesting that they were not involved. Binding of [3H] cyclosporine A to purified ABCA1 could be clearly detected. Furthermore, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine, PSC833, inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux with IC50 of 1.9\u00a0\u03bcM, and efficiently competed with [3H] cyclosporine A binding to ABCA1. These results indicate that cyclosporine A and PSC833 inhibit ABCA1 via direct binding, and that the ABCA1 inhibitor PSC833 is an excellent candidate for further investigations of the detailed mechanisms underlying formation of HDL.",

Our previous work has demonstrated that A2AR agonists exhibit atheroprotective effects by increasing expression of reverse cholesterol transport proteins in cultured human macrophages. This study explores the impact of pharmacologic activation/inhibition and gene silencing of A2AR on cholesterol homeostasis in both THP-1 human monocytes/macrophages and primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC).THP-1 human monocytes/macrophages and HAEC exposed to the A2AR-specific agonist ATL313 exhibited upregulation of proteins responsible for cholesterol efflux: the ABCA1 and G1 transporters. Further, activation of A2AR led to upregulation of the cholesterol metabolizing enzyme P450 27-hydroxylase, accompanied by intracellular changes in level of oxysterols. We demonstrate that anti-atherogenic properties of A2AR activation are not limited to the regulation of lipid efflux in vasculature, but include protection from lipid overload in macrophages, particularly via suppression of the CD36 scavenger receptor. The reduced lipid accumulation manifests directly as a diminution in foam cell transformation. In THP-1 macrophages, either A2AR pharmacological blockade or gene silencing promote lipid accumulation and enhance foam cell transformation.Our pre-clinical data provides evidence suggesting that A2AR stimulation by ATL313 has the potential to be a viable therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention, particularly in patients with elevated risk due to immune/inflammatory disorders.",

     "abstract": "Phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2) plays a key role in glycosphingolipid (GSL) production using its C-terminal domain to transport newly synthesized glucosylceramide away from the cytosol-facing glucosylceramide synthase in the cis-Golgi for further anabolic processing. Structural homology modeling against human glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) predicts a GLTP-fold for FAPP2 C-terminal domain, but no experimental support exists to warrant inclusion in the GLTP superfamily. Here, the biophysical properties and glycolipid transfer specificity of FAPP2-C-terminal domain have been characterized and compared with other established GLTP-folds. Experimental evidence for a GLTP-fold includes: i) far-UV circular dichroism (CD) showing secondary structure with high alpha-helix content and a low thermally-induced unfolding transition (~\u00a041\u00a0\u00b0C); ii) near-UV-CD indicating only subtle tertiary conformational change before/after interaction with membranes containing/lacking glycolipid; iii) Red-shifted tryptophan (Trp) emission wavelength maximum (\u03bbmax\u00a0~\u00a0352\u00a0nm) for apo-FAPP2-C-terminal domain consistent with surface exposed intrinsic Trp residues; iv) \u2018signature\u2019 GLTP-fold Trp fluorescence response, i.e., intensity decrease (~\u00a030%) accompanied by strongly blue-shifted \u03bbmax (~\u00a014\u00a0nm) upon interaction with membranes containing glycolipid, supporting direct involvement of Trp in glycolipid binding and enabling estimation of partitioning affinities. A structurally-based preference for other simple uncharged GSLs, in addition to glucosylceramide, makes human FAPP2-GLTP more similar to fungal HET-C2 than to plant AtGLTP1 (glucosylceramide-specific) or to broadly GSL-selective human GLTP. These findings along with the distinct mRNA exon/intron organizations originating from single-copy genes on separate human chromosomes suggest adaptive evolutionary divergence by these two GLTP-folds.",

Import of both endogenous and exogenous PS to IMM was a relatively slow process (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a0several hours), but depended on the acyl chains. In particular, the 38:4 and 38:5 species were imported more efficiently compared to the other PS species. Knock-down of Mitofusin 2 or Mitostatin had no detectable effect on PS import to mitochondria, suggesting that the ER\u2013mitochondria contacts regulated by these proteins are not essential. Knock-down of PS synthase 1 inhibited PS decarboxylation, suggesting that import of PS to mitochondria is coupled to its synthesis. Also the export of PE from IMM to microsomes is a relatively slow process, but again depends markedly on the acyl chain structure. Most notably, the polyunsaturated 38:4 and 38:5 PE species were less efficiently exported, which together with rapid import of the PS precursors most probably explains their enrichment in IMM. PE synthesized via the CDP-ethanolamine was also imported to IMM, but most of the PE in this membrane derives from imported PS. In contrast to PS, all PC species made in Golgi/ER translocated similarly and rapidly to IMM. In conclusion, selective translocation of PS species and PS-derived PE species between ER and mitochondria plays a major role in phospholipid homeostasis of these organelles.",

Here, a modulatory effect of sugars on dolichol and phytosterol profiles was noted in the hairy roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis roots contain a complex dolichol mixture comprising three groups (\u2018families\u2019) of dolichols differing in the chain-length. These dolichols, especially the longest ones are accompanied by considerable amounts of polyprenols of the same length. The spectrum of polyisoprenoid alcohols, i.e. dolichols and polyprenols, was dependent on sugar type (glucose or sucrose) and its concentration in the medium. Among the long-chain dolichols Dol/Pren-20 (dolichol or prenol molecule composed of 20 isoprene residues) and Dol/Pren-23 were the main components at 0.5% and 2% glucose, respectively. Moreover, the ratio of polyprenols versus respective dolichols was also modulated by sugar in this group of polyisoprenoids, with polyprenols dominating at 3% sucrose and dolichols at 2% glucose. Glucose concentration affected the expression level of genes encoding cis-prenyltransferases, enzymes responsible for elongation of the polyisoprenoid chain. The most abundant phytosterols of the A. thaliana roots, \u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, were accompanied by corresponding stanols and traces of brassicasterol, stigmast-4,22-dien-3-one and stigmast-4-en-3-one. Similar to the polyisoprenoids, sterol profile responded to the sugar present in the medium, \u03b2-sitosterol dominating in roots grown on 3% or lower glucose concentrations and stigmasterol in 3% sucrose. These results indicate an involvement of sugar signaling in the regulation of cis-prenyltransferases and phytosterol pathway enzymes.",

Therefore it has been assumed that STARD10 may function in the secretion of phospholipids into the bile. To help elucidate the physiological role of STARD10, we produced Stard10 knockout mice (Stard10\u2212/\u2212) and studied their phenotype. Neither liver content nor biliary secretion of phosphatidylcholine was altered in Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Unexpectedly, the biliary secretion of bile acids from the liver and the level of taurine-conjugated bile acids in the bile were significantly higher in Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice than wild type (WT) mice. In contrast, the levels of the secondary bile acids were lower in the liver of Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that the enterohepatic cycling is impaired. STARD10 was also expressed in the gallbladder and small intestine where the expression level of apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) turned out to be markedly lower in Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice than in WT mice when measured under fed condition. Consistent with the above results, the fecal excretion of bile acids was significantly increased in Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, PPAR\u03b1-dependent genes responsible for the regulation of bile acid metabolism were down-regulated in the liver of Stard10\u2212/\u2212 mice. The loss of STARD10 impaired the PPAR\u03b1 activity and the expression of a PPAR\u03b1-target gene such as Cyp8b1 in mouse hepatoma cells.

LPA signals through six distinct G protein-coupled receptors, acting alone or in concert to activate multiple effector pathways. The ATX\u2013LPA signaling axis is implicated in a remarkably wide variety of physiological and pathological processes and plays a vital role in embryonic development. Disruption of the ATX-encoding gene (Enpp2) in mice results in intrauterine death due to vascular defects in the extra-embryonic yolk sac and embryo proper. In addition, Enpp2 (\u2212/\u2212) embryos show impaired neural development. The observed angiogenic defects are attributable, at least in part, to loss of LPA signaling through the G\u03b112/13-linked RhoA-ROCK-actin remodeling pathway.

These functional roles are due to a family of at least 11 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), named LPA1\u20136 and S1P1\u20135, which are widely distributed throughout the body and that activate multiple effector pathways initiated by a range of heterotrimeric G proteins including Gi/o, G12/13, Gq and Gs, with actual activation dependent on receptor subtypes. In the central nervous system (CNS), a major locus for these signaling pathways, LPA and S1P have been shown to influence myriad responses in neurons and glial cell types through their cognate receptors. These receptor-mediated activities can contribute to disease pathogenesis and have therapeutic relevance to human CNS disorders as demonstrated for multiple sclerosis (MS) and possibly others that include congenital hydrocephalus, ischemic stroke, neurotrauma, neuropsychiatric disorders, developmental disorders, seizures, hearing loss, and Sandhoff disease, based upon the experimental literature. In particular, FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya, Novartis Pharma, AG) that becomes an analog of S1P upon phosphorylation, was approved by the FDA in 2010 as a first oral treatment for MS, validating this class of receptors as medicinal targets. This review will provide an overview and update on the biological functions of LPA and S1P signaling in the CNS, with a focus on results from studies using genetic null mutants for LPA and S1P receptors.

     "abstract": "Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is the simplest phospholipid yet possesses myriad biological functions. Until 2003, the functions of LPA were thought to be elicited exclusively by three subtypes of the endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) family of G protein-coupled receptors \u2014 LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3. However, several biological functions of LPA could not be assigned to any of these receptors indicating the existence of one or more additional LPA receptor(s). More recently, the discovery of a second cluster of LPA receptors which includes LPA4, LPA5, and LPA6 has paved the way for new avenues of LPA research. Analyses of these non-Edg family LPA receptors have begun to fill in gaps to understand biological functions of LPA such as platelet aggregation and vascular development that could not be ascribed to classical Edg family LPA receptors and are also unveiling new biological functions. Here we review recent progress in the non-Edg family LPA receptor research, with special emphasis on the pharmacology, signaling, and physiological roles of this family of receptors.

     "abstract": "Acute inflammatory pain signal originates from transient hypersensitivity in afferent fibers when depolarized via injured tissues or proinflammatory cells-derived pronociceptive ligand binding. This pain is sensitive to opioids and NSAIDs. In neuropathic pain, however, damage to the nerve along the pain pathway results in spontaneous generation of action potential and lowered nociceptive threshold, as seen in allodynia and hyperalgesia. This abnormal pain transmission had been linked to LPA production in the spinal cord, through activation of NMDA and NK1 activation by glutamate and SP in iPLA2/cPLA2/ATX-dependent pathway. In a bifurcated response involving Gq/11 and G12/13 coupling, Schwann cell LPA1 mediates degradation and transcriptional suppression of myelin proteins, respectively. The loss of contact inhibition on axonal growth creates cytoskeletal framework for axonal sprouting. LPA causes an amplification of LPA production through activation of LPA3 signaling in microglia immediately after nerve injury. LPA1 deficient mice (LPA1\u2212/\u2212) show no neuropathic-pain behavior or demyelination in response to intrathecal LPA injection or nerve injury. Given these bodies of research evidence, LPA therefore presents as the chemical signature for the initiation of neuropathic pain.

     "abstract": "High expression of autotaxin in cancers is often associated with increased tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. This is explained mainly since autotaxin produces the lipid growth factor, lysophosphatidate (LPA), which stimulates cell division, survival and migration. It has recently become evident that these signaling effects of LPA also produce resistance to chemotherapy and radiation-induced cell death. This results especially from the stimulation of LPA2 receptors, which depletes the cell of Siva-1, a pro-apoptotic signaling protein and stimulates prosurvival kinase pathways through a mechanism mediated via TRIP-6. LPA signaling also increases the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate, a pro-survival lipid. At the same time, LPA decreases the accumulation of ceramides, which are used in radiation therapy and by many chemotherapeutic agents to stimulate apoptosis. The signaling actions of extracellular LPA are terminated by its dephosphorylation by a family of lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPP) that act as ecto-enzymes. In addition, lipid phosphate phoshatase-1 attenuates signaling downstream of the activation of both LPA receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. This makes many cancer cells hypersensitive to the action of various growth factors since they often express low LPP1/3 activity. Increasing our understanding of the complicated signaling pathways that are used by LPA to stimulate cell survival should identify new therapeutic targets that can be exploited to increase the efficacy of chemo- and radio-therapy.

     "abstract": "LPA and LPA1 have been shown to increase osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation as well as activation of osteoclasts. Cell and animal model studies have suggested that LPA is produced by bone cells and bone tissues. We obtained data from invalidated mice which support the hypothesis that LPA1 is involved in bone development by promoting osteogenesis. LPA1-invalidated mice demonstrate growth and sternal and costal abnormalities, which highlights the specific roles of LPA1 during bone development. Microcomputed tomography and histological analysis demonstrate osteoporosis in the trabecular and cortical bone of LPA1-invalidated mice. Moreover, bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors from these mice displayed decreased osteoblastic differentiation. Infrared analysis did not indicate osteomalacia in the bone tissue of LPA1-invalidated mice. LPA1 displays opposite effects to LPA4 on the related G proteins Gi and Gs, responsible for decrease and increase of the cAMP level respectively, which itself is essential to the control of osteoblastic differentiation. The opposite effects of LPA1 and LPA4 during osteoblastic differentiation support the possibility that new pharmacological agents derived from the LPA pathways could be found and used in clinical practice to positively influence bone formation and treat osteoporosis. The paracrine effect of LPA is potentially modulated by its concentration in bone tissues, which may result from various intracellular and extracellular pathways. The relevance of LPA1 in bone remodeling, as a receptor able to influence both osteoblast and osteoclast activity, still deserves further clarification.

     "abstract": "Bone is a common metastatic site for solid cancers. Bone homeostasis is tightly regulated by intimate cross-talks between osteoblast (bone forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells). Once in the bone microenvironment, metastatic cells do not alter bone directly but instead perturb the physiological balance of the bone remodeling process controlled by bone cells. Tumor cells produce growth factors and cytokines stimulating either osteoclast activity leading to osteolytic lesions or osteoblast function resulting in osteoblastic metastases. Growth factors, released from the resorbed bone matrix or throughout osteoblastic bone formation, sustain tumor growth. Therefore, bone metastases are the sites of vicious cycles wherein tumor growth and bone metabolism sustain each other. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) promotes the growth of primary tumors and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. We have shown that by acting on cancer cells via the contribution of blood platelets and the LPA-producing enzyme Autotaxin (ATX), LPA promotes the progression of osteolytic bone metastases in animal models. In the light of recent reports it would appear that the role of LPA in the context of bone metastases is complex involving multiple sources of lipid combined with direct and indirect effects on target cells. This review will present our current knowledge on the LPA/ATX axis involvement in osteolytic and osteoblastic skeletal metastases and will discuss the potential activity of LPA upstream and downstream metastasis seeding of cancer cells to bone as well as its implication in cancer induced bone pain.

     "abstract": "The simplest signalling lipid Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) elicits pleiotropic actions upon most mammalian cell types. Although LPA has an established role in many biological processes, particularly wound healing and cancer, the function of LPA for human osteoblast (hOB) biology is still unravelling. Early studies, identified in this review, gave a reliable indication that LPA, via binding to one of several transmembrane receptors, stimulated multiple intracellular signalling networks coupled to changes in cell growth, fibronectin binding, maturation and survival. The majority of studies exploring the actions of LPA on hOB responses have done so using the lipid in isolation. Our own research has focussed on the co-operation of LPA with the active vitamin D3 metabolite, 1\u03b125,dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol), in light of a serendipitous discovery that calcitriol, in a serum-free culture setting, was unable to promote hOB maturation. We subsequently learnt that the serum-borne factor co-operating with calcitriol to enhance hOB differentiation was LPA bound to the albumin fraction of whole serum. Recent studies from our laboratory have identified that LPA and calcitriol are a potent pairing for securing hOB formation from their stem cell progeny. Greater understanding of the ability of LPA to influence, for example, hOB growth, maturation and survival could be advantageous in developing novel strategies aimed at improving skeletal tissue repair and regeneration. Herein this review provides an insight into the diversity of studies exploring the actions of a small lipid on a major cell type key to bone tissue health and homeostasis.

     "abstract": "Osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells) and osteoblasts (bone forming cells) play essential roles in skeletal development, mineral homeostasis and bone remodeling. The actions of these two cell types are tightly coordinated, and imbalances in bone formation and resorption can result in disease states, such as osteoporosis. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a potent bioactive phospholipid that influences a number of cellular processes, including proliferation, survival and migration. LPA is also involved in wound healing and pathological conditions, such as tumor metastasis and autoimmune disorders. During trauma, activated platelets are likely a source of LPA in bone. Physiologically, osteoblasts themselves can also produce LPA, which in turn promotes osteogenesis. The capacity for local production of LPA, coupled with the proximity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, leads to the intriguing possibility that LPA acts as a paracrine mediator of osteoblast\u2013osteoclast signaling. Here we summarize emerging evidence that LPA enhances the differentiation of osteoclast precursors, and regulates the morphology, resorptive activity and survival of mature osteoclasts. These actions arise through stimulation of multiple LPA receptors and intracellular signaling pathways. Moreover, LPA is a potent mitogen implicated in promoting the metastasis of breast and ovarian tumors to bone. Thus, LPA released from osteoblasts is potentially an important autocrine and paracrine mediator \u2014 physiologically regulating skeletal development and remodeling, while contributing pathologically to metastatic bone disease.

     "abstract": "Due to its antiapoptotic action, derivatives of the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) provide potential therapeutic utility in diseases associated with programmed cell death. Apoptosis is one of the major pathophysiological processes elicited by radiation injury to the organism. Consequently, therapeutic explorations applying compounds that mimic the antiapoptotic action of LPA have begun. Here we present a brief account of our decade-long drug discovery effort aimed at developing LPA mimics with a special focus on specific agonists of the LPA2 receptor subtype, which was found to be highly effective in protecting cells from apoptosis. We describe new evidence that 2-((3-(1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)propyl)thio)benzoic acid (GRI977143), a prototypic nonlipid agonist specific to the LPA2 receptor subtype, rescues apoptotically condemned cells in vitro and in vivo from injury caused by high-dose \u03b3-irradiation. GRI977143 shows the features of a radiomitigator because it is effective in rescuing the lives of mice from deadly levels of radiation when administered 24\u00a0h after radiation exposure. Our findings suggest that by specifically activating LPA2 receptors GRI977143 activates the ERK1/2 prosurvival pathway, effectively reduces Bax translocation to the mitochondrion, attenuates the activation of initiator and effector caspases, reduces DNA fragmentation, and inhibits PARP-1 cleavage associated with \u03b3-irradiation-induced apoptosis. GRI977143 also inhibits bystander apoptosis elicited by soluble proapoptotic mediators produced by irradiated cells.

Although the three mammalian enzymes (LPP1-3) demonstrate overlapping catalytic activities and substrate preferences in vitro, the phenotypes of mice with targeted inactivation of the Ppap2 genes encoding the LPP enzymes reveal nonredundant functions. A specific role for LPP3 in vascular development has emerged from studies of mice lacking Ppap2b. A meta-analysis of multiple, large genome-wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in PPAP2B as a novel predictor of coronary artery disease. In this review, we will discuss the evidence that links LPP3 to vascular development and disease and evaluate potential molecular mechanisms.

     "abstract": "Plasticity-related genes (PRGs, Lipid phosphate phosphatase-related proteins LPPRs) are a defined as a subclass of the lipid phosphate phosphatase (LPP) superfamily, comprising so far five brain- and vertebrate-specific membrane-spanning proteins. LPPs interfere with lipid phosphate signaling and are thereby involved in mediating the extracellular concentration and signal transduction of lipid phosphate esters such as lysophosphatidate (LPA) and spingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). LPPs dephosphorylate their substrates through extracellular catalytic domains, thus making them ecto-phosphatases. PRGs/LPPRs are structurally similar to the other LPP family members in general. They are predominantly expressed in the CNS in a subtype specific pattern rather than having a wide tissue distribution. In contrast to LPPs, PRGs/LPPRs may act by modifying bioactive lipids and their signaling pathways, rather than possessing an ecto-phosphatase activity. However, the exact functional roles of PRGs/LPPRs have just begun to be explored. Here, we discuss new findings on the neuron-specific transcriptional regulation of PRG1/LPPR4 and new insights into protein\u2013protein interaction and signaling pathway regulation. Further, we start to shed light on the subcellular localization and the resulting functional modulatory influence of PRG1/LPPR4 expression in excitatory synaptic transmission to the established neural effects such as promotion of filopodia formation, neurite extension, axonal sprouting and reorganization after lesion. This range of effects suggests an involvement in the pathogenesis and/or reparation attempts in disease. Therefore, we summarize available data on the association of PRGs/LPPRs with several neurological and other diseases in humans and experimental animals. Finally we highlight important open questions and emerging future directions of research. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.",

To date, limited numbers of studies have used site directed mutagenesis and activity determinations to examine the roles of individual SK residues in substrate, calmodulin, and membrane binding, as well as activation via phosphorylation. Assays are currently available that allow for both single and bisubstrate kinetic analysis of mutant proteins that show normal, lowered and enhanced activity as compared to wild type controls. Additional studies will be required to build on this foundation to completely understand SK mediated substrate binding and phosphoryl group transfer.

Not only does S1P play a structural role in cells by defining the components of the plasma membrane, but in the last 20\u00a0years it has been implicated in various significant cell signaling pathways and physiological processes: for example, cell migration, survival and proliferation, cellular architecture, cell\u2013cell contacts and adhesions, vascular development, atherosclerosis, acute pulmonary injury and respiratory distress, inflammation and immunity, and tumorogenesis and metastasis [[1], [2]].

     "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid whose actions are essential for many physiological processes including angiogenesis, lymphocyte trafficking and development. In addition, S1P serves as a muscle trophic factor that enables efficient muscle regeneration. This is due in part to S1P's ability to activate quiescent muscle stem cells called satellite cells (SCs) that are needed for muscle repair. However, the molecular mechanism by which S1P activates SCs has not been well understood. Further, strategies for harnessing S1P signaling to recruit SCs for therapeutic benefit have been lacking. S1P is irreversibly catabolized by S1P lyase (SPL), a highly conserved enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of S1P at carbon bond C2\u20133, resulting in formation of hexadecenal and ethanolamine-phosphate. SPL enhances apoptosis through substrate- and product-dependent events, thereby regulating cellular responses to chemotherapy, radiation and ischemia. SPL is undetectable in resting murine skeletal muscle. However, we recently found that SPL is dynamically upregulated in skeletal muscle after injury. SPL upregulation occurred in the context of a tightly orchestrated genetic program that resulted in a transient S1P signal in response to muscle injury. S1P activated quiescent SCs via a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathway, thereby facilitating skeletal muscle regeneration. Mdx mice, which serve as a model for muscular dystrophy (MD), exhibited skeletal muscle SPL upregulation and S1P deficiency. Pharmacological SPL inhibition raised skeletal muscle S1P levels, enhanced SC recruitment and improved mdx skeletal muscle regeneration. These findings reveal how S1P can activate SCs and indicate that SPL suppression may provide a therapeutic strategy for myopathies.

Here we review the role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the regulation of skeletal muscle biology. Indeed, a wealth of experimental data indicate that these molecules are crucial players in the skeletal muscle regeneration process, acting by controllers of activation, proliferation and differentiation not only of muscle-resident satellite cells but also of mesenchymal progenitors that originate outside the skeletal muscle. Moreover, S1P and LPA are clearly involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism, muscle adaptation to different physiological needs and resistance to muscle fatigue. Notably, studies accomplished so far, have highlighted the complexity of S1P and LPA signaling in skeletal muscle cells that appears to be further complicated by their close dependence on functional cross-talks with growth factors, hormones and cytokines. Our increasing understanding of bioactive lipid signaling can individuate novel molecular targets aimed at enhancing skeletal muscle regeneration and reducing the fibrotic process that impairs full functional recovery of the tissue during aging, after a trauma or skeletal muscle diseases.

     "abstract": "Fibrosis is a pathological process characterized by massive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) such as type I/III collagens and fibronectin that are secreted by an expanded pool of myofibroblasts, which are phenotypically altered fibroblasts with more contractile, proliferative, migratory and secretory activities. Fibrosis occurs in various organs including the lung, heart, liver and kidney, resulting in loss of normal tissue architecture and functions. Myofibroblasts could originate from multiple sources including tissue-resident fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells through mechanisms of epithelial/endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT/EndMT), and bone marrow-derived circulating progenitors called fibrocytes. Emerging evidence in recent years shows that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts on several types of target cells and is engaged in pro-fibrotic inflammatory process and fibrogenic process through multiple mechanisms, which include vascular permeability change, leukocyte infiltration, and migration, proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of fibroblasts. Many of these S1P actions are receptor subtype-specific. In these actions, S1P has multiple cross-talks with other cytokines, particularly transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), which plays a major role in fibrosis. The cross-talks include the regulation of S1P production through altered expression and activity of sphingosine kinases in fibrotic lesions, altered expression of S1P receptors, and S1P receptor-mediated transactivation of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. These cross-talks may give rise to a feed-forward, amplifying loop between S1P and TGF\u03b2, and possibly with other cytokines in stimulating fibrogenesis. Another lysophospholipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid has also been recently implicated in fibrosis. The lysophospholipid signaling pathways represent novel, promising therapeutic targets for treating refractory fibrotic diseases.

S1P is released in both ischemic pre- and post-conditioning. Application of exogenous S1P to cultured cardiac myocytes subjected to hypoxia or treatment of isolated hearts either before ischemia or at the onset of reperfusion exerts prosurvival effects. Synthetic congeners of S1P such as FTY720 mimic these responses. Gene targeted mice null for the SK1 isoform whose hearts are subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury exhibit increased infarct size and respond poorly either to ischemic pre- or postconditioning. Measurements of cardiac SK activity and S1P parallel these observations. Experiments in SK2 knockout mice have revealed that this isoform is necessary for survival in the heart. High density lipoprotein (HDL) is a major carrier of S1P, and studies of hearts in which selected S1P receptors have been inhibited implicate the S1P cargo of HDL in cardioprotection. Inhibition of S1P lyase, an endogenous enzyme that degrades S1P, also leads to cardioprotection. These observations have considerable relevance for future therapeutic approaches to acute and chronic myocardial injury.

These GPCRs are quite efficacious in coupling to the G\u03b112/13 family of G-proteins, which stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RhoA. Activated RhoA subsequently regulates downstream enzymes that transduce signals which affect the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, cell proliferation and cell survival. Remarkably many of the enzymes regulated downstream of RhoA either use phospholipids as substrates (e.g. phospholipase D, phospholipase C-epsilon, PTEN, PI3 kinase) or are regulated by phospholipid products (e.g. protein kinase D, Akt). Thus lysophospholipids signal from outside of the cell and control phospholipid signaling processes within the cell that they target. Here we review evidence suggesting an integrative role for RhoA in responding to lysophospholipids upregulated in the pathophysiological environment, and in transducing this signal to cellular responses through effects on phospholipid regulatory or phospholipid regulated enzymes.

     "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic organ that is continuously turned over during growth, even in adults. During bone remodeling, homeostasis is regulated by the balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. However, in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, arthritic joint destruction, and bone metastasis, this equilibrium is disrupted. Since osteoclasts are excessively activated in osteolytic diseases, the inhibition of osteoclast function has been a major therapeutic strategy. It has recently been demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a biologically active lysophospholipid that is enriched in blood, controls the trafficking of osteoclast precursors between the circulation and bone marrow cavities via G protein-coupled receptors, S1PRs. While S1PR1 mediates chemoattraction toward S1P in bone marrow, where S1P concentration is low, S1PR2 mediates chemorepulsion in blood, where the S1P concentration is high. The regulation of precursor recruitment may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling osteoclast-dependent bone remodeling. By means of intravital multiphoton imaging of bone tissues, we have recently revealed that the reciprocal action of S1P controls the migration of osteoclast precursors between bone tissues and blood stream. Imaging technologies have enabled us to visualize the in situ behaviors of different cell types in intact tissues. In this review we also discuss future perspectives on this new method in the field of bone biology and medical sciences in general.

     "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic lipid mediator that acts either on G protein-coupled S1P receptors on the cell surface or via intracellular target sites. In addition to the well established effects of S1P in angiogenesis, carcinogenesis and immunity, evidence is now continuously accumulating which demonstrates that S1P is an important regulator of fibrosis. The contribution of S1P to fibrosis is of a Janus-faced nature as S1P exhibits both pro- and anti-fibrotic effects depending on its site of action. Extracellular S1P promotes fibrotic processes in a S1P receptor-dependent manner, whereas intracellular S1P has an opposite effect and dampens a fibrotic reaction by yet unidentified mechanisms. Fibrosis is a result of chronic irritation by various factors and is defined by an excess production of extracellular matrix leading to tissue scarring and organ dysfunction. In this review, we highlight the general effects of extracellular and intracellular S1P on the multistep cascade of pathological fibrogenesis including tissue injury, inflammation and the action of pro-fibrotic cytokines that stimulate ECM production and deposition. In a second part we summarize the current knowledge about the involvement of S1P signaling in the development of organ fibrosis of the lung, kidney, liver, heart and skin. Altogether, it is becoming clear that targeting the sphingosine kinase-1/S1P signaling pathway offers therapeutic potential in the treatment of various fibrotic processes.

Since it is known that CoCl2 induces cleavage of HuR, we investigated whether there is a link between HuR cleavage and the observed sphingolipid changes in cells exposed to hypoxia, and whether this link is associated with the induction of apoptosis. Exposure of hepatocytes to direct hypoxia by means of a hypoxic chamber resulted in acid sphingomyelinase activation and ceramide elevation. The elevation in ceramide levels was associated with activation of caspase 5 and the subsequent cleavage of HuR and apoptotic cell death. These data raise the possibility that acid sphingomyelinase and caspase 5 are each potential targets for treating hypoxia (ischemia)-induced liver injury.",

     "abstract": "Although triacylglycerol (TAG) stores play a critical role in organisms, mechanisms underlying TAG synthesis are poorly understood in invertebrates. In mammals, the synthesis of glycerolipids, including TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG) and phospholipids (PL), occurs predominantly by the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway in most cell types, except for in enterocytes. In these cells, the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway accounts for the majority of glycerolipid production. The insect Rhodnius prolixus, a vector of Chagas' disease, exhibits a high capacity to produce glycerolipids in the midgut after a blood meal, providing substrates that are transferred to other organs, such as the fat body, which is specialized in TAG production and storage. In this report, the genes required for TAG synthesis were identified in the R. prolixus genome. The genomic data indicated that TAG is synthesized by the G3P pathway, which is the sole pathway for TAG synthesis in this organism. Furthermore, transcription of both the RpGpat and RpDgat genes were upregulated in a diverse number of organs at moments of highest lipid production. In the midgut and fat body, in vitro synthesis of glycerolipids required G3P, but not MAG, as the initial substrate. These results indicate that the G3P pathway is the only route for TAG synthesis in R. prolixus, and its regulation at the transcriptional level can be a determinant of glycerolipid synthesis and TAG formation in insect organs.",

     "abstract": "ORP10/OSBPL10 is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family, and genetic variation in OSBPL10 is associated with dyslipidemias and peripheral artery disease. In this study we investigated the ligand binding properties of ORP10 in vitro as well as its localization and function in human HuH7 hepatocytes. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of ORP10 selectively interacts with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, while the C-terminal ligand binding domain binds cholesterol and several acidic phospholipids. Full-length ORP10 decorates microtubules (MT), while the ORP10 N-terminal fragment (aa 1\u2013318) localizes at Golgi membranes. Removal of the C-terminal aa 712\u2013764 of ORP10 containing a predicted coiled-coil segment abolishes the MT association, but allows partial Golgi targeting. A PH domain-GFP fusion protein is distributed mainly in the cytosol and the plasma membrane, indicating that the Golgi affinity of ORP10 involves other determinants in addition to the PH domain. HuH7 cells expressing ORP10-specific shRNA display increased accumulation of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), but not of albumin, in culture medium, and contain reduced levels of intracellular apoB-100. Pulse-chase analysis of cellular [35S]apoB-100 demonstrates enhanced apoB-100 secretion by cells expressing ORP10-specific shRNA. The apoB-100 secretion phenotype is replicated in HepG2 cells transduced with the ORP10 shRNA lentiviruses. As a conclusion, the present study dissects the determinants of ORP10 association with MT and the Golgi complex and provides evidence for a specific role of this protein in \u03b2-lipoprotein secretion by human hepatocytes.",

We also measured the influence of the culture medium, isolated from macrophages treated with AGE-albumin, on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Methods and results: Macrophages were incubated with control (C) or AGE-albumin in the presence or absence of HDL, followed by incubations with S100B or LPS. Also, culture medium obtained from cells treated with C- or AGE-albumin, following S100B or LPS stimulation was utilized to treat naive macrophages in order to evaluate cholesterol efflux and the expression of HDL receptors. In comparison with C-albumin, AGE-albumin, promoted a greater secretion of cytokines after stimulation with S100B or LPS. A greater amount of cytokines was also produced by macrophages treated with AGE-albumin even in the presence of HDL. Cytokine-enriched medium, drawn from incubations with AGE-albumin and S100B or LPS impaired the cholesterol efflux mediated by apoA-I (23% and 37%, respectively), HDL2 (43% and 47%, respectively) and HDL3 (20% and 8.5%, respectively) and reduced ABCA-1 protein level (16% and 26%, respectively). Conclusions: AGE-albumin primes macrophages for an inflammatory response impairing the RCT. Moreover, AGE-albumin abrogates the anti-inflammatory role of HDL, which may aggravate the development of atherosclerosis in DM.",

Various stimuli have been shown to induce scrambling of phospholipids and thereby exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). In two types of patients, both with aberrant plasma cholesterol levels, we observed an aberrant PS exposure in erythrocytes upon stimulation. We investigated the effect of high and low levels of cholesterol on the ATP-dependent flippase, which maintains phospholipid asymmetry, and the ATP-independent scrambling activity, which breaks down phospholipid asymmetry. We analyzed erythrocytes of a patient with spur cell anemia, characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol, and the erythrocytes of Tangier disease patients with very low levels of plasma cholesterol. In normal erythrocytes, loaded with cholesterol or depleted of cholesterol in vitro, the same analyses were performed. Changes in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of erythrocytes had marked effects on PS exposure upon cell activation. Excess cholesterol profoundly inhibited PS exposure, whereas cholesterol depletion led to increased PS exposure. The activity of the ATP\u2010dependent flippase was not changed, suggesting a major influence of cholesterol on the outward translocation of PS. The effects of cholesterol were not accompanied by eminent changes in cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. These findings emphasize the importance of cholesterol exchange between circulating plasma and the erythrocyte membrane as determinant for phosphatidylserine exposure in erythrocytes.",

We examined MPs from various human cellular sources (human breast cancer, endothelial, red and white blood cells) by flow cytometry using a PE-specific probe, duramycin, and two PS-specific probes, annexin V and lactadherin. PS and PE exposure percentage was comparable on vascular and blood cell-derived MPs (80\u201390% of MP-gated events). However, the percentage of malignant breast cancer MPs exposing PE (~\u00a090%) was significantly higher than PS (~\u00a050%).

Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (sLOX-1) contains non-heme iron and oxidizes 18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 with a large deuterium kinetic isotope effect (D-KIE). The aim of the present work was to obtain further mechanistic insight into the action of these enzymes by using a series of n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 and n\u00a0\u2212\u00a09 fatty acids and by analysis of D-KIE.

A cis-configured double bond in the n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 position therefore seems important for substrate positioning. 8R-DOX oxidized (9Z,12E)18:2 at C-8 in analogy with 18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06, but the 9E,12Z isomer was mainly subject to hydrogen abstraction at C-11 and oxygen insertion at C-9 by 8R-DOX of 5,8-LDS. sLOX-1 and 13R-MnLOX oxidized [11S-2H]18:2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 with similar D-KIE (~\u00a053), which implies that the catalytic metals did not alter the D-KIE.

FXR plays an important role in positively regulating genes (transactivation) involved in bile acid homeostasis, fat and glucose metabolism. Recently, it has become clear that an additional important role for FXR consists of downregulating genes involved in inflammation. Because of this broad spectrum of regulated genes, therapeutically targeting FXR with full agonists will likely result in adverse side effects, in line with what is described for other NRs. It may therefore be necessary to develop selective FXR modulators. However, the molecular mechanisms that distinguish between FXR-mediated transactivation and transrepression are currently unknown. For other NRs, post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation and phosphorylation have been reported to be unique to either transactivation or transrepression. Here, we review current knowledge on post-translational regulation of FXR with respect to transactivation and transrepression. Ultimately, increased understanding of the different mechanisms of transactivation and transrepression of nuclear receptors will aid in the development of NR drugs with fewer side effects.",

     "abstract": "Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) is a known inhibitor of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and some other serine enzymes. MAFP was found here to be an irreversible inhibitor of human pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (HPLRP2), an enzyme displaying lipase, phospholipase A1 and galactolipase activities. In the presence of MAFP, mass spectrometry analysis of HPLRP2 revealed a mass increase of 351\u00a0Da, suggesting a covalent binding of MAFP to the active site serine residue. When HPLRP2 was pre-incubated with MAFP before measuring residual activity, a direct inhibition of HPLRP2 occurred, confirming that HPLRP2 has an active site freely accessible to solvent and differs from most lipases in solution. HPLRP2 activities on tributyrin (TC4), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and monogalactosyl dioctanoylglycerol (C8-MGDG) were equally inhibited under these conditions. Bile salts were not required to trigger the inhibition, but they significantly increased the rate of HPLRP2 inhibition, probably because of MAFP micellar solubilization. Since HPLRP2 is active on various substrates that self-organize differently in the presence of water, HPLRP2 inhibition by MAFP was tested in the presence of these substrates after adding MAFP in the course of the lipolysis reaction. In this case, the rates of inhibition of lipase, phospholipase A1 and galactolipase activities were not equivalent (triglycerides\u00a0>\u00a0PC\u00a0>\u00a0MGDG), suggesting different enzyme/inhibitor partitioning between the aqueous phase and lipid aggregates. The inhibition by MAFP of a well identified phospholipase A1 (HPLRP2), present in pancreatic juice and also in human monocytes, indicates that MAFP cannot be used for discriminating phospholipase A2 from A1 activities at the cellular level.",

     "abstract": "Cells metabolize arachidonic acid (AA) to adrenic acid (AdA) via 2-carbon elongation reactions. Like AA, AdA can be converted into multiple oxygenated metabolites, with important roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, in contrast to AA, there is virtually no information on how the cells regulate the availability of free AdA for conversion into bioactive products. We have used a comparative lipidomic approach with both gas chromatography and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to characterize changes in the levels of AA- and AdA-containing phospholipid species in RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells. Incubation of the cells with AA results in an extensive conversion to AdA but both fatty acids do not compete with each other for esterification into phospholipids. AdA but not AA, shows preference for incorporation into phospholipids containing stearic acid at the sn-1 position. After stimulation of the cells with zymosan, both AA and AdA are released in large quantities, albeit AA is released to a greater extent. Finally, a variety of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol molecular species contribute to AA; however, AdA is liberated exclusively from phosphatidylcholine species. Collectively, these results identify significant differences in the cellular utilization of AA and AdA by the macrophages, suggesting non-redundant biological actions for these two fatty acids.",

     "abstract": "The lipidic metabolite, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP), in its dioctanoyl form (DGPP 8:0), has been described as an antagonist for mammalian lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors LPA1 and LPA3. In this study we show that DGPP 8:0 does not antagonize LPA dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAP kinases but strongly stimulated them in various mammalian cell lines. LPA and DGPP 8:0 stimulation of ERK1/2 occurred through different pathways. The DGPP 8:0 effect appeared to be dependent on PKC, Raf and MEK but was insensitive to pertussis toxin and did not involve G protein activation. Finally we showed that DGPP 8:0 effect on ERK1/2 was dependent on its dephosphorylation by a phosphatase activity sharing lipid phosphate phosphatase properties. The inhibition of this phosphatase activity by VPC32183, a previously characterized LPA receptor antagonist, blocked the DGPP 8:0 effect on ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, down-regulation of lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP1) expression by RNA interference technique also reduced DGPP 8:0-induced ERK1/2 activation. Consistently, over expression of LPP1 in HEK293 cells increases DGPP 8:0 hydrolysis and this increased activity was inhibited by VPC32183. In conclusion, DGPP 8:0 does not exert its effect by acting on a G protein coupled receptor, but through its dephosphorylation by LPP1, generating dioctanoyl phosphatidic acid which in turn activates PKC. These results suggest that LPP1 could have a positive regulatory function on cellular signaling processes such as ERK1/2 activation.",

The physiological role of this enzyme in enterocytes, however, stayed elusive. In the present study we generated mice lacking HSL exclusively in the small intestine (HSLiKO) to investigate the impact of HSL deficiency on intestinal lipid metabolism and the consequences on whole body lipid homeostasis. Chow diet-fed HSLiKO mice showed unchanged plasma lipid concentrations. In addition, feeding with high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC) diet led to unaltered triglyceride but increased plasma cholesterol concentrations and CE accumulation in the small intestine. The same effect was observed after an acute cholesterol load. Gavaging of radioactively labeled cholesterol resulted in increased abundance of radioactivity in plasma, liver and small intestine of HSLiKO mice 4\u00a0h post-gavaging. However, cholesterol absorption determined by the fecal dual-isotope ratio method revealed no significant difference, suggesting that HSLiKO mice take up the same amount of cholesterol but in an accelerated manner. mRNA expression levels of genes involved in intestinal cholesterol transport and esterification were unchanged but we observed downregulation of HMG-CoA reductase and synthase and consequently less intestinal cholesterol biosynthesis. Taken together our study demonstrates that the lack of intestinal HSL leads to CE accumulation in the small intestine, accelerated cholesterol absorption and decreased cholesterol biosynthesis, indicating that HSL plays an important role in intestinal cholesterol homeostasis.",

It degrades important neurotransmitters such as oleamide and anandamide, and it has been involved in a number of human pathological conditions, representing therefore a valuable target for biochemical and pharmacological research. In this study, we have investigated in vitro the structure\u2013function relationship of rat and human FAAHs. In particular circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and light scattering measurements have been performed, in order to characterize the structural features of the two proteins, both in the presence and absence of the irreversible inhibitor methoxyarachidonyl-fluorophosphonate. The results demonstrate that the structural dynamics of the two FAAHs are different, despite their high sequence homology and overall similarity in temperature-dependence. Additionally, membrane binding and kinetic assays of both FAAHs indicate that also the functional properties of the two enzymes are different in their interaction with lipid bilayers and with exogenous inhibitors. These findings suggest that pre-clinical studies of FAAH-dependent human diseases based only on animal models should be interpreted with caution, and that the efficacy of new drugs targeted to FAAH should be tested in vitro, on both rat and human enzymes.",

Activity assays show the importance of PIP2 in determining the specific activity of this enzyme. A FRET stopped flow fluorescence study was carried out to monitor the rapid kinetics of protein binding to model membranes containing POPC/POPS/DOG and eventually PIP2. The results best fitted a binding mechanism in which protein bound to the membrane following a two-phase mechanism with a first bimolecular reaction followed by a slow unimolecular reaction. In the absence of PIP2, the rapid protein binding rate was especially dependent on POPS concentration. Formation of the slow high affinity complex during the second phase seems to involve specific interactions with POPS and DOG since it is only sensitive to changes within relatively low concentration ranges of these lipids. Both the association and dissociation rate constants fell in the presence of PIP2. We propose a model in which PKC\u03b1 binds to the membranes via a two-step mechanism consisting of the rapid membrane initial recruitment of PKC\u03b1 driven by interactions with POPS and/or PIP2 although interactions with DOG are involved too. PKC\u03b1 searches on the lipid bilayer in two dimensions to establish interactions with its specific ligands.",

     "abstract": "Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that stimulates the proliferation of many cellular types. We studied the mitogenic potential of AA in rat brown preadipocytes in culture and the signaling pathways involved. AA is a potent mitogen which induces 4-fold DNA synthesis in brown preadipocytes. The AA mitogenic effect increases by NE addition. AA also increases the mitogenic action of different growth factor combinations. Other unsaturated and saturated fatty acids do not stimulate DNA synthesis to the same extent as AA. We analyzed the role of PKC and MEK/MAPK signaling pathways. PKC inhibition by bisindolilmaleimide I (BIS) abolishes AA and phorbol ester stimulation of DNA synthesis and reduces the mitogenic activity of different growth factors in brown preadipocytes. Brown preadipocytes in culture express PKC \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5 and \u03b6 isoforms. Pretreatment with high doses of the phorbol ester PDBu, induces downregulation of PKCs \u03b5 and \u03b4 and reproduces the effect of BIS indicating that AA-dependent induction of DNA synthesis requires PKC activity. AA also activates MEK/MAPK pathway and the inhibition of MEK activity inhibits AA stimulation of DNA synthesis and brown adipocyte proliferation. Inhibition of PKC \u03b4 by rottlerin abolishes AA-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis and MAPK activation, whereas PKC \u03b5 inhibition does not produce any effect. In conclusion, our results identify AA as a potent mitogen for brown adipocytes and demonstrate the involvement of the PDBu-sensitive PKC \u03b4 isoform and MEK/MAPK pathway in AA-induced proliferation of brown adipocytes. Increased proliferative activity might increase the thermogenic capacity of brown fat.",

     "abstract": "The ruminant trans fatty acid vaccenic acid (tVA) favorably alters markers of inflammation. However, it is not yet clear whether these effects are attributed to its endogenous partial conversion to c9,t11-CLA, which is known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. We compared the cytokine reducing potential of tVA to c9,t11-CLA in human T-helper (Th) cells as a main source of cytokine production during inflammation. Secondly, we assessed whether a bioconversion of tVA to c9,t11-CLA via stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) encoded activity takes place in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in order to relate the outcomes of intracellular cytokine measurement to the degree of conversion. TVA reduced the percentage of both IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 expressing Th cells significantly, but to a lesser extent compared to c9,t11-CLA, as determined by flow cytometry after alloreactive stimulation of PBMC. Pre-treatment with the selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist T0070907 largely re-established the IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 positive Th cell population in both tVA and c9,t11-CLA treated cultures. Interestingly, while the portion of tVA dose-dependently increased within the cellular lipid fraction, the initially marginal amount of c9,t11-CLA remained unaltered. However, SCD mRNA although abundantly expressed in PBMC was not regulated by tVA. Conclusively, these results suggest that the cytokine reducing effect of tVA in human T cells is independent of c9,t11-CLA, since no bioconversion occurred. Moreover, the data provide evidence that tVA mechanistically acts in a manner similar to c9,t11-CLA.",

To clarify aspects of this difference we have compared the metabolism of oleic (OA, monounsaturated) and palmitic acids (PA, saturated) in human myotubes. Human myotubes were treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcM OA or PA and the metabolism of [14C]-labeled fatty acid was studied. We observed that PA had a lower lipolysis rate than OA, despite a more than two-fold higher protein level of adipose triglyceride lipase after 24\u00a0h incubation with PA. PA was less incorporated into triacylglycerol and more incorporated into phospholipids after 24\u00a0h. Supporting this, incubation with compounds modifying lipolysis and reesterification pathways suggested a less influenced PA than OA metabolism. In addition, PA showed a lower accumulation than OA, though PA was oxidized to a relatively higher extent than OA. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that 24\u00a0h of PA treatment upregulated lipogenesis and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and downregulated oxidative phosphorylation compared to OA. The differences in lipid accumulation and lipolysis between OA and PA were eliminated in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid). In conclusion, this study reveals that the two most abundant fatty acids in our diet are partitioned toward different metabolic pathways in muscle cells, and this may be relevant to understand the link between dietary fat and skeletal muscle insulin resistance.",

It acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC, E.C 3.5.1.98) inhibitor, and the interaction of the two enantiomers of 9-HSA with the catalytic site of the enzyme, investigated by using a molecular modelling approach, has been reported to be different. In this work we tested out this prediction by synthesizing the two enantiomers (R)-9-HSA (R-9) and (S)-9-HSA (S-9) starting from the natural source methyl dimorphecolate obtained from Dimorphotheca sinuata seeds and investigating their biological activity in HT29 cells. Both enantiomers inhibit the enzymatic activity of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3, R-9 being more active; R-9 and S-9 inhibitory effect induces an increase in histone H4 acetylation. We also demonstrate that the antiproliferative effect brought about by R-9 is more pronounced as well as we observe increase of p21 transcription and protein content, while the expression of cyclin D1 is decreased. Starting from these observations it can be hypothesized that the interaction of R-9 with HDAC1 induce conformational changes in the enzyme causing loss of its interaction with other proteins, like cyclin D1 itself.",

     "abstract": "The carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane, belongs to the carnitine-dependent system of fatty acid transport into mitochondria, where beta-oxidation occurs. CACT exchanges cytosolic acylcarnitine or free carnitine for carnitine in the mitochondrial matrix. The object of this study was to investigate in rat liver the effect, if any, of diets enriched with saturated fatty acids (beef tallow, BT, the control), n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (fish oil, FO), n\u00a0\u2212\u00a06 PUFA (safflower oil, SO), and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (olive oil, OO) on the activity and expression of CACT. Translocase exchange rates increased, in parallel with CACT mRNA abundance, upon FO-feeding, whereas OO-dietary treatment induced a decrease in both CACT activity and expression. No changes were observed upon SO-feeding. Nuclear run-on assay revealed that FO-treatment increased the transcriptional rate of CACT mRNA. On the other hand, only in the nuclei of hepatocytes from OO-fed rats splicing of the last intron of CACT pre-mRNA and the rate of formation of the 3\u2032-end were affected. Overall, these findings suggest that compared to the BT\u2010enriched diet, the SO-enriched diet did not influence CACT activity and expression, whereas FO- and OO-feeding alters CACT activity in an opposite fashion, i.e. modulating its expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively.",

How this enzyme is regulated transcriptionally by sterols is currently unclear. Some studies have suggested that its expression is regulated by Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) while another suggests it is through the Liver X Receptor (LXR). However, these transcription factors have opposing effects on cellular sterol levels, so it is likely that one predominates. Here we establish that sterol regulation of DHCR24 occurs predominantly through SREBP-2, and identify the particular region of the DHCR24 promoter to which SREBP-2 binds. We demonstrate that sterol regulation is mediated by two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter of the gene, assisted by two nearby NF-Y binding sites. Moreover, we present evidence that the dual SREs work cooperatively to regulate DHCR24 expression by comparison to two known SREBP target genes, the LDL receptor with one SRE, and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, with two SREs.",

     "abstract": "Angiogenesis plays remarkable roles in the development of atherosclerotic rupture plaques. However, its essential mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether inhibitor of DNA binding-1 or inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) promoted angiogenesis when exposed to oxidised low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and to determine the molecular mechanism involved. Using aortic ring assay and tube formation assay as a model system, a low concentration of oxLDL was found to induce angiogenic sprouting and capillary lumen formation of endothelial cell. But the Id1 expression was significantly upregulated by oxLDL at low and high concentrations. The Id1 was localised in the nuclei of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the control group and in the high-concentration oxLDL group. Id1 was translocated to the cytoplasm at low oxLDL concentrations. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling at low oxLDL concentration was inhibited by treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. Protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 promoted nuclear export of Id1, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 reduced the nuclear export of Id1. PI3K inhibition blocked oxLDL-induced angiogenesis. Low concentrations of oxLDL promoted angiogenic sprouting and capillary formation. And this process depends on nuclear export of Id1, which in turn is controlled by the PI3K pathway. This report presents a new link between oxLDL and Id1 localisation, and may provide a new insight into the interactions of ox-LDL and Id1 in the context of atherosclerosis.",

     "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is important for clearance of triacylglycerols (TG) from plasma both as an enzyme and as a bridging factor between lipoproteins and receptors for endocytosis. The amount of LPL at the luminal side of the capillary endothelium determines to what extent lipids are taken up. Mechanisms to control both the activity of LPL and its transport to the endothelial sites are regulated, but poorly understood. Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3 and 4 are potential control proteins for LPL, but plasma concentrations of ANGPTLs do not correlate with plasma TG levels. We investigated the effects of recombinant human N-terminal (NT) ANGPTLs3 and 4 on LPL-mediated bridging of TG-rich lipoproteins to primary mouse hepatocytes and found that the NT-ANGPTLs, in concentrations sufficient to cause inactivation of LPL in vitro, were unable to prevent LPL-mediated lipoprotein uptake. We therefore investigated the effects of lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL) on the inactivation of LPL in vitro by NT-ANGPTLs3 and 4 and found that LPL activity was protected by TG-rich lipoproteins. In vivo, postprandial TG protected LPL from inactivation by recombinant NT-ANGPTL4 injected to mice. We conclude that lipoprotein-bound LPL is stabilized against inactivation by ANGPTLs. The levels of ANGPTLs found in blood may not be sufficient to overcome this stabilization. Therefore it is likely that the prime site of action of ANGPTLs on LPL is in subendothelial compartments where TG-rich lipoprotein concentration is lower than in blood. This could explain why the plasma levels of TG and ANGPTLs do not correlate.",

In the present study, using whole-cell patch clamp technique, we have for the first time investigated the effects of the most abundantly produced NAEs, N-stearoylethanolamine (SEA) and N\u2010oleoylethanolamine (OEA), on electric excitability and membrane currents in cardiomyocytes isolated from endocardial, epicardial, and atrial regions of neonatal rat heart. SEA and OEA (1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM) attenuated electrical activity of the myocytes from all regions of the cardiac muscle by hyperpolarizing resting potential, reducing amplitude, and shortening the duration of the action potential. However, the magnitudes of these effects varied significantly depending on the type of cardiac myocyte (i.e., endocardial, epicardial, atrial) with OEA being generally more potent. OEA and to a lesser extent SEA suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner currents through voltage-gated Na+ (VGSC) and L-type Ca2+ (VGCC) channels, but induced variable cardiac myocyte type-dependent effects on background K+ and Cl\u2212 conductance. The mechanisms of inhibitory action of OEA on cardiac VGSCs and VGCCs involved influence on channels' activation/inactivation gating and partial blockade of ion permeation. OEA also enhanced the viability of cardiac myocytes by reducing necrosis without a significant effect on apoptosis. We conclude that SEA and OEA attenuate the excitability of cardiac myocytes mainly through inhibition of VGSCs and VGCC-mediated Ca2+ entry. Since NAEs are known to increase during tissue ischemia and infarction, these effects of NAEs may mediate some of their cardioprotective actions during these pathological conditions.",

Inflammation was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of SIRT1 protein and an increase in PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 mRNA levels. Stimulation of human mature SGBS adipocytes with TNF\u2010\u03b1 caused similar changes in PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and SIRT1 to those reported in obese patients. Unexpectedly, PPAR DNA\u2010binding activity and the expression of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4\u2010target genes was reduced following TNF\u2010\u03b1 stimulation, suggesting that the activity of this transcription factor was inhibited by cytokine treatment.

     "abstract": "Acrosomal exocytosis involves a massive fusion between the outer acrosomal and the plasma membranes of the spermatozoon triggered by stimuli that open calcium channels at the plasma membrane. Diacylglycerol has been implicated in the activation of these calcium channels. Here we report that this lipid promotes the efflux of intraacrosomal calcium and triggers exocytosis in permeabilized human sperm, implying that diacylglycerol activates events downstream of the opening of plasma membrane channels. Furthermore, we show that calcium and diacylglycerol converge in a signaling pathway leading to the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Addition of diacylglycerol promotes the PKC-dependent activation of PLD1. Rescue experiments adding phosphatidic acid or PIP2 and direct measurement of lipid production suggest that both PKC and PLD1 promote PIP2 synthesis. Inhibition of different steps of the pathway was reverted by adenophostin, an agonist of IP3-sensitive calcium channels, indicating that PIP2 is necessary to keep these channels opened. However, phosphatidic acid, PIP2, or adenophostin could not trigger exocytosis by themselves, indicating that diacylglycerol must also activate another factor. We found that diacylglycerol and phorbol ester stimulate the accumulation of the GTP-bound form of Rab3A. Together our results indicate that diacylglycerol promotes acrosomal exocytosis by i) maintaining high levels of IP3 \u2013 an effect that depends on a positive feedback loop leading to the production of PIP2 \u2013 and ii) stimulating the activation of Rab3A, which in turn initiates a cascade of protein interactions leading to the assembly of SNARE complexes and membrane fusion.",

P-gp is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, thereby significantly impairing the systemic absorption of various pharmaceutically active substances. The phospholipid screening performed in this study involved derivatives with different headgroups and fatty acid residues and a number of experimental parameters. For in vitro studies we carried out transport experiments and calcein accumulation assays in Caco-2- and MDCKII mdr1 and wildtype cell lines. The three compounds which displayed significant P-gp inhibition in both assays and in Caco-2 as well as in MDCKII mdr1, consisted of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and either two saturated fatty acid residues of eight (8:0 PC) or ten carbon atoms (10:0 PC), or of two unsaturated docosahexaeonic acid residues (cis-22:6 PC).Supported by P-gp ATPase activity measurements, 8:0 and 10:0 PC were assumed to function as direct P-gp inhibitors interacting with the transporter probably in their monomeric state, whereas a different, as yet unknown mechanism of action applied for cis-22:6 PC.Because of their proven ability to significantly inhibit P-gp in vitro, these phospholipids shall further be elucidated in vivo, whether they may truly serve to increase the bioavailability of orally applied drugs with a P-gp substrate character.",

EGF caused a rapid activation of cPLA2\u03b1 which coincided with a significant increase in cell proliferation. The inhibition of cPLA2\u03b1 activity by pyrrophenone or by antisense oligonucleotide against cPLA2\u03b1 (AS) or inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by indomethacin resulted with inhibition of cell proliferation, that was restored by addition of PGE2. The secreted PGE2 activated both protein kinase A (PKA) and PKB/Akt pathways via the EP2 and EP4 receptors. Either, the PKA inhibitor (H-89) or the PKB/Akt inhibitor (Ly294002) caused a partial inhibition of cell proliferation which was restored by PGE2. But, inhibited proliferation in the presence of both inhibitors could not be restored by addition of PGE2. AS or H-89, but not Ly294002, inhibited CREB activation, suggesting that CREB activation is mediated by PKA. AS or Ly294002, but not H-89, decreased PKB/Akt activation as well as the nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin and cyclin D1 and increased the plasma membrane localization of \u03b2-catenin with E-cadherin, suggesting that these processes are regulated by the PKB pathway. Similarly, Caco-2 cells exhibited cPLA2\u03b1 dependent proliferation via activation of both PKA and PKB/Akt pathways. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the regulation of HT-29 proliferation is mediated by cPLA2\u03b1-dependent PGE2 production.

[1-14C]DPAn-6 was infused intravenously for 5\u00a0min in unanesthetized rats, after which the brain underwent high-energy microwaving, and then was analyzed. The n-3 PUFA deficient compared with adequate diet increased DPAn-6 and decreased DHA concentrations in plasma and brain, while minimally changing brain AA concentration. Incorporation rates of unesterified DPAn-6 from plasma into individual brain phospholipids were increased 5.2\u20137.7 fold, while turnover rates were increased 2.1\u20134.7 fold. The observations suggest that increased metabolism and brain concentrations of DPAn-6 and its metabolites, together with a reduced brain DHA concentration, contribute to behavioral and functional abnormalities reported with dietary n-3 PUFA deprivation in rodents.

     "abstract": "Primary long-chain fatty alcohols are present in a variety of phyla. In eukaryotes, the production of fatty alcohols is catalyzed by fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) enzymes that convert fatty acyl-CoAs or acyl-ACPs into fatty alcohols. Here, we report on the biochemical properties of a purified plant FAR, Arabidopsis FAR6 (AtFAR6). In vitro assays show that the enzyme preferentially uses 16 carbon acyl-chains as substrates and produces predominantly fatty alcohols. Free fatty acids and fatty aldehyde intermediates can be released from the enzyme, in particular with suboptimal chain lengths and concentrations of the substrates. Both acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP could serve as substrates. Transient expression experiments in Nicotiana tabacum showed that AtFAR6 is a chloroplast localized FAR. In addition, expression of full length AtFAR6 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves resulted in the production of C16:0-alcohol within this organelle. Finally, a GUS reporter gene fusion with the AtFAR6 promoter showed that the AtFAR6 gene is expressed in various tissues of the plant with a distinct pattern compared to that of other Arabidopsis FARs, suggesting specialized functions in planta.",

     "abstract": "Alterations in lipid metabolism and in the lipid composition of cellular membranes are linked to the pathology of numerous diseases including cancer. However, the influence of oncogene expression on cellular lipid profile is currently unknown. In this work we analyzed changes in lipid profiles that are induced in the course of ERBB2-expression mediated premature senescence. As a model system we used MCF-7 breast cancer cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of NeuT, an oncogenic ERBB2 variant. Affymetrix gene array data showed NeuT-induced alterations in the transcription of many enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, several of which (ACSL3, CHPT1, PLD1, LIPG, MGLL, LDL and NPC1) could be confirmed by quantitative realtime PCR. A study of the glycerophospholipid and lyso-glycerophospholipid profiles, obtained by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry revealed senescence-associated changes in numerous lipid species, including mitochondrial lipids. The most prominent changes were found in PG(34:1), PG(36:1) (increased) and LPE(18:1), PG(40:7) and PI(36:1) (decreased). Statistical analysis revealed a general trend towards shortened phospholipid acyl chains in senescence and a significant trend to more saturated acyl chains in the class of phosphatidylglycerol. Additionally, the cellular cholesterol content was elevated and accumulated in vacuoles in senescent cells. These changes were accompanied by increased membrane fluidity. In mitochondria, loss of membrane potential along with altered intracellular distribution was observed. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of altered cholesterol and glycerophospholipid patterns in senescence, showing that predominantly mitochondrial lipids are affected and lipid species less susceptible to peroxidation are increased.",

     "abstract": "The oxysterol 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25EC) can affect cholesterol metabolism at multiple points. Previously, we proposed that 24,25EC has an especially significant role in fine-tuning cholesterol synthesis, since it parallels cholesterol production, and without it, acute cholesterol synthesis is exaggerated. 24,25EC is structurally similar to desmosterol, a substrate for the enzyme 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol \u220624-reductase (DHCR24, also called Seladin-1) which catalyzes a final step in cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we reveal a novel mode by which 24,25EC can regulate cholesterol synthesis, by interfering with DHCR24, resulting in the rapid accumulation of the substrate desmosterol, at the expense of cholesterol. This effect was independent of DHCR24 protein levels, and was observed in multiple mammalian cell-lines, including those of hepatic and neuronal origin. Conversely, overexpression of DHCR24 blunted the inhibition by 24,25EC. We also determined that the specificity of this effect was restricted to certain side-chain oxysterols, notably those oxygenated at C-25. Importantly, endogenous levels of 24,25EC, manipulated by genetic and pharmacological methods, were sufficient to reduce DHCR24 activity. Together, our work introduces a novel role for 24,25EC in cholesterol homeostasis, through its rapid inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at DHCR24. Also, our work provides new insights into a little studied area, the post-transcriptional regulation of DHCR24, an important enzyme in human health and disease.",

Mutations in the iPLA2\u03b2 gene, PLA2G6, are associated with dystonia-parkinsonism and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. To understand the role of iPLA2\u03b2 in brain, we applied our in vivo kinetic method using radiolabeled DHA in 4 to 5-month-old wild type (iPLA2\u03b2+/+) and knockout (iPLA2\u03b2\u2212/\u2212) mice, and measured brain DHA kinetics, lipid concentrations, and expression of PLA2, cyclooxygenase (COX), and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. Compared to iPLA2\u03b2+/+ mice, iPLA2\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed decreased rates of incorporation of unesterified DHA from plasma into brain phospholipids, reduced concentrations of several fatty acids (including DHA) esterified in ethanolamine- and serine-glycerophospholipids, and increased lysophospholipid fatty acid concentrations. DHA turnover in brain phospholipids did not differ between genotypes. In iPLA2\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice, brain levels of iPLA2\u03b2 mRNA, protein, and activity were decreased, as was the iPLA2\u03b3 (Group VIB PLA2) mRNA level, while levels of secretory sPLA2-V mRNA, protein, and activity and cytosolic cPLA2-IVA mRNA were increased. Levels of COX-1 protein were decreased in brain, while COX-2 protein and mRNA were increased. Levels of 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX proteins did not differ significantly between genotypes. Thus, a genetic iPLA2\u03b2 deficiency in mice is associated with reduced DHA metabolism, profound changes in lipid-metabolizing enzyme expression (demonstrating lack of redundancy) and of phospholipid fatty acid content of brain (particularly of DHA), which may be relevant to neurologic abnormalities in humans with PLA2G6 mutations.",

Their cell membranes contain cholesterol-rich microdomains called lipids rafts, which participate in numerous signaling cascades. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, pravastatin has several pleiotropic effects and is widely used as secondary prevention treatment after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pravastatin on the organization of cholesterol within monocyte membrane rafts from patients who had suffered myocardial infarction. Monocytes from healthy donors and acute MI patients were cultured with or without 4\u00a0\u03bcM pravastatin. Lipid rafts were extracted by Lubrol WX, caveolae and flat rafts were separated using a modified sucrose gradient. Cholesterol level and caveolin-1 expression in lipid rafts were determined. In healthy donors, cholesterol was concentrated in flat rafts (63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 vs 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). While monocytes from MI patients presented similar cholesterol distribution in both caveolae and flat rafts. Cholesterol distribution was higher in flat rafts in healthy donors, compared to MI patients (63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 vs 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with less distribution in caveolae (13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 vs 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

In S. cerevisiae, \u03b2-oxidation occurs only in peroxisomes, and H2O2 is generated during this fatty acid-metabolizing pathway. S. cerevisiae has three GPX genes (GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) encoding atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. Here we show that expression of GPX1 was induced in medium containing oleic acid as a carbon source in an Msn2/Msn4-dependent manner. We found that Gpx1 was located in the peroxisomal matrix. The peroxisomal Gpx1 showed peroxidase activity using thioredoxin or glutathione as a reducing power. Peroxisome biogenesis was induced when cells were cultured with oleic acid. Peroxisome biogenesis was impaired in gpx1\u2206 cells, and subsequently, the growth of gpx1\u2206 cells was lowered in oleic acid-containing medium. Gpx1 contains six cysteine residues. Of the cysteine-substituted mutants of Gpx1, Gpx1C36S was not able to restore growth and peroxisome formation in oleic acid-containing medium, therefore, redox regulation of Gpx1 seems to be involved in the mechanism of peroxisome formation.",

The COPII coat\u2014comprising Sar1, Sec23/24, Sec13/31\u2014generates transport vesicles that mediate the bulk of protein/lipid export from the ER. The coat exhibits remarkable flexibility in its ability to specifically select and accommodate a large number of cargoes with diverse properties. In this review, we discuss the fundamentals of COPII vesicle production and describe recent advances that further our understanding of just how flexible COPII cargo recruitment and vesicle formation may be. Large or bulky cargo molecules (e.g. collagen rods and lipoprotein particles) exceed the canonical size for COPII vesicles and seem to rely on the additional action of recently identified accessory molecules. Although the bulk of the research has focused on the fate of protein cargo, the mechanisms and regulation of lipid transport are equally critical to cellular survival. From their site of synthesis in the ER, phospholipids, sphingolipids and sterols exit the ER, either accompanying cargo in vesicles or directly across the cytoplasm shielded by lipid-transfer proteins. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to the field in addressing the physiological regulation of COPII vesicle production and the molecular details of how diverse cargoes, both proteins and lipids, are accommodated.

     "abstract": "Next to the protein-based machineries composed of small G-proteins, coat complexes, SNAREs and tethering factors, the lipid-based machineries are emerging as important players in membrane trafficking. As a component of these machineries, lipid transfer proteins have recently attracted the attention of cell biologists for their involvement in trafficking along different segments of the secretory pathway. Among these, the four-phosphate adaptor protein 2 (FAPP2) was discovered as a protein that localizes dynamically with the trans-Golgi network and regulates the transport of proteins from the Golgi complex to the cell surface. Later studies have highlighted a role for FAPP2 as lipid transfer protein involved in glycosphingolipid metabolism at the Golgi complex. Here we discuss the available evidence on the function of FAPP2 in both membrane trafficking and lipid metabolism and propose a mechanism of action of FAPP2 that integrates its activities in membrane trafficking and in lipid transfer.

In particular, phosphoinositides play a critical role in regulating membrane dynamics and vesicular transport. The unique distribution of certain phosphoinositides at specific intracellular membranes makes these molecules uniquely suited to direct organelle-specific trafficking reactions. In this regulatory role, phosphoinositides cooperate specifically with small GTPases from the Arf and Rab families. This review will summarize recent progress in the study of phosphoinositides in membrane trafficking and organellar organization and highlight the particular relevance of these signaling pathways in disease.

     "abstract": "Chemical synapses are specialist points of contact between two neurons, where information transfer takes place. Communication occurs through the release of neurotransmitter substances from small synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal, which fuse with the presynaptic plasma membrane in response to neuronal stimulation. However, as neurons in the central nervous system typically only possess ~\u00a0200 vesicles, high levels of release would quickly lead to a depletion in the number of vesicles, as well as leading to an increase in the area of the presynaptic plasma membrane (and possible misalignment with postsynaptic structures). Hence, synaptic vesicle fusion is tightly coupled to a local recycling of synaptic vesicles. For a long time, however, the exact molecular mechanisms coupling fusion and subsequent recycling remained unclear. Recent work now indicates a unique role for the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), acting together with the vesicular protein synaptotagmin, in coupling these two processes. In this work, we review the evidence for such a mechanism and discuss both the possible advantages and disadvantages for vesicle recycling (and hence signal transduction) in the nervous system.

     "abstract": "The balance between protein and lipid biosynthesis and their eventual degradation is a critical component of cellular health. Autophagy, the catabolic process by which cytoplasmic material becomes degraded in lysosomes, can be induced by various physiological stimuli to maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy was for a long time considered a non-selective bulk process, but recent data have shown that unwanted components such as aberrant protein aggregates, dysfunctional organelles and invading pathogens can be selectively eliminated by autophagy. Recently, also intracellular lipid droplets were described as specific autophagic cargo, indicating that autophagy plays a role in lipid metabolism and storage (Singh et al., 2009 [1]). Moreover, over the past several years, it has become increasingly evident that lipids and lipid-modifying enzymes play important roles in the autophagy process itself, both at the level of regulation of autophagy and as membrane constituents required for formation of autophagic vesicles. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between lipids and autophagy, as well as the role of lipid-binding proteins in autophagy.

     "abstract": "Myelin-forming glia are highly polarized cells that synthesize as an extension of their plasma membrane, a multilayered myelin membrane sheath, with a unique protein and lipid composition. In most cells polarity is established by the polarized exocytosis of membrane vesicles to the distinct plasma membrane domains. Since myelin is composed of a stack of tightly packed membrane layers that do not leave sufficient space for the vesicular trafficking, we hypothesize that myelin does not use polarized exocytosis as a primary mechanism, but rather depends on lateral transport of membrane components in the plasma membrane. We suggest a model in which vesicle-mediated transport is confined to the cytoplasmic channels, from where transport to the compacted areas occurs by lateral flow of cargo within the plasma membrane. A diffusion barrier that is formed by MBP and the two adjacent cytoplasmic leaflets of the myelin bilayers acts a molecular sieve and regulates the flow of the components. Finally, we highlight potential mechanism that may contribute to the assembly of specific lipids within myelin. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipids and Vesicular Transport.",

Photoreceptors are polarized cells whose apical domain is organized into finger like projections of plasma membrane, microvilli that contain the molecular machinery required for sensory transduction. The development of this apical domain requires intense polarized membrane transport during development and it is maintained by post developmental membrane turnover. Sensory transduction in these cells involves a high rate of G-protein coupled phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] hydrolysis ending with the activation of ion channels that are members of the TRP superfamily. Defects in this lipid-signaling cascade often result in retinal degeneration, which is a consequence of the loss of apical membrane homeostasis.

However, absence of a p53-mediated response does not necessarily abrogate programmed cell death, due to the existence of p53-independent apoptotic pathways, such as those mediated by the pro-apoptotic molecule ceramide. We compared ceramide levels before and after DNA damage in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and colon cancer (HCT116) cells that were either expressing or deficient in p53. When treated with mitomycin C, p53-deficient cells, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a marked increase in ceramide levels. Microarray analysis of genes involved in ceramide metabolism identified acid ceramidase (ASAH1, up-regulated), ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG, down-regulated), and galactosylceramidase (GALC, up-regulated) as the three genes most affected. Experiments employing pharmacological and siRNA agents revealed that inhibition of UGCG is sufficient to increase ceramide levels and induce cell death. When inhibition of UGCG and treatment with mitomycin C were combined, p53-deficient, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a significant increase in cell death, suggesting that the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism could be used to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.",

We showed that mm-LDL induced the accumulation of lipid droplets in RAW264.7 macrophages with increased free cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with an antibody against toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Additionally, mm-LDL stimulated the transport of Cy3-labeled activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), a key sensor to the unfolded protein response (UPR), from cytoplasm into nucleus. The expression of phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (p-IRE1), another sensor to the UPR, and its two downstream molecules, X box binding protein 1 and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), were significantly upregulated by mm-LDL. The alterations induced by mm-LDL were all significantly inhibited by antibodies against TLR4 or CD36. In addition, the upregulation of p-IRE1 and GRP78 and the nuclear translocation of ATF6 induced by mm-LDL were significantly attenuated by TLR4 siRNA. These results suggest that mm-LDL may induce free cholesterol accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently stimulate ERS and activate the UPR signaling pathway mediated by ATF6 and IRE1 in macrophages, a process that is potentially mediated by TLR4.",

     "abstract": "The widely expressed steroid hydroxylase CYP7B1 is involved in metabolism of a number of steroids reported to influence estrogen and androgen signaling. Several studies by us and other investigators have linked this enzyme to effects on estrogen receptor activation. In a previous report we examined the effect of CYP7B1-mediated hormone metabolism for estrogen-mediated response in kidney-derived HEK293 cells. In the current study we used an androgen response element (ARE) reporter system to examine androgen-dependent response of some CYP7B1 substrates and CYP7B1-formed metabolites in several cell lines derived from different tissues. The results indicate significantly lower androgen receptor activation by CYP7B1-formed steroid metabolites than by the corresponding steroid substrates, suggesting that CYP7B1-mediated catalysis may decrease some androgenic responses. Thus, CYP7B1-dependent metabolism may be of importance not only for estrogenic signaling but also for androgenic. This finding, that CYP7B1 activity may be a regulator of androgenic signaling by converting AR ligands into less active metabolites, is also supported by real-time RT-PCR experiment where a CYP7B1 substrate, but not the corresponding product, was able to stimulate known androgen-sensitive genes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effects of some steroids on hormone response element reporter systems are cell line-specific. For instance, despite transfection of the same reporter systems, 5-androstene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol strongly activates an androgen-dependent response element in prostate cancer cells whereas it elicits only ER-dependent responses in kidney HEK293 cells.

The results showed that all CLnA isomers have strong cytotoxic effects on DLD-1 cells, with jacaric acid (JA) having the strongest effect.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, and cell culture using a specific fluorescent membrane probe, to demonstrate that NSAIDs have a strong affinity to form ionic and hydrophobic associations with zwitterionic phospholipids, and specifically phosphatidylcholine (PC), that are reversible and non-covalent in nature. We propose that the pH-dependent partition of these potent anti-inflammatory drugs into the phospholipid bilayer, and possibly extracellular mono/multilayers present on the luminal interface of the mucus gel layer, may result in profound changes in the hydrophobicity, fluidity, permeability, biomechanical properties and stability of these membranes and barriers. These changes may not only provide an explanation of how NSAIDs induce surface injury to the GI mucosa as a component in the pathogenic mechanism leading to peptic ulceration and bleeding, but potentially an explanation for a number of (COX-independent) biological actions of this family of pharmaceuticals. This insight also has proven useful in the design and development of a novel class of PC-associated NSAIDs that have reduced GI toxicity while maintaining their essential therapeutic efficacy to inhibit pain and inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Using mass spectrometry (MS), we examined the impact of endothelial lipase (EL) overexpression on the cellular phospholipid (PL) and triglyceride (TG) content of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and of mouse plasma and liver tissue. In HAEC incubated with the major EL substrate, HDL, adenovirus (Ad)-mediated EL overexpression resulted in the generation of various lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) species in cell culture supernatants. While the cellular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) content remained unaltered, cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC)-, LPC- and TG-contents were significantly increased upon EL overexpression. Importantly, cellular lipid composition was not altered when EL was overexpressed in the absence of HDL. [14C]-LPC accumulated in EL overexpressing, but not LacZ-control cells, incubated with [14C]-PC labeled HDL, indicating EL-mediated LPC supply. Exogenously added [14C]-LPC accumulated in HAEC as well. Its conversion to [14C]-PC was sensitive to a lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) inhibitor, thimerosal. Incorporation of [3H]-Choline into cellular PC was 56% lower in EL compared with LacZ cells, indicating decreased endogenous PC synthesis. In mice, adenovirus mediated EL overexpression decreased plasma PC, PE and LPC and increased liver LPC, LPE and TG content. Based on our results, we conclude that EL not only supplies cells with FFA as found previously, but also with HDL-derived LPC and LPE species resulting in increased cellular TG and PC content as well as decreased endogenous PC synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Monoacylglycerol lipases (MGLs) catalyse the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerol into free fatty acid and glycerol. MGLs have been identified throughout all genera of life and have adopted different substrate specificities depending on their physiological role. In humans, MGL plays an integral part in lipid metabolism affecting energy homeostasis, signalling processes and cancer cell progression. In bacteria, MGLs degrade short-chain monoacylglycerols which are otherwise toxic to the organism. We report the crystal structures of MGL from the bacterium Bacillus sp. H257 (bMGL) in its free form at 1.2\u00a0\u00c5 and in complex with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 1.8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. In both structures, bMGL adopts an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold with a cap in an open conformation. Access to the active site residues, which were unambiguously identified from the protein structure, is facilitated by two different channels. The larger channel constitutes the highly hydrophobic substrate binding pocket with enough room to accommodate monoacylglycerol. The other channel is rather small and resembles the proposed glycerol exit hole in human MGL. Molecular dynamics simulation of bMGL yielded open and closed states of the entrance channel and the glycerol exit hole. Despite differences in the number of residues, secondary structure elements, and low sequence identity in the cap region, this first structure of a bacterial MGL reveals striking structural conservation of the overall cap architecture in comparison with human MGL. Thus it provides insight into the structural conservation of the cap amongst MGLs throughout evolution and provides a framework for rationalising substrate specificities in each organism.",

A dose- and time-dependent increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) and DHA in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) glycerophospholipids (GPL) via the elongation/desaturation pathway following alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03) supplements was observed. That was accompanied by a marked reduction of eicosatrienoic acid (Mead acid 20:3n\u00a0\u2212\u00a09), an index of PUFA deficiency. EPA supplements were equally effective converted to 22:5n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 and 22:6n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03.

They have also been implicated in apoptosis. Sphingolipids are heterogeneous in their acyl chain length, with long-chain (C16) and very long-chain (C24) sphingolipids being predominant in most mammalian tissues. We demonstrate that knockdown of ELOVL1 or CERS2, which catalyze synthesis of C24 acyl-CoAs and C24 ceramide, respectively, drastically reduced C24 sphingolipid levels with a complementary increase in C16 sphingolipids. Under ELOVL1 or CERS2 knockdown conditions, cisplatin-induced apoptosis significantly increased. Enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis exhibited close correlation with increases in caspase-3/7 activity. No significant alterations in sphingolipid metabolism such as ceramide generation were apparent with the cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and inhibitors of ceramide generation had no effect on the apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by UV radiation or C6 ceramides also increased in ELOVL1 or CERS2 knockdown cells. Changes in the composition of sphingolipid chain length may affect susceptibility to stimuli-induced apoptosis by affecting the properties of cell membranes, such as lipid microdomain/raft formation.",

Treatment of Sprague Dawley rats with AY9944 (an inhibitor of Dhcr7) leads to similar biochemical features as observed in SLOS. Eighteen oxysterols previously have been identified as oxidation products of 7-DHC (most of them distinct from cholesterol (Chol)-derived oxysterols) in solution, in cells, and in brains obtained from Dhcr7-KO mice and AY9944-treated rats, formed either via free radical oxidation (peroxidation) or P450-catalyzed enzymatic oxidation. We report here the identification of five 7-DHC-derived oxysterols, including 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), 4\u03b1- and 4\u03b2-hydroxy-7-DHC, 24-hydroxy-7-DHC and 7-ketocholesterol (7-kChol, an oxysterol that is normally derived from Chol), in the retinas of AY9944-treated rats by comparing the retention times and mass spectrometric characteristics with corresponding synthetic standards in HPLC-MS analysis. Levels of 4\u03b1- and 4\u03b2-hydroxy-7-DHC, DHCEO, and 7-kChol were quantified using d7-DHCEO as an internal standard. Among the five oxysterols identified, only 7-kChol was observed in retinas of control rats, but the levels of 7-kChol in retinas of AY9944-rats were 30-fold higher. Intravitreal injection of 7-kChol (0.25\u00a0\u03bcmol) into a normal rat eye induced panretinal degeneration within one week; by comparison, contralateral (control) eyes injected with vehicle alone exhibited normal histology.

Here, we investigated the ability of hypertonicity (high salt medium) to induce Madin\u2013Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell differentiation and found an increase in GSL synthesis under hypertonic conditions. Then, we investigated the role of GSLs in MDCK cell differentiation induced by hypertonicity by using two approaches. First, cultured cells were depleted of GSLs by exposure to D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP). Second, cells were transfected with an siRNA specific to glucosylceramide synthase, the key enzyme in GSL synthesis. Exposure of cells to both treatments resulted in the impairment of the development of the apical membrane domain and the formation of the primary cilium. Enzymatic inhibitions of the de novo and the salvage pathway of GSL synthesis were used to determine the source of ceramide responsible of the GSL increase involved in the development of the apical membrane domain induced by hypertonicity. The results from this study show that extracellular hypertonicity induces the development of a differentiated apical membrane in MDCK cells by performing a sphingolipid metabolic program that includes the formation of a specific pool of GSLs. The results suggest as precursor a specific pool of ceramides formed by activation of a Fumonisin B1-resistant ceramide synthase as a component of the salvage pathway.",

     "abstract": "Disruption of the Pex2 gene leads to peroxisome deficiency and widespread metabolic dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that peroxisomes are critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis, using peroxisome-deficient Pex2\u2212/\u2212 mice on a hybrid Swiss Webster\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0129S6/SvEv (SW/129) genetic background. Peroxisome deficiency activates hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways, leading to dysregulation of the endogenous sterol response mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate a more profound dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in newborn Pex2\u2212/\u2212 mice congenic on a 129S6/SvEv (129) genetic background, and substantial differences between newborn versus postnatal Pex2\u2212/\u2212 mice in factors that activate ER stress. These differences extend to relationships between activation of genes regulated by SREBP-2 versus PPAR\u03b1. The SREBP-2 pathway is induced in neonatal Pex2\u2212/\u2212 livers from 129 and SW/129 strains, despite normal hepatic cholesterol levels. ER stress markers are increased in newborn 129 Pex2\u2212/\u2212 livers, which occurs in the absence of hepatic steatosis or accumulation of peroxins in the ER. Moreover, the induction of SREBP-2 and ER stress pathways is independent of PPAR\u03b1 activation in livers of newborn 129 and SW/129 Pex2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Two-week-old wild-type mice treated with the peroxisome proliferator WY-14,643 show strong induction of PPAR\u03b1-regulated genes and decreased expression of SREBP-2 and its target genes, further demonstrating that SREBP-2 pathway induction is not dependent on PPAR\u03b1 activation. Lastly, there is no activation of either SREBP-2 or ER stress pathways in kidney and lung of newborn Pex2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting a parallel induction of these pathways in peroxisome-deficient mice.

Here we employed plasma from various genetic models of mice which naturally differ in their plasma SM/PC ratios, to study the role of SM as a modulator of LCAT, the enzyme responsible for HDL maturation and the synthesis of cholesteryl esters (CE) in normal plasma. Serine palmitoyltransferase deficient mice, and SM synthase deficient mice, both of which have below normal SM/PC ratios, showed significantly elevated LCAT activities when assayed with the endogenous substrates. On the other hand, LDL receptor knockout mice, and apo E knockout mice, both of which have high SM/PC ratios, had markedly reduced (\u2212\u00a080%) LCAT activities. The LCAT levels in plasma, as assayed with an exogenous substrate, were similar in all groups, except for a 45% decrease in apo E knockout mice. Plasma samples with high SM/PC ratios had lower percentage of 20:4, 22:5, and 22:6 CE all of which are formed by LCAT, and a higher percentage of the atherogenic 18:1 CE which is mainly derived from the action of liver ACAT, showing that in vivo, the contribution of LCAT to plasma CE is reduced while that of liver ACAT is increased. These results show that SM is a physiological modulator of LCAT activity as well as plasma CE composition, and this may contribute to the previously reported pro-atherogenic effect of high plasma SM levels.",

     "abstract": "Leucine-rich glioma inactivated 3 (LGI3) is a secreted protein and a member of LGI/epitempin family. We previously showed that LGI3 was highly expressed in brain and played regulatory roles in neuronal exocytosis and differentiation. Besides the nervous system, LGI3 was shown to be expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we found that LGI3 and its receptor candidate ADAM23 were expressed in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes secreted a 60-kDa protein, a major secreted form of LGI3, which declined with adipocyte differentiation. LGI3 was also expressed in adipose tissue macrophages in the ob/ob mice and in macrophage cell line. The 60-kDa LGI3 protein was selectively increased in the ob/ob adipose tissues comparing with the lean mice. Pull-down experiments, coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry indicated that LGI3 associated with ADAM23 in adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. Knockdown of LGI3 or ADAM23 by siRNA increased adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment with LGI3 protein did not affect preadipocyte proliferation but attenuated adipogenesis and this effect was reversed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ADAM23. Taken together, we propose that LGI3 may be a candidate adipokine that is perturbed in obesity and suppresses adipogenesis through its receptor, ADAM23.",

Mass spectrometry revealed that cells deleted of HVO_1799 fail to fully reduce the isoprene chains of H. volcanii membrane phospholipids and glycolipids. Likewise, the absence of HVO_1799 led to a loss of saturation of the \u03c9-position isoprene subunit of C55 and C60 dolichol phosphate, with the effect of HVO_1799 deletion being more pronounced with C60 dolichol phosphate than with C55 dolichol phosphate.

     "abstract": "Ejaculated mammalian sperm must acquire fertilization capacity after residing into the female reproductive tract, a process collectively known as capacitation. Cholesterol efflux was required for sperm maturation. Different from flagellated sperm, C. elegans sperm are crawling cells. C. elegans sperm are highly enriched with cholesterol though this animal species lacks biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol and its survival requires an exogenous cholesterol supply. The low abundance of cholesterol in C. elegans lipid extract is thought insufficient to form lipid microdomains ubiquitously in this organism. We present evidence that cholesterol is enriched in the plasma membrane of C. elegans spermatids and that cholesterol- and glycosphingolipids (GSLs)-enriched membrane microdomains (lipid microdomains) mediate sperm activation. Disruption of sperm lipid microdomains by acute manipulation of cholesterol in vitro blocks the sperm activation. Restriction of cholesterol uptake also results in the abnormal sperm activation in both males and hermaphrodites. Manipulation of the integrity of lipid microdomains by targeting the biosynthesis of GSLs inhibits sperm activation and the inhibition can be rescued by the addition of exogenous GSLs. The cleavage of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which are exclusively found in lipid microdomains, also affects sperm activation. We conclude that localized signaling mediated by lipid microdomains is critical for worm sperm activation. Lipid microdomains composed of cholesterol and GSLs have been observed in flagellated sperm of several animal species, thus cholesterol, before its efflux from the plasma membrane, might be needed to assemble into a platform for some more important upstream signal sorting during spermatogenesis than was previously thought.",

The concept of disease development occurring in the fed state now has much support and dysregulation of substrate flux may occur due to poor handling of dietary fat in the immediate postprandial period. The present paper will review recent observations implicating cephalic phase events in the control of enterocyte lipid transport, the impact of varying the composition of meals on subsequent fat metabolism, and the means by which dietary lipid carried in chylomicrons can lead to elevated postprandial non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. This discussion is followed by an evaluation of the data on quantitative meal fat oxidation at the whole body level and an examination of dietary fat clearance to peripheral tissues \u2014 with particular attention paid to skeletal muscle and liver given the role of ectopic lipid deposition in insulin resistance. Estimates derived from data of dietary-TG clearance show good agreement with clearance to the liver equaling 8\u201312% of meal fat in lean subjects and this number appears higher (10\u201316%) in subjects with diabetes and fatty liver disease. Finally, we discuss new methods with which to study dietary fatty acid partitioning in vivo. Future research is needed to include a more comprehensive understanding of 1) the potential for differential oxidation of saturated versus unsaturated fatty acids which might lead to meaningful energy deficit and whether this parameter varies based on insulin sensitivity, 2) whether compartmentalization exists for diet-derived fatty acids within tissues vs. intracellular pools, and 3) the role of reduced peripheral fatty acid clearance in the development of fatty liver disease. Further advancements in the quantitation of dietary fat absorption and disposal will be central to the development of therapies designed to treat diet-induced obesity.

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major phospholipid component of all plasma lipoprotein classes. PC is the only phospholipid which is currently known to be required for lipoprotein assembly and secretion. Impaired hepatic PC biosynthesis significantly reduces the levels of circulating very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and high density lipoproteins (HDLs). The reduction in plasma VLDLs is due in part to impaired hepatic secretion of VLDLs. Less PC within the hepatic secretory pathway results in nascent VLDL particles with reduced levels of PC. These particles are recognized as being defective and are degraded within the secretory system by an incompletely defined process that occurs in a post-endoplasmic reticulum compartment, consistent with degradation directed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor and/or autophagy. Moreover, VLDL particles are taken up more readily from the circulation when the PC content of the VLDLs is reduced, likely due to a preference of cell surface receptors and/or enzymes for lipoproteins that contain less PC. Impaired PC biosynthesis also reduces plasma HDLs by inhibiting hepatic HDL formation and by increasing HDL uptake from the circulation. These effects are mediated by elevated expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and hepatic scavenger receptor class B type 1, respectively. Hepatic PC availability has recently been linked to the progression of liver and heart disease. These findings demonstrate that hepatic PC biosynthesis can regulate the amount of circulating lipoproteins and suggest that hepatic PC biosynthesis may represent an important pharmaceutical target.

     "abstract": "The hallmark of obesity and one of the key contributing factors to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is excess triacylglycerol (TG) storage. In hepatocytes, excessive accumulation of TG is the common denominator of a wide range of clinicopathological entities known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can eventually progress to cirrhosis and associated complications including hepatic failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. A tight regulation between TG synthesis, hydrolysis, secretion and fatty acid oxidation is required to prevent lipid accumulation as well as lipid depletion from hepatocytes. Therefore, understanding the pathways that regulate hepatic TG metabolism is crucial for development of therapies to ameliorate pathophysiological conditions associated with excessive hepatic TG accumulation, including dyslipidemias, viral infection and atherosclerosis.

     "abstract": "Elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations are prominent features of metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Individuals with Tangier disease also have elevated plasma TG concentrations and a near absence of HDL, resulting from mutations in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which facilitates the efflux of cellular phospholipid and free cholesterol to assemble with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), forming nascent HDL particles. In this review, we summarize studies focused on the regulation of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) TG production, with particular attention on recent evidence connecting hepatic ABCA1 expression to VLDL, LDL, and HDL metabolism. Silencing ABCA1 in McArdle rat hepatoma cells results in diminished assembly of large (>\u00a010\u00a0nm) nascent HDL particles, diminished PI3 kinase activation, and increased secretion of large, TG-enriched VLDL1 particles. Hepatocyte-specific ABCA1 knockout (HSKO) mice have a similar plasma lipid phenotype as Tangier disease subjects, with a two-fold elevation of plasma VLDL TG, 50% lower LDL, and 80% reduction in HDL concentrations. This lipid phenotype arises from increased hepatic secretion of VLDL1 particles, increased hepatic uptake of plasma LDL by the LDL receptor, elimination of nascent HDL particle assembly by the liver, and hypercatabolism of apoA-I by the kidney. These studies highlight a novel role for hepatic ABCA1 in the metabolism of all three major classes of plasma lipoproteins and provide a metabolic link between elevated TG and reduced HDL levels that are a common feature of Tangier disease, MS, and T2D.

     "abstract": "Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) are a major secretory product of the liver. They serve to transport endogenously synthesized lipids, mainly triglycerides (but also some cholesterol and cholesteryl esters) to peripheral tissues. VLDL is also the precursor of LDL. ApoB100 is absolutely required for VLDL assembly and secretion. The amount of VLDL triglycerides secreted by the liver depends on the amount loaded onto each lipoprotein particle, as well as the number of particles. Each VLDL has one apoB100 molecule, making apoB100 availability a key determinant of the number of VLDL particles, and hence, triglycerides, that can be secreted by hepatic cells. Surprisingly, the pool of apoB100 in the liver is typically regulated not by its level of synthesis, which is relatively constant, but by its level of degradation. It is now recognized that there are multiple opportunities for the hepatic cell to intercept apoB100 molecules and to direct them to distinct degradative processes. This mini-review will summarize progress in understanding these processes, with an emphasis on autophagy, the most recently described pathway of apoB100 degradation, and the one with possibly the most physiologic relevance to common metabolic perturbations affecting VLDL production.

     "abstract": "Plasma triglyceride concentrations are determined by the balance between production of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins VLDL and chylomicrons in liver and intestine, and their lipoprotein lipase-mediated clearance in peripheral tissues. In the last decade, the group of Angiopoietin-like proteins has emerged as important regulators of circulating triglyceride (TG) levels. Specifically, ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 impair TG clearance by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Whereas ANGPTL4 irreversibly inactivates LPL by promoting conversion of active LPL dimers into inactive monomers, ANGPTL3 reversibly inhibits LPL activity. Studies using transgenic or knockout mice have clearly demonstrated the stimulatory effect of Angptl3 and Angptl4 on plasma TG, which is further supported by human genetic data including genome wide association studies. Whereas ANGPTL3 is mainly active in the fed state, ANGPTL4 is elevated by fasting and mediates fasting-induced changes in plasma TG and free fatty acid metabolism. Both proteins undergo oligomerization and are subject to proteolytic cleavage to generate N- and C-terminal fragments with highly divergent biological activities. Expression of ANGPTL3 is exclusive to liver and governed by the liver X receptor (LXR). In contrast, ANGPTL4 is expressed ubiquitously and under sensitive control of the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family and fatty acids. Induction of ANGPTL4 gene expression by fatty acids and via PPARs is part of a feedback mechanism aimed at protecting cells against lipotoxicity. So far there is very little evidence that other ANGPTLs directly impact plasma lipoprotein metabolism. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Triglyceride Metabolism and Disease.",

As LMF1 is only required for the maturation of homodimeric, but not monomeric, lipases, it is likely involved in the assembly of inactive lipase subunits into active enzymes and/or the stabilization of active dimers. Herein, we provide an overview of current understanding of LMF1 function and propose that it may play a regulatory role in lipase activation and lipid metabolism.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently identified APOA5 as a contributor to plasma TG levels. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the APOA5 gene locus have been shown to correlate with elevated plasma TG. Furthermore, transgenic and knockout mouse models support the view that apoA-V plays a critical role in maintenance of plasma TG levels. The present review describes recent concepts pertaining to apoA-V SNP analysis and their association with elevated plasma TG. The interaction of apoA-V with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) is discussed relative to its postulated role in TG-rich lipoprotein catabolism. The potential role of intracellular apoA-V in regulation of TG homeostasis, as a function of its ability to associate with cytosolic lipid droplets, is reviewed. While some answers are emerging, numerous mysteries remain with regard to this low abundance, yet potent, modulator of TG homeostasis. Given the strong correlation between elevated plasma TG and heart disease, there is great scientific and public interest in deciphering the numerous biological riddles presented by apoA-V.

     "abstract": "Although cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of diabetes-related death, its etiology is still not understood. The immediate change that occurs in the diabetic heart is altered energy metabolism where in the presence of impaired glucose uptake, glycolysis, and pyruvate oxidation, the heart switches to exclusively using fatty acids (FA) for energy supply. It does this by rapidly amplifying its lipoprotein lipase (LPL\u2014a key enzyme, which hydrolyzes circulating lipoprotein-triglyceride to release FA) activity at the coronary lumen. An abnormally high capillary LPL could provide excess fats to the heart, leading to a number of metabolic, morphological, and mechanical changes, and eventually to cardiac disease. Unlike the initial response, chronic severe diabetes \u201cturns off\u201d LPL, this is also detrimental to cardiac function. In this review, we describe a number of post-translational mechanisms that influence LPL vesicle formation, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, and transfer of LPL from cardiomyocytes to the vascular lumen to hydrolyze lipoprotein-triglyceride following diabetes. Appreciating the mechanism of how the heart regulates its LPL following diabetes should allow the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention, to prevent heart failure.

     "abstract": "Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid abnormality in persons with visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Hypertriglyceridemia typically occurs in conjunction with low HDL levels and atherogenic small dense LDL particles and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Insulin resistance is often an underlying feature and results in increased free fatty acid (FFA) delivery to the liver due to increased peripheral lipolysis. Increased hepatic VLDL production occurs due to increased substrate availability via FFAs, decreased apolipoprotein B100 degradation and increased lipogenesis. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia also is a common feature of insulin resistance. Small dense LDL that coexist with decreased HDL particles in hypertriglyceridemic states are highly pro-atherogenic due to their enhanced endothelial permeability, proteoglycan binding abilities and susceptibility to oxidation. Hypertriglyceridemia also occurs in undertreated individuals with type 1 diabetes but intensive glucose control normalizes lipid abnormalities. However, development of visceral obesity in these patients unravels a similar metabolic profile as in patients with insulin resistance. Modest hypertriglyceridemia increases cardiovascular risk, while marked hypertriglyceridemia should be considered a risk for pancreatitis. Lifestyle modification is an important therapeutic strategy. Drug therapy is primarily focused on lowering LDL levels with statins, since efforts at triglyceride lowering and HDL raising with fibrates and/or niacin have not yet been shown to be beneficial in improving cardiovascular risk. Fibrates, however, are first-line agents when marked hypertriglyceridemia is present. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Triglyceride Metabolism and Disease.",

The international guidelines do not include TG into their risk calculator despite the recent observations that plasma TG is an independent risk factor for CVD. The understanding of the pathophysiology of triglycerides opens up avenues for development of new drug targets. Hypertriglyceridemia occurs through 1. Abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production, and intestinal chylomicron synthesis 2. Dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or 3. Impaired remnant clearance. The current review will discuss new aspects in lipolysis by discussing the role of GPIHBP1 and the involvement of apolipoproteins and in the process of hepatic remnant clearance with a focus upon the role of heparin sulfate proteoglycans.

For instance, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed 32 common variants that are associated with plasma TG concentrations in healthy epidemiologic populations. Furthermore, GWAS in clinically ascertained hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) patients have shown that almost all of the same TG-raising alleles from epidemiologic samples are also associated with HTG disease status, and that greater accumulation of these alleles reflects the severity of the HTG phenotype. Finally, comprehensive resequencing studies show a burden of rare variants in some of these same genes \u2013 namely in LPL, GCKR, APOB and APOA5 \u2013 in HTG patients compared to normolipidemic controls.

     "abstract": "Long chain omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are effective for reducing plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. At the pharmaceutical dose, 3.4\u00a0g/day, they reduce plasma TG by about 25\u201350% after one month of treatment, resulting primarily from the decline in hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-TG) production, and secondarily from the increase in VLDL clearance. Numerous mechanisms have been shown to contribute to the TG overproduction, but a key component is an increase in the availability of FAs in the liver. The liver derives FAs from three sources: diet (delivered via chylomicron remnants), de novo lipogenesis, and circulating non-esterified FAs (NEFAs). Of these, NEFAs contribute the largest fraction to VLDL-TG production in both normotriglyceridemic subjects and hypertriglyceridemic, insulin resistant patients. Thus reducing NEFA delivery to the liver would be a likely locus of action for fish oils (FO). The key regulator of plasma NEFA is intracellular adipocyte lipolysis via hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), which increases as insulin sensitivity worsens. FO counteracts intracellular lipolysis in adipocytes by suppressing adipose tissue inflammation. In addition, FO increases extracellular lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) in adipose, heart and skeletal muscle and enhances hepatic and skeletal muscle \u03b2-oxidation which contributes to reduced FA delivery to the liver. FO could activate transcription factors which control metabolic pathways in a tissue specific manner regulating nutrient traffic and reducing plasma TG.

     "abstract": "Uptake of long-chain fatty acids plays pivotal roles in metabolic homeostasis and human physiology. Uptake rates must be controlled in an organ-specific fashion to balance storage with metabolic needs during transitions between fasted and fed states. Many obesity-associated diseases, such as insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, cardiac lipotoxicity, and hepatic steatosis, are thought to be driven by the overflow of fatty acids from adipose stores and the subsequent ectopic accumulation of lipids resulting in apoptosis, ER stress, and inactivation of the insulin receptor signaling cascade. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand the components that regulate the flux of fatty acid between the different organ systems. Cellular uptake of fatty acids by key metabolic organs, including the intestine, adipose tissue, muscle, heart, and liver, has been shown to be protein mediated and various unique combinations of fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs/SLC27A1\u20136) are expressed by all of these tissues. Here we review our current understanding of how FATPs can contribute to normal physiology and how FATP mutations as well as hypo- and hypermorphic changes contribute to disorders ranging from cardiac lipotoxicity to hepatosteatosis and ichthyosis. Ultimately, our increasing knowledge of FATP biology has the potential to lead to the development of new diagnostic tools and treatment options for some of the most pervasive chronic human disorders.

     "abstract": "Epidemiological and interventional studies have implicated elevated triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL) levels as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and vascular inflammation, though the results have not been entirely consistent. This appears particularly relevant in model systems where the lipolysis occurs in the setting of established inflammation (e.g., in pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques), rather than in the tissue capillary beds where lipolysis normally occurs. Two main mechanisms seem to link TGRL lipolysis to vascular inflammation. First, lipolysis of TGRL leaves behind partially lipolyzed remnant particles which are better able to enter the vessel wall than nascent TGRL, have a rate of egress substantially lower than their rate of entry, and contain 5\u201320 times more cholesterol per particle than LDL. Furthermore, remnants do not require oxidation or other modifications to be phagocytized by macrophages, enhancing foam cell formation. Second, saturated fatty acids and oxidized phospholipids released by lipolysis induce inflammation by activating Toll-like receptors of the innate immune system, via oxidative stress, or by greatly amplifying existing pro-inflammatory signals (caused by subclinical endotoxemia) via mitogen-activated protein kinases. However, n-3 and unbound n-9 unsaturated fatty acids released by lipolysis have anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, the contribution of TGRL lipolysis to inflammation likely depends less on the TGRL concentration than on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and on the setting in which the lipolysis occurs. In the setting of the typical \u201cWestern\u201d diet, enriched in saturated and oxidized fatty acids and excessive in size, this balance is likely to be tilted towards increased vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis.

     "abstract": "ABC transporter G1 (ABCG1) plays a pivotal role in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux and atherogenesis. We investigated whether, and how, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) regulate ABCG1 expression in macrophages. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an RAR ligand, increased ABCG1 protein levels and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Both ATRA and other RAR agonists, TTNPB and Am580, increased major transcripts driven by promoter B upstream of exon 5, though minor transcripts driven by promoter A upstream of exon 1 were only increased by ATRA. The stimulatory effects of ATRA on ABCG1 expression were completely abolished in the presence of RAR/RXR antagonists but were only partially canceled in the presence of an LXR antagonist. Adenovirus with overexpressed oxysterol sulfotransferase abolished the LXR pathway, as previously reported, and ATRA-responsiveness in ABCA1/ABCG1 expressions were respectively attenuated by 38 and 22% compared to the control virus. Promoter assays revealed that ABCG1 levels were regulated more by promoter B than promoter A, and ATRA activated promoter B in a liver X receptor-responsive element (LXRE)-dependent manner. Further, LXRE-B in intron 7, but not LXRE-A in intron 5, enhanced ATRA responsiveness under overexpression of all RAR isoforms\u2014RAR\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3. In contrast, the activation of promoter B by TTNPB depended on LXRE-B and RAR\u03b1, but not on RAR\u03b2/\u03b3. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel-shift assays revealed a specific and direct repeat 4-dependent binding of RAR\u03b1 to LXRE-B. In conclusion, RAR ligands increase ABCA1/G1 expression and apoA-I/HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and modulate ABCG1 promoter activity via LXRE-dependent mechanisms.",

In this study, we aligned sequences of characterized Pcs enzymes to identify conserved amino acid residues. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed on 55 of these conserved residues.

Upregulation of vascular endothelin type B (ETB) receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells is predicted to be the molecular mechanism that leads to cardiovascular pathogenesis. The objective of the present study was to examine the hypothesis that mmLDL upregulates ETB receptors in rat coronary artery. The contractile responses to sarafotoxin 6c (ETB receptor agonist) were studied using a sensitive myograph. ETB receptor mRNA and protein expression was determined using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. The results showed that organ culture increased the contractile responses induced by sarafotoxin 6c and the levels of ETB receptor mRNA and protein. This increase was further enhanced by the addition of mmLDL (10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Specific ERK1/2 inhibitors (SB386023 and U0126) and an NF-\u03baB inhibitor (wedelolactone) attenuated the mmLDL-increased ETB receptor-mediated contraction and ETB receptor mRNA and protein levels. Wedelolactone significantly attenuated the mmLDL-decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 protein expression. Consistent with this result, I\u03baB\u03b1 protein expression was significantly decreased by culture with mmLDL compared to the level of expression in the organ culture group. However, the JNK inhibitor, SP600125 or p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580 did not inhibit mmLDL-enhanced effects. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine attenuated only culture-alone-increased effects. In conclusion, mmLDL upregulates the ETB receptors in rat coronary arterial smooth muscle cells, mainly via activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK and the downstream transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB.",

Material and methods: This has been investigated in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the human \u03b21-, \u03b22-, \u03b23-AR and in ob/ob mice. Cyclic AMP assays were carried out along with binding studies. Ob/ob mice were treated with ZAG and glucose transportation and insulin were examined in the presence or absence of propranolol. Results: ZAG bound to the \u03b23-AR with higher affinity (Kd 46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nM) than the \u03b22-AR (Kd 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0nM) while there was no binding to the \u03b21-AR, and this correlated with the increases in cyclic AMP in CHO-K1 cells transfected with the various \u03b2-AR and treated with ZAG.

     "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are neutral lipid-rich organelles involved in many cellular processes. A well-known example is their accumulation in leukocytes upon activation by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria. A role of LDs and LD-associated proteins during inflammation in the brain is unknown, however. We have now studied their dynamics and regulation in microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain. We find that LPS treatment of microglia leads to the accumulation in them of LDs, and enhancement of the size of LDs. This induction of LDs was abolished by triacsin C, an inhibitor of triglyceride biosynthesis. LPS strongly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK stress signaling pathways and increased the expression of LD-associated protein perilipin-2 (ADRP) in a time-dependent manner. Immunostaining showed that perilipin-2 in LPS-treated microglia predominantly colocalized with LDs. Inhibitors of p38 \u03b1/\u03b2 (SB203580) and PI3K/Akt pathway (LY294002), but not that of JNK (SP600125), reduced LPS-induced LD accumulation and eliminated the activating effect of LPS on perilipin-2. In addition, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2-\u03b1), a key enzyme for arachidonic acid release, colocalized with LPS-induced LDs. These observations suggest that LDs may play an important role in eicosanoid synthesis in activated microglia; they provide a novel insight into the regulation of LDs in inflammatory cells of the brain and point to a potential role of p38 \u03b1/\u03b2 in LPS-induced LD accumulation. Collectively, our findings imply that LD formation and perilipin-2 induction could be microglial biomarkers of inflammation in the central nervous system.",

     "abstract": "Though most of the studies have focused on the effects of free fatty acids on T-cell activation, fatty acids incorporated into plasma membrane phospholipids may also affect cell signaling via diacylglycerol (DAG), generally produced by phospholipid hydrolysis. In the present study, we have synthesized a DAG-containing oleic acid and studied its implication in the modulation of calcium signaling in human Jurkat T-cells. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (POG) induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. This effect was due to the presence of oleic acid at the sn-2 position as no differences were observed between POG and 1-stearoly-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (SOG). However, the substitution of oleic acid with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of the DAG moiety exerted a different response on the increases in [Ca2+]i in these cells. POG-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i were not due to its metabolites. Furthermore, POG-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were due to the opening of TRPC3/TRPC6 channels as silencing of TRPC3 and TRPC6 genes by shRNA abolished calcium entry. Moreover, disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin completely abolished POG-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that oleic acid can influence T-lymphocyte functions, in the conjugated form of DAG, via opening TRPC3/6 channels.",

It is unclear whether uptake mechanisms such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL) can be attenuated to diminish this uptake. Rats were cold acclimated to induce cardiac hypertrophy and increase cardiac LPL. Lipid uptake and metabolism were altered by feeding a \u2018Western-style\u2019 high fat diet (WSD) or feeding oxfenicine (2\u00a0g/L) in the drinking water. Diastolic stiffness (increased volume change/unit pressure change) was induced in hypertrophied hearts for rats fed WSD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) or WSD\u00a0+\u00a0oxfenicine (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), although absolute performance of cardiac muscle, estimated from stress\u2013strain calculations was unchanged. Cold acclimation increased cardiac endothelial LPL (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but this was diminished following oxfenicine. Following WSD LPL was further decreased below WSD-fed control hearts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with no further decrease by oxfenicine supplementation. A negative correlation was noted between plasma TAG and endothelial LPL (correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.654; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not cardiac TAG concentration.

For CA-hearts fed WSD or WSD\u00a0+\u00a0oxfenicine ANGPTL4 mRNA levels were preserved at chow-fed levels. VLDLR protein levels were increased 10-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) by CA. ANGPTL4 protein levels were increased 2-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by WSD, but restored following oxfenicine. For CA-hearts WSD increased ANGPTL4 protein levels 3-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with WSD\u00a0+\u00a0oxfenicine increasing ANGPTL4 protein 4-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "In a previous study (Spanova et al., 2010, J. Biol. Chem., 285, 6127\u20136133) we demonstrated that squalene, an intermediate of sterol biosynthesis, accumulates in yeast strains bearing a deletion of the HEM1 gene. In such strains, the vast majority of squalene is stored in lipid particles/droplets together with triacylglycerols and steryl esters. In mutants lacking the ability to form lipid particles, however, substantial amounts of squalene accumulate in organelle membranes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of squalene on biophysical properties of lipid particles and biological membranes and compared these results to artificial membranes. Our experiments showed that squalene together with triacylglycerols forms the fluid core of lipid particles surrounded by only a few steryl ester shells which transform into a fluid phase below growth temperature. In the hem1\u2206 deletion mutant a slight disordering effect on steryl esters was observed indicated by loss of the high temperature transition. Also in biological membranes from the hem1\u2206 mutant strain the effect of squalene per se is difficult to pinpoint because multiple effects such as levels of sterols and unsaturated fatty acids contribute to physical membrane properties. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies using endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and artificial membranes revealed that it is not the absolute squalene level in membranes but rather the squalene to sterol ratio which mainly affects membrane fluidity/rigidity. In a fluid membrane environment squalene induces rigidity of the membrane, whereas in rigid membranes there is almost no additive effect of squalene. In summary, our results demonstrate that squalene (i) can be well accommodated in yeast lipid particles and organelle membranes without causing deleterious effects; and (ii) although not being a typical membrane lipid may be regarded as a mild modulator of biophysical membrane properties.",

     "abstract": "Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is the key enzyme in mediating the esterification of cholesterol on circulating lipoproteins. It has long been suggested that LCAT plays a crucial role in reverse cholesterol transport, a process depicting the removal of cellular cholesterol through efflux to high density lipoproteins (HDL) and its delivery to the liver for eventual excretion from the body. Although loss-of-function LCAT mutations invariably result in profound HDL deficiency, the role of LCAT in atherogenesis continues to be clouded with controversy. Increasing number of large scale, population-based studies failed to detect an elevated cardiac risk with reduced blood levels of LCAT, suggesting that reduced LCAT activity may not be a risk factor nor a therapeutic target. More recent studies in human LCAT gene mutation carriers tend to suggest that atherogenicity in LCAT deficiency may be dependent on the nature of the mutations, providing plausible explanations for the otherwise contradictory findings. Genetic models of LCAT excess or deficiency yielded mixed findings. Despite its known profound effects on HDL and triglyceride metabolism, the role of LCAT in metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes, has not received much attention. Recent studies in LCAT deficient mouse models suggest that absence of LCAT may protect against insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity. Coordinated modulation of a number of anti-obesity and insulin sensitizing pathways has been implicated. Further studies to explore the role of LCAT in the modulation of cardiometabolic disorders and the underlying mechanisms are warranted.",

     "abstract": "Solea senegalensis is an unusual marine teleost as it has very low dietary requirement for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) during early development. Aquaculture is rapidly becoming the main source of health-beneficial fish products for human consumption. This, associated with limited supply of LC-PUFA-rich ingredients for fish feeds, render S. senegalensis a highly interesting species in which to study the LC-PUFA biosynthesis pathway. We have cloned and functionally characterized fatty acyl desaturase and elongase cDNAs corresponding to \u03944fad (with some \u03945 activity for the n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 series) and elovl5 with the potential to catalyze docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) biosynthesis from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Changes in expression of both transcripts were determined during embryonic and early larval development, and transcriptional regulation in response to higher or lower dietary n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 LC-PUFA was assessed during larval and post-larval stages. There was a marked pattern of regulation during early ontogenesis, with both transcripts showing peak expression coinciding with the start of exogenous feeding. Although elovl5 transcripts were present in fertilized eggs, \u03944fad only appeared at hatching. However, eggs have high proportions of DHA (~\u00a020%) and high DHA/EPA ratio (~\u00a011) to meet the high demands for early embryonic development. The fatty acid profile of larvae after the start of exogenous feeding closely reflected dietary composition. Nonetheless, \u03944fad was significantly up-regulated in response to LC-PUFA-poor diets, which may suggest biological relevance of this pathway in reducing LC-PUFA dietary requirements in this species, compared to other marine teleosts. These results indicate that sole is capable of synthesizing DHA from EPA through a Sprecher-independent pathway.",

Here we investigated the role of COXs (cyclooxygenases) in these effects and we found that, i) ATRA increased the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA and protein and the intracellular levels (but not the extracellular ones) of PGE2. Furthermore, inhibitors of COX isoenzymes blocked ATRA-induced increase in intracellular PGE2, HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation and increased VEGF-A production. Immunofluorescence analysis found intracellular staining for EP1-4 receptors (PGE2 receptors). These results indicated that COX activity is critical for ATRA-induced HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation and suggested that intracellular PGE2 could mediate the effects of ATRA; ii) Treatment with PGE2 analog 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 resulted in up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and antagonists of EP1-4 receptors inhibited 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2- and ATRA-induced HIF-1\u03b1 up-regulation.

Jurkat cells are typically defined as type 2 cells, which require the activation of the mitochondrial pathway for efficient apoptosis induction in response to CD95L. Caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells significantly resisted CD95L-induced apoptosis, despite ceramide accumulation. Knock-down of sphingomyelin synthase 1, which metabolizes ceramide to sphingomyelin, enhanced (i) CD95L-triggered ceramide production, (ii) cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and (iii) caspase-9 activation. Exogenous ceramide-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were impaired in caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells.

Here we describe the import of fluorescent POVPC and PGPC analogs into cultured RAW 264.7 macrophages and the identification of their primary protein targets. We found that the fluorescent oxidized phospholipids were rapidly taken up by the cells. The cellular target sites depended on the chemical reactivity of these compounds but not on the donor (aqueous lipid suspension, albumin or LDL). The great differences in cellular uptake of PGPC and POVPC are a direct consequence of the subtle structural differences between both molecules. The former compound (carboxyl lipid) can only physically interact with the molecules in its immediate vicinity. In contrast, the aldehydo-lipid covalently reacts with free amino groups of proteins by forming covalent Schiff bases, and thus becomes trapped in the cell surface. Despite covalent binding, POVPC is exchangeable between (lipo)proteins and cells, since imines are subject to proton-catalyzed base exchange. Protein targeting by POVPC is a selective process since only a limited subfraction of the total proteome was labeled by the fluorescent aldehydo-phospholipid.

A comprehensive review of PLTP is presented on the following topics: PLTP gene organization and structure; PLTP transfer properties; different forms of PLTP; characteristics of plasma PLTP complexes; relationship of plasma PLTP activity, mass and specific activity with lipoprotein and metabolic factors; role of PLTP in lipoprotein metabolism; PLTP and reverse cholesterol transport; insights from studies of PLTP variants; insights of PLTP from animal studies; PLTP and atherosclerosis; PLTP and signal transduction; PLTP in the brain; and PLTP in human disease.PLTP's central role in lipoprotein metabolism and lipid transport in the vascular compartment has been firmly established. However, more studies are needed to further delineate PLTP's functions in specific tissues, such as the lung, brain and adipose tissue. Furthermore, the specific role that PLTP plays in human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease, remains to be clarified. Exciting directions for future research include evaluation of PLTP's physiological relevance in intracellular lipid metabolism and signal transduction, which undoubtedly will advance our knowledge of PLTP functions in health and disease.

     "abstract": "Diabetes and insulin resistance increase the risk of cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Lipid-loaded macrophages are key contributors to all stages of atherosclerosis. We have recently shown that diabetes associated with increased plasma lipids reduces cholesterol efflux and levels of the reverse cholesterol transporter ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1) in mouse macrophages, which likely contributes to macrophage lipid accumulation in diabetes. Furthermore, we and others have shown that unsaturated fatty acids reduce ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, and that this effect is mediated by the acyl-CoA derivatives of the fatty acids. We therefore investigated whether acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1), a key enzyme mediating acyl-CoA synthesis in macrophages, could directly influence ABCA1 levels and cholesterol efflux in these cells. Mouse macrophages deficient in ACSL1 exhibited reduced sensitivity to oleate- and linoleate-mediated ABCA1 degradation, which resulted in increased ABCA1 levels and increased apolipoprotein A-I-dependent cholesterol efflux in the presence of these fatty acids, as compared with wildtype mouse macrophages. Conversely, overexpression of ACSL1 resulted in reduced ABCA1 levels and reduced cholesterol efflux in the presence of unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, the reduced ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux in macrophages subjected to conditions of diabetes and elevated fatty load may, at least in part, be mediated by ACSL1. These observations raise the possibility that ABCA1 levels could be increased by inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase activity in vivo.

     "abstract": "Increased or decreased hepatic lipase (HL) activity has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). This is consistent with the findings that gene variants that influence HL activity were associated with increased CAD risk in some population studies but not in others. In this review, we will explain the conditions that influence the effects of HL on CAD. Increased HL is associated with smaller and denser LDL (sdLDL) and HDL (HDL3) particles, while decreased HL is associated with larger and more buoyant LDL and HDL particles. The effect of HL activity on CAD risk is dependent on the underlying lipoprotein phenotype or disorder. Central obesity with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is associated with high HL activity that leads to the formation of sdLDL that is pro-atherogenic. In the absence of HTG, where large buoyant cholesteryl ester-enriched LDL is prominent, elevation of HL does not raise the risk for CAD. In HTG patients, drug therapy that decreases HL activity selectively decreases sdLDL particles, an anti-atherogenic effect. Drug therapy that raises HDL2 cholesterol has not decreased the risk for CAD. In trials where inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) or HL occurs, the increase in HDL2 most likely is due to inhibition of catabolism of HDL2 and impairment of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, but with normal triglyceride levels and big-buoyant LDL particles, an increase in HL activity is beneficial; possibly because it increases RCT. Drugs that lower HL activity might decrease the risk for CAD only in hypertriglyceridemic patients with sdLDL by selectively clearing sdLDL particles from plasma, which would override the potentially pro-atherogenic effect on RCT.

     "abstract": "ABCA1 belongs to the A class of ABC transporter, which is absent in yeast. ABCA1 elicits lipid translocation at the plasma membrane through yet elusive processes. We successfully expressed the mouse Abca1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The cloned ABCA1 distributed at the yeast plasma membrane in stable discrete domains that we name MCA (membrane cluster containing ABCA1) and that do not overlap with the previously identified punctate structures MCC (membrane cluster containing Can1p) and MCP (membrane cluster containing Pma1p). By comparison with a nonfunctional mutant, we demonstrated that ABCA1 elicits specific phenotypes in response to compounds known to interact with membrane lipids, such as papuamide B, amphotericin B and pimaricin. The sensitivity of these novel phenotypes to the genetic modification of the membrane lipid composition was studied by the introduction of the cho1 and lcb1-100 mutations involved respectively in phosphatidylserine or sphingolipid biosynthesis in yeast cells. The results, corroborated by the analysis of equivalent mammalian mutant cell lines, demonstrate that membrane composition, in particular its phosphatidylserine content, influences the function of the transporter. We thus have reconstituted in yeast the essential functions associated to the expression of ABCA1 in mammals and characterized new physiological phenotypes prone to genetic analysis.

Circulating GPI-PLD levels are regulated by multiple factors including genetics. To determine if genetic variation in GPLD1 affects circulating GPI-PLD levels, we examined the relationship between 32 SNPS upstream, within, and downstream of GPLD1 and circulating GPI-PLD levels in Caucasians (n\u00a0=\u00a077) and African-Americans (n\u00a0=\u00a099).

     "abstract": "Niemann\u2013Pick disease type C (NPC) is caused by mutations leading to loss of function of NPC1 or NPC2 proteins, resulting in accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes and lysosomes. We previously reported that expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is impaired in human NPC1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, resulting in reduced HDL particle formation and providing a mechanism for the reduced plasma HDL cholesterol seen in the majority of NPC1 patients. We also found that treatment of NPC1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts with an agonist of liver X-receptor corrects ABCA1 expression and HDL formation and reduces lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. We have confirmed that ABCA1 expression is also reduced in NPC2\u2212/\u2212 cells, and found that \u03b1-HDL particle formation is impaired in these cells. To determine whether selective up-regulation of ABCA1 can correct lysosomal cholesterol accumulation in NPC disease cells and HDL particle formation, we produced and infected NPC1\u2212/\u2212 and NPC2\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts with an adenovirus expressing full-length ABCA1 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdABCA1-EGFP). ABCA1-EGFP expression in NPC1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts resulted in normalization of cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and \u03b1-HDL particle formation, plus a marked reduction in filipin staining of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, AdABCA1-EGFP treatment of NPC2\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts to normalize ABCA1 expression had no effect on cholesterol efflux to apoA-I or accumulation of excess cholesterol in lysosomes, and only partially corrected \u03b1-HDL formation by these cells. These results suggest that correction of ABCA1 expression can bypass the mutation of NPC1 but not NPC2 to mobilize excess cholesterol from late endosomes and lysosomes in NPC disease cells. Expression of ABCA1-EGFP in NPC1\u2212/\u2212 cells increased cholesterol available for esterification and reduced levels of HMG-CoA reductase protein, effects that were abrogated by co-incubation with apoA-I. A model can be generated in which ABCA1 is able to mobilize cholesterol, to join the intracellular regulatory pool or to be effluxed for HDL particle formation, either directly or indirectly from the lysosomal membrane, but not from the lysosomal lumen.

     "abstract": "Inflammation is a major factor underlying acute coronary syndromes (ACS). HDL particles may be remodeled, becoming functionally defective, under the inflammatory conditions seen in ACS. Shotgun proteomics was used to monitor changes in the HDL proteome between male age-matched control, stable CAD, and ACS subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a010/group). HDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation and separated by 1D-gel followed by LC\u2013MS/MS. We identified 67 HDL-associated proteins, 20 of which validated recently identified proteins including vitronectin and complement C4B, and 5 of which were novel. Using gene ontology analysis, we found that the HDL-proteome consisted of proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis (~\u00a050%), with significant contributions by proteins involved in lipid binding, antioxidant, acute-phase response, immune response, and endopeptidase/protease inhibition. Importantly, levels of apoA-IV were significantly reduced in ACS patients, whereas levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) and complement C3 (C3) were significantly increased (spectral counting; t-test p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), as confirmed by immunoblot or ELISA. Despite differences in protein composition, ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI mediated cholesterol efflux assays did not indicate that HDL from ACS patients is functionally deficient as compared to controls, when corrected for apoA-I mass. Our results support that the HDL proteome differs between control, CAD and ACS patients. Increased abundance of SAA, C3, and other inflammatory proteins in HDL from ACS patients suggests that HDL reflects a shift to an inflammatory profile which, in turn, might alter the protective effects of HDL on the atherosclerotic plaque.

     "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with several co-morbid conditions including diabetes, dyslipidemia, cancer, atherosclerosis and gallstones. Obesity is associated with low systemic inflammation and an accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) that are thought to modulate insulin resistance. ATMs may also modulate adipocyte metabolism and take up lipids released during adipocyte lipolysis and cell death. We suggest that high levels of free cholesterol residing in adipocytes are released during these processes and contribute to ATM activation and accumulation during obesity and caloric restriction. Db/db mice were studied for extent of adipose tissue inflammation under feeding conditions of ad libitum (AL) and caloric restriction (CR). The major finding was a marked elevation in epididymal adipose ABCG1 mRNA levels with obesity and CR (6-fold and 16-fold, respectively) over that seen for lean wild-type mice. ABCG1 protein was also elevated for CR as compared to AL adipose tissue. ABCG1 is likely produced by cholesterol loaded ATMs since this gene is not highly expressed in adipocytes and ABCG1 expression is sterol mediated. Our data supports the concept that metabolic changes in adipocytes due to demand lipolysis and cell death lead to cholesterol loading of ATMs. Based on finding cholesterol-loaded peritoneal leukocytes with elevated levels of ABCG1 in CR as compared to AL mice, we suggest that pathways for cholesterol trafficking out of adipose tissue involve ATM egress as well as ABCG1 mediated cholesterol efflux.

     "abstract": "Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism. The lipid-free/lipid-poor form of apoA-I is the preferred substrate for the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). The interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 leads to the formation of cholesterol laden high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport and the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. Knowledge of the structure of lipid-free apoA-I is essential to understanding its critical interaction with ABCA1 and the molecular mechanisms underlying HDL biogenesis. We therefore examined the structure of lipid-free apoA-I by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Through site directed spin label EPR, we mapped the secondary structure of apoA-I and identified sites of spin coupling as residues 26, 44, 64, 167, 217 and 226. We capitalize on the fact that lipid-free apoA-I self-associates in an anti-parallel manner in solution. We employed these sites of spin coupling to define the central plane in the dimeric apoA-I complex. Applying both the constraints of dipolar coupling with the EPR-derived pattern of solvent accessibility, we assembled the secondary structure into a tertiary context, providing a solution structure for lipid-free apoA-I.

     "abstract": "The apoA-I molecule adopts a two-domain tertiary structure and the properties of these domains modulate the ability to form HDL particles. Thus, human apoA-I differs from mouse apoA-I in that it can form smaller HDL particles; the C-terminal \u03b1-helix is important in this process and human apoA-I is unusual in containing aromatic amino acids in the non-polar face of this amphipathic \u03b1-helix. To understand the influence of these aromatic amino acids and the associated high hydrophobicity, apoA-I variants were engineered in which aliphatic amino acids were substituted with or without causing a decrease in overall hydrophobicity. The variants human apoA-I (F225L/F229A/Y236A) and apoA-I (F225L/F229L/A232L/Y236L) were compared to wild-type (WT) apoA-I for their abilities to (1) solubilize phospholipid vesicles and form HDL particles of different sizes, and (2) mediate cellular cholesterol efflux and create nascent HDL particles via ABCA1. The loss of aromatic residues and concomitant decrease in hydrophobicity in apoA-I (F225L/F229A/Y236A) has no effect on protein stability, but reduces by a factor of about three the catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of vesicle solubilization and cholesterol efflux; also, relatively large HDL particles are formed. With apoA-I (F225L/F229L/A232L/Y236L) where the hydrophobicity is restored by the presence of only leucine residues in the helix non-polar face, the catalytic efficiencies of vesicle solubilization and cholesterol efflux are similar to those of WT apoA-I; this variant forms smaller HDL particles.

     "abstract": "Macrophages store excess unesterified cholesterol (free, FC) in the form of cholesteryl ester (CE) in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The hydrolysis of droplet-CE in peripheral foam cells is critical to HDL-promoted reverse cholesterol transport because it represents the first step in cellular cholesterol clearance, as only FC is effluxed from cells to HDL. Cytoplasmic lipid droplets move within the cell utilizing the cytoskeletal network, but, little is known about the influence of the cytoskeleton on lipid droplet formation. To understand this role we employed cytochalasin D (cyt.D) to promote actin depolymerization in J774 macrophages. Incubating J774 with acetylated LDL creates foam cells having a 4-fold increase in cellular cholesterol content (30\u201340% cholesterol present as cholesteryl ester (CE)) in cytoplasmic droplets. Lipid droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D are smaller in diameter. CE-deposition and -hydrolysis are decreased when cells are cholesterol-enriched in the presence of cyt.D or latrunculin A, another cytoskeleton disrupting agent. However, when lipid droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D are isolated and incubated with an exogenous CE hydrolase, the CE is more rapidly metabolized compared to droplets from control cells. This is apparently due to the smaller size and altered lipid composition of the droplets formed in the presence of cyt.D. Cytoskeletal proteins found on CE droplets influence droplet lipid composition and maturation in model foam cells. In J774 macrophages, cytoskeletal proteins are apparently involved in facilitating the interaction of lipid droplets and a cytosolic neutral CE hydrolase and may play a role in foam cell formation.

     "abstract": "To develop a detailed double belt model for discoidal HDL, we previously scored inter-helical salt bridges between all possible registries of two stacked antiparallel amphipathic helical rings of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. The top score was the antiparallel apposition of helix 5 with 5 followed closely by appositions of helix 5 with 4 and helix 5 with 6. The rationale for the current study is that, for each of the optimal scores, a pair of identical residues can be identified in juxtaposition directly on the contact edge between the two antiparallel helical belts of apoA-I. Further, these residues are always in the \u20189th position\u2019 in one of the eighteen 11-mer repeats that make up the lipid-associating domain of apoA-I. To illustrate our terminology, 129j (LL5/5) refers to the juxtaposition of the C\u03b1 atoms of G129 (in a \u20189th position\u2019) in the pairwise helix 5 domains. We reasoned that if identical residues in the double belt juxtapositions were mutated to a cysteine and kept under reducing conditions during disc formation, we would have a precise method for determining registration in discoidal HDL by formation of a disulfide-linked apoA-I homodimer. Using this approach, we conclude that 129j (LL5/5) is the major rotamer orientation for double belt HDL and propose that the small ubiquitous gap between the pairwise helix 5 portions of the double belt in larger HDL discoidal particles is significantly dynamic to hinge off the disc edge under certain conditions, e.g., in smaller particles or perhaps following binding of the enzyme LCAT.

     "abstract": "The mechanisms that deprive HDL of its cardioprotective properties are poorly understood. One potential pathway involves oxidative damage of HDL proteins by myeloperoxidase (MPO) a heme enzyme secreted by human artery wall macrophages. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that levels of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine \u2013 two characteristic products of MPO \u2013 are elevated in HDL isolated from patients with established cardiovascular disease. When apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major HDL protein, is oxidized by MPO, its ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the membrane-associated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) pathway is diminished. Biochemical studies revealed that oxidation of specific tyrosine and methionine residues in apoA-I contributes to this loss of ABCA1 activity. Another potential mechanism for generating dysfunctional HDL involves covalent modification of apoA-I by reactive carbonyls, which have been implicated in atherogenesis and diabetic vascular disease. Indeed, modification of apoA-I by malondialdehyde (MDA) or acrolein also markedly impaired the lipoprotein's ability to promote cellular cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway. Tandem mass spectrometric analyses revealed that these reactive carbonyls target specific Lys residues in the C-terminus of apoA-I. Importantly, immunochemical analyses showed that levels of MDA-protein adducts are elevated in HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions. Also, apoA-I co-localized with acrolein adducts in such lesions. Thus, lipid peroxidation products might specifically modify HDL in vivo. Our observations support the hypotheses that MPO and reactive carbonyls might generate dysfunctional HDL in humans.

It is associated with a dominant negative phenotype, displaying hypoalphaproteinemia and an increased risk for atherosclerosis in humans. Mice lacking both mouse apoA-I and LDL receptor (LDL\u2212/\u2212, apoA-I\u2212/\u2212) (double knockout or DKO) were crossed\u00a0>\u00a09 generations with mice transgenic for human FIN to obtain L159R apoA-I, LDLr\u2212/\u2212, ApoA-I\u2212/\u2212 (FIN-DKO) mice. A similar cross was also performed with human wild-type (WT) apoA-I (WT-DKO). In addition, FIN-DKO and WT-DKO were crossed to obtain WT/FIN-DKO mice. To determine the effects of the apoA-I mutations on atherosclerosis, groups of each genotype were fed either chow or an atherogenic diet for 12\u00a0weeks. Interestingly, the production of dysfunctional HDL-like particles occurred in DKO and FIN-DKO mice. These particles were distinct with respect to size, and their enrichment in apoE and cholesterol esters. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicated that particles found in the plasma of FIN-DKO mice migrated as large \u03b13-HDL. Atherosclerosis analysis showed that FIN-DKO mice developed the greatest extent of aortic cholesterol accumulation compared to all other genotypes, including DKO mice which lack any apoA-I. Taken together these data suggest that the presence of large apoE enriched HDL particles containing apoA-I L159R lack the normal cholesterol efflux promoting properties of HDL, rendering them dysfunctional and pro-atherogenic. In conclusion, large HDL-like particles containing apoE and apoA-IL159R contribute rather than protect against atherosclerosis, possibly through defective efflux properties and their potential for aggregation at their site of interaction in the aorta.

     "abstract": "In some settings increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels has been associated with a reduction in experimental atherosclerosis. This has been most clearly seen in apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) transgenic mice or in animals infused with HDL or its apolipoproteins. A major mechanism by which these treatments are thought to delay progression or cause regression of atherosclerosis is by promoting efflux of cholesterol from macrophage foam cells. In addition, HDL has been described as having anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects. Some recent research has linked anti-inflammatory effects to cholesterol efflux pathways but likely multiple mechanisms are involved. Macrophage cholesterol efflux may have a role in facilitating emigration of macrophages from lesions during regression. While macrophages can mediate cholesterol efflux by several pathways, studies in knockout mice or cells point to the importance of active efflux mediated by ATP binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 and G1. In addition to traditional roles in macrophages, these transporters have been implicated in the control of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, monocytosis and neutrophilia, as well as activation of monocytes and neutrophils. Thus, HDL and cholesterol efflux pathways may have important anti-atherogenic effects at all stages of the myeloid cell/monocyte/dendritic cell/macrophage lifecycle.

     "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is an integral cell membrane protein that protects cardiovascular disease by at least two mechanisms: by export of excess cholesterol from cells and by suppression of inflammation. ABCA1 exports cholesterol and phospholipids from cells by multiple steps that involve forming cell surface lipid domains, binding of apolipoproteins to ABCA1, activating signaling pathways, and solubilizing these lipids by apolipoproteins. ABCA1 executes its anti-inflammatory effect by modifying cell membrane lipid rafts and directly activating signaling pathways. The interaction of apolipoproteins with ABCA1 activates multiple signaling pathways, including Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3), protein kinase A, Rho family G protein CDC42 and protein kinase C. Activating protein kinase A and Rho family G protein CDC42 regulates ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux, activating PKC stabilizes ABCA1 protein, and activating JAK2/STAT3 regulates both ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux and anti-inflammation. Thus, ABCA1 behaves both as a lipid exporter and a signaling receptor. Targeting ABCA1 receptor-like property using agonists for ABCA1 protein could become a promising new therapeutic target for increasing ABCA1 function and treating cardiovascular disease.

Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a lipid acceptor for ABCA1, reportedly interacts with ABCA1. However, it has also been proposed that apoA-I interacts with ABCA1-generated special domains on the plasma membrane, but apart from ABCA1, and solubilizes membrane lipids. To determine the importance of the apoA-I\u2013ABCA1 interaction in HDL formation, the electrostatic interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1, which mediates the interaction between apoB100 in low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL) and LDL receptor, was analyzed. The apoA-I binding to ABCA1 and the cross-linking between them were inhibited by the highly charged molecules heparin and poly-L-lysine. Treating cells with membrane impermeable reagents that specifically react with primary amino groups abolished the interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1. However, these reagents did not affect the characteristic tight ATP binding to ABCA1. These results suggest that lysine residues in the extracellular domains of ABCA1 contribute to the interaction with apoA-I. The electrostatic interaction between ABCA1 and apoA-I is predicted to be the first step in HDL formation.

     "abstract": "Lipoprotein metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) is based on high-density lipoprotein-like particles that use apoE as their predominant apolipoprotein rather than apoA-I. Although apoA-I is not expressed in astrocytes and microglia, which produce CNS apoE, apoA-I is reported to be expressed in porcine brain capillary endothelial cells and also crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). These mechanisms allow apoA-I to reach concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that are approximately 0.5% of its plasma levels. Recently, apoA-I has been shown to enhance cognitive function and reduce cerebrovascular amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) mice, raising questions about the regulation and function of apoA-I in the CNS. Peripheral apoA-I metabolism is highly influenced by ABCA1, but less is known about how ABCA1 regulates CNS apoA-I. We report that ABCA1 deficiency leads to greater retention of apoA-I in the CNS than in the periphery. Additionally, treatment of symptomatic AD mice with GW3965, an LXR agonist that stimulates ABCA1 expression, increases apoA-I more dramatically in the CNS compared to the periphery. Furthermore, GW3965-mediated up-regulation of CNS apoA-I is independent of ABCA1. Our results suggest that apoA-I may be regulated by distinct mechanisms on either side of the BBB and that apoA-I may serve to integrate peripheral and CNS lipid metabolism.

ABCA1 is mandatory and rate-limiting for this reaction. Besides regulation of the gene expression by transcriptional factors including LXR, AP2 and SREBP, the ABCA1 activity is regulated post-translationally by calpain-mediated proteolytic degradation of ABCA1 protein that occurs in the early endosome after its endocytosis. When the HDL biogenesis reaction is ongoing as helical apolipoproteins interact with ABCA1, ABCA1 becomes resistant to calpain and is recycled to cell surface after endocytosis. Biogenesis of HDL is most likely to take place on cell surface. Clearance rate of ABCA1 by this mechanism is also retarded by various factors that interact with ABCA1, such as \u03b11-syntrophin, LXR\u03b2 and calmodulin. Physiological relevance of the retardation by these factors is not entirely clear. Pharmacological inhibition of the calpain-mediated ABCA1 degradation results in the increase of the ABCA1 activity and HDL biogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and potentially suppresses atherogenesis.

However, how ABCG1 mediates the efflux of cholesterol onto lipidated apoA-I is unclear. Since the crystal structure of ABCG family is not available, other approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis have been widely used to identify amino acid residues important for protein functions. We noticed that ABCG1 contains a single cysteine residue in its putative transmembrane domains. This cysteine residue locates at position 514 (Cys514) within the third putative transmembrane domain and is highly conserved. Replacement of Cys514 with Ala (C514A) essentially abolished ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apoA-I. Substitution of Cys514 with more conserved amino acid residues, Ser or Thr, also significantly decreased cholesterol efflux. However, mutation C514A had no detectable effect on protein stability and trafficking. Mutation C514A also did not affect the dimerization of ABCG1. Our findings demonstrated that the sulfhydryl group of Cys residue located at position 514 plays a critical role in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux.

     "abstract": "The development of mass spectrometry-based techniques is opening new insights into the understanding of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. AA incorporation, remodeling and release are collectively controlled by acyltransferases, phospholipases and transacylases that exquisitely regulate the distribution of AA between the different glycerophospholipid species and its mobilization during cellular stimulation. Traditionally, studies involving phospholipid AA metabolism were conducted by using radioactive precursors and scintillation counting from thin layer chromatography separations that provided only information about lipid classes. Today, the input of lipidomic approaches offers the possibility of characterizing and quantifying specific molecular species with great accuracy and within a biological context associated to protein and/or gene expression in a temporal frame. This review summarizes recent results applying mass spectrometry-based lipidomic approaches to the identification of AA-containing glycerophospholipids, phospholipid AA remodeling and synthesis of oxygenated metabolites.",

     "abstract": "Local acidic areas characterize diffuse intimal thickening (DIT) and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The role of acidity in the modification and extra- and intracellular accumulation of triglyceride-rich VLDL and IDL particles has not been studied before. Here, we examined the effects of acidic pH on the activity of recombinant human group V secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-V) toward small VLDL (sVLDL), IDL, and LDL, on the binding of these apoB-100-containing lipoproteins to human aortic proteoglycans, and on their uptake by human monocyte-derived macrophages. At acidic pH, the ability of sPLA2-V to lipolyze the apoB-100-containing lipoproteins was moderately, but significantly, increased while binding of the lipoproteins to proteoglycans increased >\u00a060-fold and sPLA2-V-modification further doubled the binding. Moreover, acidic pH more than doubled macrophage uptake of soluble complexes of sPLA2-V\u2013LDL with aortic proteoglycans. Proteoglycan-affinity chromatography at pH 7.5 and 5.5 revealed that sVLDL, IDL, and LDL consisted of populations with different proteoglycan-binding affinities, and, surprisingly, the sVLDL fractions with the highest proteoglycan-affinity contained only low amounts of apolipoproteins E and C-III. Our results suggest that in atherosclerotic lesions with acidic extracellular pH, sPLA2-V is able to lipolyze sVLDL, IDL, and LDL, and increase their binding to proteoglycans. This is likely to provoke extracellular accumulation of lipids derived from these atherogenic lipoprotein particles and to increase the progression of the atherosclerotic lesions.",

     "abstract": "The PAT family of lipid storage droplet proteins comprised five members, each of which has become an established regulator of cellular neutral lipid metabolism. Perilipin 5 (also known as lsdp-5, MLDP, PAT-1, and OXPAT), the most recently discovered member of the family, has been shown to localize to two distinct intracellular pools: the lipid storage droplet (LD), and a poorly characterized cytosolic fraction. We have characterized the denser of these intracellular pools and find that a population of perilipin 5 not associated with large LDs resides in complexes with a discrete density (~\u00a01.15\u00a0g/ml) and size (~\u00a0575\u00a0kDa). Using immunofluorescence, western blotting of isolated sucrose density fractions, native gradient gel electrophoresis, and co-immunoprecipitation, we have shown that these small (~\u00a015\u00a0nm), perilipin 5-encoated structures do not contain the PAT protein perilipin 2 (ADRP), but do contain perilipin 3 and several other as of yet uncharacterized proteins. The size and density of these particles as well as their susceptibility to degradation by lipases suggest that like larger LDs, they have a neutral lipid rich core. When treated with oleic acid to promote neutral lipid deposition, cells ectopically expressing perilipin 5 experienced a reorganization of LDs in the cell, resulting in fewer, larger droplets at the expense of smaller ones. Collectively, these data demonstrate that a portion of cytosolic perilipin 5 resides in high density lipid droplet complexes that participate in cellular neutral lipid accumulation.",

     "abstract": "U73122 which was originally identified as a phospholipase C inhibitor represents a potent direct inhibitor of purified 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) with an IC50 value of 30\u00a0nM. 5-LO catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into leukotrienes which represent mediators involved in inflammatory and allergic reactions and in host defense reactions against microorganisms. Since the efficient inhibition of the human 5-LO enzyme depended on the thiol reactivity of the maleinimide group of U73122, we used this property to identify cysteine residues in the 5-LO protein that are important for 5-LO inhibition by U73122. We found by MALDI-MS that U73122 covalently binds to cysteine residues 99, 159, 248, 264, 416 and 449. Mutation of Cys416 to serine strongly reduces inhibition of 5-LO by U73122 and the additional mutation of three cysteines close to Cys416 further impairs 5-LO inhibition by the compound. Wash out experiments with U73122 and 5-LO indicated an irreversible binding of U73122. Together, our data suggest that the area around Cys416 which is close to the proposed AA entry channel to the active site is an interesting target for the development of new 5-LO inhibitors.",

Recently we detected a pathogen inducible divinyl ether synthase (DES) in flax leaves [Chechetkin, Blufard, Hamberg, Grechkin, 2008]. This prompted us to examine the CYP74 genes in the flax leaf transcriptome. Since the flax genome is not sequenced, we used the PCR approach with degenerate primers related to the conserved domains of selected CYP74 genes; this revealed several CYP74 transcripts in flax leaves. One transcript belongs to the previously described allene oxide synthase (LuAOS, CYP74A, GenBank ID: U00428.1). Another one contains the ORF (1473\u00a0bp) of an unknown CYP74B16 gene. Three more nearly identical sequences, including one expressed pseudogene, were also identified. The recombinant CYP74B16 protein expressed in Escherichia coli had 491 amino acid residues and MW of 56\u00a0kDa. The preferred substrate of this enzyme is the 13-hydroperoxide of \u03b1-linolenic acid, and the reaction product was identified by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV spectroscopy as the divinyl ether (9Z,11E)-12-[(1\u2032Z,3\u2032Z)-hexadienyloxy]-9,11-dodecadienoic acid, (\u03c95Z)-etherolenic acid.

     "abstract": "The association between apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) may significantly impact the function of both proteins, thus affecting the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, apoE/A\u03b2 interactions remain fundamentally defined by the stringency of the detection method. Here we use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a non-stringent approach to the detection of apoE/A\u03b2 interactions in solution, specifically apoE and both endogenous and exogenous A\u03b2 from plasma, CSF and astrocyte conditioned media. By SEC analysis, A\u03b2 association with plasma and CNS lipoproteins is apoE-dependent. While endogenous A\u03b2 elutes to specific human plasma lipoproteins distinct from those containing apoE, it is the apoE-containing lipoproteins that absorb excess amounts of exogenous A\u03b240. In human CSF, apoE, endogenous A\u03b2 and phospholipid elute in an almost identical profile, as do apoE, exogenous A\u03b2 and phospholipid from astrocyte conditioned media. Combining SEC fractionation with subsequent analysis for SDS-stable apoE/A\u03b2 complex reveals that apoE-containing astrocyte lipoproteins exhibit the most robust interactions with A\u03b2. Thus, standardization of the methods for detecting apoE/A\u03b2 complex is necessary to determine its functional significance in the neuropathology characteristic of AD. Importantly, a systematic understanding of the role of apoE-containing plasma and CNS lipoproteins in A\u03b2 homeostasis could potentially contribute to identifying a plasma biomarker currently over-looked because it has multiple components.",

We investigated the impact of membrane incorporation of TFA on cholesterol efflux by exposing J774 mouse macrophages or human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) to media enriched or not (standard medium) with industrially produced elaidic (trans-9 18:1) acid, naturally produced vaccenic (trans-11 18:1) acid (34\u00a0h, 70\u00a0\u03bcM) or palmitic acid. In J774 macrophages, elaidic and palmitic acid, but not vaccenic acid, reduced ABCA1-mediated efflux by ~\u00a023% without affecting aqueous diffusion, SR-BI or ABCG1-mediated pathways, and this effect was maintained in cholesterol-loaded cells. The impact of elaidic acid on the ABCA1 pathway was weaker in cholesterol-normal HMDM, but elaidic acid induced a strong reduction of ABCA1-mediated efflux in cholesterol-loaded cells (\u2212\u00a036%). In J774 cells, the FA supplies had no impact on cellular free cholesterol or cholesteryl ester masses, the abundance of ABCA1 mRNA or the total and plasma membrane ABCA1 protein content. Conversely, TFA or palmitic acid incorporation induced strong modifications of the membrane FA composition with a decrease in the ratio of (cis-monounsaturated FA\u00a0+\u00a0polyunsaturated FA):(saturated FA\u00a0+\u00a0TFA), with elaidic and vaccenic acids representing each 20% and 13% of the total FA composition, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that cellular ATP was required for the effect of elaidic acid, suggesting that it contributes to atherogenesis by impairing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages, likely by decreasing the membrane fluidity, which could thereby reduce ATPase activity and the function of the transporter.",

     "abstract": "Chronic exposure of blood vessels to cardiovascular risk factors such as free fatty acids, LDL-cholesterol, homocysteine and hyperglycemia can give rise to endothelial dysfunction, partially due to decreased synthesis and bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO). Many of these same risk factors have been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in endothelial cells. The objective of this study was to examine the mechanisms responsible for endothelial dysfunction mediated by ER stress. ER stress elevated both intracellular and plasma membrane (PM) cholesterols in BAEC by ~\u00a03-fold, indicated by epifluorescence and cholesterol oxidase methods. Increases in cholesterol levels inversely correlated with neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSMase2) activity, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phospho-activation and NO-production. To confirm that ER stress-induced effects on PM cholesterol were a direct consequence of decreased NSMase2 activity, enzyme expression was either enhanced or knocked down in BAEC. NSMase2 over-expression did not significantly affect cholesterol levels or NO-production, but increased eNOS phosphorylation by ~\u00a01.7-fold. Molecular knock down of NSMase2 decreased eNOS phosphorylation and NO-production by 50% and 40%, respectively while increasing PM cholesterol by 1.7-fold and intracellular cholesterol by 2.7-fold. Furthermore, over-expression of NSMase2 in ER-stressed BAEC lowered cholesterol levels to within control levels as well as nearly doubled the NO production, restoring it to ~\u00a074% and 68% of controls using tunicamycin and palmitate, respectively. This study establishes NSMase2 as a pivotal enzyme in the onset of endothelial ER stress-mediated vascular dysfunction as its inactivation leads to the attenuation of NO production and the elevation of cellular cholesterol.",

Cellular growth and apoptosis may also be influenced by the PC to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio as a reduction in this ratio can result in a loss of membrane integrity. To investigate whether a reduced PC:PE ratio influences cellular growth and apoptosis, we utilized the MT58 cell line, which contains a thermo-sensitive mutation in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-\u03b1, the rate-limiting enzyme for PC biosynthesis. Incubation of MT58 cells at the restrictive temperature of 41\u00a0\u00b0C results in a reduction of cellular PC and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, MT58 cells have a 50% reduction in the PC:PE ratio when incubated at 41\u00a0\u00b0C. In an attempt to normalize the PC:PE ratio, which may stabilize cellular membranes and rescue MT58 cells from apoptosis, the cells were treated with either silencing RNA to impair PE biosynthesis or lysophosphatidylcholine to increase PC mass. Impairing PE biosynthesis in MT58 cells reduced cellular PE and PC concentrations by 30% and 20%, but did not normalize the PC:PE ratio. Loss of both phospholipids enhanced the onset of apoptosis in MT58 cells. Lysophosphatidylcholine normalized cellular PC, increased PE mass by 10%, restored cellular growth and prevented apoptosis of MT58 cells without normalizing the PC:PE ratio. Furthermore, total amount of cellular PC and PE, but not the PC:PE ratio, correlated with cellular growth (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.76), and inversely with cellular apoptosis (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.97).

Using a well-validated rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell culture model of Cox-2 over-expression the current study investigated inter-dependence between Cox-2 and clusterin with respect to induction of expression and impact on NF-\u03baB signalling. Both gene expression and immunoblot analysis confirmed that intracellular and secreted levels of clusterin were elevated in Cox-2 over-expressing cells (PCXII). Clusterin expression was increased in control (PCMT) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner by 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), but not PGE2, and inhibited in PCXII cells by pharmacological Cox inhibition. In PCXII cells, inhibition of two transcription factors known to be activated by 15d-PGJ2, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b3, by transcription factor oligonucleotide decoy and antagonist (GW9662) treatment, respectively, reduced clusterin expression. While PCXII cells exhibited reduced TNF-\u03b1-induced cell surface ICAM-1 expression, IkB phosphorylation and degradation were similar to control cells. With respect to the impact of Cox-2-dependent clusterin upregulation on NF-\u03baB signalling, basal levels of I\u03baB were similar in control and PCXII cells, and no evidence for a physical association between clusterin and phospho-I\u03baB was obtained. Moreover, while PCXII cells exhibited reduced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, this was not restored by clusterin knock-down. These results indicate that Cox-2 induces clusterin in a 15d-PGJ2-dependent manner, and via activation of HSF-1 and PPAR\u03b3.

     "abstract": "Metabolic conversion of vitamin A (retinol) into retinoic acid (RA) controls numerous physiological processes. 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, is a high affinity ligand for retinoid X receptor (RXR) and also activates retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Despite the identification of candidate enzymes that produce 9cRA and the importance of RXRs as established by knockout experiments, in vivo detection of 9cRA in tissue was elusive until recently when 9cRA was identified as an endogenous pancreas retinoid by validated liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) methodology. This review will discuss the current status of the analysis, occurrence, and function of 9cRA. Understanding both the nuclear receptor-mediated and non-genomic mechanisms of 9cRA will aid in the elucidation of disease physiology and possibly lead to the development of new retinoid-based therapeutics.

Points of interest are the different changes in the ligand-binding pocket induced by variously shaped agonists, the communication of the ligand-bound pocket with the coactivator binding surface and the heterodimerization interface, and recently identified ligands that are natural products, those that function as environmental toxins or drugs that had been originally designed to interact with other targets, as well as those that were deliberately designed as RXR-selective transcriptional agonists, synergists, or antagonists. Of these synthetic ligands, the general trend in design appears to be away from fully aromatic rigid structures to those containing partial elements of the flexible tetraene side chain of 9-cis-retinoic acid.

     "abstract": "As the promiscuous partner of heterodimeric associations, retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play a key role within the Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily. Some of the heterodimers (PPAR/RXR, LXR/RXR, FXR/RXR) are \u201cpermissive\u201d as they become transcriptionally active in the sole presence of either an RXR-selective ligand (\u201crexinoid\u201d) or a NR partner ligand. In contrast, \u201cnon-permissive\u201d heterodimers (including RAR/RXR, VDR/RXR and TR/RXR) are unresponsive to rexinoids alone but these agonists superactivate transcription by synergizing with partner agonists. Despite their promiscuity in heterodimer formation and activation of multiple pathways, RXR is a target for drug discovery. Indeed, a rexinoid is used in the clinic for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In addition to cancer RXR modulators hold therapeutical potential for the treatment of metabolic diseases. The modulation potential of the rexinoid (as agonist or antagonist ligand) is dictated by the precise conformation of the ligand\u2013receptor complexes and the nature and extent of their interaction with co-regulators, which determine the specific physiological responses through transcription modulation of cognate gene networks. Notwithstanding the advances in this field, it is not yet possible to predict the correlation between ligand structure and physiological response. We will focus on this review on the modulation of PPAR\u03b3/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer activities by rexinoids. The genetic and pharmacological data from animal models of insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity demonstrate that RXR agonists and antagonists have promise as anti-obesity agents. However, the treatment with rexinoids raises triglycerides levels, suppresses the thyroid hormone axis, and induces hepatomegaly, which has complicated the development of these compounds as therapeutic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The discovery of PPAR\u03b3/RXR and LXR/RXR heterodimer-selective rexinoids, which act differently than PPAR\u03b3 or LXR agonists, might overcome some of these limitations.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for humans and is converted to the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and to the hormone, retinoic acid. Vitamin A in animal-derived foods is found as long chain acyl esters of retinol and these are digested to free fatty acids and retinol before uptake by the intestinal mucosal cell. The retinol is then reesterified to retinyl esters for incorporation into chlylomicrons and absorbed via the lymphatics or effluxed into the portal circulation facilitated by the lipid transporter, ABCA1. Provitamin A carotenoids such as \u03b2-carotene are found in plant-derived foods. These and other carotenoids are transported into the mucosal cell by scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Provitamin A carotenoids are partly converted to retinol by oxygenase and reductase enzymes and the retinol so produced is available for absorption via the two pathways described above. The efficiency of vitamin A and carotenoid intestinal absorption is determined by the regulation of a number of proteins involved in the process. Polymorphisms in genes for these proteins lead to individual variability in the metabolism and transport of vitamin A and carotenoids.

     "abstract": "Humans depend on a dietary intake of lipids to maintain optimal health. Among various classes of dietary lipids, the physiological importance of carotenoids is still controversially discussed. On one hand, it is well established that carotenoids, such as \u03b2,\u03b2-carotene, are a major source for vitamin A that plays critical roles for vision and many aspects of cell physiology. On the other hand, large clinical trials have failed to show clear health benefits of carotenoids supplementation and even suggest adverse health effects in individuals at risk of disease. In recent years, key molecular players for carotenoid metabolism have been identified, including an evolutionarily well conserved family of carotenoid-oxygenases. Studies in knockout mouse models for these enzymes revealed that carotenoid metabolism is a highly regulated process and that this regulation already takes place at the level of intestinal absorption. These studies also provided evidence that \u03b2,\u03b2-carotene conversion can influence retinoid-dependent processes in the mouse embryo and in adult tissues. Moreover, these analyses provide an explanation for adverse health effects of carotenoids by showing that a pathological accumulation of these compounds can induce oxidative stress in mitochondria and cell signaling pathways related to disease. Advancing knowledge about carotenoid metabolism will contribute to a better understanding of the biochemical and physiological roles of these important micronutrients in health and disease.

Studies of the molecular basis of vision have provided important insights into the intricate mechanistic details of the function, transport and recycling of vitamin A and its derivatives (retinoid). This review focuses on retinoid-related membrane receptors and transporters. Three kinds of mammalian membrane receptors and transporters are discussed: opsins, best known as vitamin A-based light sensors in vision; ABCA4, an ATP-dependent transporter specializes in the transport of vitamin A derivative; and STRA6, a recently identified membrane receptor that mediates cellular uptake of vitamin A. The evolutionary driving forces for their existence and the wide spectrum of human diseases associated with these proteins are discussed.

     "abstract": "In mammals, dietary vitamin A intake is essential for the maintenance of adequate retinoid (vitamin A and metabolites) supply of tissues and organs. Retinoids are taken up from animal or plant sources and subsequently stored in form of hydrophobic, biologically inactive retinyl esters (REs). Accessibility of these REs in the intestine, the circulation, and their mobilization from intracellular lipid droplets depends on the hydrolytic action of RE hydrolases (REHs). In particular, the mobilization of hepatic RE stores requires REHs to maintain steady plasma retinol levels thereby assuring constant vitamin A supply in times of food deprivation or inadequate vitamin A intake. In this review, we focus on the roles of extracellular and intracellular REHs in vitamin A metabolism. Furthermore, we will discuss the tissue-specific function of REHs and highlight major gaps in the understanding of RE catabolism.

     "abstract": "The liver is the most important tissue site in the body for uptake of postprandial retinoid, as well as for retinoid storage. Within the liver, both hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are importantly involved in retinoid metabolism. Hepatocytes play an indispensable role in uptake and processing of dietary retinoid into the liver, and in synthesis and secretion of retinol-binding protein (RBP), which is required for mobilizing hepatic retinoid stores. HSCs are the central cellular site for retinoid storage in the healthy animal, accounting for as much as 50\u201360% of the total retinoid present in the entire body. The liver is also an important target organ for retinoid actions. Retinoic acid is synthesized in the liver and can interact with retinoid receptors which control expression of a large number of genes involved in hepatic processes. Altered retinoid metabolism and the accompanying dysregulation of retinoid signaling in the liver contribute to hepatic disease. This is related to HSCs, which contribute significantly to the development of hepatic disease when they undergo a process of cellular activation. HSC activation results in the loss of HSC retinoid stores and changes in extracellular matrix deposition leading to the onset of liver fibrosis. An association between hepatic disease progression and decreased hepatic retinoid storage has been demonstrated. In this review article, we summarize the essential role of the liver in retinoid metabolism and consider briefly associations between hepatic retinoid metabolism and disease.

     "abstract": "A major goal in vision research over the past few decades has been to understand the molecular details of retinoid processing within the retinoid (visual) cycle. This includes the consequences of side reactions that result from delayed all-trans-retinal clearance and condensation with phospholipids that characterize a variety of serious retinal diseases. Knowledge of the basic retinoid biochemistry involved in these diseases is essential for development of effective therapeutics. Photoisomerization of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin triggers a complex set of metabolic transformations collectively termed phototransduction that ultimately lead to light perception. Continuity of vision depends on continuous conversion of all-trans-retinal back to the 11-cis-retinal isomer. This process takes place in a series of reactions known as the retinoid cycle, which occur in photoreceptor and RPE cells. All-trans-retinal, the initial substrate of this cycle, is a chemically reactive aldehyde that can form toxic conjugates with proteins and lipids. Therefore, much experimental effort has been devoted to elucidate molecular mechanisms of the retinoid cycle and all-trans-retinal-mediated retinal degeneration, resulting in delineation of many key steps involved in regenerating 11-cis-retinal. Three particularly important reactions are catalyzed by enzymes broadly classified as acyltransferases, short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases and carotenoid/retinoid isomerases/oxygenases.

     "abstract": "All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) provides essential support to diverse biological systems and physiological processes. Epithelial differentiation and its relationship to cancer, and embryogenesis have typified intense areas of interest into atRA function. Recently, however, interest in atRA action in the nervous system, the immune system, energy balance and obesity has increased considerably, especially concerning postnatal function. atRA action depends on atRA biosynthesis: defects in retinoid-dependent processes increasingly relate to defects in atRA biogenesis. Considerable evidence indicates that physiological atRA biosynthesis occurs via a regulated process, consisting of a complex interaction of retinoid binding-proteins and retinoid recognizing enzymes. An accrual of biochemical, physiological and genetic data have identified specific functional outcomes for the retinol dehydrogenases, RDH1, RDH10, and DHRS9, as physiological catalysts of the first step in atRA biosynthesis, and for the retinal dehydrogenases RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3, as catalysts of the second and irreversible step. Each of these enzymes associates with explicit biological processes mediated by atRA. Redundancy occurs, but seems limited. Cumulative data support a model of interactions among these enzymes with retinoid binding-proteins, with feedback regulation and/or control by atRA via modulating gene expression of multiple participants. The ratio apo-CRBP1/holo-CRBP1 participates by influencing retinol flux into and out of storage as retinyl esters, thereby modulating substrate to support atRA biosynthesis. atRA biosynthesis requires the presence of both an RDH and an RALDH: conversely, absence of one isozyme of either step does not indicate lack of atRA biosynthesis at the site.

     "abstract": "Vitamin A, retinol, circulates in blood bound to serum retinol binding protein (RBP) and is transported into cells by a membrane protein termed stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6). It was reported that serum levels of RBP are elevated in obese rodents and humans, and that increased level of RBP in blood causes insulin resistance. A molecular mechanism by which RBP can exert such an effect is suggested by the recent discovery that STRA6 is not only a vitamin A transporter but also functions as a surface signaling receptor. Binding of RBP\u2013ROH to STRA6 induces the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the receptor C-terminus, thereby activating a JAK/STAT signaling cascade. Consequently, in STRA6-expressing cells such as adipocytes, RBP\u2013ROH induces the expression of STAT target genes, including SOCS3, which suppresses insulin signaling, and PPAR\u03b3, which enhances lipid accumulation. RBP\u2013retinol thus joins the myriad of cytokines, growth factors and hormones which regulate gene transcription by activating cell surface receptors that signal through activation of Janus kinases and their associated transcription factors STATs.

     "abstract": "Evidence has accumulated that specific retinoids impact on developmental and biochemical processes influencing mammalian adiposity including adipogenesis, lipogenesis, adaptive thermogenesis, lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in tissues. Treatment with retinoic acid, in particular, has been shown to reduce body fat and improve insulin sensitivity in lean and obese rodents by enhancing fat mobilization and energy utilization systemically, in tissues including brown and white adipose tissues, skeletal muscle and the liver. Nevertheless, controversial data have been reported, particularly regarding retinoids' effects on hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and blood lipid profile. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying retinoid effects on lipid metabolism are complex and remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a brief overview of mammalian lipid metabolism and its control, introduce mechanisms through which retinoids can impact on lipid metabolism, and review reported activities of retinoids on different aspects of lipid metabolism in key tissues, focusing on retinoic acid. Possible implications of this knowledge in the context of the management of obesity and the metabolic syndrome are also addressed.

     "abstract": "Morbidity and mortality associated with increased white fat accumulation in visceral fat depots have focused attention on the pathways regulating the development of this tissue during embryogenesis, in adulthood, and while under the influence of obesogenic diets. Adipocytes undergo clonal expansion, differentiation (adipogenesis) and maturation through a complex network of transcriptional factors, most of which are expressed at similar levels in visceral and subcutaneous fat. Rigorous research attempts to unfold the pathways regulating expression and activity of adipogenic transcription factors that act in a fat-depot-specific manner. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is the master regulator of adipogenesis, and is expressed at higher levels in subcutaneous than in visceral depots. PPAR\u03b3 expression in adipogenesis is mediated by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and several transcription factors acting in conjunction with C/EBPs, although alternative pathways through zinc-finger protein-423 (ZFP423) transcription factor are sufficient to induce PPAR\u03b3 expression and adipogenesis. Vitamin A and its metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acid, are transcriptionally-active molecules. Retinoic acid is generated from retinaldehyde in adipose tissue by the aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 family of enzymes (Aldh1). In this review, we discuss the role of Aldh1 enzymes in the generation of retinoic acid during adipogenesis, in the regulation of the transcriptional network of PPAR\u03b3 in a fat-depot-specific manner, and the important contribution of this autocrine pathway in the development of visceral obesity.

     "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A (retinol) that controls growth and development. The first step of RA synthesis is controlled by enzymes of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) families that catalyze oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde. The second step of RA synthesis is controlled by members of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) family also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) that further oxidize retinaldehyde to produce RA. RA functions as a ligand for DNA-binding RA receptors that directly regulate transcription of specific target genes. Elucidation of the vitamin A metabolic pathway and investigation of the endogenous function of vitamin A metabolites has been greatly improved by development of mouse ADH, RDH, and RALDH loss-of-function models. ADH knockouts have demonstrated a postnatal role for this enzyme family in clearance of excess retinol to prevent vitamin A toxicity and in generation of RA for postnatal survival during vitamin A deficiency. A point mutation in Rdh10 generated by ethylnitrosourea has demonstrated that RDH10 generates much of the retinaldehyde needed for RA synthesis during embryonic development. Raldh1, Raldh2, and Raldh3 knockouts have demonstrated that RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3 generate most of the RA needed during embryogenesis. These mouse models serve as instrumental tools for providing new insight into retinoid function. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Retinoid and Lipid Metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) acts by binding to nuclear RA receptors (RARs) to regulate a broad spectrum of downstream target genes in most cell types examined. In cytoplasm, RA binds specifically to cellular retinoic acid binding proteins I (CRABPI), and II. Although the function of CRABPI in animals remains the subject of debate, it is believed that CRABPI binding facilitates RA metabolism, thereby modulating the concentration of RA and the type of RA metabolites in cells. The basal promoter of the CrabpI gene is a housekeeping promoter that can be regulated by thyroid hormones (T3), DNA methylation, sphinganine, and ethanol acting on its upstream regulatory region. T3 regulation of CrabpI is mediated by the binding of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) to a TR response element (TRE) approximately 1 kb upstream of the basal promoter. Specifically, in the adipocyte differentiation process, T3 regulation is bimodal and closely associated with the cellular differentiation status: T3 activates CrabpI in predifferentiated cells (e.g., mesenchymal precursors or fibroblasts), but suppresses this gene once cells are committed to adipocyte differentiation. These disparate effects are functions of T3-triggered differential recruitment of coregulatory complexes in conjunction with chromatin looping/folding that alters the configuration of this genomic locus along adipocyte differentiation. Subsequent sliding, disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes occur, resulting in specific changes in the conformation of the basal promoter chromatin at different stages of differentiation. This chapter summarizes studies illustrating the epigenetic regulation of CrabpI expression during adipocyte differentiation. Understanding the pathways regulating CrabpI in this specific context might help to illuminate the physiological role of CRABPI in vivo.

     "abstract": "The vitamin A (retinol) metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), is a signaling molecule that plays key roles in the development of the body plan and induces the differentiation of many types of cells. In this review the physiological and pathophysiological roles of retinoids (retinol and related metabolites) in mature animals are discussed. Both in the developing embryo and in the adult, RA signaling via combinatorial Hox gene expression is important for cell positional memory. The genes that require RA for the maturation/differentiation of T cells are only beginning to be cataloged, but it is clear that retinoids play a major role in expression of key genes in the immune system. An exciting, recent publication in regeneration research shows that ALDH1a2 (RALDH2), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of RA from retinaldehyde, is highly induced shortly after amputation in the regenerating heart, adult fin, and larval fin in zebrafish. Thus, local generation of RA presumably plays a key role in fin formation during both embryogenesis and in fin regeneration. HIV transgenic mice and human patients with HIV-associated kidney disease exhibit a profound reduction in the level of RAR\u03b2 protein in the glomeruli, and HIV transgenic mice show reduced retinol dehydrogenase levels, concomitant with a greater than 3-fold reduction in endogenous RA levels in the glomeruli. Levels of endogenous retinoids (those synthesized from retinol within cells) are altered in many different diseases in the lung, kidney, and central nervous system, contributing to pathophysiology.

These precise levels of RA are achieved by regulating several steps in the conversion of dietary vitamin A (retinol) to RA and RA catabolism.

     "abstract": "Retinoids, the metabolically-active structural derivatives of vitamin A, are critical signaling molecules in many fundamental biological processes including cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Emerging evidence, both clinical and molecular, implicates retinoids in atherosclerosis and other vasculoproliferative disorders such as restenosis. Although the data from clinical trials examining effect of vitamin A and vitamin precursors on cardiac events have been contradictory, this data does suggest that retinoids do influence fundamental processes relevant to atherosclerosis. Preclinical animal model and cellular studies support these concepts. Retinoids exhibit complex effects on proliferation, growth, differentiation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), including responses to injury and atherosclerosis. Retinoids also appear to exert important inhibitory effects on thrombosis and inflammatory responses relevant to atherogenesis. Recent studies suggest retinoids may also be involved in vascular calcification and endothelial function, for example, by modulating nitric oxide pathways. In addition, established retinoid effects on lipid metabolism and adipogenesis may indirectly influence inflammation and atherosclerosis. Collectively, these observations underscore the scope and complexity of retinoid effects relevant to vascular disease. Additional studies are needed to elucidate how context and metabolite-specific retinoid effects affect atherosclerosis.

Most LOXs constitute single polypeptide chain proteins that fold into a two-domain structure. In the crystal structure the two domains are tightly associated, but small angle X-ray scattering data and dynamic fluorescence studies suggested a high degree of structural flexibility involving movement of the N-terminal domain relative to catalytic subunit. When we inspected the interdomain interface we have found a limited number of side-chain contacts which are involved in interactions of these two structural subunits. One of such contact points involves tyrosine 98 of N-terminal domain. This aromatic amino acid is invariant in vertebrate LOXs regardless of overall sequence identity. To explore in more detail the role of aromatic interactions in interdomain association we have mutated Y98 to various residues and quantified the structural and functional consequences of these alterations. We have found that loss of an aromatic moiety at position 98 impaired the catalytic activity and membrane binding capacity of the mutant enzymes. Although CD and fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type and mutant enzyme species were indistinguishable, the mutation led to enlargement of the molecular shape of the enzyme as detected by analytic gel filtration and this structural alteration was shown to be associated with a loss of protein thermal stability.

The final step in TG biosynthesis is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes. Lack of whole body DGAT1 is associated with reduced lipid-induced inflammation. Since one major component of atherosclerosis is chronic inflammation we hypothesized that DGAT1 deficiency might ameliorate atherosclerotic lesion development. We therefore crossbred Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE\u2212/\u2212) mice with Dgat1\u2212/\u2212 mice.

The reduced lesion size was associated with decreased cholesterol uptake and absorption by the intestine, reduced plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations and increased cholesterol efflux from macrophages. The expression of adhesion molecules was reduced in aortas of ApoE\u2212/\u2212Dgat1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which might be the reason for less migration capacities of monocytes and macrophages and the observed decreased amount of macrophages within the plaques.

In this study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanisms of Tgase-2 in SPC-induced K8 phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization in PANC-1 cells (PANWT), and in PANC-1 cells that stably expressed shTgase-2 or Tgase-2 (PANshTg2 and PANTg2). SPC induces the expression of Tgase-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Gene silencing of Tgase-2 or cystamine suppressed the SPC-induced phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization of K8 and suppressed the SPC-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. An inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), SP600125, suppressed the SPC-induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8 and keratin reorganization. Next, we examined the effect of Tgase-2 on JNK activation of serine 431 phosphorylation in K8. Tgase-2 gene silencing suppressed the expression of active form JNK (pJNK). Constitutive or tetracyclin-induced conditional expression of Tgase-2 increased the levels of pJNK. Tgase-2 was coimmunoprecipitated with K8 and JNK. In addition, K8 was coimmunoprecipitated with Tgase-2 and JNK. JNK was also coimmunoprecipitated with K8 and Tgase-2. Overall, these results suggest that Tgase-2 is involved in SPC-induced phosphorylation and perinuclear reorganization of K8 by activating JNK and forming a triple complex with K8 and JNK.

In the present study we investigated a possible link between TAG and PE metabolism by analyzing the contribution of the four different PE biosynthetic pathways to TAG formation, namely de novo PE synthesis via Psd1p and Psd2p, the CDP-ethanolamine (CDP-Etn) pathway and lyso-PE acylation by Ale1p. In cells grown on the non-fermentable carbon source lactate supplemented with 5\u00a0mM ethanolamine (Etn) the CDP-Etn pathway contributed most to the cellular TAG level, whereas mutations in the other pathways displayed only minor effects. In cki1\u2206dpl1\u2206eki1\u2206 mutants bearing defects in the CDP-Etn pathway both the cellular and the microsomal levels of PE were markedly decreased, whereas in other mutants of PE biosynthetic routes depletion of this aminoglycerophospholipid was less pronounced in microsomes. This observation is important because Lro1p similar to the enzymes of the CDP-Etn pathway is a component of the ER. We conclude from these results that in cki1\u2206dpl1\u2206eki1\u2206 insufficient supply of PE to the PDAT Lro1p was a major reason for the strongly reduced TAG level. Moreover, we found that Lro1p activity was markedly decreased in cki1\u2206dpl1\u2206eki1\u2206, although transcription of LRO1 was not affected. Our findings imply that (i) TAG and PE syntheses in the yeast are tightly linked; and (ii) TAG formation by the PDAT Lro1p strongly depends on PE synthesis through the CDP-Etn pathway. Moreover, it is very likely that local availability of PE in microsomes is crucial for TAG synthesis through the Lro1p reaction.",

     "abstract": "Potato aspartic proteases (StAPs) and their swaposin domain (StAsp-PSI) are proteins with cytotoxic activity which involves plasma membrane destabilization. The ability of these proteins to produce cell death varies with the cellular type. Therefore, StAPs and StAsp-PSI selective cytotoxicity could be attributed to the different membrane lipid compositions of target cells. In this work we investigate the possible mechanism by which StAPs and StAsp-PSI produce selective membrane destabilization. Results obtained from leakage assays show that StAsp-PSI is a potent inducer of the leakage of LUVs containing anionic phospholipids, especially those containing phosphatidylglycerol. Based in these results, we suggest that the cytotoxic activity of StAsp-PSI on pathogenic microorganisms could be mediated by the attraction between the exposed positive domains of StAsp-PSI and the negatively charged microorganism membrane. On the other hand, our circular dichroism spectroscopic measurements and analysis by size exclusion chromatography and followed by electrophoresis, indicate that hydrophobic environment is necessary to StAsp-PSI oligomerization and both StAsp-PSI disulfide bounds and membrane with negative charged phospholipids are required by StAsp-PSI to produce membrane destabilization and then induce cell death in tumors and microorganism cell targets. Additionally, we demonstrate that the presence of cholesterol into the LUV membranes strongly diminishes the capacity of StAsp-PSI to produce leakage. This result suggests that the lack of hemolytic and cytotoxic activities on human lymphocytes of StAsp-PSI/StAPs may be partly due by the presence of cholesterol in these cell membrane types.",

In this study, we used pharmacological methods to investigate the role of RBP4. RNA oligonucleotide against RBP4 (anti-RBP4 oligo) was transfected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. RT-PCR analysis showed that RBP4 mRNA expression decreased by 55% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared with control cells. Validated RNA oligo was used in an in vivo study with high fat diet (HFD) fed \u2014 mice. 14\u00a0weeks of HFD feeding increased RBP4 expression (associated with elevated serum levels measured with immunoblotting and ELISA) by 56% in adipose tissue (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 68% in the liver (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Adipose RBP4 levels were significantly reduced after 4\u00a0weeks treatment with anti-RBP4 oligo (25\u00a0mg/kg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and rosiglitazone (RSG, 10\u00a0mg/kg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with scrambled RNA oligo (25\u00a0mg/kg) treated mice. Only anti-RBP4 oligo significantly inhibited RBP4 protein (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and mRNA expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the liver and reduced serum RBP4 levels. Anti-RBP4 oligo and RSG showed comparable effects on impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. Anti-RBP4 oligo significantly enhanced adipose-GLUT4 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but did not increase muscle-GLUT4. Both RSG and anti-RBP4 oligo significantly reduced hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Histological analysis revealed that anti-RBP4 oligo ameliorated hepatic steatosis and reduced lipid droplets associated with normalized liver function. Histological and pharmacological results of this study indicate that RBP4 is not only an adipocytokine, but also a hepatic cytokine leading to metabolic syndrome, NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.",

In order to gain greater understanding of the mechanistic basis and capability of the 8\u03b2-hydroxylase we have transformed a range of structurally diverse androgens and progestogens with this organism. This has revealed that both steroid types can be hydroxylated at the 8\u03b2-position. The collective data has demonstrated the first time that 8\u03b2-hydroxylation occurs through inverted binding within a 9\u03b1-hydroxylase of the fungus. In the case of the progestogens, for this to occur, the presence of 17\u03b1-oxygen functionality (alcohol or epoxide) was essential. Remarkably monohydroxylation of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone at carbons 8\u03b2 and 15\u03b2 has strongly indicated that the responsible hydroxylase has 2 different binding sites for the ring-A ketone. Unusually, with one exception, all hydroxylation occurred at axial protons and in the case of the progestogens, all above the plane of the ring system. In general all maximally oxidised metabolites contained four oxygen atoms. The importance of these findings in relation to 8\u03b2-hydroxylation of these steroids is discussed.",

In this paper, we studied the interaction between apoA-I and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) to relate with PL-C\u03b3 function for generation of HDL-like lipoproteins in the apoA-I-stimulated astrocytes. ABCA1 co-migrated with exogenous apoA-I with apparent molecular weight over 260\u00a0kDa on SDS-PAGE when rat astrocytes were treated with apoA-I and then with a cross-linker, BS3. The solubilized ABCA1 of rat astrocytes was associated with the apoA-I-immobilized Affi-Gel 15. An LXR agonist, To901317, increased the cellular level of ABCA1, association of apoA-I with ABCA1 and apoA-I-mediated lipid release in rat astrocytoma GA-1/Mock cells where ABCA1 expression at baseline is very low. PL-C\u03b3 was co-isolated by apoA-I-immobilized Affi-Gel 15 and co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ABCA1 antibody along with ABCA1 from the solubilized membrane fraction of rat astrocytes. The SiRNA of ABCA1 suppressed not only the PL-C\u03b3 binding to ABCA1 but also the tyrosine phosphorylation of PL-C\u03b3. A PL-C inhibitor, U73122, prevented generation of apoA-I-mediated HDL-like lipoproteins in rat astrocytes. To901317 increased the association of PL-C\u03b3 with ABCA1 in GA-1/Mock cells dependently on the increase of cellular level of ABCA1 without changing that of PL-C\u03b3. These findings suggest that the exogenous apoA-I augments the interaction between PL-C\u03b3 and ABCA1 to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PL-C\u03b3 for generation of HDL-like lipoproteins in astrocytes.",

     "abstract": "Conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) exhibit growth inhibitory effects on colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. To investigate whether the anticancerogenic potency depends on number or configuration of the conjugated double bonds, the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; C18:2) isomers and conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA; C18:3) isomers on viability and growth of HT-29 cells were compared. Low concentrations of CLnAs (<\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcM) yielded a higher degree of inhibitory effects compared to CLAs (40\u00a0\u03bcM). All trans-CFAs were more effective compared to cis/trans-CFAs as follows: t9,t11,t13-CLnA\u00a0\u2265\u00a0c9,t11,t13-CLnA\u00a0>\u00a0t11,t13-CLA\u00a0\u2265\u00a0t9,t11-CLA\u00a0>\u00a0c9,t11-CLA. The mRNA expression analysis of important genes associated with fatty acid metabolism showed an absence of \u22065-/\u22066-desaturases and elongases in HT-29 cells, which was confirmed by fatty acid analysis. Using time- and dose-dependent stimulation experiments several metabolites were determined. Low concentrations of all trans-CFAs (5\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM) led to dose-dependent increase of conjugated t/t-C16:2 formed by \u03b2-oxidation of C18 CFAs, ranging from 1\u20135% of total FAME. Importantly, it was found that CLnA is converted to CLA and that CLA is inter-converted (t11,t13-CLA is metabolized to c9,t11-CLA) by HT-29 cells. In summary, our study shows that growth inhibition of human cancer cells is associated with a specific cellular transcriptomic and metabolic profile of fatty acid metabolism, which might contribute to the diversified ability of CFAs as anti-cancer compounds.",

In the present study, extracellular level of triacylglycerols (TG), a major sebum component, as well as intracellular TG accumulation was augmented in insulin-differentiated hamster sebocytes (DHS). The DHS exhibited phosphatidylserine exposure in an apoptosis-independent manner. In addition, intracellular ATP level and membrane-transporter activity using a substrate, Rhodamine 123, were highly detectable in the DHS rather than in the undifferentiated hamster sebocytes. A membrane-transporter activating reagent, 2\u2032(3\u2032)-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl) adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (BzATP), enhanced transporter activity, extracellular TG level, and phosphatidylserine exposure in the DHS. Both transporter activity and TG secretion were suppressed by R-verapamil, a potent membrane-transporter inhibitor, in the BzATP-treated and untreated DHS. Furthermore, the gene expression and production of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) were augmented in the DHS. ABCB1 was also detectable in sebaceous glands in the skin of hamsters. Moreover, the cell-differentiation- and BzATP-augmented transporter activity and TG secretion were dose-dependently inhibited by adding not only an ABCB1 antibody but also a selective inhibitor of ABCB1, PSC833. Thus, these results provide novel evidence that ABCB1 is involved in sebum secretion in the DHS, which is associated with non-apoptotic phosphatidylserine exposure and the increased level of intracellular ATP. These findings should accelerate the understanding of sebum secretion occurring in a holocrine-independent manner in sebaceous glands, and may contribute to the development of therapies for sebaceous gland disorders such as acne, seborrhea, and xerosis.",

Here, we describe a complex pattern of modulation of the peptidolytic activity of cathepsin D by sphingolipids. A panel of sphingolipid derivatives was screened in a FRET-based assay; these molecules demonstrated negative or positive modulation of cathepsin D peptidolytic activity, depending on the sphingolipid structure. Certain sphingosines and ceramides inhibited cathepsin D in the submicromolar range, and structural requirements for this inhibitory effect were evaluated. The interaction of cathepsin D with sphingolipids was also demonstrated by fluorescence polarization measurements and determined to follow a competitive inhibition mode. In contrast, monoester phosphosphingolipids, especially ceramide-1-phosphate, were identified as activators of cathepsin D peptidolytic activity at submicromolar concentrations. Thus, sphingolipids and phosphosphingolipids, known to be antagonistic in their cell-signaling functions, displayed opposite modulation of cathepsin D. Sphingolipid-based modulators of cathepsin D are potentially involved in the control of cathepsin D-dependent processes and might serve as a scaffold for the development of novel regulators of this therapeutic target.",

In the current study, its impact on adipose tissue and adipocytes was studied. In microarray experiments, the set of genes regulated by apo-10-lycac treatments was compared to the set of genes regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the natural ligand of RAR, in adipocytes. Approximately 27.5% of the genes regulated by apo-10-lycac treatments were also regulated by ATRA, suggesting a common ability in terms of gene expression modulation, possibly via RAR transactivation. The physiological impact of apo-10-lycac on adipose tissue biology was evaluated. If it had no effect on adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 cell model, this metabolite may have a preventative effect against inflammation, by preventing the increase in the inflammatory markers, interleukin 6 and interleukin 1\u03b2 in various dedicated models. The ability of apo-10-lycac to transactivate the RAR and to modulate the transcription of RAR target gene was brought in vivo in adipose tissue. While apo-10-lycac was not detected in adipose tissue, a metabolite with a molecular weight with 2\u00a0Da larger mass was detected, suggesting that a dihydro-apo-10'-lycopenoic acid, may be present in adipose tissue and that this compound could active or may lead to further active RAR-activating apo-10-lycac metabolites. Since apo-10-lycac treatments induce anti-inflammatory effects in adipose tissue but do not inhibit adipogenesis, we propose that apo-10-lycac treatments and its potential active metabolites in WAT may be considered for prevention strategies relevant for obesity-associated pathologies.",

We compared TripA and apoA-I for important properties in reverse cholesterol transport. Reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL) containing TripA or apoA-I together with palmitoyl-2-oleyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) differed slightly by size. Compared to apoA-I, TripA activated lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) with similar maximal velocity but concentration leading to half maximal velocity was slightly reduced (Km\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL vs. 0.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Both in the lipid-free form and as part of rHDL, TripA elicited cholesterol efflux from THP1-derived macrophages with similar kinetic parameters and response to liver-X-receptor activation as apoA-I. Lipid-free TripA is bound and transported by aortic endothelial cells through mechanisms which are competed by apoA-I and TripA and inhibited by knock-down of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1. Pre-formed TripA/POPC particles were bound and transported by endothelial cells through mechanisms which are competed by excess native HDL as well as reconstituted HDL containing either apoA-I or TripA and which involve ABCG1 and scavenger receptor B1 (SR-BI). In conclusion, apoA-I and TripA show similar in vitro properties which are important for reverse cholesterol transport. These findings are important for further development of TripA as an anti-atherosclerotic drug.",

     "abstract": "Brain specific kinases 1 and 2 (BRSK1/2, also named SAD kinases) are serine\u2013threonine kinases specifically expressed in the brain, and activated by LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue at their T-loop (Thr189/174 in human BRSK1/2). BRSKs are crucial for establishing neuronal polarity, and BRSK1 has also been shown to regulate neurotransmitter release presynaptically. How BRSK1 exerts this latter function is unknown, since its substrates at the synaptic terminal and the mechanisms modulating its activity remain to be described. Key regulators of neurotransmitter release, such as SNARE complex proteins, are located at membrane rafts. Therefore we initially undertook this work to check whether BRSK1 also locates at these membrane microdomains. Here we show that brain BRSK1, but not BRSK2, is palmitoylated, and provide biochemical and pharmacological evidences demonstrating that a pool of BRSK1, but not BRSK2 or LKB1, localizes at membrane lipid rafts. We also show that raft-associated BRSK1 has higher activity than BRSK1 from non-raft environment, based on a higher T-loop phosphorylation at Thr-189. Further, recombinant BRSK1 activity increased 3-fold when assayed with small multilamellar vesicles (SMV) generated with lipids extracted from synaptosomal raft fractions. A similar BRSK1-activating effect was obtained with synthetic SMV made with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, mixed in the same molar ratio at which these three major lipids are present in rafts. Importantly, SMV also enhanced the activity of a constitutively active BRSK1 (T189E), underpinning that interaction with lipid rafts represents a new mechanism of BRSK1 activity modulation, additional to T-loop phosphorylation.",

We and others have previously reported that synthetic LXR agonists reduced atherosclerosis in models of mouse with no detectable plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity, which plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport. In the present study, we investigated the effect of LXR activation in rabbits to elucidate the influence of CETP activity. First, we cloned rabbit LXRs cDNA. The data indicated that rabbit LXR\u03b1 was mostly highly expressed in the liver, whereas LXR\u03b2 expression was ubiquitous. Next, we investigated the effect of LXR agonist on lipid levels. Treatment with LXR agonist T0901317 increased plasma CETP activity and consequently elevated LDL, but no change in HDL. High cholesterol (HC) diet-feeding, which is thought to provide oxysterols as the natural agonists, could also increase expression of CETP and other LXR target genes. Finally, we tested T0901317 in the atherosclerosis intervention study. Chronic administration of T0901317 significantly reduced atherosclerosis in HC diet-fed rabbits despite less favorable lipid profiles, i.e. increases of plasma triglycerides and no change of HDL. T0901317 induced ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and suppressed inflammatory genes expression in the aorta, suggesting that direct actions of LXR agonist on vascular gene expression are likely to contribute to the antiatherogenic effect. The present work strongly supports the idea that LXR agonists could be beneficial as therapeutic agents for treatment of atherosclerosis.",

Although estrogen replacement therapy increases serum levels of apoAI and HDL, it does not seem to reduce the cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Therefore, we investigated the effects of estrogen on apoM expression in vitro and in vivo. HepG2 cells were incubated with different concentrations of estrogen with or without the estrogen receptor antagonist, fulvestrant, and apoM expression in the cells was determined. Hepatic apoM expression and serum levels of apoM were also determined in normal and in ovariectomized rats treated with either placebo or estradiol benzoate, using sham operated rats as controls. Estrogen significantly increased mRNA levels of apoM and apoAI in HepG2 cell cultures in a dose- and time-dependent manner; the upregulation of both apolipoproteins was fully abolished by addition of estrogen receptor antagonist. In normal rats, estrogen treatment led to an increase in plasma lipid levels including HDL cholesterol, a marked upregulation of apoM mRNA and a significant increase in serum levels of apoM. The same pattern of regulation was found in ovariectomized rats treated with estrogen. Thus, estrogen upregulates apoM expression both in vivo and in vitro by mechanism(s) involving the estrogen receptor.",

ABCA2 is most highly expressed in the brain but its effects on cholesterol homeostasis in neuronal-type cells have not been characterized. It is important to study the role of ABCA2 in regulating cholesterol homeostasis in neuronal-type cells because ABCA2 has been identified as a possible genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the effects of ABCA2 expression on cholesterol homeostasis were examined in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. ABCA2 reduced total, free- and esterified cholesterol levels as well as membrane cholesterol but did not perturb cholesterol distribution in organelle or lipid raft compartments. ABCA2 did not modulate de novo cholesterol biosynthesis from acetate. Cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane was not affected by ABCA2 but efflux to the physiological acceptor ApoE3 and mobilization of plasma membrane cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification were reduced by ABCA2. ABCA2 reduced esterification of serum and low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol but not 25-hydroxycholesterol. ABCA2 decreased low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNA and protein levels and increased its turnover rate. The surface expression of LDLR as well as the uptake of fluroresecent DiI-LDL was also reduced by ABCA2. Reduction of endogenous ABCA2 expression by RNAi treatment of N2a cells and rat primary cortical neurons produced the opposite effects of over-expression of ABCA2, increasing LDLR protein levels. This report identifies ABCA2 as a key regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and LDLR metabolism in neuronal cells.",

The yeast non-polar lipids, triacylglycerols (TG) and steryl esters (SE) are stored in so-called lipid particles/droplets (LP) as biologically inert form of fatty acids and sterols. To understand LP structure and function in more detail we investigated the molecular equipment of this compartment making use of mass spectrometric analysis of lipids (TG, SE, phospholipids) and proteins. We addressed the question whether or not lipid and protein composition of LP influence each other and performed analyses of LP from cells grown on two different carbon sources, glucose and oleate. Growth of cells on oleate caused dramatic cellular changes including accumulation of TG at the expense of SE, enhanced the amount of glycerophospholipids and strongly increased the degree of unsaturation in all lipid classes. Most interestingly, oleate as a carbon source led to adaptation of the LP proteome resulting in the appearance of several novel LP proteins. Localization of these new LP proteins was confirmed by cell fractionation. Proteomes of LP variants from cells grown on glucose or oleate, respectively, were compared and are discussed with emphasis on the different groups of proteins detected through this analysis. In summary, we demonstrate flexibility of the yeast LP lipidome and proteome and the ability of LP to adapt to environmental changes.",

CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is the key regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis. Liver-specific elimination of CT\u03b1 (LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212) in mice fed a chow diet decreases very-low-density lipoprotein secretion, reduces lipid efflux from liver, and causes mild steatosis. We fed LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice a high fat diet to determine if impaired PC biosynthesis played a role in development of NASH. LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice developed NASH within one week of high fat feeding. Hepatic CT\u03b1 deficiency caused hepatic steatosis, a 2-fold increase in ceramide mass, and a 20% reduction in PC content. In an attempt to prevent NASH, LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were either injected daily with CDP-choline or fed the high fat diet supplemented with betaine. In addition, LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice were injected with adenoviruses expressing CT\u03b1. CDP-choline injections and adenoviral expression of CT\u03b1 increased hepatic PC, while dietary betaine supplementation normalized hepatic triacylglycerol but did not alter hepatic PC mass in LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Interestingly, none of the treatments normalized hepatic ceramide mass or fully prevented the development of NASH in LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results show that normalizing the amount of hepatic PC is not sufficient to prevent NASH in LCT\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Plasma TG were 2.6 and 4.3-fold higher in fasted G5/G8+/\u2212 and G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively, than in G5/G8+/+ mice. Postprandial TG were 5-fold higher in G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 mice. TG metabolism studies indicate that: first, the fractional catabolic rate was significantly lower in G5/G8+/\u2212 (1.3-fold) and G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 mice (1.5-fold) compared to G5/G8+/+ and postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase activities were significantly lower in G5/G8+/\u2212 (1.8-fold) and G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 mice (5.4-fold) than in G5/G8+/+. Second, liver TG secretion was 1.3-fold higher in G5/G8+/\u2212 and G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 than in G5/G8+/+ mice and this was associated with an increase in liver LXR, FAS, ACAC and CD36 gene expression.

Also, the HOMA index was 2.6-fold higher in G5/G8\u2212/\u2212 than in G5/G8+/+ mice, reflecting a degree of insulin resistance.

Liver and OM and SC adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from lean and obese patients. Human preadipocytes were isolated from the adipose tissues from obese patients and differentiated under adipogenic conditions. ChREBP expression levels were quantified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We found opposing results in terms of ChREBP regulation in the liver and adipose samples. ChREBP increased in the liver from obese compared to lean subjects, whereas the expression decreased in both adipose tissues. The mRNAs of other adipogenic markers were checked in these tissues. The pattern of FASN was similar to the one for ChREBP, ADCY3 decreased in both adipose tissues from obese patients, AP2 decreased only in OM adipose tissue of obese patients and ATGL did not change. The levels of ChREBP mRNA and protein showed dramatic increases during the differentiation of human OM and SC preadipocytes. In conclusion, ChREBP expression has an opposite regulation in the liver and adipose tissue from obese subjects which is compatible with the increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased adipocytic lipogenesis found in these patients. The dramatic increase of ChREBP mRNA and protein levels during preadipocyte differentiation suggests a role in adipogenesis.",

     "abstract": "L-3-Hydroxy fatty acids are unusual metabolites and rarely occur in significant quantities in normal human physiology. Genetic defects of both long-chain and medium-/short-chain mitochondrial L-3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenases (LCHAD, M/SCHAD) have been identified as significant metabolic diseases in humans often with severe clinical phenotypes and pathophysiology that appears to differ from other defects of straight chain fatty acid oxidation. It is felt that accumulation of these atypical fatty acid species may play a role in this pathology. We have therefore developed an assay to measure these compounds in body fluids, and tissue culture medium to help in the diagnosis of these disorders and to better study the effects of 3-hydroxy fatty acid accumulation.We have developed a stable isotope dilution, selected ion-monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometric assay for the measurement of all 3-hydroxy fatty acids from chain lengths C6 to C18 using 1,2 13C-labeled internal standards for all species. Authentic patient samples were utilized to develop reference intervals for control subjects, for those associated with patient samples confirmed at the molecular level to have either LCHAD or M/SCHAD deficiency and for patients who did not have disease but were fasting or on diets high in medium-chain fatty acids. Likewise, skin fibroblasts were obtained from patients with confirmed disease for additional study. Samples were also obtained from the hadh (M/SCHAD) knockout mouse.The measurement of 3-hydroxy fatty acids in patient plasma is a valuable tool in the identification of defects of both enzymes. Severe starvation, prolonged fasting and increased medium-chain triglycerides in the diet produce a profile that is similar to that seen in M/SCHAD deficiency, making this a more difficult condition to diagnose but these biomarkers provide an important clue to the diagnosis, particularly in non-fasted, diet-controlled patients. Fibroblast studies in LCHAD deficiency demonstrate that long-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acid accumulation can be observed in cultured tissues. Incubation of cultured fibroblasts from LCHAD deficient patients with labeled fatty acids demonstrated a process of chain lengthening that has not previously been recognized.The measurement of body fluid and cultured cell 3-hydroxy fatty acids provides both diagnostic and pathogenic information regarding these genetic diseases of fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondrion. Presently, the measurement of medium- and short-chain species provides a major metabolic biomarker for the recognition of M/SCHAD deficiency.

Today, the introduction of new ambient ionization techniques coupled to MS (AMS), which are characterized by the direct desorbing/ionizing of molecules from solid samples, is generating new possibilities for in situ analysis. Recently, we developed an AMS approach called APTDCI to desorb/ionize using a heated gas flow and an electrical discharge to directly analyze sterols and indirectly investigate acylcarnitines in dried blood or plasma spot samples.

     "abstract": "Fatty aldehydes are important components of the cellular lipidome. Significant interest has been developed towards the analysis of the short chain \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated and hydroxylated aldehydes formed as a result of oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Multiple gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and subsequently liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC/MS) approaches have been developed to identify and quantify short-chain as well as long-chain fatty aldehydes. Due to the ability to non-enzymaticaly form Schiff bases with amino groups of proteins, lipids, and with DNA guanidine, free aldehydes are viewed as a marker or metric of fatty acid oxidation and not the part of intracellular signaling pathways which has significantly limited the overall attention this group of molecules have received. This review provides an overview of current GC/MS and LC/MS approaches of fatty aldehyde analysis as well as discusses technical challenges standing in the way of free fatty aldehyde quantitation.

     "abstract": "Compared to the arachidonic acid (C20:4) cascade, the oleic acid (C18:1) family comprises a handful known metabolites. The pathophysiology of oleic acid and its oxidized and nitrated metabolites, i.e., cis-9,10-epoxyoctadecanoic acid (cis-EpOA) and the two vinylic nitro-oleic acids cis-9-nitro-oleic acid (9-NO2-OA) and cis-10-nitro-oleic acid (10-NO2-OA), is only little investigated and little understood. cis-EpOA, 9-NO2-OA and 10-NO2-OA have been detected in plasma of healthy and ill human subjects by means of gas chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS/MS) and liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) techniques in their acid and esterified forms. cis-EpOA is formed from oleic acid by the catalytic action of various cytochrome P450 isozymes. In end-stage liver disease, cis-EpOA plasma concentration is lower than in healthy subjects suggesting liver as the main organ responsible for cis-EpOA synthesis. The origin of 9-NO2-OA and 10-NO2-OA and of other nitrated oleic acid metabolites is unknown. In vitro models, nitro-oleic acid species can be formed non-enzymatically from oleic acid and nitrogen dioxide. Thus, endogenous nitro-oleic acids could serve as biomarkers of fatty acid nitration by reactive nitrogen species. Synthetic 9-NO2-OA and 10-NO2-OA at concentrations of three orders of magnitude higher than their endogenous counterparts have interesting pharmacological features and are currently intensely investigated. The present article reviews and discusses currently available analytical methods for the quantitative determination of cis-EpOA, 9-NO2-OA and 10-NO2-OA in biological samples, notably in human plasma, and the potential biological significance of these oleic acid metabolites. Special emphasis is given to GC\u2013MS/MS and LC\u2013MS/MS methods utilizing the stable-isotope dilution technique. The sensitivity and specificity of the MS/MS approach make electron-capture negative ion chemical ionization (ECNICI) GC\u2013MS/MS and negative electrospray ionization (NESI) LC\u2013MS/MS methodologies indispensable in experimental and clinical settings on oxidative and nitrative oleic acid metabolism. These techniques are particularly suited to delineate the oleic acid cascade. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.",

     "abstract": "The endocannabinoids anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG) are physiologically occurring, biologically active compounds on CB1 and CB2 receptors with multiple physiological functions. AEA and 2AG have been identified and quantified in many mammalian biological fluids and tissues, such as human plasma, adipocytes, tissues and tissue microdialysates, at concentrations in the picomolar-to-nanomolar range under basal conditions. In this article, recently published chromatographic and mass spectrometric analytical methods, i.e., HPLC with fluorescence or ultraviolet detection, LC\u2013MS, LC\u2013MS/MS, GC\u2013MS and GC\u2013MS/MS, are reviewed and discussed, notably from the quantitative point of view. We focus on and emphasize the particular importance of blood sampling, sample storage and work-up including solvent and solid-phase extraction and derivatization procedures, matrix-effects, and stability of analytes. As 2AG spontaneously isomerizes to its CB1/CB2 receptors biologically inactive 1-arachidonoyl glycerol (1AG) by acyl migration, this phenomenon and its particular importance for accurate quantification of 2AG are discussed in detail. Due to the electrical neutrality of AEA and 2AG their solvent extraction by toluene offers the least matrix-effect and minimum isomerization. LC\u2013MS/MS is the most frequently used analytical technique for AEA and 2AG. At present, the utility of the GC\u2013MS/MS methodology seems to be limited to AEA measurement in human plasma, bronchoalveolar liquid (BAL) and microdialysate samples. Despite great instrumental advances in the LC\u2013MS/MS methodology, sampling and sample treatment remains one of the most crucial analytical steps in 2AG analysis. Extension of the LC\u2013MS/MS methodology, for instance to microdialysate and BAL samples from clinical studies, is a big analytical challenge in endocannabinoid analysis in clinical settings. Currently available LC\u2013MS/MS and GC\u2013MS/MS methods should be useful to investigate the metabolism of AEA and 2AG beyond hydrolysis, i.e., by \u03b2- and \u03c9-oxidation pathways.

     "abstract": "Fatty acid-derived eicosanoids and N-acylethanolamines (NAE) are important bioactive lipid mediators involved in numerous biological processes including cell signaling and disease progression. To facilitate research on these lipid mediators, we have developed a targeted high-throughput mass spectrometric based methodology to monitor and quantitate both eicosanoids and NAEs, and can be analyzed separately or together in series. Each methodology utilizes scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) pairs in conjunction with a 25\u00a0min reverse-phase HPLC separation. The eicosanoid methodology monitors 141 unique metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for over 100 of these metabolites against standards. The analysis covers eicosanoids generated from cycloxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450 enzymes, and those generated from non-enzymatic pathways. The NAE analysis monitors 36 metabolites and quantitative amounts can be determined for 33 of these metabolites against standards. The NAE method contains metabolites derived from saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids. The lower limit of detection for eicosanoids ranges from 0.1\u00a0pg to 1\u00a0pg, while NAEs ranges from 0.1\u00a0pg to 1000\u00a0pg. The rationale and design of the methodology is discussed.

     "abstract": "Control of the inflammatory response is of wide interest given its important role in many diseases. In recent years we identified novel mechanisms and lipid mediators that play an active role in stimulating the resolution of self-limited acute inflammation. These novel pro-resolving mediators include the essential fatty acid-derived lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. Members of each possess a unique pro-resolving mechanism of action; each limits neutrophilic infiltration, regulates local mediators (chemokines, cytokines) as well as stimulates macrophage-enhanced clearance of apoptotic PMN, cellular debris and microbes. Given this unique mechanism of action, resolvins have already been shown to play pivotal roles in regulating key events in a wide range of experimental inflammatory diseases. These pro-resolving mediators also provide a molecular link between omega-3 essential fatty acids (e.g. EPA, DHA) and the resolution process of inflammation and tissue homeostasis. Here, we review recent evidence obtained using chiral LC-MS-MS-based lipidomics to identify a novel 18S-series of resolvins derived from EPA. Resolvin E1 possesses potent actions in vivo and in vitro demonstrated now in many laboratories, and herein we review comparisons in E-series resolvin biosynthesis and action of 18S-resolvin E1 and 18S-resolvin E2. The biosynthesis and formation of both 18S and 18R-series are enhanced with aspirin treatment and involve the utilization of dietary EPA as well as recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase and LTA4 hydrolase in their stereospecific biosynthesis. Herein we also demonstrate the utility of LC-MS-MS-based lipidomics in identifying resolvins, protectins and related products in marine organisms such as Engraulis (Peruvian anchovy). These new findings emphasize the utility of chiral LC-MS-MS lipidomics and the potential for identifying new resolution circuits with chiral LC-MS-MS-based lipidomics and metabolomics.

     "abstract": "As technology expands what it is possible to accurately measure, so too the challenges faced by modern mass spectrometry applications expand. A high level of accuracy in lipid quantitation across thousands of chemical species simultaneously is demanded. While relative changes in lipid amounts with varying conditions may provide initial insights or point to novel targets, there are many questions that require determination of lipid analyte absolute quantitation. Glycerophospholipids present a significant challenge in this regard, given the headgroup diversity, large number of possible acyl chain combinations, and vast range of ionization efficiency of species. Lipidomic output is being used more often not just for profiling of the masses of species, but also for highly-targeted flux-based measurements which put additional burdens on the quantitation pipeline. These first two challenges bring into sharp focus the need for a robust lipidomics workflow including deisotoping, differentiation from background noise, use of multiple internal standards per lipid class, and the use of a scriptable environment in order to create maximum user flexibility and maintain metadata on the parameters of the data analysis as it occurs. As lipidomics technology develops and delivers more output on a larger number of analytes, so must the sophistication of statistical post-processing also continue to advance. High-dimensional data analysis methods involving clustering, lipid pathway analysis, and false discovery rate limitation are becoming standard practices in a maturing field.

     "abstract": "Neutral lipids are a diverse family of hydrophobic biomolecules that have important roles in cellular biochemistry of all living species but have in common the property of charge neutrality. A large component of neutral lipids is the glycerolipids composed of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and monoacylglycerols that can serve as cellular energy stores as well as signaling molecules. Another abundant lipid class in many cells is the cholesterol esters that are on one hand sterols and the other fatty acyl lipids, but in either case are neutral lipids involved in cholesterol homeostasis and transport in the blood. The analysis of these molecules in the context of lipidomics remains challenging because of their charge neutrality and the complex mixtures of molecular species present in cells. Various techniques have been used to ionize these neutral lipids prior to mass spectrometric analysis including electron ionization, atmospheric chemical ionization, electrospray ionization and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization. Various approaches to deal with the complex mixture of molecular species have been developed including shotgun lipidomics and chromatographic-based separations such as gas chromatography, reversed phase liquid chromatography, and normal phase liquid chromatography. Several applications of these approaches are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.",

     "abstract": "Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are rapidly becoming recognized as important mediators of cellular and immune signaling. They are generated either enzymatically or non-enzymatically and 100s of structures exist of which only a small fraction have been analyzed to date. Pleiotropic activities, including regulation of adhesion molecule expression, pro-coagulant activity and inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling have been observed and some are detected in models of human and animal disease, including atherosclerosis and infection. More recently, the acute generation of specific oxidized phospholipids by cellular enzymes in immune cells was reported. Assays for analysis and quantification of OxPLs were first developed approx 15\u00a0years ago, primarily for hydro(pero)xy-species. Many were based on monitoring a single precursor ion with/without LC separation, based on the PL headgroup. Others combined LC with monitoring precursor to product transitions, but were unable to provide information regarding position of oxidation on unsaturated sn-2 fatty acid due to sensitivity issues. More recently, LC/MS/MS methods for specific OxPLs have been reported that enable high sensitivity quantitation in biological samples. In this review, widely used methods for detecting and quantifying various classes of OxPL will be summarized, along with practical advice for their use. In particular, the focus will be on LC/MS/MS, which today is almost universally the method of choice. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Lipodomics and Imaging Mass Spectrometry.",

Phosphatidylmethanol (PM) was identified by exact mass measurement and collision induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Extraction in the presence of deuterated methanol leads to a 3 atomic mass unit shift in the [M\u2013H]\u2212 ions of PM indicating its formation during extraction. Ethyl and methyl carbamates of PE, also identified by exact mass measurement and MS/MS, are likely to be formed by phosgene, a breakdown product of chloroform. Addition of phosgene to extractions containing synthetic PE significantly increases the levels of PE-MC detected in the lipid extracts by ESI-MS. Extraction in the presence of methylene chloride significantly reduced the levels of these lipid species. N-succinyl PE is formed from reaction of succinyl-CoA with PE during extraction. Interestingly N-succinyl PE can be formed in an aqueous reaction mixture in the absence of added E. coli proteins. This work highlights the reactivity of the amine of PE and emphasizes that careful extraction controls are required to ensure that new minor lipid species identified using mass spectrometry are indeed endogenous lipid metabolites.

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids are a highly diverse category of molecules that serve not only as components of biological structures but also as regulators of numerous cell functions. Because so many of the structural features of sphingolipids give rise to their biological activity, there is a need for comprehensive or \u201csphingolipidomic\u201d methods for identification and quantitation of as many individual subspecies as possible. This review defines sphingolipids as a class, briefly discusses classical methods for their analysis, and focuses primarily on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tissue imaging mass spectrometry (TIMS). Recently, a set of evolving and expanding methods have been developed and rigorously validated for the extraction, identification, separation, and quantitation of sphingolipids by LC-MS/MS. Quantitation of these biomolecules is made possible via the use of an internal standard cocktail. The compounds that can be readily analyzed are free long-chain (sphingoid) bases, sphingoid base 1-phosphates, and more complex species such as ceramides, ceramide 1-phosphates, sphingomyelins, mono- and di-hexosylceramides, sulfatides, and novel compounds such as the 1-deoxy- and 1-(deoxymethyl)-sphingoid bases and their N-acyl-derivatives. These methods can be altered slightly to separate and quantitate isomeric species such as glucosyl/galactosylceramide. Because these techniques require the extraction of sphingolipids from their native environment, any information regarding their localization in histological slices is lost. Therefore, this review also describes methods for TIMS. This technique has been shown to be a powerful tool to determine the localization of individual molecular species of sphingolipids directly from tissue slices.

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids represent an important class among lipids, especially when considering their vital roles in lipid metabolism. Thus, a variety of methods have been created to accomplish their analysis and the term \u201csphingolipidomics\u201d has recently been coined to underline the motivation to enable a comprehensive analysis of all sphingolipid species including the acidic and the neutral ones. In this review, we summarize selected mainly biomedical based mass spectrometric approaches for the analysis of neutral sphingolipids regarding their advantages, applications and limitations. To underline some practical aspects of method development, we focus on a new method recently developed in our laboratory, which enables separation, detection, and mass spectrometric profiling of ceramide, hexosylceramide, lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, globotetraosylceramide, sphingomyelin species, and cholesterol in one run. This method can be applied to investigate impairments of neutral sphingolipid metabolism in a variety of disorders such as sphingolipidoses and be employed to screen for sphingolipid profile changes as induced by knockout experiments or related studies.

     "abstract": "Much effort is currently invested in the development of mass spectrometry-based strategies for investigating the entirety of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) of a certain cell type, tissue, organ or body encompassing the respective glycosphingolipidome. As part of the investigation of the vertebrate glycosphingolipidome, GSL analysis is undergoing rapid expansion owing to the application of novel mass spectrometry techniques acting as the linchpin in the network of collaborations challenged to unravel structural and functional aspects of GSLs. Difficulties may arise in the determination of the exact structures of GSLs due to the heterogeneity of the sugar moiety varying in the number and sequence of monosaccharides, and their anomeric configuration and linkage type, which make up the principal items of the glyco code of biologically active carbohydrate chains. The ceramide variability caused by the diversity of the long-chain amino alcohol and the fatty acid, which both may vary in chain length, degree of unsaturation, and type and number of substituents, further contributes to the increasing number of possible GSL species. In view of this heterogeneity, a single-method analytical mass spectrometry (MS) technique without auxiliary tools yields limited data, providing only partial structural information of individual GSLs in complex mixtures. Approaching this challenge, current advances on a triad system matching three complementary methods are described in this review: (i) silica gel based TLC separation of GSLs, (ii) their overlay detection on the TLC plate (mostly based on antibody-mediated recognition), and (iii) direct and indirect MS based structural characterization, i.e. directly on the TLC plate or in lipid extracts from silica gel. We will focus on recent improvements by employing antibodies, AB5 toxins and bacteria for direct IR-MALDI-o-TOF MS and indirect ESI-QTOF MS analysis of GSLs. We believe that the combinatorial approach using conventional TLC and modern mass spectrometry provides a developmental advance in exploring the glycosphingolipidome of biological material.",

Since its first introduction in biological mass spectrometry, chip-based ESI demonstrated a high potential to discover novel structures of biomarker value. Therefore, recently, microfluidics for electrospray in conjunction with advanced MS instruments able to perform multistage fragmentation were introduced also in glycolipid research. This review is focused on the strategies, which allowed a successful application of chip technology for ganglioside mapping and sequencing by ESI MS and tandem MS (MS/MS). The first part of the review is dedicated to the progress of MS methods in brain ganglioside research, which culminated with the introduction of two types of microfluidic devices: the NanoMate robot and a polymer microchip for electrospray. In the second part a systematic description of most relevant results obtained by using MS in combination with the two chip systems is presented. Chip-based ESI accomplishments for determination of ganglioside expression and structure in normal brain regions and brain pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases and primary brain tumors are described together with some considerations upon the perspectives of microfluidics-MS to be routinely introduced in biomedical investigation.",

The successful application of SIMS-based imaging in the investigation of lipids directly from tissue and cells are demonstrated. Common complications and technical pitfalls are discussed. In this review, we examine the use of cluster ion sources and cryogenically compatible sample handling for improved ion yields and to expand the application potential of SIMS. Methodological improvements, including pre-treating the sample to improve ion yields and protocol development for 3-dimensional analyses (i.e. molecular depth profiling), are also included in this discussion. New high performance SIMS instruments showcasing the most advanced instrumental developments, including tandem MS capabilities and continuous ion beam compatibility, are described and the future direction for SIMS in lipid imaging is evaluated.",

     "abstract": "The ability to translate vast amounts of information, as obtained from lipidomic analysis, into the knowledge and understanding of biological phenomena is an important challenge faced by the lipidomics community. While many of the informatics and computational tools from other domains such as bioinformatics and metabolomics are also applicable to lipidomics data processing and analysis, new solutions and strategies are needed for the studies of lipidomes at the systems level. This is due to enormous functional and structural diversity of lipids as well as because of their complex regulation at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In order to better understand the lipidomes at the physiological level, lipids need to be modeled not only at the level of biological pathways but also at the level of the biophysical systems they are part of, such as cellular membranes or lipoprotein particles. Herein the current state, recent advances and new opportunities in the field of lipid bioinformatics are reviewed.

     "abstract": "Bioactive N-acylethanolamines include anandamide (an endocannabinoid), N-palmitoylethanolamine (an anti-inflammatory), and N-oleoylethanolamine (an anorexic). In the brain, these molecules are formed from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) by a specific phospholipase D, called NAPE-PLD, or through NAPE-PLD-independent multi-step pathways, as illustrated in the current study employing NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. Although N-acylethanolamine plasmalogen (1-alkenyl-2-acyl-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamine, pNAPE) is presumably a major class of N-acylethanolamine phospholipids in the brain, its enzymatic conversion to N-acylethanolamines is poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on the formation of N-acylethanolamines from pNAPEs. While recombinant NAPE-PLD catalyzed direct release of N-palmitoylethanolamine from N-palmitoylethanolamine plasmalogen, the same reaction occurred in the brain homogenate of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice, suggesting that this reaction occurs through both the NAPE-PLD-dependent and -independent pathways. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a remarkable accumulation of 1-alkenyl-2-hydroxy-glycero-3-phospho(N-acyl)ethanolamines (lyso pNAPEs) in the brain of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. We also found that brain homogenate formed N-palmitoylethanolamine, N-oleoylethanolamine, and anandamide from their corresponding lyso pNAPEs by a Mg2+-dependent \u201clysophospholipase D\u201d. Moreover, the brain levels of alkenyl-type lysophosphatidic acids, the other products from lyso pNAPEs by lysophospholipase D, also increased in NAPE-PLD-deficient mice. Glycerophosphodiesterase GDE1 can hydrolyze glycerophospho-N-acylethanolamines to N-acylethanolamines in the brain. In addition, we discovered that recombinant GDE1 has a weak activity to generate N-palmitoylethanolamine from its corresponding lyso pNAPE, suggesting that this enzyme is at least in part responsible for the lysophospholipase D activity. These results strongly suggest that brain tissue N-acylethanolamines, including anandamide, can be formed from N-acylated plasmalogen through an NAPE-PLD-independent pathway as well as by their direct release via NAPE-PLD.",

     "abstract": "Following the discovery of the endocannabinoid arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and other N-acyl-ethanolamines, several other compounds have been found in which amino acids or neurotransmitters rather than ethanolamide are linked to fatty acids. Studies have shown that the local availability of fatty acid precursors, which in turn is modulated by dietary intake of lipids, determines the pattern of conjugates formed. Less information is available whether the same might be true for the amines or neurotransmitters involved. We hypothesized that N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT) and its analogs could be endogenously present in those tissues that have high contents of serotonin. We investigated the endogenous presence of N-acyl serotonins in different parts of the gastro-intestinal tract of pigs and mice. We discovered that AA-5-HT, oleoyl-serotonin, palmitoyl-serotonin, and stearoyl-serotonin were endogenously present, particularly in the jejunum and ileum. Their formation in vitro was stimulated by the addition of serotonin to intestinal tissue incubations. Furthermore, in a mouse study we showed that the pattern of formation is dependent on the relative amount of fatty acids in the diet. The formation of docosahexaenoyl-serotonin and eicosapentaenoyl-serotonin was elevated in mice fed with a diet containing fish oil. Preliminary data showed that several of the serotonin conjugates are able to inhibit glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion and FAAH activity in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that N-acyl serotonins are a novel class of lipid mediators present in the gut with highly promising biological properties.",

     "abstract": "The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has an outstanding capacity to produce and store triacylglycerols resembling adipocytes of higher eukaryotes. Here, the identification of two genes YALI0E32769g (DGA1) and YALI0E16797g (LRO1) encoding major triacylglycerol synthases of Yarrowia lipolytica is reported. Heterologous expression of either DGA1 or LRO1 in a mutant of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in triacylglycerol synthesis restores the formation of this neutral lipid. Whereas Dga1p requires acyl-CoA as a substrate for acylation of diacylglycerol, Lro1p is an acyl-CoA independent triacylglycerol synthase using phospholipids as acyl-donor. Growth of Yarrowia lipolytica strains deleted of DGA1 and/or LRO1 on glucose containing medium significantly decreases triacylglycerol accumulation. Most interestingly, when oleic acid serves as the carbon source the ratio of triacylglycerol accumulation in mutants to wild-type is significantly increased in strains defective in DGA1 but not in lro1\u0394. In vitro experiments revealed that under these conditions an additional acyl-CoA dependent triacylglycerol synthase contributes to triacylglycerol synthesis in the respective mutants. Taken together, evidence is provided that Yarrowia lipolytica contains at least four triacylglycerol synthases, namely Lro1p, Dga1p and two additional triacylglycerol synthases whereof one is acyl-CoA dependent and specifically induced upon growth on oleic acid.",

     "abstract": "StarD4 is a member of the StarD4 subfamily of START domain proteins with a characteristic lipid binding pocket specific for cholesterol. The objective of this study was to define StarD4 subcellular localization, regulation, and function. Immunobloting showed that StarD4 is highly expressed in the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1, in human THP-1 macrophages, Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), and hepatocytes. In 3T3-L1 cells and THP-1 macrophages, StarD4 protein appeared localized to the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). More specifically, in THP-1 macrophages StarD4 co-localized to areas of the ER enriched in Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), and was closely associated with budding lipid droplets. The addition of purified StarD4 recombinant protein to an in vitro assay increased ACAT activity 2-fold, indicating that StarD4 serves as a rate-limiting step in cholesteryl ester formation by delivering cholesterol to ACAT-1-enriched ER. In addition, StarD4 protein was found to be highly regulated and to redistribute in response to sterol levels. In summary, these observations, together with our previous findings demonstrating the ability of increased StarD4 expression to increase bile acid synthesis and cholesteryl ester formation, provide strong evidence for StarD4 as a highly regulated, non-vesicular, directional, intracellular transporter of cholesterol which plays a key role in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Polyprenoids, polymers containing varied numbers of isoprene subunits, serve numerous roles in biology. In Eukarya, dolichyl phosphate, a phosphorylated polyprenol bearing a saturated \u03b1-end isoprene subunit, serves as the glycan carrier during N-glycosylation, namely that post-translational modification whereby glycans are covalently linked to select asparagine residues of a target protein. As in Eukarya, N-glycosylation in Archaea also relies on phosphorylated dolichol. In this report, LC-ESI/MS/MS was employed to identify a novel dolichyl phosphate (DolP) in the thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. The unusually short S. acidocaldarius DolP presents a degree of saturation not previously reported. S. acidocaldarius DolP contains not only the saturated \u03b1- and \u03c9-end isoprene subunits observed in other archaeal DolPs, but also up to five saturated intra-chain isoprene subunits. The corresponding dolichol and hexose-charged DolP species were also detected. The results of the present study offer valuable information on the biogenesis and potential properties of this unique DolP. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanism of \u03b1-isoprene unit reduction in S. acidocaldarius dolichol may facilitate the identification of the alternative, as yet unknown polyprenol reductase in Eukarya.",

     "abstract": "In the brain, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway in which the rate-limiting step is catalyzed by two isoforms of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT): CT\u03b1 and CT\u03b22. In mice, CT\u03b22 mRNA is more highly expressed in the brain than in other tissues, and several observations suggest that CT\u03b22 plays an important role in the nervous system. We, therefore, investigated the importance of CT\u03b22 for PC synthesis as well as for axon formation, growth and branching of primary sympathetic neurons. We show that in cultured primary neurons nerve growth factor increases the amount of CT\u03b22, but not CT\u03b1, mRNA and protein. The brains of mice lacking CT\u03b22 had normal PC content despite having 35% lower CT activity than wild-type brains. CT\u03b22 mRNA and protein are abundant in distal axons of mouse sympathetic neurons whereas CT\u03b1 mRNA and protein were not detected. Moreover, CT\u03b22 deficiency in distal axons reduced the incorporation of [3H]choline into PC by 95% whereas PC synthesis in cell bodies/proximal axons was unaltered. These data suggest that CT\u03b22 is the major CT isoform involved in PC synthesis in axons. Axons of CT\u03b22-deficient sympathetic neurons contained 32% fewer branch points than did wild-type neurons although the number of axons/neuron and the rate of axon extension were the same as in wild-type neurons. We conclude that in distal axons of primary sympathetic neurons CT\u03b22 is a major contributor to PC synthesis and promotes axon branching, whereas CT\u03b1 appears to be the major CT isoform involved in PC synthesis in cell bodies/proximal axons.",

     "abstract": "Fatty liver is commonly detected in obesity and has been identified as a risk factor for the progression of hepatic fibrosis in a wide range of liver diseases. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) and activin A, both members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamiliy, are central regulators in liver fibrosis and regeneration, and the effect of hepatocyte lipid accumulation on the release of these proteins was studied. Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were incubated with palmitic acid or oleic acid to increase lipid storage. Whereas activin A and its natural inhibitor follistatin were not affected, TGF\u03b2 was 2-fold increased. The hepatoprotective adipokine adiponectin dose-dependently induced activin A while lowering follistatin but did not alter TGF\u03b2. Activin A was markedly reduced in hepatocyte cell lines compared to PHH and was not induced upon adiponectin incubation demonstrating significant differences of primary and transformed cells. In free fatty acid (FFA)-incubated PHH adiponectin-mediated induction of activin A was impaired. Inhibition of TGF\u03b2 receptors ALK4/5 and blockage of SMAD3 phosphorylation rescued activin A synthesis in FFA and in TGF\u03b2 incubated cells suggesting that FFA inhibit adiponectin activity by inducing TGF\u03b2. To evaluate whether serum levels of activin A and its antagonist are altered in patients with hepatic steatosis, both proteins were measured in the serum of patients with sonographically diagnosed fatty liver and age- and BMI-matched controls. Systemic adiponectin was significantly reduced in patients with fatty liver but activin A and follistatin were not altered. In summary the current data demonstrate that lipid accumulation in hepatocytes induces TGF\u03b2 which impairs adiponectin bioactivity, and thereby may contribute to liver injury.",

To test the hypothesis that n\u22123 FAs decrease hepatic steatosis in mice given LXR agonist, C57BL/6 mice received daily gavage of an LXR agonist T0901317 (LXRT) or vehicle for 4\u00a0weeks with concomitant intakes chow or high-fat diets enriched in saturated fat (SAT) or n\u22123 fat (n\u22123). Mice on LXRT and SAT developed hepatomegaly with a large increase in size and number of hepatic lipid droplets; an n\u22123 diet reduced liver weight/body weight with decreased hepatic steatosis and triglyceride levels. Effects of n\u22123 diet on hepatic lipogenesis were linked to a blunting of LXRT upregulation of hepatic SREBP1-c and FA synthase mRNA. n\u22123 diets also normalized LXRT-mediated increases of plasma ALT and AST levels, whereas SAT diet increased these markers.

Since its first introduction in biological mass spectrometry, chip-based ESI demonstrated a high potential to discover novel structures of biomarker value.

This review is focused on the strategies, which allowed a successful application of chip technology for ganglioside mapping and sequencing by ESI MS and tandem MS (MS/MS). The first part of the review is dedicated to the progress of MS methods in brain ganglioside research, which culminated with the introduction of two types of microfluidic devices: the NanoMate robot and a polymer microchip for electrospray.

Although relevant literature has reported on gankyrin functions in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis, the exact role of gankyrin is poorly understood in animal model systems. This study analyzed hepatic lipid accumulation in gankyrin transgenic (GK) zebrafish. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells were predominantly increased in the liver bud of GK larvae, indicating that gankyrin functionally promoted cell proliferation at the larval stage in GK fish. However, over 90% of the viable GK adults showed an increased lipid content, leading in turn to liver steatosis. Liver histology and oil red O staining also indicated the accumulation of fatty droplets in GK fish, consistent with the specific pathological features of severe steatosis. Molecular analysis revealed that gankyrin overexpression induced hepatic steatosis and modulated the expression profiles of four hepatic microRNAs, miR-16, miR-27b, miR-122, and miR-126, and 22 genes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, significantly increased hepatic cell apoptosis resulted in liver damage in GK adults, leading to liver failure and death after approximately 10\u00a0months. This study is the first to report gankyrin as a potential link between microRNAs and liver steatosis in zebrafish.",

In humans, NPC1L1 is also expressed in the liver. We found that transgenic overexpression of NPC1L1 in the wild-type mouse liver inhibits biliary cholesterol secretion and raises blood cholesterol, which can be reversed by ezetimibe treatment. Unfortunately, the high expression of endogenous NPC1L1 in the intestine hampered a definitive establishment of the role of hepatic NPC1L1 in cholesterol metabolism and ezetimibe action in the liver because intestinal NPC1L1 dramatically influences cholesterol homeostasis and is a target of ezetimibe. To circumvent this obstacle, we crossed liver-specific NPC1L1 transgenic mice to NPC1L1 knockout (L1-KO) mice and created a mouse line expressing no endogenous NPC1L1, but human NPC1L1 in liver only (L1LivOnly mice). Compared to L1-KO mice, L1LivOnly mice on a 0.2% cholesterol diet showed significantly increased hepatic and plasma cholesterol, and despite a 90% reduction in biliary cholesterol excretion, their fecal cholesterol excretion remained completely unaltered. Remarkably, 4\u00a0days of ezetimibe treatment significantly restored biliary cholesterol secretion in L1LivOnly mice. These findings demonstrated a direct role of hepatic NPC1L1 in regulating biliary cholesterol excretion and hepatic/blood cholesterol levels, and unequivocally established hepatic NPC1L1 as a target of ezetimibe.",

In this article we assessed the relevance of IL-1R2 in atherosclerosis by studying its expression in monocytes from hyperlipidemic patients, in THP-1 macrophages exposed to lipoproteins and in human atherosclerotic lesions. Our results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1R2 was reduced in monocytes from patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (\u2212\u00a030%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). THP-1 macrophages incubated with increasing concentrations of acetylated low density (ac-LDL) and very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins also exhibit a decrease in IL-1R2 mRNA and protein levels. Pre-incubation with agents that block intracellular accumulation of lipids prevents the decrease in IL-1R2 mRNA caused by lipoproteins. Lipoproteins also prevented the increase in IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 caused by a 4-h stimulation with LPS and reduced protein expression of total and phosphorylated IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1. Finally, IL-1R2 expression in human atherosclerotic vessels was markedly lower than in non-atherosclerotic arteries (\u2212\u00a080%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). Overall, our results suggest that under atherogenic conditions, there is a decrease in IL-1R2 expression in monocytes/macrophages and in the vascular wall that may facilitate IL-1 signaling.",

The mean molecular area of BMP at the collapse surface pressure (45\u00a0mN m\u2212\u00a01) was similar to those measured with other phospholipids bearing two acyl chains (66 and 59.6\u00a0\u00c52 molecule\u2212\u00a01 at pH 5.5 and 8.0, respectively). In Hemi-BDP and BDP, the mean molecular area increased by 26 and 35\u00a0\u00c52 molecule\u2212\u00a01 per additional acyl chain at pH 5.5 and 8.0, respectively. When BMP was added to a phospholipid mixture mimicking late endosome membrane composition at pH 8.0, the mean phospholipid molecular area increased by 7% regardless of the surface pressure. In contrast, the variation in molecular area was surface pressure-dependent at pH 5.5, a pH value close to that of intra-endosomal content. BMP and hemi-BDP, but not BDP, were hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2), which exhibits phospholipase A1 activity. At pH 5.5, the maximum activities of PLRP2 on BMP were recorded at high surface pressures (25\u201335\u00a0mN/m). At pH 8.0, the PLRP2 activity vs. surface pressure showed a bell-shaped curve with maximum activities at 15\u00a0mN/m for both BMP and hemi-BDP. This is a new activity for this enzyme which could degrade cellular BMP since both human PLRP2 (HPLRP2) and BMP were localized in human monocytic THP-1 cells.

These changes appear important for the pathophysiology of the disease. However, the mechanisms of these changes are not clearly understood. The current study demonstrates that metabolism of LA and alpha linolenate (LNA) to AA and eicosapentaenoate (EPA), respectively, are significantly increased in two different cell culture models of cystic fibrosis. These changes correlated with increased expression of fatty acid \u03945- and \u03946-desaturases, key enzymes in this metabolic pathway. In contrast, cystic fibrosis cells showed decreased metabolism of AA and EPA to docosapentaenoate (DPA) and docosahexaenoate (DHA), respectively, although metabolism of 22:5n-3 to DHA was relatively unchanged. In addition, the expression and activity of both cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase-5 was markedly increased in these cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that the diminished LA and increased AA in cystic fibrosis result from increased metabolism of LA, while the observed decrease in DHA is at least partly due to decreased elongation and desaturation beyond EPA.",

     "abstract": "Imbalance in the supply and utilization of fatty acids (FA) is thought to contribute to intrahepatic lipid (IHL) accumulation in obesity. The aim of this study was to determine the time course of changes in the liver capacity to oxidize and store FA in response to high-fat diet (HFD). Adult male Wistar rats were fed either normal chow or HFD for 2.5\u00a0weeks (short-term) and 25\u00a0weeks (long-term). Short-term HFD feeding led to a 10% higher palmitoyl-l-carnitine-driven ADP-stimulated (state 3) oxygen consumption rate in isolated liver mitochondria indicating up-regulation of \u03b2-oxidation. This adaptation was insufficient to cope with the dietary FA overload, as indicated by accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines, depletion of free carnitine and increase in FA content in the liver, reflecting IHL accumulation. The latter was confirmed by in vivo1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Oil Red O staining. Long-term HFD feeding caused further up-regulation of mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation (24% higher oxygen consumption rate in state 3 with palmitoyl-l-carnitine as substrate) and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as indicated by 62% higher mitochondrial DNA copy number compared to controls. These adaptations were paralleled by a partial restoration of free carnitine levels and a decrease in long-chain acylcarnitine content. Nevertheless, there was a further increase in IHL content, accompanied by accumulation of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation products. In conclusion, partially effective adaption of hepatic FA metabolism to long-term HFD feeding came at a price of increased oxidative stress, caused by a combination of higher FA oxidation capacity and oversupply of FA.",

Here we investigated the interaction of these proteins with different models of phospholipid membrane vesicles in order to achieve further insight into their specificity within the enterocyte. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques allowed us to determine affinities of these proteins to membranes, the way phospholipid composition and vesicle size and curvature modulate such interaction, as well as the effect of protein binding on the integrity of the membrane structure. We demonstrate here that, besides their apparently opposite ligand transfer mechanisms, both LFABP and IFABP are able to interact with phospholipid membranes, but the factors that modulate such interactions are different for each protein, further implying different roles for IFABP and LFABP in the intracellular context. These results contribute to the proposed central role of intestinal FABPs in the lipid traffic within enterocytes as well as in the regulation of more complex cellular processes.",

     "abstract": "The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a superb nature's medicine, with still unfolding health benefits. Because hepatotoxicity is a prominent adverse drug reaction, we currently attempted a new approach in which EPA was challenged to both alleviate hepatotoxicity and provide synergy with anticonvulsant effects of valproate (VPA). Besides, we verified whether EPA may kinetically modulate the clearance rate of VPA. VPA (500\u00a0mg/kg p.o., for 2\u00a0weeks) caused rat hepatotoxicity that was manifested as notable (2- to 4-fold) rise in serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT, and ALP), increased hepatic levels of lipid peroxides and TNF-\u03b1 (3- and 7-fold) and activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO, 4-fold), lowering of serum albumin (42%), and depletion of liver reduced glutathione (GSH, 36%). Furthermore, histopathologic examination revealed hepatocellular degeneration, focal pericentral necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and steatosis. Joint treatment with EPA (300\u00a0mg/kg) blunted the oxidative stress, TNF-\u03b1 levels and MPO activity, while enhanced levels of serum albumin and hepatic GSH. EPA also ameliorated most of the hepatocellular anomalies evoked by VPA. Additionally, in a mouse PTZ convulsion model, EPA markedly augmented the anticonvulsant effects of VPA far beyond their single responses. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that joint EPA administration had no effect on serum VPA concentrations. Collectively, results demonstrate for the first time that the \u03c9-3 FA (EPA) markedly alleviated VPA-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation, while enhanced its anticonvulsant effects without altering its clearance. Therapeutically, these protective and synergy profiles for EPA foster a more safe and efficacious drug combination regimen than VPA.",

Methods. L6 myotubes were cultured with PA, DHA or LA (0.4\u00a0mmol/l), with or without conditioned media from human subcutaneous (SC) and visceral (IAB) fat. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, lipid content, mRNA expression of key genes involved in nutrient utilization and protein expression of inhibitor protein inhibitor kappa B (I\u03baB)-\u03b1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were measured. Results. PA and IAB fat reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and their combined effect was similar to that of PA alone. PA-induced insulin resistance was ameliorated by inhibiting the de novo synthesis of ceramide, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation or mTOR activation. The PA effect was also partially reversed by DHA and completely by LA in the presence of SC fat. PA increased diacylglycerol content, which was reduced by LA and to a greater extent when either IAB or SC fat was also present. PA increased SCD1 whereas DHA and LA increased AMPK\u03b12 mRNA. In the presence of SC or IAB fat, the combination of PA with either DHA or LA decreased SCD1 and increased AMPK\u03b12 mRNA. Conclusions. PA-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle involves inflammatory (nuclear factor kappa B/mTOR) and nutrient (ceramide) pathways. PUFAs promote pathways, at a transcriptional level, that increase fat oxidation and synergize with factors from SC fat to abrogate PA-induced insulin resistance.",

Our previous work showed that, in the absence of cytosolic GPx in insulinoma RINm5F cells, an intrinsic activity of 12 lipoxygenase (12(S)-LOX) converts 12S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE) to the bioactive epoxide hepoxilin A3 (HXA3). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of HXA3 on apoptosis as compared to its precursor 12(S)-HpETE and shed light upon the underlying pathways. In contrast to 12(S)-HpETE, which induced apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway, we found HXA3 not only to prevent it but also to promote cell proliferation. In particular, HXA3 suppressed the pro-apoptotic BAX and upregulated the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. Moreover, HXA3 induced the anti-apoptotic 12(S)-LOX by recruiting heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), another anti-apoptotic protein. Finally, a co-chaperone protein of HSP90, protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), was upregulated by HXA3, which counteracted oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by dephosphorylating and thus inactivating apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). Taken together, these findings suggest that HXA3 protects insulinoma cells from oxidative stress and, via multiple signaling pathways, prevents them from undergoing apoptosis.",

The aim of the study was to explore the effect of mild stretch on phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation, an enzyme known to be involved in surfactant secretion. In A549 cells (a model of AT II cells), we showed, using a fluorometric assay, that stretch triggers an increase of total PLA2 activity. Western blot experiments revealed that the cytosolic isoform cPLA2 is rapidly phosphorylated under stretch, in addition to a modest increase in cPLA2 mRNA levels. Treatment of A549 cells with selective inhibitors of the MEK/ERK pathway significantly attenuated the stretch-induced cPLA2 phosphorylation. A strong interaction of cPLA2 and pERK enzymes was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. We also found that inhibition of PI3K pathway attenuated cPLA2 activation after stretch, without affecting pERK levels. Our results suggest that low magnitude stretch can induce cPLA2 phosphorylation through the MEK/ERK and PI3K\u2013Akt pathways, independently.",

     "abstract": "CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase \u03b1 (CCT\u03b1) is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the CDP\u2013choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Lipid activation of CCT\u03b1 results in its translocation to the nuclear envelope and expansion of an intranuclear membrane network termed the nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR) by a mechanism involving membrane deformation. Nuclear lamins are also required for stability and proliferation of the NR, but whether this unique structure, or the nuclear lamina in general, is required for PC synthesis is not known. To examine this relationship, the nuclear lamina was depleted by RNAi or disrupted by expression of the Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) mutant lamin A (progerin), and the effect on CCT\u03b1 and choline metabolism was analyzed. siRNA-mediated silencing of lamin A/C or lamin B1 in CHO cells to diminish the NR had no effect on PC synthesis, while double knockdown non-specifically inhibited the pathway. Confirming this minor role in PC synthesis, only 10% of transiently overexpressed choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase was detected in the NR. In CHO cells, CCT\u03b1 was nucleoplasmic and co-localized with GFP-progerin in nuclear folds and invaginations; however, HGPS fibroblasts displayed an abnormal distribution of CCT\u03b1 in the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope that was accompanied by a 2-fold reduction in PC synthesis. In spite of its altered localization, choline-labeling experiments showed that CCT activity was unaffected, and inhibition of PC synthesis was traced to reduced activity of a hemicholinium-sensitive choline transporter. We conclude that CCT\u03b1 and lamins specifically cooperate to form the NR, but the overall structure of the nuclear envelope has a minimal impact on CCT activity and PC synthesis.",

     "abstract": "The acylated peptide ghrelin (AG) and its endogenous non-acylated isoform (UAG) protect cardiomyocytes, pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and preadipocytes from apoptosis, and induce preadipocytes differentiation into adipocytes. These events are mediated by AG and UAG binding to a still unidentified receptor, which determines the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2. AG and UAG also possess antilipolytic activity in vitro, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Thus, the objective of the current study was to characterize the molecular events involved in AG/UAG receptor signaling cascade. We treated rat primary visceral adipocytes with isoproterenol (ISO) and forskolin (FSK) to stimulate lipolysis, simultaneously incubating them with or without AG or UAG. Both peptides blocked ISO- and FSK-induced lipolysis. By direct measurement of cAMP intracellular content, we demonstrated that AG/UAG effect was associated to a reduction of ISO-induced cAMP accumulation. Moreover, the cAMP analog 8Br-cAMP abolished AG/UAG effect. As AG and UAG were ineffective against lipolysis induced by db-cAMP, another poorly hydrolyzable cAMP analog, phosphodiesterase (PDE) involvement was hypothesized. Indeed, cilostamide, a specific PDE3B inhibitor, blocked AG/UAG effect on ISO-induced lipolysis. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and AKT inhibitor 1,3-dihydro-1-(1-((4-(6-phenyl-1H-imidazo(4,5-g)quinoxalin-7-yl)phenyl)methyl)-4piperidinyl)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one trifluoroacetate also blocked AG/UAG action, suggesting a role in PDE3B activation. In particular, PI3K isoenzyme gamma (PI3K\u03b3) selective inhibition through the compound AS605240 prevented AG/UAG effect on ISO-stimulated lipolysis, hampering AKT phosphorylation on Ser473. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that AG/UAG attenuation of ISO-induced lipolysis involves PI3K\u03b3/AKT and PDE3B.",

     "abstract": "The LDL receptor (LDLR) is an endocytic receptor that plays a major role in the clearance of atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation. During the endocytic process, the LDLR first binds lipoprotein at the cell surface and then traffics to endosomes, where the receptor releases bound lipoprotein. Release is acid-dependent and correlates with the formation of an intramolecular contact within the receptor. Human mutations at residues that form the contact are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and the goal of the present study was to determine the role of contact residues on LDLR function. We show that mutations at nine contact residues reduce the ability of the LDLR to support lipoprotein uptake. Unexpectedly, only four of the mutations (W515A, W541A, H562Y and H586Y) impaired acid-dependent lipoprotein release. The remaining mutations decreased the lipoprotein-binding capacity of the LDLR through either reduction in the number of surface receptors (H190Y, K560W, H562Y and K582W) or reduction in the fraction of surface receptors that were competent to bind lipoprotein (W144A and W193A). We also examined three residues, distal to the contact, which were predicted to be necessary for the LDLR to adopt the acidic conformation. Of the three mutations we tested (G293S, F362A and G375S), one mutation (F362A) reduced lipoprotein uptake. Together, these data suggest that the intramolecular interface plays multiple roles in LDLR function.",

Our results showed that delta-6 desaturase as well as elongase-6 expressions were upregulated in 3-month-old Zucker fatty rats as compared to lean littermates, independently of SREBP-1c activation. We also demonstrated for the first time an increase of liver group VII phospholipase A2 gene expression in the obese animals together with a strong specific inhibition of type IVA and VIA phospholipases A2.

The 129-residue enzyme hen egg-white lysozyme has been shown to form fibrils in vitro at pH 2.0 and 55\u00a0\u00b0C. In this research, using various spectroscopic techniques, light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy, we first examined the influence of short-chain phospholipids on the amyloid fibrillogenesis and the structural changes derived from hen lysozyme in vitro. Both model short-chain phospholipids were observed to mitigate the fibrillogenesis of hen lysozyme. Also, urea-induced unfolding results suggested that the susceptibility of hen lysozyme to conformational changes elicited by the denaturant was observed to decrease upon addition of short-chain phospholipids. Moreover, our molecular dynamics simulations results demonstrated that the observed inhibitory action of short-chain phosoholipids against hen lysozyme fibrillogenesis might be attributable to the interference of \u03b2-strand extension by the binding of phospholipids to lysozyme's \u03b2-sheet-rich region. We believe that the outcome from this study may contribute to a better understanding the molecular factors affecting amyloid fibrillogenesis and the molecular mechanism(s) of the interactions between phospholipids/lipids and amyloid-forming proteins.",

CG is rapidly induced by heat shock before the activation of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and production of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and the addition of CG in turn induces HSF1 activation and HSP70 production in human fibroblasts; thus, a reasonable correlation is that CG functions as a crucial lipid mediator in stress responses in the animal. In this study, we focused on a CG-synthesizing enzyme, animal sterol glucosyltransferase, which has not yet been identified. In this study, we describe a novel type of animal sterol glucosyltransferase in hog stomach and human fibroblasts (TIG-3) detected by a sensitive assay with a fluorescence-labeled substrate. The cationic requirement, inhibitor resistance, and substrate specificity of animal sterol glucosyltransferase were studied. Interestingly, animal sterol glucosyltransferase did not use uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) as an immediate glucose donor, as has been shown in plants and fungi. Among the glycolipids tested in vitro, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was the most effective substrate for CG formation in animal tissues and cultured cells. Using chemically synthesized [U-13C]Glc-\u03b2-Cer as a glucose donor, we confirmed by mass spectrometry that [U-13C]CG was synthesized in hog stomach homogenate. These results suggest that animal sterol glucosyltransferase transfers glucose moiety from GlcCer to cholesterol. Additionally, using GM-95, a mutant B16 melanoma cell line that does not express ceramide glucosyltransferase, we showed that GlcCer is an essential substrate for animal sterol glucosyltransferase in the cell.",

The purified 24.8-kDa protein lysed sheep, horse and rabbit erythrocytes and the hemolytic activity was inhibited by sphingomyelin, but not other phospholipids or glycosphingolipids. The open reading frame of the clamlysin gene encoded a putative 26.9-kDa protein (clamlysin B) which showed high sequence similarity with the actinoporin family. A surface plasmon resonance assay confirmed that clamlysin B specifically bound to sphingomyelin. Furthermore, two cDNA variants of clamlysin, encoding putative 31.4 kDa (clamlysin A) and 11 kDa (clamlysin C) proteins, were isolated. Only the 31.4-kDa variant was found to exhibit sphingomyelin-binding activity. Clamlysin A and B, but not C, shared a sequence (domain II) conserved in all known sphingomyelin-binding proteins. Domain II fused with a glutathione S-transferase bound to sphingomyelin. Horse erythrocytes, mouse melanoma B16 and GM95 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 cells, but not the same cells treated with bacterial sphingomyelinase, were immunostained with clamlysin B.

A PBK model to predict plasma cholesterol levels in the mouse was developed, validated, and analyzed. Kinetic parameters required for defining the model were obtained using data from published experiments. To construct the model, a set of appropriate submodels was selected from a set of 65,536 submodels differing in the kinetic expressions of the reactions. A submodel was considered appropriate if it had the ability to correctly predict an increased or decreased plasma cholesterol level for a training set of 5 knockout mouse strains. The model thus defined consisted of 8 appropriate submodels and was validated using data from an independent set of 9 knockout mouse strains. The model prediction is the average prediction of 8 appropriate submodels. Remarkably, these submodels had in common that the rate of cholesterol transport from the liver to HDL was not dependent on hepatic cholesterol concentrations. The model appeared able to accurately predict in a quantitative way the plasma cholesterol concentrations of all 14 knockout strains considered, including the frequently used Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 and Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mouse strains.

In addition, since isoprenylation of proteins is an important therapeutic target in cancer research there is interest in interfering with isoprenoid biosynthesis, for which new inhibitors to block farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPases are being developed. We recently developed a sensitive method using UPLC\u2013MS/MS that allows the direct detection and quantification of all intermediates of the mevalonate pathway from MVA to GGPP which can be used to verify the specificity of inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. We here investigated the specificity of several inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway in HepG2 cells, fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates pamidronate and zoledronate specifically inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase indicated by the accumulation of IPP/DMAPP. However, zaragozic acid A, a squalene synthase inhibitor, causes an increase of MVA in addition to the expected increase of FPP. Analysis of isoprenoid intermediate profiles after incubation with 6-fluoromevalonate showed a very nonspecific result with an increase in MVA, MVAP, MVAPP and IPP/DMAPP.

     "abstract": "The fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis mobilizes lipid bodies (LB) located in the cytosol during infection process has been proposed for decades. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of mobilization of these lipid droplets within mycobacteria are still not completely characterized. Evidence in favour of this characterization was obtained here using a combined fluorescent microscopy and computational image processing approach. The decrease in lipid storage levels observed under nutrient depletion conditions was correlated with a significant increase in the size of the bacteria. LB fragmentation/condensation cycles were monitored in real time. The exact contribution of lipases in this process was confirmed using the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin, which was found to prevent LB degradation and to limit the bacterial cell growth. The method presented here provides a powerful tool for monitoring in vivo lipolysis in mycobacteria and for obtaining new insights on the growth of cells and their entry into the dormant or reactivation phase. It should be particularly useful for studying the effects of chemical inhibitors and activators on cells as well as investigating other metabolic pathways.",

In this study we report the purification and characterization of a novel second type of neutral ceramidase from rat brain (RBCDase II). Triton X-100 protein extract from rat brain membrane was purified sequentially using Q-Sepharose, HiLoad16/60 Superdex 200\u00a0pg, heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose HP, and Mono Q columns. After Mono Q, the specific activity of the enzyme increased by ~\u00a015,000-fold over that of the rat brain homogenate. This enzyme has pH optima of 7.5, and it has a larger apparent molecular weight (110\u00a0kDa) than the previously purified (90\u00a0kDa) and characterized neutral rat brain CDase (RBCDase I). De-glycosylation experiments show that the differences in molecular mass of RBCDase I and II on SDS-PAGE are not due to the heterogeneity with N-glycan. RBCDase II is partially stimulated by Ca2+ and is inhibited by pyrimidine mono nucleotides such as TMP and UMP. This finding is significant as it demonstrates for the first time an effect by nucleotides on a CDase activity. The enzyme was also inhibited by both oxidized and reduced GSH. The effects of metal ions were examined, and we found that the enzyme is very sensitive to Hg2+ and Fe3+, while it is not affected by Mn2+. EDTA was somewhat inhibitory at a 20\u00a0mM concentration.",

Due to its effects on aromatase gene expression and enzyme activity, 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has been proposed as an interesting substance in breast cancer treatment and prevention. In the present study, we have examined the effects of 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on estrogen and androgen metabolism in adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells and prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The NCI-H295R cell line has been proposed as a screening tool to study endocrine disruptors. We therefore studied whether this cell line reacted to 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment in the same way as cells from important endocrine target tissues. 1\u03b1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerted cell line-specific effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism. In breast cancer MCF-7 cells, aromatase gene expression and estradiol production were decreased, while production of androgens was markedly increased. In NCI-H295R cells, 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulated aromatase expression and decreased dihydrotestosterone production. In prostate cancer LNCaP cells, aromatase expression increased after the same treatment, as did production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In summary, our data show that 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerts tissue-specific effects on estrogen and androgen production and metabolism. This is important knowledge about 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 as an interesting substance for further research in the field of breast cancer prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the observed cell line-specific effects are of importance in the discussion about NCI-H295R cells as a model for effects on estrogen and androgen metabolism.",

We report here a condition that decreases liver damage in intrahepatic cholestasis based on a mouse model that lacks multiple drug resistant protein 2 (ABCB4). We found that lack of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) decreased liver damage in Abcb4\u2212/\u2212 mice caused by exposure of the liver to excess bile acids. The protective effect was not related to hepatic ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine or the level of cholesterol. The decreased concentration of bile acids in liver was related to impaired re-absorption of bile acids in intestine and increased disposal of bile acids in feces in Abcb4\u2212/\u2212/Pemt\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to Abcb4\u2212/\u2212 mice. PEMT deficiency affected intestinal Na+ absorption resulting in an impaired Na+ concentration gradient along the length of the small intestine and abnormal absorption of bile acids mediated by apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT). The findings of this study suggest that inhibition of PEMT and/or reduction of intestinal sodium concentration may be helpful in attenuating liver damage and prolonging hepatic function in intrahepatic cholestasis.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic adaptations are triggered in the maternal organism to synthesize milk with an adequate concentration of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) required to the newborn. They may be a high uptake of dietary linoleic acid and its conversion to LC-PUFAs by desaturases of fatty acids (FADS) 1 and 2 in the mammary gland (MG). It is unknown if they also occur from onset of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore the participation of the MG as a mechanism involved in LC-PUFAs synthesis to support their demand during pregnancy and lactation in rats. The expression of desaturases in MG was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher (12.3-fold for FADS1 and 41.2-fold for FADS2) during the late pregnancy and throughout lactation (31.7-fold for FADS1 and 67.1-fold higher for FADS2) than in nonpregnant rats. SREBF-1c showed a similar pattern of increase during pregnancy but remained higher only during the early lactation (11.7-fold, P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Transcript of ELOVL6 and FASN increased throughout pregnancy and lactation, respectively. ELOVL5 mRNA increased in MG only during lactation (2.8 to 5.3-fold, P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Accordingly, a higher content of LC-PUFAs was found in lactating MG than in nonpregnant rats. Results suggest that MG participates from late pregnancy and throughout lactation by expressing desaturases and elongases as a mechanism involved in LC-PUFAs synthesis, probably by SREBF-1c. Because desaturases and ELOVL5 were expressed in cultured lactocytes and such expression was downregulated by linoleic and arachidonic acid, these cells may be a useful model for understanding the regulatory mechanisms for LC-PUFAs synthesis in MG.",

Therefore, the present study assessed the impact of apoO overexpression on (i) plasma lipids and lipoproteins as well as on (ii) HDL functionality. Human apoO was overexpressed by means of recombinant adenovirus (AdhapoO) in human apoA-I transgenic mice, a humanized mouse model of HDL metabolism. AdhapoO substantially increased apoO in plasma and within HDL. However, plasma triglycerides, phospholipids, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol did not change. HDL size distribution, lipid composition and the apoA-I and the apoO distribution over the different HDL fractions separated by FPLC remained unaltered. Furthermore, enrichment of HDL with apoO did not impact on HDL functionality assessed in four independent ways, namely (i) stimulation of cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells, (ii) protection against LDL oxidation, (iii) anti-inflammatory activity on endothelial cells, and (iv) induction of vasodilation in isolated aortic rings ex vivo as a measure of stimulating vascular NO production. These results demonstrate that although overexpression of apoO results in a substantial enrichment of HDL particles with this novel apolipoprotein, apoO does not impact the plasma lipoprotein profile or HDL functionality.",

Although sphingolipid degradation has been extensively studied, gene expression of human sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase (SPL) catalyzing sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) remains to be determined. Among 5 human lung cancer cell lines examined, SPL protein levels paralleled the respective mRNA and enzyme activities. Between H1155 and H1299 cells used for further experiments, higher cellular S1P was observed in H1155 with higher SPL activity compared with H1299 with low SPL activity. GATA-4 has been reported to affect SPL transcription in Dictyostelium discoideum. GATA-4 was observed in H1155 but not in other cell lines. Overexpression of GATA-4 in H1299 increased SPL expression. However, promoter analysis of human SPL revealed that the most important region was located between \u2212\u00a0136\u00a0bp and \u2212\u00a088\u00a0bp from the first exon, where 2 Sp1 sites exist but no GATA site. DNA pull-down assay of H1155 showed increased DNA binding of Sp1 and GATA-4 within this promoter region compared with H1299. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, reporter assay using mutated binding motif, and mithramycin A, a specific Sp1 inhibitor, suggest the major role of Sp1 in SPL transcription and no direct binding of GATA-4 with this 5\u2032 promoter region. The collaborative role of GATA-4 was proved by showing coimmunoprecipitation of Sp1 and GATA-4 using GST-Sp1 and overexpressed GATA-4. Thus, high SPL transcription of H1155 cells was regulated by Sp1 and GATA-4/Sp1 complex formation, both of which bind to Sp1 sites of the 5\u2032-SPL promoter.",

We investigated the effects of acyl chain length in the non-hydroxy acyl sphingosine type (NS) ceramides on the skin permeability and their thermotropic phase behavior. Neither the long- to medium-chain ceramides (8\u201324C) nor free sphingosine produced any changes of the skin barrier function. In contrast, the short-chain ceramides decreased skin electrical impedance and increased skin permeability for two marker drugs, theophylline and indomethacin, with maxima in the 4\u20136C acyl ceramides. The thermotropic phase behavior of pure ceramides and model stratum corneum lipid membranes composed of ceramide/lignoceric acid/cholesterol/cholesterol sulfate was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and infrared spectroscopy. Differences in thermotropic phase behavior of these lipids were found: those ceramides that had the greatest impact on the skin barrier properties displayed the lowest phase transitions and formed the least dense model stratum corneum lipid membranes at 32\u00a0\u00b0C. In conclusion, the long hydrophobic chains in the NS-type ceramides are essential for maintaining the skin barrier function. However, this ability is not shared by their short-chain counterparts despite their having the same polar head structure and hydrogen bonding ability.",

     "abstract": "Manganese lipoxygenase (MnLOX) oxidizes (11R)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid (11R-HpOTrE) to a peroxyl radical. Our aim was to compare the enzymatic oxidation of 11R-HpOTrE and octadecenoic acids with LOO\u2015H and allylic C\u2015H bond dissociation enthalpies of ~\u00a088 and ~\u00a087\u00a0kcal/mol. Mn(III)LOX oxidized (11Z)-, (12Z)-, and (13Z)-18:1 to hydroperoxides with R configuration, but this occurred at insignificant rates (<\u00a01%) compared to 11R-HpOTrE. We next examined whether transitional metals could mimic this oxidation. Ce4+ and Mn3+ transformed 11R-HpOTrE to hydroperoxides at C-9 and C-13 via oxidation to a peroxyl radical at C-11, whereas Fe3+ was a poor catalyst. Our results suggest that MnLOX oxidizes bis-allylic hydroperoxides to peroxyl radicals in analogy with Ce4+ and Mn3+. The enzymatic oxidation likely occurs by proton-coupled electron transfer of the electron from the hydroperoxide anion to Mn(III) and H+ to the catalytic base, Mn(III)OH\u2212. Hydroperoxides abolish the kinetic lag times of MnLOX and FeLOX by oxidation of their metal centers, but 11R-HpOTrE was isomerized by MnLOX to (13R)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E,15Z)-octadecatrienoic acid (13R-HpOTrE) with a kinetic lag time. This lag time could be explained by two competing transformations, dehydration of 11R-HpOTrE to 11-ketolinolenic acid and oxidation of 11R-HpOTrE to peroxyl radical; the reaction rate then increases as 13R-HpOTrE oxidizes MnLOX with subsequent formation of two epoxyalcohols. We conclude that oxidation of octadecenoic acids and bis-allylic hydroperoxides occurs by different mechanisms, which likely reflect the nature of the hydrogen bonds, steric factors, and the redox potential of the Mn(III) center.",

Although a defective HsABCD1 results in the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in plasma of X-ALD patients, there is still no direct biochemical evidence that HsABCD1 actually transports very long-chain fatty acids. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the transport of fatty acids across the peroxisomal membrane. Our earlier work showed that in yeast the uptake of fatty acids into peroxisomes may occur via two routes, either as (1.) free fatty acid or as (2.) acyl-CoA ester. The latter route involves the two peroxisomal half-ABC transporters, Pxa1p and Pxa2p, which form a heterodimeric complex in the peroxisomal membrane. We here report that the phenotype of the pxa1/pxa2\u0394 yeast mutant, i.e. impaired growth on oleate containing medium and deficient oxidation of oleic acid, cannot only be partially rescued by human ABCD1, but also by human ABCD2 (ALDRP), which indicates that HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 can both function as homodimers. Fatty acid oxidation studies in the pxa1/pxa2\u0394 mutant transformed with either HsABCD1 or HsABCD2 revealed clear differences suggesting that HsABCD1 and HsABCD2 have distinct substrate specificities. Indeed, full rescue of beta-oxidation activity in cells expressing human ABCD2 was observed with C22:0 and different unsaturated very long-chain fatty acids including C24:6 and especially C22:6 whereas in cells expressing HsABCD1 rescue of beta-oxidation activity was best with C24:0 and C26:0 as substrates.",

     "abstract": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is secreted from adipose tissue and is considered to be a risk factor for both atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. Here we report for the first time that PAI-1 expression is enhanced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) and its lipid component lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, OxLDL treatment increased the mRNA expression and protein secretion of PAI-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas native LDL had no effect. The addition of an anti-CD36 antibody suppressed OxLDL-stimulated PAI-1 expression by 50%, suggesting that adipose-derived CD36 contributes to roughly half of the PAI-1 expression stimulated by OxLDL. In addition, pharmacological experiments showed that the OxLDL-stimulated enhancement in PAI-1 expression was mediated through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, LPC, a major lipid component of OxLDL, was responsible for the enhanced expression of PAI-1 as phospholipase A2-treated acetyl LDL, which generates LPC, strongly stimulated PAI-1 expression, whereas acetyl LDL itself had no such activity. These data demonstrate that the uptake of OxLDL and, in particular, its lipid component LPC into adipocytes triggers aberrant ROS-mediated PAI-1 expression, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.",

     "abstract": "Background: The ability of chronic valproate (VPA) to reduce arachidonic acid (AA) turnover in brain phospholipids of unanesthetized rats has been ascribed to its inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl)-mediated activation of AA to AA-CoA. Our aim was to identify a rat Acsl isoenzyme that could be inhibited by VPA in vitro. Methods: Rat Acsl3-, Acsl6v1- and Acsl6v2-, and Acsl4-flag proteins were expressed in E. coli, and the ability of VPA to inhibit their activation of long-chain fatty acids to acyl-CoA was estimated using Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics. Results: VPA uncompetitively inhibited Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA and of docosahexaenoic (DHA) but not of palmitic acid to acyl-CoA, but did not affect AA conversion by Acsl3, Acsl6v1 or Acsl6v2. Acsl4-mediated conversion of AA to AA-CoA showed substrate inhibition and had a 10-times higher catalytic efficiency than did conversion of DHA to DHA-CoA. Butyrate, octanoate, or lithium did not inhibit AA activation by Acsl4. Conclusions: VPA's ability to inhibit Acsl4 activation of AA and of DHA to their respective acyl-CoAs, when related to the higher catalytic efficiency of AA than DHA conversion, may account for VPA's selective reduction of AA turnover in rat brain phospholipids, and contribute to VPA's efficacy against bipolar disorder.",

One of its benefits is in lowering fasting and postprandial blood triglyceride (TG) concentrations. The goal of this study was to determine whether the hypotriglyceridemic actions of fenofibrate in the postprandial state include alterations in TG and fatty acid metabolism in the small intestine. We found that the hypotriglyceridemic actions of fenofibrate in the postprandial state of high-fat (HF) fed mice include a decrease in supply of TG for secretion by the small intestine. A decreased supply of TG for secretion was due in part to the decreased dietary fat absorption and increased intestinal fatty acid oxidation in fenofibrate compared to vehicle treated HF fed mice. These results suggest that the effects of fenofibrate on the small intestine play a critical role in the hypotriglyceridemic effects of fenofibrate.",

To date the detailed characterisation of these carotenoids and their formation has not been described. In the present article biochemical analysis on the carotenoids responsible for the yellow/orange pigmentation present in Bacilli has been carried out and the identity of the carotenoids present was elucidated. Chromatographic, UV/Vis and Mass Spectral (MS) data have revealed the exclusive presence of a C30 carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus species. Apophytoene was detected representing the first genuine carotenoid formed by this pathway. Cultivation in the presence of diphenylamine (DPA), a known inhibitor of pathway desaturation resulted in the accumulation of apophytoene along with other intermediates of desaturation (e.g. apophytofluene and apo-\u03b6-carotene). The most abundant carotenoids present in the Bacillus species were oxygenated derivatives of apolycopene, which have either undergone glycosylation and/or esterification. The presence of fatty acid moieties (C9 to C15) attached to the sugar residue via an ester linkage was revealed by saponification and MS/MS analysis. In source fragmentation showed the presence of a hexose sugar associated with apolycopene derivatives. The most abundant apocarotenoids determined were glycosyl-apolycopene and glycosyl-4\u2032-methyl-apolycopenoate esters. Analysis of these carotenoids over the developmental formation of spores revealed that 5-glycosyl-4\u2032-methyl-apolycopenoate was related to sporulation. Potential biosynthetic pathways for the formation of these apocarotenoids in vegetative cells and spores have been reconstructed from intermediates and end-products were elucidated.",

In contrast, the precursor lipids phosphatidic acid, CDP-diacylglycerol and PS were present almost exclusively as diacyl phospholipids. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasmalogens are formed from diacylated phospholipids at a late stage of phospholipid formation in Clostridium species.

Two cDNAs for SREBPs homologous to mammalian SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were characterised. We identified three groups of genes whose expression responded differently to the treatments. One group of genes, including cholesterol biosynthetic genes, showed increased expression in response to lipid depletion but supplementary cholesterol or LC-PUFA had no further effect. The expression of a second group of genes belonging to fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, included fatty acid synthase, \u03946 and \u03945 fatty acyl desaturases, also increased after lipid depletion but this was negated by cholesterol or by LC-PUFA supplementation. The expression of a third group of genes including acyl-CoA oxidase, HMG-CoA reductase and Elovl5 elongase was increased by cholesterol treatment but was not affected by lipid depletion or by LC-PUFA. This same pattern of expression was also shown by liver X receptor (LXR), indicating that acyl-CoA oxidase, HMG-CoA reductase and Elovl5 are possible direct targets of LXR. This suggests that salmon Elovl5 may be regulated differently from mammalian Elovl5, which is an indirect target of LXR, responding to LXR-dependent increases in SREBP-1.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial electron transport chain is a source of oxygen superoxide anion (O2-) that is dismutated to H2O2. Although low levels of ROS are physiologically synthesized during respiration, their increase contributes to cell injury. Therefore, an efficient machinery for H2O2 disposal is essential in mitochondria. In this study, the ability of brain mitochondria to acquire cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylserine (PS) in vitro through a fusion process was exploited to investigate lipid effects on ROS. MTT assay, oxygen consumption, and respiratory ratio indicated that the acquired phospholipids did not alter mitochondrial respiration and O2\u2212 production from succinate. However, in CL-enriched mitochondria, H2O2 levels where 27% and 47% of control in the absence and in the presence of antimycin A, respectively, suggesting an increase in H2O2 elimination. Concomitantly, cytochrome c (cyt c) was released outside mitochondria. Since free oxidized cyt c acquired peroxidase activity towards H2O2 upon interaction with CL in vitro, a contribution of cyt c to H2O2 disposal in mitochondria through CL conferred peroxidase activity is plausible. In this model, the accompanying CL peroxidation should weaken cyt c-CL interactions, favouring the detachment and release of the protein. Neither cyt c peroxidase activity was elicited by PS in vitro, nor cyt c release was observed in PS-enriched mitochondria, although H2O2 levels were significantly decreased, suggesting a cyt c-independent role of PS in ROS metabolism in mitochondria.",

     "abstract": "Secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines by macrophages is a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this study, the effects of chylomicron remnants (CMR), the lipoproteins which transport dietary fat in the blood, on the production of pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion by macrophages was investigated using CMR-like particles (CRLPs) together with THP-1 macrophages or primary human macrophages (HMDM). Incubation of CRLPs or oxidized CRLPs (oxCRLPs) with HMDM or THP-1 macrophages for up to 24\u00a0h led to a marked decrease in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (\u2212\u00a050\u201390%), but these effects were reduced or abolished when CRLPs protected from oxidation by incorporation of the antioxidant drug, probucol, (pCRLPs) were used. In macrophages transfected with siRNA targeted to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), neither CRLPs nor pCRLPs had any significant effect on chemokine/cytokine secretion, but in cells transfected with siRNA targeted to the LDLr-related protein 1 (LRP1) both types of particles inhibited secretion to a similar extent to that observed with CRLPs in mock transfected cells. These findings demonstrate that macrophage pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokine secretion is down-regulated by CMR, and that these effects are positively related to the lipoprotein oxidative state. Furthermore, uptake via the LDLr is required for the down-regulation, while uptake via LRP1 does not bring about this effect. Thus, the receptor-mediated route of uptake of CMR plays a crucial role in modulating their effects on inflammatory processes in macrophages.",

     "abstract": "Owing to its high fat content, the classical Western diet has a range of adverse effects on the heart, including enhanced inflammation, hypertrophy, and contractile dysfunction. Proinflammatory factors secreted by cardiac cells, which are under the transcriptional control of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), may contribute to heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. The underlying mechanisms are complex, since they are linked to systemic metabolic abnormalities and changes in cardiomyocyte phenotype. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that regulate metabolism and are capable of limiting myocardial inflammation and hypertrophy via inhibition of NF-\u03baB. Since PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 is the most prevalent PPAR isoform in the heart, we analyzed the effects of the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist GW501516 on inflammatory parameters. A high-fat diet induced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6, and enhanced the activity of NF-\u03baB in the heart of mice. GW501516 abrogated this enhanced proinflammatory profile. Similar results were obtained when human cardiac AC16 cells exposed to palmitate were coincubated with GW501516. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 activation by GW501516 enhanced the physical interaction between PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and p65, which suggests that this mechanism may also interfere NF-\u03baB transactivation capacity in the heart. GW501516-induced PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 activation can attenuate the inflammatory response induced in human cardiac AC16 cells exposed to the saturated fatty acid palmitate and in mice fed a high-fat diet.

     "abstract": "Fenofibrate, a PPAR-\u03b1 agonist, lowers triglycerides (TG) and raises high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) in humans. While fenofibrate is very effective in lowering TG, it does not raise HDL-C in humans to the same extent as seen in human apoAI transgenic (hAI-Tg) mice. We studied the mechanism of this discordance using the following compounds as tools: cholic acid that down-regulates human apoAI, and fenofibrate, that elevates hapoAI and HDL-C in hAI-Tg mice. We hypothesized that additional sequences, including apoCIII and AIV genes on chromosome 11, not present in the hapoAI transgene may be responsible for the dampened effect of fibrates on HDL-C seen in humans. For this, hAI-Tg mice with 11\u00a0kb DNA segment and hapoAI\u2013CIII\u2013AIV-Tg mice with 33\u00a0kb DNA segment harboring apoCIII and AIV genes were employed. These mice were treated with fenofibrate and cholic acid. Fenofibrate increased apoAI and HDL-C levels, and HDL size in the apoAI-Tg mice via up-regulation of the hapoAI mRNA and increased activity and mRNA of PLTP, respectively. Consistent with earlier findings, cholic acid showed similar effects of lowering HDL-C, and elevating LDL-C in hAI-Tg mice as well as in the hAI\u2013CIII\u2013AIV-Tg mice. Fenofibrate decreased TG and increased HDL size in hAI\u2013CIII\u2013AIV-Tg mice as well, but surprisingly, did not elevate serum levels of hapoAI or hepatic AI mRNA, suggesting that additional sequences not present in the hapoAI transgene (11\u00a0kb) may be partly responsible for the dampened effect on HDL-C seen in hAI\u2013CIII\u2013AIV-Tg mice.

     "abstract": "Brown spider dermonecrotic toxins (phospholipases-D) are the most well-characterized biochemical constituents of Loxosceles spp. venom. Recombinant forms are capable of reproducing most cutaneous and systemic manifestations such as dermonecrotic lesions, hematological disorders, and renal failure. There is currently no direct confirmation for a relationship between dermonecrosis and inflammation induced by dermonecrotic toxins and their enzymatic activity. We modified a toxin isoform by site-directed mutagenesis to determine if phospholipase-D activity is directly related to these biological effects. The mutated toxin contains an alanine substitution for a histidine residue at position 12 (in the conserved catalytic domain of Loxosceles intermedia Recombinant Dermonecrotic Toxin \u2014 LiRecDT1). LiRecDT1H12A sphingomyelinase activity was drastically reduced, despite the fact that circular dichroism analysis demonstrated similar spectra for both toxin isoforms, confirming that the mutation did not change general secondary structures of the molecule or its stability. Antisera against whole venom and LiRecDT1 showed cross-reactivity to both recombinant toxins by ELISA and immunoblotting. Dermonecrosis was abolished by the mutation, and rabbit skin revealed a decreased inflammatory response to LiRecDT1H12A compared to LiRecDT1. Residual phospholipase activity was observed with increasing concentrations of LiRecDT1H12A by dermonecrosis and fluorometric measurement in vitro. Lipid arrays showed that the mutated toxin has an affinity for the same lipids LiRecDT1, and both toxins were detected on RAEC cell surfaces. Data from in vitro choline release and HPTLC analyses of LiRecDT1-treated purified phospholipids and RAEC membrane detergent-extracts corroborate with the morphological changes. These data suggest a phospholipase-D dependent mechanism of toxicity, which has no substrate specificity and thus utilizes a broad range of bioactive lipids.",

     "abstract": "The availability of free arachidonic acid (AA) constitutes a limiting step in the synthesis of biologically active eicosanoids. Free AA levels in cells are regulated by a deacylation/reacylation cycle of membrane phospholipids, the so-called Lands cycle, as well as by further remodeling reactions catalyzed by CoA-independent transacylase. In this work, we have comparatively investigated the process of AA incorporation into and remodeling between the various phospholipid classes of human monocytes and monocyte-like U937 cells. AA incorporation into phospholipids was similar in both cell types, but a marked difference in the rate of remodeling was appreciated. U937 cells remodeled AA at a much faster rate than human monocytes. This difference was found not to be related to the differentiation state of the U937 cells, but rather to the low levels of esterified arachidonate found in U937 cells compared to human monocytes. Incubating the U937 cells in AA-rich media increased the cellular content of this fatty acid and led to a substantial decrease of the rate of phospholipid AA remodeling, which was due to reduced CoA-independent transacylase activity. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that cellular AA levels determine the amount of CoA-independent transacylase activity expressed by cells and provide support to the notion that CoA-IT is a major regulator of AA metabolism in human monocytes.",

These drugs act as PPAR\u03b1 agonists and upregulate the expression of genes crucial in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). In the present study, we determined the effects of these two fibrates on RCT from macrophages to feces in vivo in human apoA-I transgenic (hApoA-ITg) mice. [3H]cholesterol-labeled mouse macrophages were injected intraperitoneally into hApoA-ITg mice treated with intragastric doses of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil or a vehicle solution for 17\u00a0days, and radioactivity was determined in plasma, liver and feces. Fenofibrate, but not gemfibrozil, enhanced [3H]cholesterol flux to plasma and feces of female hApoA-ITg mice. Fenofibrate significantly increased plasma HDLc, HDL phospholipids, hApoA-I levels and phospholipid transfer protein activity, whereas these parameters were not altered by gemfibrozil treatment. Unlike gemfibrozil, fenofibrate also induced the generation of larger HDL particles, which were more enriched in cholesteryl esters, together with higher potential to generate pre\u03b2-HDL formation and caused a significant increase in [3H]cholesterol efflux to plasma. Our findings demonstrate that fenofibrate promotes RCT from macrophages to feces in vivo and, thus, highlight a differential action of this fibrate on HDL.",

Assuming that these enzyme changes represent brain homeostatic responses to deprivation, we hypothesized that dietary n-6 PUFA deprivation would produce changes in the opposite directions.Brain expression of PUFA-metabolizing enzymes and their transcription factors was quantified in male rats fed an n-6 PUFA adequate or deficient diet for 15\u00a0weeks post-weaning.The deficient compared with adequate diet increased brain mRNA, protein and activity of iPLA2 VIA and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX), but decreased cPLA2 IVA and COX-2 expression.

     "abstract": "Myristic acid, the 14-carbon saturated fatty acid (C14:0), usually accounts for small amounts (0.5%\u20131% weight of total fatty acids) in animal tissues. Since it is a relatively rare molecule in the cells, the specific properties and functional roles of myristic acid have not been fully studied and described. Like other dietary saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid, lauric acid), this fatty acid is usually associated with negative consequences for human health. Indeed, in industrialized countries, its excessive consumption correlates with an increase in plasma cholesterol and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, one feature of myristoyl-CoA is its ability to be covalently linked to the N-terminal glycine residue of eukaryotic and viral proteins. This reaction is called N-terminal myristoylation. Through the myristoylation of hundreds of substrate proteins, myristic acid can activate many physiological pathways. This review deals with these potentially activated pathways. It focuses on the following emerging findings on the biological ability of myristic acid to regulate the activity of mammalian desaturases: (i) recent findings have described it as a regulator of the \u03944-desaturation of dihydroceramide to ceramide; (ii) studies have demonstrated that it is an activator of the \u03946-desaturation of polyunsaturated fatty acids; and (iii) myristic acid itself is a substrate of some fatty acid desaturases. This article discusses several topics, such as the myristoylation of the dihydroceramide \u03944-desaturase, the myristoylation of the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase which is part of the whole desaturase complex, and other putative mechanisms.",

Gene expression profiling in HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice suggests that HSL is important for modulating adipogenesis and adipose metabolism. To test whether HSL is required for the supply of intrinsic ligands for PPAR\u03b3 for normal adipose differentiation, HSL\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed normal chow (NC) and high-fat (HF) diets supplemented with or without rosiglitazone (200\u00a0mg/kg) for 16\u00a0weeks. Results show that supplementing rosiglitazone to an NC diet completely normalized the decreased body weight and adipose depots in HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additionally, rosiglitazone resulted in similar serum glucose, total cholesterol, FFA, and adiponectin values in WT and HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, rosiglitazone normalized the expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, markers of adipocyte differentiation, and enzymes involved in triacylglycerol synthesis and metabolism, and cholesteryl ester homeostasis, in HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice. Supplementing rosiglitazone to an HF diet resulted in improved glucose tolerance in both WT and HSL\u2212/\u2212 animals and also partial normalization in HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice of abnormal WAT gene expression, serum chemistries, organ and body weight changes. In vitro studies showed that adipocytes from WT animals can provide ligands for activation of PPAR\u03b3 and that activation is further boosted following lipolytic stimulation, whereas adipocytes from HSL\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed attenuated activation of PPAR\u03b3, with no change following lipolytic stimulation. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which HSL modulates adipose metabolism is by providing intrinsic ligands or pro-ligands for PPAR\u03b3.",

     "abstract": "Although the conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) have several isomer-specific biological effects including anti-carcinogenic and anti-adipogenic effects, their mechanisms of action remain unclear. To determine their potential effects on membrane structure and function, we studied the incorporation profiles of four CLA isomers (trans-10 cis-12 (A), trans-9 trans-11 (B), cis-9 trans-11 (C), and cis-9 cis-11 (D)) in CHO and HepG2 cells. All four isomers were incorporated into cellular lipids as efficiently as linoleic acid (LA), with the majority of the incorporated CLA present in membrane rafts. Of the four isomers, only CLA-A increased the cholesterol content of the raft fraction. Over 50% of the incorporated CLAs were recovered in phosphatidylcholine of CHO cells, but in HepG2 the neutral lipids contained the majority of CLA. The desaturation index (18:1/18:0 and 16:1/16:0) was reduced by CLA-A, but increased by CLA-B, the effects being apparent mostly in raft lipids. The \u03949 desaturase activity was inhibited by CLAs A and C. Unlike LA, which was mostly found in the sn-2 position of phospholipids, most CLAs were also incorporated significantly into the sn-1 position in both cell types. These studies show that the incorporation profiles of CLA isomers differ significantly from that of LA, and this could lead to alterations in membrane function, especially in the raft-associated proteins.",

     "publication date": "01-2011",
     "abstract": "As the principal component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I plays essential roles in lipid transport and metabolism. Because of its intrinsic conformational plasticity and flexibility, the molecular details of the tertiary structure of lipid-free apoA-I have not been fully elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that the stability of the N-terminal helix bundle structure is modulated by proline substitution at the most hydrophobic region (residues around Y18) in the N-terminal domain. Here we examine the effect of proline substitution at S55 located in another relatively hydrophobic region compared to most of the helix bundle domain to elucidate the influences on the helix bundle structure and lipid interaction. Fluorescence measurements revealed that the S55P mutation had a modest effect on the stability of the bundle structure, indicating that residues around S55 are not pivotally involved in the helix bundle formation, in contrast to the insertion of proline at position 18. Although truncation of the C-terminal domain (\u0394190\u2013243) diminishes the lipid binding of apoA-I molecule, the mutation S55P in addition to the C-terminal truncation (S55P/\u0394190\u2013243) restored the lipid binding, suggesting that the S55P mutation causes a partial unfolding of the helix bundle to facilitate lipid binding. Furthermore, additional proline substitution at Y18 (Y18P/S55P/\u0394190\u2013243), which leads to a drastic unfolding of the helix bundle structure, yielded a greater lipid binding ability. Thus, proline substitutions in the N-terminal domain of apoA-I that destabilized the helix bundle promoted lipid solubilization. These results suggest that not only the hydrophobic C-terminal helical domain but also the stability of the N-terminal helix bundle in apoA-I are important modulators of the spontaneous solubilization of membrane lipids by apoA-I, a process that leads to the generation of nascent HDL particles.",

When LpE are supplied to distal axons, but not cell bodies, of CNS neurons (retinal ganglion cells) the rate of axonal extension is increased. In this study we have investigated the molecular requirements underlying the stimulatory effect of LpE on axonal extension. We show that enhancement of axonal growth by LpE requires the presence of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in neurons since RNA silencing of LRP1 in neurons, or antibodies directed against LRP, suppressed the LpE-induced axonal extension. In contrast, an alternative LRP1 ligand, \u03b12-macroglobulin, failed to stimulate axonal extension, suggesting that LpE do not exert their growth-stimulatory effect solely by activation of a LRP1-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, although apoE3-containing LpE enhanced axonal extension, apoE4-containing LpE did not. Over-expression of ABCG1 in rat cortical glial cells resulted in production of LpE that increased the rate of axonal extension to a greater extent than did expression of an inactive, mutant form of ABGC1. Furthermore, reconstituted lipoprotein particles containing apoE3, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, but not cholesterol, stimulated axonal extension, suggesting that sphingomyelin, but not cholesterol, is involved in the stimulatory effect of LpE. These observations demonstrate that LpE and LRP1 promote axonal extension, and suggest that lipids exported to LpE by ABCG1 are important for the enhancement of axonal extension mediated by LpE.",

Serum from both wild-type and Pon1\u2212/\u2212 mice contained a lactonase activity towards 5-HETEL and 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone that was resistant to inactivation by EDTA. This lactonase activity was sensitive to the serine esterase inhibitor phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride and co-eluted with carboxylesterase activity by size-exclusion chromatography. Analysis of serum from the Es1e mouse strain, which has a deficiency in the carboxylesterase, ES-1, proved that this activity was due to ES-1. PON1 activity predominated at early time points (30\u00a0s), whereas both PON1 and ES-1 contributed equally at later time points (15\u00a0min). When both PON1 and ES-1 were inhibited, 5-HETEL was stable in mouse serum. Thus, while long-chain fatty acid lactones are substrates for PON1, they can be hydrolyzed by ES-1 at neutral pH. In contrast, medium-chain length fatty acid lactones are stable in mouse serum in the absence of PON1, suggesting that PON1 plays a specific role in the metabolism of these compounds.",

     "abstract": "Growing evidence links the three mammalian lipin proteins, i.e., lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3, to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases such as noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Lipin proteins play a dual function in lipid metabolism by acting as phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes and as transcriptional regulators. Genetic variants within the human LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are associated with metabolic syndromes. The fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mice carrying mutations within the Lpin1 gene display life-long deficiency in adipogenesis, insulin resistance, neonatal hepatosteatosis and hypertriglyceridemia, as well as increased atherosclerosis susceptibility. Cell culture studies show that hepatic lipin-1 expression is selectively stimulated by glucocorticoids and repressed by insulin, and its subcellular localization governs the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). In noninsulin-dependent diabetes, glucocorticoid signals lead to dyslipidemia characterized by overproduction of VLDL and atherogenic remnants. This puts lipin-1 as a key integrator of hormonal signals to the liver in diabetic dyslipidemia. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role that hepatic lipin-1 plays in the synthesis, storage and compartmentalization of glycerolipids, and highlights the lipid metabolic consequences associated with dysregulated lipin expression.",

     "abstract": "A new genus of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) which include several families of distinct local mediators (lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins) are actively involved in the clearance and regulation of inflammatory exudates to permit restoration of tissue homeostasis. Classic lipid mediators that are temporally regulated are formed from arachidonic acid, and novel local mediators were uncovered that are biosynthesized from \u03c9-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. The biosynthetic pathways for resolvins are constituted by fatty acid lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase-2 via transcellular interactions established by innate immune effector cells which migrate from the vasculature to inflamed tissue sites. SPM provide local control over the execution of an inflammatory response towards resolution, and include recently recognized actions of SPM such as tissue protection and host defense. The structural families of the SPM do not resemble classic eicosanoids (PG or LT) and are novel structures that function uniquely via pro-resolving cellular and molecular targets. The extravasation of inflammatory cells expressing SPM biosynthetic routes are matched by the temporal provision of essential fatty acids from circulation needed as substrate for the formation of SPM. The present review provides an update and overview of the biosynthetic pathways and actions of SPM, and examines resolution as an integrated component of the inflammatory response and its return to homeostasis via biochemically active resolution mechanisms.",

Identification of their biosynthetic routes in animal tissues and molecular characterization of the enzymes involved are essential for better understanding of physiological importance of NAEs as well as development of enzyme inhibitors as possible therapeutic drugs. In the classical \u201ctransacylation\u2013phosphodiesterase pathway\u201d, NAEs are formed from glycerophospholipids via N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), an unusual derivative of phosphatidylethanolamine with a third acyl chain attached to the amino group, by sequential catalyses by Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase and NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D. However, recent studies reveal that NAE-generating pathways are more complex than presumed before. In this review article, we will focus on recent findings regarding mammalian enzymes that are involved or might be involved in the biosynthesis of NAEs.",

     "abstract": "Adipokines have been reported to contribute to glomerular injury during obesity or diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanisms mediating the actions of various adipokines on the kidney remained elusive. The present study was performed to determine whether acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)-ceramide associated lipid raft (LR) clustering is involved in local oxidative stress in glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) induced by adipokines such as visfatin and adiponectin. Using confocal microscopy, visfatin but not adiponectin was found to increase LRs clustering in the membrane of GECs in a dose and time dependent manner. Upon visfatin stimulation ASMase activity was increased, and an aggregation of ASMase product, ceramide and NADPH oxidase subunits, gp91phox and p47phox was observed in the LR clusters, forming a LR redox signaling platform. The formation of this signaling platform was blocked by prior treatment with LR disruptor filipin, ASMase inhibitor amitriptyline, ASMase siRNA, gp91phox siRNA and adiponectin. Corresponding to LR clustering and aggregation of NADPH subunits, superoxide (O2\u2212) production was significantly increased (2.7 folds) upon visfatin stimulation, as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry. Functionally, visfatin significantly increased the permeability of GEC layer in culture and disrupted microtubular networks, which were blocked by inhibition of LR redox signaling platform formation. In conclusion, the injurious effect of visfatin, but not adiponectin on the glomerular endothelium is associated with the formation of LR redox signaling platforms via LR clustering, which produces local oxidative stress resulting in the disruption of microtubular networks in GECs and increases the glomerular permeability.",

With a view to elucidating the role of all Mycobacterium tuberculosis phospholipase Cs (PLC-A, PLC-B, PLC-C and PLC-D), a large amount of active, soluble recombinant PLCs, were expressed and purified using Mycobacterium smegmatis as expression system. These enzymes showed different pH activity profiles. PLC-C was found to be the most active of the four recombinant PLCs under acidic conditions. All the enzymes tested induced cytotoxic effects on mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cell lines, via direct or indirect enzymatic hydrolysis of cell membrane phospholipids. These results open new prospects for characterising biochemical and structural features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PLCs, which might lead to the identification of novel anti-tuberculosis drug targets.

Athenstaedt and G. Daum, J. Biol. Chem. 278 (2003) 23317\u201323323]. To study a possible link between TAG lipolysis and membrane lipid biosynthesis, we carried out metabolic labeling experiments with wild type and deletion strains bearing defects in the three major yeast TAG lipases, Tgl3p, Tgl4p and Tgl5p. Using [3H]inositol, [32P]orthophosphate, [3H]palmitate and [14C]acetate as precursors for complex lipids we demonstrated that tgl mutants had a lower level of sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids than wild type. ESI-MS/MS analyses confirmed that TAG accumulation in these mutant cells resulted in reduced amounts of phospholipids and sphingolipids. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that TAG lipolysis markedly affected the metabolic flux of long chain fatty acids and very long chain fatty acids required for sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid synthesis. Activity and expression level of fatty acid elongases, Elo1p and Elo2p were enhanced as a consequence of reduced TAG lipolysis. Finally, the pattern of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine molecular species was altered in tgl deletion strain underlining the important role of TAG turnover in maintaining the pool size of these compounds and the remodeling of complex membrane lipids.",

Both at L-PL/HDL-PL ratios of 3:1 and 5:1 the fraction of liposomal-derived PL associated with pre-\u03b2 fraction was significantly higher than those accepted by \u03b1-HDL. We found that 78% of apo A-I released from HDL was incorporated into pre-\u03b2 mobility fraction. The relative contents of PL and apo A-I in pre-\u03b2 fraction were constant irrespective of the initial L-PL/HDL-PL ratio in the incubation mixture and accounted for approximately 83 and 11%, respectively. Apo A-II was detached from HDL to a similar extent as apo A-I and distributed evenly between pre-\u03b2 fraction and non-disrupted liposomes. Apo A-II constituted approximately 1%, by weight, in these fractions at all L-PL/HDL-PL ratios investigated. It corresponded approximately to 10% of pre-\u03b2 fraction protein mass. Both liposomes and pre-\u03b2 fraction accepted comparable amounts of FC released from HDL. This data indicated that during the interaction between human HDL and phosphatidylcholine liposome apo A-II participates both in structural modification of liposomes and in the generation of pre-\u03b2 mobility fraction of constant content of PL, apo A-I and apo A-II.

Using microarray and real-time PCR, we found that a ffr mutant with a nonsense mutation exhibits increased transcript level of ADP-ribosylation factor gene (arfs). Further analysis indicated that Ffr contains a putative Arf binding motif and can bind GTP-bound Arfs. In addition, ffr exhibited increased transcript and activity levels of the Arf downstream effector phospholipase D (PLD). Inhibition of PLD partially restored lipid and glucose metabolism in ffr, suggesting that Ffr is involved in a pathway regulating PLD activity by regulating Arfs. We propose that local over-production of phosphatidic acid (PA) by excess PLD promotes membrane curvature, which affects Golgi membrane structure and secretory processes, contributing to impairment of lipid and glucose metabolism.",

First, we demonstrated that GR-HSCs express 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), as detected by immunolocalization in whole cells and confirmed in cell lysates through western blotting and by mRNA expression through RT-PCR. Moreover, mRNA expression of 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) and LTC4-synthase was also documented, indicating that GR-HSCs have the molecular machinery required for LT synthesis. Morphological analysis of osmium and Oil-Red O-stained HSC revealed large numbers of small lipid droplets (also known as lipid bodies). We observed co-localization of lipid droplet protein marker (ADRP) and 5-LO by immunofluorescence microscopy. We demonstrated that GR-HSCs were able to spontaneously release cysteinyl-LTs (CysLTs), but not LTB4, into culture supernatants. CysLT production was highly enhanced after TGF-\u03b2-stimulation. Moreover, the 5-LO inhibitor zileuton and 5-LO gene deletion were able to inhibit the TGF-\u03b2-stimulated proliferation of GR-HSCs, suggesting a role for LTs in HSC activation.

     "abstract": "The activation of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) and consequent ceramide production are implicated in many stress-induced signaling pathways. Trafficking of nSMase2 from the Golgi compartment to the plasma membrane (PM) in response to signaling stimuli has been described. However, the precise mechanisms of transport remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the trafficking of nSMase2 between the Golgi and the PM. We show here that V5-nSMase2 localizes at the PM and Golgi in MCF-7 cells and confirm relocalization of nSMase2 to the PM at confluence. Although cycloheximide (CHX) treatment partially inhibited the Golgi localization of GFP-nSMase2, recovery of GFP-nSMase2 to an intracellular compartment was still observed after photobleaching. Moreover, in the presence of CHX, GFP- and V5-nSMase2 co-localized with endosomal/recycling markers. In HEK293 cells, activation of either protein kinase C-alpha or betaII, with the phorbol ester PMA led to relocalization of both wild-type and inactive nSMase2 to the pericentrion, a PKC-dependent subset of recycling endosomes. Finally, inhibition of nSMase2 endocytosis by K\u00a0+\u00a0depletion reduced the intracellular pool of nSMase2 and increased nSMase2 activity resulting in elevated ceramide levels. Altogether, these results suggest that nSMase2 traffics from the Golgi to the PM as a membrane protein en route to the cell surface and recycles back to the Golgi through the endosomal/recycling compartment. Moreover, the recycling of nSMase2 from the PM is important for its catalytic regulation.",

Eight weeks of feeding trans-10,cis-12 CLA significantly improved glucose tolerance without changing body weight or visceral adipose mass. The trans-10,cis-12 isomer was also associated with reduced liver lipid content, improved liver function and reduced inflammation; these effects were not observed in rats fed the cis-9,trans-11 CLA isomer. Reduced liver lipid content did not correlate with activation of AMP-activated protein kinase or suppressed activation of sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1, two key regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism. Interestingly, rats fed cis-9,trans-11 CLA had fewer cytoplasmic lipid droplets in hepatocytes compared to rats fed control diet, but these droplets were larger in size. Conversely, fa/fa rats fed the trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomer had greater numbers of hepatic lipid droplets that were smaller in size, resulting in overall lower total lipid within these droplets. Changes in lipid droplets were associated with lower hepatic levels of PERILIPIN-2 (formerly known as adipophilin) in rats fed trans-10,cis-12 CLA, whereas amounts of other members of the PERILIPIN family of lipid droplet proteins were unaffected by dietary CLA. However, CLA isomers differentially affected the subcellular localization of these proteins. Treatment of H4IIE rat hepatoma cells with CLA isomers neither prevented nor reversed, but rather induced cytoplasmic lipid droplet formation, suggesting that the anti-steatotic effects of trans-10,cis-12 CLA are likely indirect and potentially mediated via increased lipid utilization by peripheral tissues.",

     "abstract": "The fungus Aspergillus nidulans contains both a mitochondrial and peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation pathway. This work was aimed at studying the influence of mutations in the foxA gene, encoding a peroxisomal multifunctional protein, or in the scdA/echA genes, encoding a mitochondrial short-chain dehydrogenase and an enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, on the carbon flux to the peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation pathway. A. nidulans transformed with a peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase produced PHA from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates derived from the peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation of external fatty acids. PHA produced from erucic acid or heptadecanoic acid contained a broad spectrum of monomers, ranging from 5 to 14 carbons, revealing that the peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation cycle can handle both long and short-chain intermediates. While the \u2206foxA mutant grown on erucic acid or oleic acid synthesized 10-fold less PHA compared to wild type, the same mutant grown on octanoic acid or heptanoic acid produced 3- to 6-fold more PHA. Thus, while FoxA has an important contribution to the degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the flux of short-chain fatty acids to peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation is actually enhanced in its absence. While no change in PHA was observed in the \u2206scdA\u2206echA mutant grown on erucic acid or oleic acid compared to wild type, there was a 2- to 4-fold increased synthesis of PHA in \u2206scdA\u2206echA cells grown in octanoic acid or heptanoic acid. These results reveal that a compensatory mechanism exists in A. nidulans that increases the flux of short-chain fatty acids towards the peroxisomal \u00df-oxidation cycle when the mitochondrial \u00df-oxidation pathway is defective.",

     "abstract": "Undigested food is fermented in the colon by the microbiota and gives rise to various microbial metabolites. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including acetic, propionic and butyric acid, are the principal metabolites produced. However, most of the literature focuses on butyrate and to a lesser extent on acetate; consequently, potential effects of propionic acid (PA) on physiology and pathology have long been underestimated. It has been demonstrated that PA lowers fatty acids content in liver and plasma, reduces food intake, exerts immunosuppressive actions and probably improves tissue insulin sensitivity. Thus increased production of PA by the microbiota might be considered beneficial in the context of prevention of obesity and diabetes type 2. The molecular mechanisms by which PA may exert this plethora of physiological effects are slowly being elucidated and include intestinal cyclooxygenase enzyme, the G-protein coupled receptors 41 and 43 and activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, in turn inhibiting the sentinel transcription factor NF-\u03baB and thus increasing the threshold for inflammatory responses in general. Taken together, PA emerges as a major mediator in the link between nutrition, gut microbiota and physiology.",

CCT is an amphitropic protein, whose enzymatic activity is commonly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) translocation; however, most of the enzyme is intranuclearly located. Here we demonstrate that CCT\u03b1 is concentrated in the nucleoplasm of MDCK cells. Confocal immunofluorescence revealed that extracellular hypertonicity shifted the diffuse intranuclear distribution of the enzyme to intranuclear domains in a foci pattern. One population of CCT\u03b1 foci colocalised and interacted with lamin A/C speckles, which also contained the pre-mRNA processing factor SC-35, and was resistant to detergent and salt extraction. The lamin A/C silencing allowed us to visualise a second more labile population of CCT\u03b1 foci that consisted of lamin A/C-independent foci non-resistant to extraction. We demonstrated that CCT\u03b1 translocation is not restricted to its redistribution from the nucleus to the ER and that intranuclear redistribution must thus be considered. We suggest that the intranuclear organelle distribution of CCT\u03b1 is a novel mechanism for the regulation of enzyme activity.",

     "abstract": "To differentiate esterases from lipases at the structure\u2013function level, we have compared the kinetic properties and structural features of sequence-related esterase 1 from rabbit liver (rLE) and bile-salt-activated lipase from bovine pancreas (bBAL). In contrast to rLE, bBAL hydrolyses water-insoluble medium and long chain esters as vinyl laurate, trioctanoin and olive oil. Conversely, rLE and bBAL are both active on water-soluble short chain esters as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, tripropionin, tributyrin and p-nitrophenyl butyrate. However, the enzymes show distinctive kinetic behaviours. rLE displays maximal activity at low substrate concentration, below the critical micelle concentration, whereas bBAL acts preferencially on emulsified esters, at concentration exceeding the solubility limit. Comparison of the 3D structures of rLE and bBAL shows, in particular, that the peptide loop at positions 116\u2013123 in bBAL is deleted in rLE. This peptide segment interacts with a bile salt molecule thus inducing a conformational transition which gives access to the active site. Inhibition studies and manual docking of a bulky ester molecule as vinyl laurate in the catalytic pocket of rLE and bBAL show that the inability of the esterase to hydrolyse large water-insoluble esters is not due to steric hindrance. It is hypothesized that esterases lack specific hydrophobic structures involved both in the stabilization of the lipase\u2013lipid adsorption complex at interfaces and in the spontaneous transfer of a single substrate molecule from interface to the catalytic site.",

A549 conditioned medium-induced differentiation of hASCs to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts was completely abrogated by treatment of hASCs with Ki16425, a lysophosphatidic acid receptor antagonist, or knockdown of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) expression in hASCs with small interfering RNA or lentiviral short hairpin RNA. Using a murine xenograft transplantation model of A549 cells, we showed that co-transplantation of hASCs with A549 cells stimulated growth of A549 xenograft tumor, angiogenesis, and differentiation of hASCs to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts in vivo. Knockdown of LPA1 expression in hASCs abrogated hASCs-stimulated growth of A549 xenograft tumor, angiogenesis, and differentiation of hASCs to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Moreover, A549 conditioned medium-treated hASCs stimulated tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by LPA1-dependent secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.

Previously, we identified carvacrol from the essential oil of thyme as a suppressor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, a key enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis, and also an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), a molecular target for \u201clifestyle-related\u201d diseases. In this study, we evaluated the essential oil of lemongrass using our established assays for COX-2 and PPARs. We found that COX-2 promoter activity was suppressed by lemongrass oil in cell-based transfection assays, and we identified citral as a major component in the suppression of COX-2 expression and as an activator of PPAR\u03b1 and \u03b3. PPAR\u03b3-dependent suppression of COX-2 promoter activity was observed in response to citral treatment. In human macrophage-like U937 cells, citral suppressed both LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, dose-dependently. Moreover, citral induced the mRNA expression of the PPAR\u03b1-responsive carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 gene and the PPAR\u03b3-responsive fatty acid binding protein 4 gene, suggesting that citral activates PPAR\u03b1 and \u03b3, and regulates COX-2 expression.

We show for the first time that within human brain tissue 5\u03b1-dihydroprogesterone and 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone are converted via non-stereo-selective 3-ketosteroid reductase activity to produce the respective 5\u03b1,3\u03b1-THSs and 5\u03b1,3\u03b2-THSs. Apart from this, we prove that within the human temporal lobe and limbic system cytochrome P450c17 and 3\u03b2-HSD/\u03945\u20134 ketosteroid isomerase are not expressed. Thus, it appears that these brain regions are unable to conduct de novo biosynthesis of \u03944-3-ketosteroids from \u03945-3\u03b2-hydroxysteroids. Consequently, the local formation of THSs will depend on the uptake of circulating \u03944-3-ketosteroids such as progesterone and testosterone. 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-HSD activity were (i) equally enriched in the cytosol, (ii) showed equal distribution between cerebral neocortex and subcortical white matter without sex- or age-dependency, (iii) demonstrated a strong and significant positive correlation when comparing 46 different specimens and (iv) exhibited similar sensitivities to different inhibitors of enzyme activity. These findings led to the assumption that cerebral 3-ketosteroid reductase activity might be catalyzed by a single enzyme and is possibly attributed to the expression of a soluble AKR1C aldo-keto reductase. AKR1Cs are known to act as non-stereo-selective 3-ketosteroid reductases; low AKR1C mRNA expression was detected. However, the cerebral 3-ketosteroid reductase was clearly refractory to inhibition by AKR1C inhibitors indicating the expression of a currently unidentified enzyme. Its lack of stereo-selectivity is of physiological significance, since only 5\u03b1,3\u03b1-THSs enhance the effect of GABA on the GABAA receptor, whereas 5\u03b1,3\u03b2-THSs are antagonists.",

HSD17B7 is the orthologue of the yeast steroid-3-ketoreductase (ERG27), an enzyme of ergosterol biosynthesis that plays a protective role towards OSC. Tracer experiments with NS0 cells showed that OSC is fully active in these mammalian cells, suggesting that in mammals the ketosteroid reductase is not required for OSC activity.

Using fatty acid precursors we showed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes are indeed able to convert docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to their NAE derivatives docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA), respectively.

Results of combined incubations with PPAR-\u03b3 and CB2 antagonists suggest a role of these receptors in mediating the reduction of IL-6 by DHEA. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that in addition to other pathways, formation of N-acyl ethanolamines may contribute to the biological activity of n-3 PUFAs.

Primary myotubes were treated with leptin (0.1, 1, 10, 100\u00a0nM) for 24\u00a0h. Lipid oxidation was determined by 14CO2 production rate from [1-14C] palmitate. Leptin was found to increase lipid oxidation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in db/db myotubes as well as in m/m myotubes. Leptin significantly increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in both types of myotube. Leptin-induced lipid oxidation was abolished by STAT3 siRNA. To investigate the mechanism underlying leptin-induced lipid oxidation, the effects of pharmacological inhibitors were examined. JAK2 or p38 MAPK inhibitor suppressed leptin-induced lipid oxidation and decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in both types of myotube, respectively. Leptin significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and leptin-induced lipid oxidation was abolished by treatment with p38 MAPK siRNA in both types of myotube.

EPC release PAF in a time dependent manner upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) or high-glucose concentration with a peak at 30\u00a0min and 10\u00a0min (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 vs. control), respectively. PAF, starting at concentration of 50\u00a0ng/ml, exerted a detrimental effect on EPC number with a concomitant increase of p38 activity. Furthermore, both the reduction of early EPC number and the enhanced p38 activity induced by PAF were abolished by CV3988, a PAF receptor antagonist. These novel findings, revealing that early EPC respond to PAF signaling, unveil an inflammatory pathway that may play a crucial role in the outcome of cardiovascular cell therapy with EPC.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the effect of a non-mammalian omega-3 desaturase in a mouse hepatocarcinogenesis model. Mice containing double mutations (DM) in c-myc and TGF-\u03b1 (transforming growth factor-\u03b1), leading to liver neoplasia, were crossed with mice containing omega-3 desaturase. MRI analysis of triple mutant (TM) mice showed the absence of neoplasia at all time points for 92% of mice in the study. Pathological changes of TM (TGF\u03b1/c-myc/fat-1) mouse liver tissue was similar to control mouse liver tissue. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of unsaturated fatty acids found a significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) between DM and TM transgenic (Tg) mice at 34 and 40\u00a0weeks of age. HPLC analysis of mouse liver tissue revealed markedly decreased levels of omega-6 fatty acids in TM mice when compared to DM (TGF\u03b1/c-myc) and control (CD1) mice. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis indicated significantly decreased 16:0/20:4 and 18:1/20:4 and elevated 16:0/22:6 fatty acyl groups in both GPCho and GPEtn, and elevated 16:0/20:5, 18:0/18:2, 18:0/18:1 and 18:0/22:6 in GPCho, within TM mice compared to DM mice. Total fatty acid analysis indicated a significant decrease in 18:1n9 in TM mice compared to DM mice. Western blot analysis of liver tissue showed a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decrease in NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor-\u03baB) levels at 40\u00a0weeks of age in TM mice compared to DM mice. Microarray analysis of TM versus DM mice livers at 40\u00a0weeks revealed alterations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell-to-cell signaling, p53 signaling, and arachidonic acid (20:4) metabolism.

     "abstract": "Elovl4 is a fatty acyl elongase that participates in the biosynthesis of very long-chain fatty acids (\u2265\u00a0C24), which are relatively abundant in skin (saturated chains), or retina, brain and testes (polyunsaturated chains) of mammals. In the present study we characterised two Elovl4 proteins, Elovl4a and Elovl4b, from zebrafish Danio rerio, and investigated their expression patterns during embryonic development. Heterologous expression in baker's yeast showed that both zebrafish Elovl4 proteins efficiently elongated saturated fatty acids up to C36, with 26:0 appearing the preferred substrate as reported for human ELOVL4. Interestingly, activity for the elongation of PUFA substrates was only shown by Elovl4b, which effectively converted eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids to elongated polyenoic products up to C36. Furthermore, zebrafish Elovl4b may be involved in the biosynthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) as it had the capacity to elongate 22:5n-3 to 24:5n-3 which can be subsequently desaturated and chain shortened to DHA in peroxisomes. The distinct functional roles of zebrafish Elovl4 proteins were also reflected in their spatial\u2013temporal expression patterns during ontogeny. Analyses by whole-mount in situ hybridisation in zebrafish embryos showed that elovl4a was expressed in neuronal tissues (wide-spread distribution in the head area), with elovl4b specifically expressed in epiphysis (pineal gland) and photoreceptor cells in the retina. Similarly, tissue distribution in adults revealed that elovl4a transcripts were found in most tissues analysed, whereas elovl4b expression was essentially restricted to eye and gonads. Overall, the results suggest that zebrafish elovl4b resembles other mammalian orthologues in terms of function and expression patterns, whereas elovl4a may represent an alternative elongase not previously described in vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "Verots S3 and Vero317 cells were shown by metabolic labeling with 35S-sulfate to contain many more sulfoglycosphingolipids than original Vero cells derived from African green monkey kidney. The activity of galactosyl ceramide sulfotransferase (GST) was shown to be 89- and 92-fold higher in Vero317 cells and Verots S3 cells, respectively, than that of the parent cells, whereas the activity of the degradation enzyme, arylsulfatase A, was unchanged among all the three cell strains. GST gene transcript levels in Verots cells were 14.3-fold higher than those in Vero cells. The cell adhesiveness to the culture plate under hypertonic stress was strengthened significantly in both mutant strains. Among the major sulfoglycolipids of the Verots S3 cell line, assigned as SM4s, SM3, SM2a, and SB1a, the incorporation of 35S-sulfate into SM3, SM2a and SB1a was upregulated with the increasing tonicity of the medium. Sulfoglycolipids in these renal cells seemed to contribute to the membrane barrier against hypertonic media as shown previously in another renal cell line, MDCK (Niimura and Nagai, 2008). Sulfoglycolipid synthesis was suppressed with the p38 (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and/or with the MEK-1/2 (MAPKK) inhibitor PD98059, and with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, which also reduced the sulfoglycolipid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Further the administration of the MAPK/MAPKK inhibitors to the culture medium reduced significantly the viability of Verots S3 cells under hypertonic stress. These findings suggest that sulfoglycolipid synthesis in those renal cells may be regulated to adapt to the renal osmotic circumstances by the medium's osmolarity via the MAPK signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "The first committed step in the formation of 24-alkylsterols in the ascomycetous fungus Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis (Pb) has been shown to involve C24-methylation of lanosterol to eburicol (24(28)-methylene-24,25-dihydro-lanosterol) on the basis of metabolite co-occurrence. A similarity-based cloning strategy was employed to obtain the cDNA clone corresponding to the sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) implicated in the C24-methylation reaction. The resulting catalyst, prepared as a recombinant fusion protein (His/Trx/S), was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(C43) and shown to possess a substrate specificity for lanosterol and to generate a single exocyclic methylene product. The full-length cDNA has an open reading frame of 1131 base pairs and encodes a protein of 377 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 42,502\u00a0Da. The enzymatic C24-methylation gave a Kmapp of 38\u00a0\u03bcM and kcatapp of 0.14\u00a0min\u22121. Quite unexpectedly, \u201cplant\u201d cycloartenol was catalyzed in high yield to 24(28)-methylene cycloartanol consistent with conformational arguments that favor that both cycloartenol and lanosterol are bound pseudoplanar in the ternary complex. Incubation of [27-13C]- or [24-2H]cycloartenol with PbSMT and analysis of the enzyme-generated product by a combination of 1H and 13CNMR and mass spectroscopy established the regiospecific conversion of the pro-Z methyl group of the \u039424(25)-substrate to the pro-R isopropyl methyl group of the product and the migration of H24 to C25 on the Re-face of the original substrate double bond undergoing C24-methylation. Inhibition kinetics and products formed from the substrate analogs 25-azalanosterol (Ki 14\u00a0nM) and 26,27-dehydrolanosterol (Ki 54\u00a0\u03bcM and kinact of 0.24\u00a0min\u22121) provide direct evidence for distinct reaction channeling capitalized by structural differences in the C24- and C26-sterol acceptors. 25-Azalanosterol was a potent inhibitor of cell growth (IC50, 30\u00a0nM) promoting lanosterol accumulation and 24-alkyl sterol depletion. Phylogenetic analysis of PbSMT with related SMTs of diverse origin together with the results of the present study indicate that the enzyme may have a similar complement of active-site amino acid residues compared to related yeast SMTs affording monofunctional C1-transfer behavior, yet there are sufficient differences in its overall amino acid composition and substrate-dependent partitioning pathways to group PbSMT into a fourth and new class of SMT.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is an important constituent of the gastrointestinal tract. PC molecules are not only important in intestinal cell membranes but also receiving increasing attention as protective agents in the gastrointestinal barrier. They are largely responsible for establishing the hydrophobic surface of the colon. Decreased phospholipids in colonic mucus could be linked to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical studies revealed that therapeutic addition of PC to the colonic mucus of these patients alleviated the inflammatory activity. This positive role is still elusive, however, we hypothesized that luminal PC has two possible functions: first, it is essential for surface hydrophobicity, and second, it is integrated into the plasma membrane of enterocytes and it modulates the signaling state of the mucosa. The membrane structure and lipid composition of cells is a regulatory component of the inflammatory signaling pathways. In this perspective, we will shortly summarize what is known about the localization and protective properties of PC in the colonic mucosa before turning to its evident medical importance. We will discuss how PC contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and how reinforcing the luminal phospholipid monolayer can be used as a therapeutic concept in humans.",

     "abstract": "The reduced expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) at the canalicular membrane is associated with cholestasis-induced hepatotoxicity due to the accumulation of bile acids in hepatocytes. We previously reported that 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), an approved drug for urea cycle disorders, is a promising agent for intrahepatic cholestasis because it increases both the cell surface expression and the transport capacity of BSEP. In the present study, we searched for effective compounds other than 4PBA by focusing on short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which have similar characteristics to 4PBA such as their low-molecular-weight and a carboxyl group. In transcellular transport studies using Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells, all short- and medium-chain fatty acids tested except for formate, acetate, and hexanoic acid showed more potent effects on wild type (WT) BSEP-mediated [3H]taurocholate transport than did 4PBA. The increase in WT BSEP transport with butyrate and octanoic acid treatment correlated with an increase in its expression at the cell surface. Two PFIC2-type variants, E297G and D482G BSEP, were similarly affected with both compounds treatment. The prolonged half-life of cell surface-resident WT BSEP was responsible for this increased octanoic acid-stimulated transport, but not for that of butyrate. In conclusion, short- and medium-chain fatty acids have potent effects on the increase in WT and PFIC2-type BSEP-mediated transport in MDCK II cells. Although both short- and medium-chain fatty acids enhance the transport capacity of WT and PFIC2-type BSEP by inducing those expressions at the cell surface, the underlying mechanism seems to differ between fatty acids.",

In this study, we report that ABCA1 and ABCG1 are also present on the syncytiotrophoblast, the maternal facing placental membrane. Syncytial ABCA1 expression is apical, suggesting a role in cholesterol efflux to the mother, while ABCG1 is expressed basolaterally indicating transport to the fetus. Silencing of ABCA1 expression in primary trophoblasts in culture, or pharmacological antagonism by glyburide, decreased cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) compared to controls, while ABCG1-silencing decreased cholesterol efflux to high density lipoproteins (HDL). In contrast, treatment with endogenous or synthetic LXR \u03b1/\u03b2 ligands such as T0901317 increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and enhanced cholesterol efflux to apoA-I and HDL, respectively, while treatment with pharmacological PPAR-\u03b1 or -\u03b3 ligands was without effect. Trophoblasts transfected with ABCA1 or ABCG1 siRNA were more sensitive to toxic oxysterols substrates (25-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol) compared to mock-transfected cells, while prior treatment with T0901317 reduced oxysterol-mediated toxicity.

     "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes and hepatocyte apoptosis are strongly implicated in disease progression from the potentially reversible condition of steatosis to severe acute and chronic liver injury. Acyl-CoA synthetase 5, a member of the ACSL gene family that catalyzes the activation of long-chain fatty acids for lipid biosynthesis, is the only ACSL isoform that is both, located on mitochondria and functionally involved in enterocyte apoptosis. In this study, the regulation of human ACSL5 in hepatocellular fatty acid degeneration and its involvement in hepatocyte apoptosis was investigated using models of in vitro and in vivo steatosis as well as plasmid-mediated stable gene transfer and RNAi-mediated gene silencing. ACSL5 mRNA and protein were strongly increased by uptake of dietary derived fatty acids in primary human hepatocytes, HepG2 cells and human steatotic liver. Over-expression of ACSL5 decreased HepG2 cell viability and increased susceptibility to TRAIL- and TNF\u03b1-, but not FAS- induced apoptosis, whereas knock down of ACSL5 reduced apoptosis susceptibility. High ACSL5 activity resulted in enhanced caspase-3/7 activity, but was not accompanied by up-regulation of death receptors, DR4, DR5 or TNF-R1. This study gives evidence that hepatocyte steatosis is associated with ACSL5 up-regulation resulting in increased susceptibility to hepatic cell death. We propose that ACSL5 could play a role in promoting fatty acid-induced lipoapoptosis in hepatocytes as important mechanism in fatty liver-related disorders.",

In previous work we showed that a membrane fluidizer benzyl alcohol (BA) could mimic the effects of heat stress and enhance heat shock protein synthesis in different mammalian cells. Here we explore heat- and BA-induced stress further by characterizing stress-induced membrane lipid changes in mouse melanoma B16 cells. Lipidomic fingerprints revealed that membrane stress achieved either by heat or BA resulted in pronounced and highly specific alterations in lipid metabolism. The loss in polyenes with the concomitant increase in saturated lipid species was shown to be a consequence of the activation of phopholipases (mainly phopholipase A2 and C).

This work examined the mechanisms by which activation of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) induces expression of inflammatory cytokines in adipocytes in vivo and model adipocytes in vitro. \u03b23-AR activation in mice triggered expression of inflammatory genes CCL2, IL-6, and PAI-1, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers GRP78 and CHOP. Pharmacological inhibition of HSL blocked induction of inflammatory genes, but not ER stress markers. Promoting intracellular accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas inhibiting ceramide synthesis partly blocked PAI-1 expression, but not IL-6. Induction of inflammatory markers in vivo and in vitro was preceded by phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, and inhibition of HSL prevented activation of these kinases. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors of specific MAP kinases demonstrated the importance of p38 MAPK as a mediator of lipolysis-induced inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate that FFAs liberated by HSL activate p38 and JNK, and p38 mediates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in adipose tissue.",

     "abstract": "The current study presents data indicating that 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 affects the production of hormones and expression of crucial steroidogenic enzymes in the human adrenocortical cell line NCI-H295R. This cell line is widely used as a model for adrenal steroidogenesis. Treatment of the cells with 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 suppressed the levels of corticosterone, aldosterone, DHEA, DHEA-sulfate and androstenedione in the culture medium. In order to study the mechanisms behind this suppression of hormone production, we investigated the effects of 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on important genes and enzymes controlling the biosynthesis of adrenal hormones. The mRNA levels were decreased for CYP21A2 while they were increased for CYP11A1 and CYP17A1. No significant changes were observed in mRNA for CYP11B1, CYP11B2 or 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2HSD). In similarity with the effects on mRNA levels, also the endogenous enzyme activity of CYP21A2 decreased after treatment with 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Interestingly, the two CYP17A1-mediated activities were influenced reciprocally \u2014 the 17\u03b1-hydroxylase activity increased whereas the 17,20-lyase activity decreased. The current data indicate that the 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated decrease in corticosterone and androgen production is due to suppression of the 21-hydroxylase activity by CYP21A2 and the 17,20-lyase activity by CYP17A1, respectively. In conclusion, the current study reports novel findings on 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated effects on hormone production and regulation of genes and enzymes involved in steroidogenesis in the adrenocortical NCI-H295R cell line, a model for human adrenal cortex.",

     "abstract": "Monoacylglycerols (MAGs) are short-lived intermediates of glycerolipid metabolism. Specific molecular species, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which is a potent activator of cannabinoid receptors, may also function as lipid signaling molecules. In mammals, enzymes hydrolyzing MAG to glycerol and fatty acids, resembling the final step in lipolysis, or esterifying MAG to diacylglycerol, are well known; however, despite the high level of conservation of lipolysis, the corresponding activities in yeast have not been characterized yet. Here we provide evidence that the protein Yju3p functions as a potent MAG hydrolase in yeast. Cellular MAG hydrolase activity was decreased by more than 90% in extracts of Yju3p-deficient cells, indicating that Yju3p accounts for the vast majority of this activity in yeast. Loss of this activity was restored by heterologous expression of murine monoglyceride lipase (MGL). Since yju3\u0394 mutants accumulated MAG in vivo only at very low concentrations, we considered the possibility that MAGs are re-esterified into DAG by acyltransferases. Indeed, cellular MAG levels were further increased in mutant cells lacking Yju3p and Dga1p or Lro1p acyltransferase activities. In conclusion, our studies suggest that catabolic and anabolic reactions affect cellular MAG levels. Yju3p is the functional orthologue of mammalian MGL and is required for efficient degradation of MAG in yeast.",

Atlantic salmon are able to synthesize EPA and DHA from 18:3n-3 through reactions catalyzed by fatty acyl desaturases (Fad) and elongases of very long chain fatty acids. Previously, two cDNAs encoding functionally distinct \u03945 and \u03946 Fads were isolated, but screening of a genomic DNA library revealed the existence of more putative fad genes in the Atlantic salmon genome. In the present study, we show that there are at least four genes encoding putative Fad proteins in Atlantic salmon. Two genes, \u03946fad_a and \u03945fad, corresponded to the previously cloned \u03946 and \u03945 Fad cDNAs. Functional characterization by heterologous expression in yeast showed that the cDNAs for both the two further putative fad genes, \u03946fad_b and \u03946fad_c, had only \u03946 activity, converting 47 % and 12 % of 18:3n-3 to 18:4n-3, and 25 and 7 % of 18:2n-6 to 18:3n-6, for \u22066Fad_b and \u03946fad_c, respectively. Both \u22066fad_a and \u22066fad_b genes were highly expressed in intestine (pyloric caeca), liver and brain, with \u22066fad_b also highly expressed in gill, whereas \u22066fad_c transcript was found predominantly in brain, with lower expression levels in all other tissues. The expression levels of the \u22066fad_a gene in liver and the \u22066fad_b gene in intestine were significantly higher in fish fed diets containing vegetable oil compared to fish fed fish oil suggesting up-regulation in response to reduced dietary EPA and DHA. In contrast, no significant differences were found between transcript levels for \u22066fad_a in intestine, \u22066fad_b in liver, or \u22066fad_c in liver or intestine of fish fed vegetable oil compared to fish fed fish oil.

Also, the transfer of fluorescent fatty acid analogues to model membranes under physiological ionic strength follows a different mechanism compared to most of the members of this family of intracellular lipid binding proteins. Tryptophan insertion mutants sensitive to ligand binding have allowed us to directly measure the binding affinity, ligand partitioning and transfer to model membranes of natural ligands. Binding of fatty acids shows a cooperative mechanism, while acyl-CoAs binding presents a hyperbolic behavior. Saturated fatty acids seem to have a stronger partition to protein vs. membranes, compared to unsaturated fatty acids. Natural ligand transfer rates are more than 200-fold higher compared to fluorescently-labeled analogues. Interestingly, oleoyl-CoA presents a markedly different transfer behavior compared to the rest of the ligands tested, probably indicating the possibility of specific targeting of ligands to different metabolic fates.",

     "abstract": "Most of the many biological effects of estrogens are mediated via the estrogen receptors ER\u03b1 and \u03b2. The current study examines the role of CYP7B1-mediated catalysis for activation of ER. Several reports suggest that CYP7B1 may be important for hormonal action but previously published studies are contradictory concerning the manner in which CYP7B1 affects ER\u03b2-mediated response. In the current study, we examined effects of several CYP7B1-related steroids on ER activation, using an estrogen response element (ERE) reporter system. Our studies showed significant stimulation of ER by 5-androstene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol (Aene-diol) and 5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol (3\u03b2-Adiol). In contrast, the CYP7B1-formed metabolites from these steroids did not activate the receptor, indicating that CYP7B1-mediated metabolism abolishes the ER-stimulating effect of these compounds. The mRNA level of HEM45, a gene known to be stimulated by estrogens, was strongly up-regulated by Aene-diol but not by its CYP7B1-formed metabolite, further supporting this concept. We did not observe stimulation by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or 7\u03b1-hydroxy-DHEA, previously suggested to affect ER\u03b2-mediated response. As part of these studies we examined metabolism of Aene-diol in pig liver which is high in CYP7B1 content. These experiments indicate that CYP7B1-mediated metabolism of Aene-diol is of a similar rate as the metabolism of the well-known CYP7B1 substrates DHEA and 3\u03b2-Adiol. CYP7B1-mediated metabolism of 3\u03b2-Adiol has been proposed to influence ER\u03b2-mediated growth suppression. Our results indicate that Aene-diol also might be important for ER-related pathways. Our data indicate that low concentrations of Aene-diol can trigger ER-mediated response equally well for both ER\u03b1 and \u03b2 and that CYP7B1-mediated conversion of Aene-diol into a 7\u03b1-hydroxymetabolite will result in loss of action.",

Its active site contains a critical cysteine-thiol residue, which is a plausible target for oxidation by H2O2. Streptococcus pneumoniae produces exceptionally high levels of H2O2, mainly through the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-P via pyruvate oxidase (SpxB). We present evidence showing that endogenous H2O2 inhibits FabF activity by specifically oxidizing its active site cysteine-thiol residue. Thiol trapping methods revealed that one of the three FabF cysteines in the wild-type strain was oxidized, whereas in an spxB mutant, defective in H2O2 production, none of the cysteines was oxidized, indicating that the difference in FabF redox state originated from endogenous H2O2. In vitro exposure of the spxB mutant to various H2O2 concentrations further confirmed that only one cysteine residue was susceptible to oxidation. By blocking FabF active site cysteine with cerulenin we show that the oxidized cysteine was the catalytic one. Inhibition of FabF activity by either H2O2 or cerulenin resulted in altered membrane fatty acid composition. We conclude that FabF activity is inhibited by H2O2 produced by S. pneumoniae.",

The epidemiological link between elevated plasma cholesterol at midlife and increased risk for AD and the possibility that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzym A reductase inhibitors (statins) may be protective against AD support a role of cholesterol metabolism in AD and have rendered it a potential therapeutic target in the treatment and prevention of the disease. The strong association of AD and AD endophenotypes with the APOE gene provides a genetic link between AD and cholesterol metabolism, because the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the most prevalent cholesterol transport protein in the central nervous system. Against this background several other genes with a role in cholesterol metabolism have been investigated for association with AD. In this review a compilation of genes related to cholesterol based on the information of the AmiGo gene ontology database is matched with the AlzGene database of AD candidate genes. 56 out of 149 (37.6%) genes with a relation to cholesterol metabolism have been investigated for association with AD. Given that only 660 out of about 23,000 (2.9%) genes have been assessed in hypothesis-driven candidate gene studies on AD, the cholesterol metabolic pathway is strongly represented among these genes. Among 34 cholesterol-related genes for which association with AD has been described APOE, CH25H, CLU, LDLR, SORL1 outstand with positive meta-analyses.

AD-related cognitive impairment, synaptic loss and neurodegeneration result from interactions of A\u03b2 oligomers with the synaptic membrane and subsequent activation of pro-apoptotic signalling pathways. Therefore, membrane structure and lipid status appear determinant in A\u03b2-induced toxicity. Numerous epidemiological studies have highlighted the beneficial influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) on the preservation of synaptic function and memory capacities in aged individuals or upon A\u03b2 exposure, whereas its deficiency is presented as a risk factor for AD. An elevated number of studies have been reporting the beneficial effects of dietary DHA supplementation on cognition and synaptic integrity in various AD models. In this review, we describe the important potential of DHA to preserve neuronal and brain functions and classified its numerous molecular and cellular effects from impact on membrane lipid content and organisation to activation of signalling pathways sustaining synaptic function and neuronal survival. DHA appears as one of the most valuable diet ingredients whose neuroprotective properties could be crucial for designing nutrition-based strategies able to prevent AD as well as other lipid- and age-related diseases whose prevalence is progressing in elderly populations.",

In this review, we shall discuss the role of apo E in the brain, particularly in relation to Alzheimer disease. Cholesterol transport and homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS) are separated from that in the peripheral circulation by the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, the brain operates its own lipoprotein transport system that is mediated by high density lipoprotein-sized, apo E-containing lipoproteins that are synthesized and secreted by glial cells (primarily astrocytes). Several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are expressed in the brain, including ABCA1 and ABCG1 which play important roles in the transfer of phospholipids and cholesterol to apo E. The astrocyte-derived apo E-containing lipoproteins can bind to, and be internalized by, receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily that are located on the surface of neurons. In addition to these receptors serving as endocytosis receptors for lipoproteins, several of these receptors also act as signaling receptors in neurons and activate pathways involved in axonal growth, as well as neuronal survival. These beneficial pathways appear to be enhanced to a greater extent by apo E3 than by apo E4. Apo E has also been implicated in the deposition of amyloid plaques since apo E3, more readily than apo E4, forms a complex with A\u00df peptides, and mediates the degradation of amyloid deposits.",

Mutations in the NPC1 gene lead to the retention of cholesterol and other lipids in the lysosomal compartment, and such defects are the basis of NPC disease. Several parallels exist between NPC disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD), including altered cholesterol homeostasis, changes in the lysosomal system, neurofibrillary tangles, and increased amyloid-beta generation. How the expression of NPC1 in the human brain is affected in AD has not been investigated so far. In the present study, we measured NPC1 mRNA and protein expression in three distinct regions of the human brain, and we revealed that NPC1 expression is upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of AD patients compared to control individuals. In the cerebellum, a brain region that is relatively spared in AD, no difference in NPC1 expression was detected. Similarly, murine NPC1 mRNA levels were increased in the hippocampus of 12-month-old transgenic mice expressing a familial AD form of human amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1tg) compared to 12-month-old wild type mice, whereas no change in NPC1 was detected in mouse cerebellum. Immunohistochemical analysis of human hippocampus indicated that NPC1 expression was strongest in neurons. However, in vitro studies revealed that NPC1 expression was not induced by transfecting SK-N-SH neurons with human APP or by treating them with oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide. Total cholesterol levels were reduced in hippocampus from AD patients compared to control individuals, and it is therefore possible that the increased expression of NPC1 is linked to perturbed cholesterol homeostasis in AD.",

     "abstract": "Several lines of evidence support a strong relationship between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Membrane cholesterol is known to modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) secretion. Here we show in a human cell line model of endocytosis (HEK293 cells) that cholesterol exerts these effects in a dose-dependent and linear manner, over a wide range of concentrations (-40% to +\u00a040% variations of plasma membrane cholesterol induced by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) and MBCD-cholesterol complex respectively). We found that the gradual effect of cholesterol is inhibited by small interference RNA-mediated downregulation of clathrin. Modulation of clathrin-mediated APP endocytosis by cholesterol was further demonstrated using mutants of proteins involved in the formation of early endosomes (dynamin2, Eps15 and Rab5). Importantly we show that membrane proteins other than APP are not affected by cholesterol to the same extent. Indeed clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transferrin and cannabinoid1 receptors as well as internalization of surface proteins labelled with a biotin derivative (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) were not sensitive to variations of plasma membrane cholesterol from -40% to 40%. In conclusion clathrin-dependent APP endocytosis appears to be very sensitive to the levels of membrane cholesterol. These results suggest that cholesterol increase in AD could be responsible for the enhanced internalization of clathrin-, dynamin2-, Eps15- and Rab5-dependent endocytosis of APP and the ensuing overproduction of A\u03b2.",

     "abstract": "Clarification of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the assembly of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) into insoluble fibrils in the brain has been one of the biggest challenges in the research on Alzheimer disease (AD). We previously identified a novel A\u03b2 species, which was characterized by its tight binding to GM1 ganglioside (GM1), in the brain showing early pathological changes of AD. The ganglioside-bound A\u03b2 (GA\u03b2) possessed unique characteristics, including its altered immunoreactivity, which suggests its distinct conformation from native A\u03b2, and its strong potency to accelerate A\u03b2 assembly into fibrils. On the basis of these characteristics, it was hypothesized that A\u03b2 adopts an altered conformation following interaction with GM1, leading to the generation of GA\u03b2, and then GA\u03b2 acts as an endogenous seed for Alzheimer amyloid in the brain. To date, various in vitro and in vivo studies on GA\u03b2 have revealed how A\u03b2 binds to gangliosides, i.e., what are the favorable physicochemical and neurobiological conditions for generating GA\u03b2, and what is the pathological significance of ganglioside-induced A\u03b2 assembly in the development of AD. Interestingly, GA\u03b2 is favorably generated in the unique ganglioside-enriched (clustered), raft-like microdomains; moreover, amyloid fibrils formed in the presence of gangliosides are neurotoxic. Furthermore, the conformational change of A\u03b2 in the presence of ganglioside has been characterized by an NMR study. In this review, we focus on the recent progress of GA\u03b2 studies and highlight the possibility that ganglioside binding is the initial and common step in the development of a part of human misfolding-type amyloidoses, including AD.",

Cholesterol is a highly recognized product of this pathway but growing interest is being given to the synthesis and functions of isoprenoids. Isoprenoids are a complex class of biologically active lipids including for example, dolichol, ubiquinone, farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Early work had shown that the long-chain isoprenoid dolichol is decreased but that dolichyl phosphate and ubiquinone are elevated in brains of Alzheimer\u2032s disease (AD) patients. Until recently, levels of their biological active precursors FPP and GGPP were unknown. These short-chain isoprenoids are critical in the post-translational modification of certain proteins which function as molecular switches in numerous signaling pathways. The major protein families belong to the superfamily of small GTPases, consisting of roughly 150 members. Recent experimental evidence indicated that members of the small GTPases are involved in AD pathogenesis and stimulated interest in the role of FPP and GGPP in protein prenylation and cell function. A straightforward prediction derived from those studies was that FPP and GGPP levels would be elevated in AD brains as compared with normal neurological controls. For the first time, recent evidence shows significantly elevated levels of FPP and GGPP in human AD brain tissue. Cholesterol levels did not differ between AD and control samples. One obvious conclusion is that homeostasis of FPP and GGPP but not of cholesterol is specifically targeted in AD. Since prenylation of small GTPases by FPP or GGPP is indispensable for their proper function we are proposing that these two isoprenoids are up-regulated in AD resulting in an over abundance of certain prenylated proteins which contributes to neuronal dysfunction.",

We recently found that certain oxysterols, namely the 7-substituted oxysterols, bound to the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b3 with high affinity, altered the LBD conformation and reduced coactivator binding resulting in suppression of the constitutive transcriptional activity of these two receptors. Here, we show that another oxysterol, 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC), is also a high affinity ligand for ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b3 (Ki \u223c\u00a025\u00a0nM). 24S-OHC is also known as cerebrosterol due to its high level in the brain where it plays an essential role as an intermediate in cholesterol elimination from the CNS. 24S-OHC functions as a ROR\u03b1/\u03b3 inverse agonist suppressing the constitutive transcriptional activity of these receptors in cotransfection assays. Additionally, 24S-OHC suppressed the expression of several ROR\u03b1 target genes including BMAL1 and REV-ERB\u03b1 in a ROR-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that 24S-OHC decreases the ability of ROR\u03b1 to recruit the coactivator SRC-2 when bound to the BMAL1 promoter. We also noted that 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol selectively suppressed the activity of ROR\u03b3. These data indicate that ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b3 may serve as sensors of oxsterols. Thus, ROR\u03b1 and ROR\u03b3 display an overlapping ligand preference with another class of oxysterol nuclear receptors, the liver X receptors (LXR\u03b1 [NR1H3] and LXR\u03b2 [NR1H2]).",

Recent evidence indicates that these lipid oxidation products, by activating the thromboxane receptor system, mediate the pro-amyloidotic neuronal response to oxidative stress in an experimental model of AD. This novel observation has important clinical implication, since pharmacologic modulation of the TP receptor system by selective antagonists, some of which are already available, could represent a novel therapeutic opportunity for AD as disease-modifying agents.",

However, it has to be evaluated, if changes of cholesterol metabolism in the whole body or in the CNS are exclusively due to the altered elimination of cholesterol or are also due to altered de novo synthesis in AD. We investigated CSF and plasma levels of cholesterol and of its precursors lanosterol, lathosterol and desmosterol in AD patients and non-demented controls. We found CSF levels of cholesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), absolute levels of all investigated cholesterol precursors (each p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and ratios of cholesterol precursors/cholesterol (each <\u00a00.01) to be lower in AD patients as compared to controls. In plasma, the absolute levels of lanosterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and lathosterol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the ratio of lathosterol/cholesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) but none of the other investigated parameters were reduced in AD patients (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1).

Our data support the hypothesis that cholesterol metabolism is altered in AD and further suggest that especially cholesterol de novo synthesis within the CNS of AD patients might be reduced.

Evidence suggests that allopregnanolone dysregulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Our prior data demonstrate that allopregnanolone is reduced in prefrontal cortex in male patients with AD compared to male cognitively intact control subjects, and inversely correlated with neuropathological disease stage (Braak and Braak). We therefore determined if allopregnanolone levels are also reduced in AD patients compared to control subjects in temporal cortex, utilizing a larger set of samples from both male and female patients. In addition, we investigated if neurosteroids are altered in subjects who are APOE4 allele carriers. Allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and pregnenolone levels were determined in temporal cortex postmortem samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, preceded by high performance liquid chromatography (40 subjects with AD/41 cognitively intact control subjects). Allopregnanolone levels are reduced in temporal cortex in patients with AD (median 2.68\u00a0ng/g, n\u00a0=\u00a040) compared to control subjects (median 5.64\u00a0ng/g, n\u00a0=\u00a041), Mann\u2013Whitney p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002, and inversely correlated with Braak and Braak neuropathological disease stage (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004).

Patients carrying an APOE4 allele demonstrate reduced allopregnanolone levels in temporal cortex (Mann\u2013Whitney p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In summary, our findings indicate that neurosteroids are altered in temporal cortex in patients with AD and related to neuropathological disease stage.

Recent genetic and biochemical studies indicate that not only the amount, but also the distribution of intracellular cholesterol is critical to regulate A\u03b2 generation. Acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT) is a family of enzymes that regulates the cellular distribution of cholesterol by converting membrane cholesterol into hydrophobic cholesteryl esters for cholesterol storage and transport.

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder, which affects more than 35\u00a0million people worldwide, is characterized by a massive accumulation of tangles and amyloid plaques. Several risk factors linked to lipid homeostasis have been identified. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which also has a strong impact in coronary artery disease, is besides aging the most prominent risk factor in sporadic AD. High levels of lipoproteins and cholesterol increase the risk of AD and some cholesterol lowering drugs like statins seem to correlate with a reduced risk for dementia. Moreover, cholesterol increases amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) production, which is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. Beside cholesterol, other lipids that strongly modulate APP processing could be identified and interestingly the APP cleavage products itself regulate lipid homeostasis resulting in complex regulatory feedback cycles. Here, we review the mechanistic link of cholesterol and sphingolipid homeostasis and APP processing and the consequence of this bidirectional link for and in AD. Although cholesterol is the best studied brain lipid in AD, many other lipids are involved in the A\u03b2-lipid regulatory system and some of these lipids exceed the cholesterol effect on A\u03b2 production [1\u20135]. This involvement is bidirectional. On the one hand, lipids control APP processing and, on the other hand, APP processing controls the levels of several key lipids [6, 7]. Beside the physiological function of APP processing in lipid homeostasis, under pathological conditions like AD, these regulating (feedback-) cycles are dysfunctional. Additionally, mutual influence of lipids and APP processing raises the question if altered lipid homeostasis is the cause or consequence of AD.",

     "abstract": "It is generally believed that cholesterol homoeostasis in the brain is both linked to and impacted by Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, elevated levels of cholesterol in neuronal plasma and endosome membranes appear to be a pro-amyloidogenic factor. The recent observation that the C-terminal transmembrane domain (C99, also known as the \u03b2-C-terminal fragment, or \u03b2-CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) specifically binds cholesterol helps to tie together previously loose ends in the web of our understanding of Alzheimer's\u2013cholesterol relationships. In particular, binding of cholesterol to C99 appears to favor the amyloidogenic pathway in cells by promoting localization of C99 in lipid rafts. In turn, the products of this pathway\u2014amyloid-\u03b2 and the intracellular domain of the APP (AICD)\u2014may down-regulate ApoE-mediated cholesterol uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis. If confirmed, this negative-feedback loop for membrane cholesterol levels has implications for understanding the function of the APP and for devising anti-amyloidogenic preventive strategies for AD.",

Although it is widely accepted that ML signals originate mainly from fatty-acyl chains in triacylglycerols (TAG) contained in cytosolic lipid droplets (LD), the dynamics of TAG in LD is not yet fully understood. In order to better understand the synthesis of cellular TAG and its relationship to ML dynamics we carried out a set of labelling experiments with C6 rat glioma cells in culture. TAG and phospholipid metabolism was monitored by incubating C6 cells with [1-13C]-glucose at two time points during cell growth curve \u201324\u00a0h incubation starting at log-phase; 48\u00a0h incubation starting at saturation density\u2013 and by acquiring the 2D-HMQC NMR spectra of the respective total lipid extracts. The resulting TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG) and phospholipid labelling patterns can only be explained if TAG synthesis takes place in two different subcellular compartments. One compartment would be the endoplasmic reticulum, which is known to be involved in TAG metabolism, while the other compartment could be the plasma membrane and/or the LD. This possible role of LD is further supported by the recent description of diacylglycerolacyltranferase-activity associated with LD. Accordingly, we postulate the existence of a carbon-shuttling mechanism between plasma membrane phospholipids and endoplasmic reticulum by way of LD content. The results we have obtained with C6 cells may also apply to other cellular systems and should be taken into account when interpreting ML dynamics detected by NMR in vivo.",

Use of isolated caveolae-enriched membranes revealed that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), co-localized with Cav-1 in caveolae. LPS upregulated CAMs expression and increased the co-localization. Cholesterol exposure decreased the level of CAMs in the caveolae. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy revealed that ICAM-1 interacted with Cav-1. Electron microscopy showed that ICAM-1 was mainly located in caveolae. Cholesterol exposure decreased this interaction and drove ICAM-1 out of caveolae. Knockdown of Cav-1 reduced the synergistic effects of cholesterol and inflammation. In vivo, ICAM-1 and Cav-1 co-localization was lower in the aortic endothelium of ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice than in that of wild-type controls. Cav-1 negatively regulates monocyte adhesion by the co-localization of CAMs in caveolae, which is disturbed by cholesterol.

In the present study, we examined whether intracellular phospholipase A1 (DDHD domain containing 1, or DDHD1), previously identified as phosphatidic acid (PA)-preferring PLA1 (PA-PLA1), is involved in the formation of 2-arachidonoyl-LPI. HEK293 cells expressing DDHD1 produced [3H]arachidonic acid-containing LPI after prelabeling with [3H]arachidonic acid and subsequent activation by ionomycin; the formation of [3H]LPI was inhibited by n-butanol and the overexpression of an inactive PLD1 mutant PLD1K898R. DDHD1 was translocated from the cytosol to membranes upon ionomycin treatment. A purified recombinant DDHD1 formed [3H]LPI when incubated with [3H]PI; the Vmax and apparent Km were 190\u00a0\u00b5mol/min/mg protein and 10\u00a0mol% PI, respectively. DDHD1 binds PA, and the addition of PA to DDHD1 increased the affinity for PI (Km ; 3\u00a0mol%) and augmented the PI-PLA1 activity. DDHD1 activated by PA was returned to a basal state by its own PA-hydrolytic activity. These results implicate DDHD1 in the formation of 2-arachidonoyl-LPI and indicate that the process is modulated by PA released by phospholipase D.

Here, we assessed the importance of hepatic fat accumulation on the progression of hepatitis in zebrafish by liver specific expression of Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx). Transgenic zebrafish lines, GBXs, which selectively express the GBx transgene (GFP-fused HBx gene) in liver, were established. GBX Liver phenotypes were evaluated by histopathology and molecular analysis of fatty acid (FA) metabolism-related genes expression. Most GBXs (66\u201381%) displayed obvious emaciation starting at 4\u00a0months old. Over 99% of the emaciated GBXs developed hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis, which in turn led to liver hypoplasia. The liver histology of GBXs displayed steatosis, lobular inflammation, and balloon degeneration, similar to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oil red O stain detected the accumulation of fatty droplets in GBXs. RT-PCR and Q-rt-PCR analysis revealed that GBx induced hepatic steatosis had significant increases in the expression of lipogenic genes, C/EBP-\u03b1, SREBP1, ChREBP and PPAR-\u03b3, which then activate key enzymes of the de novo FA synthesis, ACC1, FAS, SCD1, AGAPT, PAP and DGAT2.

     "abstract": "The eicosanoid pathway is activated in many types of cancers including prostate. Eicosanoids are synthesized from intracellular arachidonic acid (AA), which is released from membrane glycerophospholipids mainly by the action of cytosolic phospholipase A2\u03b1 (cPLA2\u03b1). Thus, targeting cPLA2\u03b1 has been proposed as a treatment option. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cPLA2\u03b1 inhibition on cyclooxygenase (COX) expression and PGE2 production. Inhibition of cPLA2\u03b1 expression by siRNA or activity by Efipladib in prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) led to an increase in COX-1 protein and PGE2 levels in a dose-dependent manner from 24 to 72\u00a0h. The COX-2 response was less evident. Efipladib treatment increased COX-1 promoter transcriptional activity without changing the rate of COX-1 protein degradation. Treatment with Efipladib also led to a decrease in most LOX products (HETEs) as measured by LC/MS/MS. Replenishing 5- and 12-HETEs abolished Efipladib-induced COX-1 and PGE2 levels. Decreasing 5- and 12-HETE production, as a result of treating cells with inhibitors MK886 and Baicalein, respectively, mimicked the effect of Efipladib on COX-1 and PGE2 levels. Hence, the mechanism underlying the cPLA2\u03b1 inhibition-induced COX-1 is likely due to a decrease in LOX products, which may exert a negative feedback on COX-1 gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Considering that PGE2 is a potent promoter of cancer cell proliferation and survival, understanding the mechanism coupling cPLA2\u03b1 with COX-1 is of potential clinical significance.",

Since plasminogen (Plg), also synthesized in the liver, is genetically related and structurally homologous to apo(a), we wanted to determine whether it contains oxPtdPCs and their location. We used Plg isolated from fresh or frozen normal human plasma and several commercial preparations. Some were freed of non-covalently bound lipids by organic solvent extraction. By immunoblot analyses, all products reacted against T15, a natural IgM monoclonal antibody specific for phosphorylcholine -containing oxidized phospholipids (ox-PLs). This immunoreactivity was retained in urokinase type plasminogen activator -generated plasmin and was abrogated in Plg previously digested with lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), a reaction that generated predominantly C16:0 lysophosphatidylcholine species as determined by mass spectrometry. Lyso derivatives were also generated upon the cleavage by Lp-PLA2 of a model ox-PL chemically linked to a lysine-containing pentapeptide. From inorganic phosphorous analyses, we found 2\u00a0mol of oxPtdPC/mole of Plg distributed between the kringles 1\u20134 and mini-Plg domain. OxPtdPCs were also present in the Plg isolated from the serum-free medium of cultured human HepG2 cells. In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that naturally occurring Plg contains oxPtdPC probably linked by a Schiff base and also suggest that the linkage occurs at the hepatic site.

It can occur jointly with cholesterol uptake, but intracellular processing of phospholipids is distinctively different from sterol processing. The newly imported phospholipids are utilized for production of bioactive lipids, such as thromboxane A2 and lyso phosphatidic acid, and for synthesis of triacylglycerol. Class B scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) represents a major mediator of the uptake of various phospholipids. The related scavenger receptor CD36, as shown here, also facilitates cellular phospholipid uptake. CD36 supports import of the choline phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM), but not of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Other transferases trigger cellular uptake of selective phospholipids, such as phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatases that facilitate PA import and thereby modify cell survival and synaptic transmission. Phospholipid uptake depends on the activation status of cells. Activation of blood platelets indeed increases PE uptake. This is mediated by the serpin protein C inhibitor (PCI) and enhances thrombin formation. Exchange of phospholipids between blood cells and lipoproteins partially adjusts the lipid distribution pattern of blood cells to the one of lipoprotein particles. This in turn modifies the activities of cell membrane sodium transporters and could thereby contribute to sodium flux alterations in the metabolic syndrome. The in vivo relevance of phospholipid uptake in humans is indicated by comparable and reversible changes in the same phospholipid species in both lipoproteins and cells after rapid removal of low-density lipoproteins. Finally, cells also incorporate oxidized (pathogenic) phospholipids using partially overlapping entry pathways as native phospholipids which might support the ability of oxidized lipids to promote atherothrombosis.",

     "abstract": "Gangliosides are well-known regulators of cell differentiation through specific interactions with growth factor receptors. Previously, our group provided the first evidence about stable association of ganglioside GM3 to EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers in mammary epithelial cells. Goals of the present study were to better define the role of gangliosides in EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimerization and receptor phosphorylation events and to analyze their involvement in mammary cell differentiation. Experiments have been conducted using the ceramide analogue (+/\u2212)-treo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol hydrochloride ([D]-PDMP), which inhibits ceramide glucosyltransferase resulting in the endogenous ganglioside depletion, and the lactogenic hormone mix DIP (dexamethasone, insulin, prolactin), which induces cell differentiation and \u03b2-casein mRNA synthesis. In addition, treatments of ganglioside-depleted cells with exogenous GM3 have been carried out to ascertain the specific involvement of this ganglioside. Results from co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments have shown that the endogenous ganglioside depletion resulted in the disappearance of SDS-stable EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers and in the appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR also in the absence of EGF stimulation; exogenous GM3 added in combination with [D]-PDMP reversed both these effects. In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 in ganglioside-depleted cells occurred only after EGF stimulation. Moreover, when ganglioside-depleted cells were treated with DIP in absence of EGF, \u03b2-casein gene expression appeared strongly down-regulated, and \u03b2-casein mRNA levels were partially restored by exogenous GM3 treatment. Altogether, although the involvement of other ganglioside species cannot be excluded, these findings sustain the ganglioside GM3 as an essential molecule for EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimer stability and important regulator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, but it is not crucial for tyrosine phosphorylation of the heterodimerization partner ErbB2. Moreover, modulation of EGFR phosphorylation may explain how gangliosides contribute to regulate the lactogenic hormone-induced mammary cell differentiation.",

     "abstract": "Acute cholesterol depletion is generally associated with decreased or abolished T cell signalling but it can also cause T cell activation. This anomaly has been addressed in Jurkat T cells using progressive cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD). At depletion levels higher than 50% there is substantial cell death, which explains reports of signalling inhibition. At 10\u201320% depletion levels, tyrosine phosphorylation is increased, ERK is activated and there is a small increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+. Peripheral actin polymerisation is also triggered by limited cholesterol depletion. Strikingly, the lipid raft marker GM1 aggregates upon cholesterol depletion and these aggregated domains concentrate the signalling proteins Lck and LAT, whereas the opposite is true for the non lipid raft marker the transferrin receptor. Using PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinase activation, it is demonstrated that the lipid raft aggregation occurs independently of and thus upstream of the signalling response. Upon cholesterol depletion there is an increase in overall plasma membrane order, indicative of more ordered domains forming at the expense of disordered domains. That cholesterol depletion and not unspecific effects of MBCD was behind the reported results was confirmed by performing all experiments with MBCD\u2013cholesterol, when no net cholesterol extraction took place. We conclude that non-lethal cholesterol depletion causes the aggregation of lipid rafts which then induces T cell signalling.",

We have previously shown that a yeast strain, the endogenous PE synthesis of which was controllable, grew in the presence of PE containing decanoyl residues (diC10PE) when PE synthesis was repressed. In this study, we investigated the fate of diC10PE, its uptake and remodeling in yeast. Deletion of the genes encoding Lem3p/Ros3p or P-type ATPases, Dnf1p and Dnf2p, impaired the growth of the mutants in the medium containing diC10PE, suggesting the involvement of these proteins in the uptake of diC10PE. Analysis of the metabolism of deuterium-labeled diC10PE by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry revealed that it was rapidly converted to deuterium-labeled PEs containing C16 or C18 acyl residues. The probable intermediate PEs that contained decanoic acid and C16 or C18 fatty acids as acyl residues were also detected. In addition, a substantial amount of decanoic acid was released into the culture medium during growth in the presence of diC10PE. These results imply that diC10PE was remodeled to PEs with longer acyl residues and used as membrane components. Defects in the remodeling of diC10PE in the deletion mutants of ALE1 and SLC1, products of which were capable of acyl-transfer to the sn\u2212\u00a02 position of lyso-phospholipids, suggested their involvement in the introduction of acyl residues to the sn\u2212\u00a02 position of lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine in the remodeling reaction of diC10PE.

We aim to develop a minimal kinetic computational model for predicting plasma cholesterol levels. To define the scope of this model, it is essential to discriminate between important and less important processes influencing plasma cholesterol levels. To this end, we performed a systematic review of mouse knockout strains and used the resulting dataset, named KOMDIP, for the identification of key genes that determine plasma cholesterol levels. Based on the described phenotype of mouse knockout models, 36 of the 120 evaluated genes were marked as key genes that have a pronounced effect on the plasma cholesterol concentration. The key genes include well-known genes, e.g., Apoe and Ldlr, as well as genes hardly linked to cholesterol metabolism so far, e.g., Plagl2 and Slc37a4. Based on the catalytic function of the genes, a minimal conceptual model was defined. A comparison with nine conceptual models from literature revealed that each of the individual published models is less complete than our model. Concluding, we have developed a conceptual model that can be used to develop a physiologically based kinetic model to quantitatively predict plasma cholesterol levels.",

As circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 levels are known to positively correlate with disturbances in lipid metabolism, we investigated the impact of the loss of TNF-\u03b1 signaling on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in ArKO mice. Histological examinations of the livers of mice at 5\u00a0months of age revealed that ArKO male mice lacking the TNF-\u03b1 receptor type 1 (TNFR1) gene (ArKO/TNFR1KO) or both the TNFR 1 and 2 genes (ArKO/TNFR1&2KO) developed more severe hepatic steatosis than ArKO or ArKO/TNFR2KO mice. Serum analyses demonstrated a clear increase in cholesterol and insulin levels in the ArKO/TNFR1KO mice compared with the ArKO mice. Glucose- and insulin-tolerance tests further revealed exacerbation of the systemic insulin resistant phenotype in the ArKO/TNFR1KO mice. Hepatic expression of lipogenic genes including fatty-acid synthase and stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1 were more markedly upregulated in the ArKO/TNFR1KO mice than the ArKO mice.

In relevant rat models for impaired lipolysis or for impaired solubilization we tested whether administration of Gelucire\u00ae44/14 enhanced fat absorption. Rats with impaired lipolysis (lipase inhibitor Orlistat diet) and rats with reduced solubilization (permanent bile diversion) underwent a 72\u00a0h fat balance test to assess fat absorption. The absorption kinetics of a stable isotope-labeled fatty acid was assessed in rats with reduced solubilization, in the presence or absence of Gelucire\u00ae44/14.

The present data show that Gelucire\u00ae44/14 might enhance fat absorption under conditions of impaired lipolysis, but not during impaired solubilization. We speculate that, due to its self-micro-emulsification properties, Gelucire\u00ae44/14 stabilizes and improves residual lipolytic enzyme activity in vivo, which could be of therapeutic value in clinical conditions of fat malabsorption due to impaired lipolysis.",

We demonstrated that iPLA2\u03b2 participates in insulin secretion, insulinoma cells and native pancreatic islets express full-length and truncated isoforms of iPLA2\u03b2, and certain stimuli promote perinuclear localization of iPLA2\u03b2. To gain a better understanding of its mobilization, iPLA2\u03b2 was expressed in INS-1 cells as a fusion protein with EGFP, enabling detection of subcellular localization of iPLA2\u03b2 by monitoring EGFP fluorescence. Cells stably-transfected with fusion protein expressed nearly 5-fold higher catalytic iPLA2\u03b2 activity than control cells transfected with EGFP cDNA alone, indicating that co-expression of EGFP does not interfere with manifestation of iPLA2\u03b2 activity. Dual fluorescence monitoring of EGFP and organelle Trackers combined with immunoblotting analyses revealed expression of truncated iPLA2\u03b2 isoforms in separate subcellular organelles. Exposure to secretagogues and induction of ER stress are known to activate iPLA2\u03b2 in \u03b2-cells and we find here that these stimuli promote differential localization of iPLA2\u03b2 in subcellular organelles. Further, mass spectrometric analyses identified iPLA2\u03b2 variants from which N-terminal residues were removed. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for endogenous proteolytic processing of iPLA2\u03b2 and redistribution of iPLA2\u03b2 variants in subcellular compartments.

     "abstract": "Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and treatment with HIV-protease inhibitor (PI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) is associated with dysregulated fatty acid and lipid metabolism. Enhanced lipolysis, increased circulating fatty acid levels, and hepatic and intramuscular lipid accumulation appear to contribute to insulin resistance in HIV-infected people treated with PI-based HAART. However, it is unclear whether currently prescribed HIV-PIs directly alter skeletal muscle fatty acid transport, oxidation, and storage. We find that ritonavir (r, 5\u00a0\u00b5mol/l) plus 20\u00a0\u00b5mol/l of atazanavir (ATV), lopinavir (LPV), or darunavir (DRV) reduce palmitate oxidation(16\u201321%) in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Palmitate oxidation was increased following exposure to high fatty acid media but this effect was blunted when myotubes were pre-exposed to the HIV-PIs. However, LPV/r and DRV/r, but not ATV/r suppressed palmitate uptake into myotubes. We found no effect of the HIV-PIs on FATP1, FATP4, or FABPpm but both CD36/FAT and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) were reduced by all three regimens though ATV/r caused only a small decrease in CPT1, relative to LPV/r or DRV/r. In contrast, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 was increased by all 3 HIV-PIs. These findings suggest that HIV-PIs suppress fatty acid oxidation in murine skeletal muscle cells and that this may be related to decreases in cytosolic- and mitochondrial-associated fatty acid transporters. HIV-PIs may also directly impair fatty acid handling and partitioning in skeletal muscle, and this may contribute to the cluster of metabolic complications that occur in people living with HIV.",

Tryptase promoting foam cell formation was also observed by transmission electron microscope. These effects were resisted by APC366, a selective inhibitor of mast cell tryptase. Tryptase dramatically resisted 22RHC induced activation of LXR\u03b1 protein expression, which can be reversed by SAM-11 (a PAR-2-specific neutralizing antibody) and reduced LXR\u03b1, ABCG1, ABCA1 and SREBP-1c mRNA levels and ABCG1 protein level, which were all blocked by APC366.

Cideb-null mice and wild-type mice were treated with normal diet (ND) or high cholesterol diet (HCD) for one month. The metabolic parameters of cholesterol metabolism and expression profiles of genes in cholesterol biosynthesis and storage were measured. Cideb-null mice had lower levels of plasma cholesterol and LDL when fed with both ND and HCD and increased rate of cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, the liver of Cideb-null mice has lower rates of cholesterol biosynthesis and reduced expression levels of sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activation protein (SCAP), and lower levels of nuclear form of SREBP2 and its downstream target genes in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway under a normal diet treatment. On the contrary, hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis rate between wild-type and Cideb-null mice was similar after high cholesterol diet treatment. Interestingly, hepatic cholesterol storage in the liver of Cideb-null mice was significantly increased due to its increased LDL receptor (LDLR) and acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) expression. Finally, we observed drastically reduced cholesterol levels in the heart of Cideb-null mice fed with a high cholesterol diet.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and mutation analysis, we identified a new SRE motif, 60% identical to an inverted SRE-3, able to bind SREBP-2 in vitro and in vivo. Co-transfection of promoter\u2013luciferase reporter constructs in HepG2 cells showed that the binding of SREBP-2 to SRE produced approximately 26-fold promoter activation, whereas mutation of the SRE motif caused a dramatic decrease of transactivation by SREBP-2. The function of additional motifs that bind transcription factors cooperating with SREBP-2 was investigated. An inverted CCAAT-box, that binds nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), cooperates with SREBP-2 in TM7SF2 promoter activation. Deletion of this motif resulted in the loss of promoter induction by sterol starvation in HepG2 cells, as well as a decrease in fold activation by SREBP-2 in co-transfection experiments. Moreover, co-transfection of the promoter with a plasmid expressing dominant negative NF-YA did not permit full activation by SREBP-2. Three GC-boxes (1, 2, 3), known to bind Sp1 transcription factor, were also investigated. The mutagenesis of each of them produced a decrease in SREBP-2-dependent activation, the most powerful being GC-box2. A triple mutagenized promoter construct did not have an additive effect. We conclude that, besides the SRE motif, both the inverted CCAAT-box and GC-box2 are essential for full promoter activation by SREBP-2.",

Distinct lipid A phosphatases directed to the 1 or the 4\u2032-positions have been identified previously in extracts of R. etli and Rhizobium leguminosarum. The corresponding structural genes, lpxE and lpxF, respectively, have also been identified. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of R. etli deletion mutants in each of these phosphatase genes and the construction of a double phosphatase mutant. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the mutant strains completely lacked the wild-type lipid A species and accumulated the expected phosphate-containing derivatives. Moreover, radiochemical analysis revealed that phosphatase activity was absent in membranes prepared from the mutants. Our results indicate that LpxE and LpxF are solely responsible for selectively dephosphorylating the lipid A molecules of R. etli. All the mutant strains showed an increased sensitivity to polymyxin relative to the wild-type. However, despite the presence of altered lipid A species containing one or both phosphate groups, all the phosphatase mutants formed nitrogen-fixing nodules on Phaseolus vulgaris. Therefore, the dephosphorylation of lipid A molecules in R. etli is not required for nodulation but may instead play a role in protecting the bacteria from cationic antimicrobial peptides or other immune responses of plants.",

However, the literature also indicates that various hFA-sphingolipids are present in additional tissues and cell types, as well as in tumors. Biosynthesis of hFA-sphingolipids requires fatty acid 2-hydroyxlase, and degradation of hFA-sphingolipids depends, at least in part, on lysosomal acid ceramidase and the peroxisomal fatty acid \u03b1-oxidation pathway. Mutations in the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase gene, FA2H, have been associated with leukodystrophy and spastic paraparesis in humans, underscoring the importance of hFA-sphingolipids in the nervous system. In the epidermis, hFA-ceramides are essential for the permeability barrier function. Physiological function of hFA-sphingolipids in other organs remains largely unknown.

     "abstract": "There is evidence that elevated plasma triglycerides (TG) serve as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Plasma TG levels are determined by the balance between the rate of production of chylomicrons and VLDL in intestine and liver, respectively, and their rate of clearance in peripheral tissues. Lipolytic processing of TG-rich lipoproteins is mediated by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is tethered to the capillary endothelium via heparin sulphate proteoglycans. In recent years the Angiopoietin-like proteins ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have emerged as novel modulators of LPL activity. Studies in transgenic animals supported by in vitro experiments have demonstrated that ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 impair plasma TG clearance by inhibiting LPL activity. In humans, genetic variation within the ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 genes contributes to variation in plasma TG and HDL levels, thereby validating the importance of ANGPTLs in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism in humans. Combined with the discovery of GPIHBP1 as a likely LPL anchor, these findings have led to a readjustment of the mechanism of LPL function. This review provides an overview of our current understanding of the role and regulation of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4 and GPIHBP1, and places the newly acquired knowledge in the context of the established function and mechanism of LPL-mediated lipolysis.",

Incubation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LDL(\u2212) for 24\u00a0h resulted in dose-dependent cell death. Activated caspases were shown to be involved in the apoptosis induced by LDL(\u2212); incubation with the broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD prevented apoptosis in LDL(\u2212)-treated cells. CD95 (Fas), CD95 ligand (FasL), CD36 and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand Tnfsf10 were overexpressed in LDL(\u2212)-treated cells. However, Bax, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein levels remained unchanged after LDL(\u2212) treatment. LDL(\u2212) promoted hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus, a process absent in cells treated with native LDL. Elicited peritoneal macrophages from Nrf2-deficient mice exhibited an elevated apoptotic response after challenge with LDL(\u2212), together with an increase in the production of ROS in the absence of alterations in CD36 expression. These results provide evidence that CD36 expression induced by LDL(\u2212) is Nrf2-dependent.

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a precursor for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin and a signaling molecule required for various cellular functions. PG is subjected to remodeling subsequent to its de novo biosynthesis in mitochondria to incorporate appropriate acyl content for its biological functions and to prevent the harmful effect of lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) accumulation. Yet, a gene encoding a mitochondrial LPG acyltransferase has not been identified. In this report, we identified a novel function of the human cardiolipin synthase (hCLS1) in regulating PG remodeling. In addition to the reported cardiolipin synthase activity, the recombinant hCLS1 protein expressed in COS-7 cells and Sf-9 insect cells exhibited a strong acyl-CoA-dependent LPG acyltransferase activity, which was further confirmed by purified hCLS1 protein overexpressed in Sf-9 cells. The recombinant hCLS1 displayed an acyl selectivity profile in the order of in the order of C18:1\u00a0>\u00a0C18:2\u00a0>\u00a0C18:0\u00a0>\u00a0C16:0, which is similar to that of hCLS1 toward PGs in cardiolipin synthesis, suggesting that the PG remodeling by hCLS1 is an intrinsic property of the enzyme. In contrast, no significant acyltransferase activity was detected from the recombinant hCLS1 enzyme toward lysocardiolipin which shares a similar structure with LPG. In support of a key function of hCLS1 in PG remodeling, overexpression of hCLS1 in COS-7 cells significantly increased PG biosynthesis concurrent with elevated levels of cardiolipin without any significant effects on the biosynthesis of other phospholipids. These results demonstrate for the first time that hCLS1 catalyzes two consecutive steps in cardiolipin biosynthesis by acylating LPG to PG and then converting PG to cardiolipin.",

Disruption of murine Chka leads to embryonic lethality, whereas a spontaneous genomic deletion in murine Chkb results in neonatal forelimb bone deformity and hindlimb muscular dystrophy. Surprisingly, muscular dystrophy isn't significantly developed in the forelimb. We have investigated the mechanism by which a lack of choline kinase \u03b2, encoded by Chkb, results in minimal muscular dystrophy in forelimbs. We have found that choline kinase \u03b2 is the major isoform in hindlimb muscle and contributes more to choline kinase activity, while choline kinase \u03b1 is predominant in forelimb muscle and contributes more to choline kinase activity. Although choline kinase activity is decreased in forelimb muscles of Chkb\u2212/\u2212 mice, the activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is increased, resulting in enhanced phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The activity of phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C is up-regulated while the activity of phospholipase A2 in forelimb muscle is not altered. Regeneration of forelimb muscles of Chkb\u2212/\u2212 mice is normal when challenged with cardiotoxin. In contrast to hindlimb muscle, mega-mitochondria are not significantly formed in forelimb muscle of Chkb\u2212/\u2212 mice.

     "abstract": "Here, we investigated the modulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) release by the polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol hyperforin. Hyperforin increased AA release from human platelets up to 2.6 fold (maximal effect at 10\u00a0\u00b5M) versus unstimulated cells, which was blocked by cPLA2\u03b1-inhibition, and induced translocation of cPLA2 to a membrane compartment. Interestingly, these stimulatory effects of hyperforin were even more pronounced after depletion of intracellular Ca2+ by EDTA plus BAPTA/AM. Hyperforin induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 at Ser505 and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 prevented cPLA2 phosphorylation. However, neither AA release nor translocation of cPLA2 was abrogated by SB203580. In cell-free assays using liposomes prepared from different lipids, hyperforin failed to stimulate phospholipid hydrolysis by isolated cPLA2 in the presence of Ca2+. However, when Ca2+ was omitted, hyperforin caused a prominent increase in cPLA2 activity using liposomes composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine but not of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC) unless the PAPC liposomes were enriched in cholesterol (20 to 50%). Finally, two-dimensional 1H-MAS-NMR analysis visualized the directed insertion of hyperforin into POPC liposomes. Together, hyperforin, through insertion into phospholipids, may facilitate cPLA2 activation by enabling its access towards select lipid membranes independent of Ca2+ ions. Such Ca2+- and phosphorylation-independent mechanism of cPLA2 activation may apply also to other membrane-interfering molecules.",

Chenodeoxycholic acid repressed FTF expression resulting in a decrease in serum triglyceride in wild-type mice.

These pathways of PE formation are decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) by (i) phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in mitochondria and (ii) phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 (Psd2p) in a Golgi/vacuolar compartment, (iii) incorporation of exogenous ethanolamine and ethanolamine phosphate derived from sphingolipid catabolism via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and (iv) synthesis of PE through acylation of lyso-PE catalyzed by the acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase Ale1p in the mitochondria associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM). Deletion of PSD1 and/or PSD2 led to depletion of total cellular and plasma membrane PE level, whereas mutation in the other pathways had practically no effect. Analysis of wild type and mutants, however, revealed that all four routes of PE synthesis contributed not only to PE formation but also to the supply of PE to the plasma membrane. Pulse-chase labeling experiments with L[3H(G)]serine and [14C]ethanolamine confirmed the latter finding. Fatty acid profiling demonstrated a rather balanced incorporation of PE species into the plasma membrane irrespective of mutations suggesting that all four pathways of PE synthesis provide at least a basic portion of \u201ccorrect\u201d PE species required for plasma membrane biogenesis. In summary, the PE level in the plasma membrane is strongly influenced by total cellular PE synthesis, but fine tuned by selective assembly mechanisms.",

The transcription of the most active form of CT, CT\u03b1, in serum-starved cells was stimulated by fetal bovine serum (FBS). Therefore, we were interested in the effects of FBS on the transcription of ET. Unexpectedly, the ET mRNA levels were significantly increased after NIH3T3 cells were cultured in serum-starved medium (0.5% FBS) longer than 8\u00a0h, and the increase was suppressed by the addition of FBS. Actinomycin-D inhibited the increased ET mRNA levels in serum-starved cells. ET enzyme activities and protein amounts were also increased after serum starvation. These results suggest that FBS contains substances that inhibit the transcription of ET. To identify these substances, cells were incubated with several fractions of FBS separated by molecular sizes.

Our objective was to determine the oxylipins formed from linoleic acid by A. clavatus and their mechanism of biosynthesis. A. clavatus oxidized linoleic acid to (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid (8R-HPODE), (10R)-hydroperoxy-8(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (10R-HPODE), and to (5S,8R)-dihydroxy- and (8R,11S)-dihydroxylinoleic acids (DiHODE) as major products. This occurred by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-8 and antarafacial dioxygenation at C-8 or at C-10 with double bond migration. 8R-HPODE was then isomerized to 5S,8R-DiHODE and to 8R,11S-DiHODE by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogens at C-5 and C-11 of 8R-HPODE, respectively, followed by suprafacial oxygenation. The genome of A. clavatus codes for two enzymes, which can be aligned with >\u00a065% amino acid identity to 10R-DOX and 5,8-LDS, respectively. The 5,8-LDS homologue likely forms and isomerizes 8R-HPODE to 5S,8R-DiHODE. A third gene (ppoB) codes for a protein which carries a serine residue at the cysteine position of the P450 motif. This Cys to Ser replacement is known to abolish P450 2B4 catalysis and the hydroperoxide isomerase activity of 5,8-LDS, suggesting that ppoB of A. clavatus may not be involved in the biosynthesis of 8R,11S-DiHODE.",

Pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2) was previously found to express galactolipase activity, and it is assumed to be the main enzyme involved in the digestion of these common vegetable lipids in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of the previous in vitro studies were however performed with medium chain synthetic galactolipids as substrates. It was shown here that recombinant guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) as well as human PLRP2 hydrolyzed at high rates natural DGDG and MGDG extracted from spinach leaves. Their specific activities were estimated by combining the pH-stat technique, thin layer chromatography coupled to scanning densitometry and gas chromatography. The optimum assay conditions for hydrolysis of these natural long chain galactolipids were investigated and the optimum bile salt to substrate ratio was found to be different from that established with synthetic medium chains MGDG and DGDG. Nevertheless the length of acyl chains and the nature of the galactosyl polar head of the galactolipid did not have major effects on the specific activities of PLRP2, which were found to be very high on both medium chain [1786\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0100 to 5420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a085\u00a0U/mg] and long chain [1756\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0208 to 4167\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0167\u00a0U/mg] galactolipids. Fatty acid composition analysis of natural MGDG, DGDG and their lipolysis products revealed that PLRP2 only hydrolyzed one ester bond at the sn-1 position of galactolipids.

We demonstrate that in the absence of l-carnitine, 1) \u03b2-oxidation rates of EPA and AA were comparable in HPCs and in KCs; 2) AA and not EPA was preferentially incorporated into glycerolipids; and 3) addition of EPA significantly decreased AA-dependent PGE2 synthesis in HPCs and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in co-cultured HPCs/KCs. However, enhancing the cellular oxidation capacity by the addition of l-carnitine 1) significantly increased \u03b2-oxidation of EPA in HPCs, but only marginally elevated the oxidation of AA in HPCs and the oxidation of both fatty acids in KCs; 2) decreased the esterification, but did not alter the preferential incorporation of AA into glycerolipids; and 3) alleviated the significant competitive inhibition of AA-dependent PGE2 synthesis and COX-2 expression by EPA. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that l-carnitine affects competition between AA and EPA in PG synthesis in liver cells by enhancing oxidation of EPA in HPCs.

This enzyme plays an essential role in all processes that require membrane biosynthesis such as cell proliferation and viability. Thus, CCT\u03b1 activity and expression fluctuate during the cell cycle to achieve PtdCho requirements. We demonstrated, for the first time, that CCT\u03b1 is localized in the nucleus in cells transiting the S phase, whereas it is localized in the cytoplasm of G0-arrested cells, suggesting a specific role of nuclear CCT\u03b1 during the S phase. We also investigated how E2F1 influences the regulation of the CCT\u03b1-promoter during the S phase; we demonstrated that E2F1 is necessary, but not sufficient, to activate CCT\u03b1 expression when this factor is over-expressed. However, when E2F1 and Sp1 were over-expressed, the transcription from the CCT\u03b1-promoter reporter construct was super-activated. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that E2F1 could super-activate Sp1-dependent transcription in a promoter containing only the Sp1 binding sites \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d, and that Sp1 could activate Sp1-dependent transcription in a promoter containing the E2F site, thus, further demonstrating a functional interaction of these factors.

In the United States, the epicenter of the epidemic, over 2/3 of the population, is overweight and 1 of every 6 Americans carries the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Although genes determine susceptibility to environmental factors, the epidemic is clearly due to increased consumption of calorie-dense, highly lipogenic foods, coupled with a marked decrease in physical exertion resulting from modern technologies. If this lifestyle continues, morbid consequences are virtually inevitable. They include type II diabetes and a cluster of disorders known as \u201cthe metabolic syndrome\u201d usually appearing in middle age. The morbid consequences of the chronic caloric surplus are buffered before middle age by the partitioning of these calories as fat in the adipocyte compartment which is specifically designed to store triglycerides. Leptin has been proposed as the major hormonal regulator of the partitioning of surplus calories. However, multiple factors can determine the storage capacity of the fat tissue and when it is exceeded ectopic lipid deposition begins. The organs affected in metabolic syndrome include skeletal muscle, liver, heart and pancreas, which are now known to contain abnormal levels of triglycerides. While neutral fat is probably harmless, it is an index of ectopic lipid overload. Fatty acid derivatives can interfere with the function of the cell and ultimately lead to its demise through lipoapoptosis, the consequences of which are gradual organ failure.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle has been suggested to underlie the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reduced mitochondrial capacity will contribute to the accumulation of lipid intermediates, desensitizing insulin signaling and leading to insulin resistance. Why mitochondrial function is reduced in the (pre-)diabetic state is, however, so far unknown. Although it is tempting to suggest that skeletal muscle insulin resistance may result from an inherited or acquired reduction in mitochondrial function in the pre-diabetic state, it cannot be excluded that mitochondrial dysfunction may in fact be the consequence of the insulin-resistant/diabetic state. Lipotoxicity, the deleterious effects of accumulating fatty acids in skeletal muscle cells, may lie at the basis of mitochondrial dysfunction: next to producing energy, mitochondria are also the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Fatty acids accumulating in the vicinity of mitochondria are vulnerable to ROS-induced lipid peroxidation. Subsequently, these lipid peroxides could have lipotoxic effects on mtDNA, RNA and proteins of the mitochondrial machinery, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, increased lipid peroxidation has been reported in insulin resistant skeletal muscle and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3, which has been suggested to prevent lipid-induced mitochondrial damage, is reduced in subjects with an impaired glucose tolerance and in type 2 diabetic patients. These findings support the hypothesis that fat accumulation in skeletal muscle may precede the reduction in mitochondrial function that is observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

     "abstract": "The concept of glucolipotoxicity refers to the combined, deleterious effects of elevated glucose and fatty acid levels on pancreatic beta-cell function and survival. Significant progress has been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of glucolipotoxicity in the beta cell. The permissive effect of elevated glucose on the detrimental actions of fatty acids stems from the influence of glucose on intracellular fatty acid metabolism, promoting the synthesis of cellular lipids. The combination of excessive levels of fatty acids and glucose therefore leads to decreased insulin secretion, impaired insulin gene expression, and beta-cell death by apoptosis, all of which probably have distinct underlying mechanisms. Recent studies from our laboratory have identified several pathways implicated in fatty acid inhibition of insulin gene expression, including the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway, the metabolic sensor Per-Arnt-Sim kinase (PASK), and the ATF6 branch of the unfolded protein response. We have also confirmed in vivo in rats that the decrease in insulin gene expression is an early defect which precedes any detectable abnormality in insulin secretion. While the role of glucolipotoxicity in humans is still debated, the inhibitory effects of chronically elevated fatty acid levels has been clearly demonstrated in several studies, at least in individuals genetically predisposed to developing type 2 diabetes. It is therefore likely that glucolipotoxicity contributes to beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes as well as to the decline in beta-cell function observed after the onset of the disease.",

Hepatic lipotoxicity may ensue when the hepatic capacity to utilize, store and export fatty acids (FA) as triglycerides is overwhelmed. Additional mechanisms of hepatic lipotoxicity include abnormal FA oxidation with formation of reactive oxygen species, disturbances in cellular membrane FA and phospholipid composition, alterations of cholesterol content and ceramide signalling. Lipotoxicity is a key factor for the progression of fatty liver disease by inducing hepatocellular death, activating Kupffer cells and an inflammatory response, impairing hepatic insulin signalling resulting in insulin resistance, and activation of a fibrogenic response in hepatic stellate cells that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis. Therefore, the concept of hepatic lipotoxicity should be considered in future therapeutic concepts for fatty liver disease.",

Emerging evidence suggests that macrophage activation by lipid metabolites and further modulation by lipid signaling represents a common pathogenic mechanism underlying lipotoxicity in atherosclerosis, obesity-associated insulin resistance and inflammatory diseases related to metabolic syndrome such as liver steatosis and chronic kidney disease. In this review, we discuss the latest discoveries that support the role of lipids in modulating the macrophage phenotype in different metabolic diseases. We describe the common mechanisms by which lipid derivatives, through modulation of macrophage function, promote plaque instability in the arterial wall, impair insulin responsiveness and contribute to inflammatory liver, muscle and kidney disease.

One hypothesis linking obesity to type 2 diabetes is the adipose tissue expandability hypothesis. The adipose tissue expandability hypothesis states that a failure in the capacity for adipose tissue expansion, rather than obesity per se is the key factor linking positive energy balance and type 2 diabetes. All individuals possess a maximum capacity for adipose expansion which is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Once the adipose tissue expansion limit is reached, adipose tissue ceases to store energy efficiently and lipids begin to accumulate in other tissues. Ectopic lipid accumulation in non-adipocyte cells causes lipotoxic insults including insulin resistance, apoptosis and inflammation. This article discusses the links between adipokines, inflammation, adipose tissue expandability and lipotoxicity.

Key enzymes, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), as well as intermediate metabolites, such as malonyl-CoA and long-chain fatty acids-CoA (LCFAs-CoA), play a major role in this neuronal network, integrating peripheral signals with classical neuropeptide-based mechanisms.

     "abstract": "Excess lipid accumulation in nonadipose tissues may occur in the setting of high levels of plasma free fatty acids or triglycerides (TGs) in a process called \u201clipotoxicity\u201d. Evidence from human studies and animal models suggests that lipid accumulation in the heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and liver play an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). During the past few years, several studies have shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have potentially cardioprotective effects, especially in high-risk patients with dyslipidemia, and might therefore be expected to be of benefit in T2DM. Moreover, new information has demonstrated the beneficial effects of consuming n-3 PUFA in preventing the complications of lipotoxicity. n-3 PUFA dietary intake thus had positive effects on fatty liver in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with an improvement in liver echotexture and a significant regression of hepatic brightness, associated with improved liver hemodynamics. The n-3 PUFA also had beneficial effects on ectopic fat accumulation inside the heart, with stabilization of cardiac myocytes and antiarrhythmic effects. On the other hand, recent data from animal models suggest that oral dosing of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) could contribute to protect against \u03b2-cell lipotoxicity. This review discusses the latest hypotheses regarding lipotoxicity, concentrating on the impact of the n-3 PUFA that contribute to ectopic lipid storage, affecting organ function. Further human studies are needed to test the evidence and elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process.",

     "abstract": "Lipotoxicity is a metabolic abnormality frequently observed during the development of obesity and is the main cause of several changes in the metabolic observed during metabolic syndrome. Consistent consumption of diets high in saturated fat or simple carbohydrates combined with low physical activity are the main causes of obesity and its comorbidities. However, the contribution of dietary protein and, in particular, the contribution due to the type of dietary protein, to the process of obesity and its metabolic consequences are less well-understood. In this review, we showed that the type of dietary protein has a significant contribution to the process of lipotoxicity through the modulation of insulin secretion and the regulation of adipocyte metabolic function. Consumption of soy protein stimulates insulin secretion to a lower extent than casein despite the fact that both are high-quality proteins. The amino acid profiles of soy protein and its isoflavones are responsible for the reduced insulin secretion. Also, soy protein increases insulin sensitivity, whereas casein has the opposite effect. Consequently, soy protein reduces SREBP-1 expression in the liver leading to low accumulation of hepatic triglycerides, despite the consumption of a high-fat diet. Furthermore, soy protein reduces adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperleptinemia, and free fatty acid concentration. Thus, the influx of FA into the liver decreases, and hepatic oxidation of FA increases. These metabolic changes result in a decrease in lipid depots and ceramide which reduce hepatic lipotoxicity, whereas casein produces the opposite effect. This study emphasizes that the type of dietary protein has an important effect on lipotoxicity.",

There is also mounting evidence that mature white adipocytes, including human fat cells, can be converted into brown fat-like adipocytes, and that the typical fatty acid storage phenotype of white adipocyte can be altered towards a fat utilization phenotype.

The adipose tissue is dysregulated in hypertrophic obesity, i.e., when the adipose cells have become enlarged.

This form of obesity is usually not associated with the metabolic complications and is termed \u201cobese but metabolically normal\u201d. We here review recent findings showing that hypertrophic obesity is associated with an impaired differentiation of committed preadipocytes. This may be a primary (genetic?) event, thus leading to hypertrophic fat cells and the associated inflammation. However, it is also possible that the inflammation is a primary event allowing, in particular, TNF\u03b1 to inhibit preadipocyte differentiation.

     "abstract": "Evolving evidence suggest that metabolic requirements for cell proliferation are identical in all normal and cancer cells. HER2 oncogene-overexpressors, a highly aggressive subtype of human cancer cells, constitute one of the best examples of how malignant cells maximize their ability to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conductive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. HER2-overexpressors optimize their requirements of rapid cancer cell growth by fine-tuning a double [lipogenic/lipolytic]-edged metabolic sword. On the one edge, HER2 oncogene overexpression triggers redundant signaling cascades to ensure that all the major enzymes involved in de novo fatty acid (FA) synthesis will facilitate aerobic glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation for energy production (Warburg effect). HER2 also establishes a positive bidirectional relationship with the key lipogenic enzyme Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN) that rapidly senses and respond to any disturbance in the flux of lipogenic substrates (e.g. NADPH and acetyl-CoA) and lipogenesis end-products (i.e. palmitate). On the other edge, HER2 overexpression arranges detoxifying mechanisms by upregulating PPAR\u03b3, a well established positive regulator role of adipogenesis and lipid storage in cell types with active lipid metabolism. PPAR\u03b3 establishes a lipogenesis/lipolysis joining-point that enables HER2-positive cancer cells to avoid endogenous palmitate toxicity while securing palmitate into fat stores to avoid palmitate feedback on FASN functioning. The ability of HER2 to supercharge lipogenesis (by activating regulatory circuits that activate and fuel the lipogenic enzyme FASN) while averting lipotoxicity (by promoting conversion and storage of excess FAs to triglycerides in a PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner) supports the notion that best adapted cancer phenotypes are addicted to oncogenic lipid metabolism for cell proliferation and survival. It is conceptually attractive to assume that we can crash HER2-driven rapid cell proliferation by inhibiting \u201cmotor refueling\u201d (upon blockade of lipogenic enzymes), by losing the \u201clipolytic brake\u201d (upon blockade of PPAR\u03b3) and/or by sticking the \u201clipogenic gas pedal\u201d (upon supplementation with dietary FAs).",

It is characterized by loss of peripheral subcutaneous adipose tissue (face, limbs, buttocks), visceral fat accumulation, and, in some cases, lipomatosis, especially in the dorsocervical area. In addition, these patients show metabolic alterations reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome, particularly dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. These alterations lead to enhanced cardiovascular risk in patients and favor the development of diabetes. Although a complex combination of HIV-1 infection and drug treatment-related events triggers the syndrome, lipotoxicity appears to contribute to the development of the syndrome. Active lipolysis in subcutaneous fat, combined with impaired fat storage capacity in the subcutaneous depot, drive ectopic deposition of lipids, either in the visceral depot or in nonadipose sites. Both hepatic steatosis and increased lipid content in skeletal muscle take place and surely contribute to systemic metabolic alterations, especially insulin resistance. Pancreatic function may also be affected by the exposure to high levels of fatty acids; together with direct effects of antiretroviral drugs, this may contribute to impaired insulin release and a prodiabetic state in the patients.

     "abstract": "The risk functions for obesity (defined as the quantitative relation between degree of obesity throughout its range and the risk of health problems) have been used to define \u2018obesity\u2019 as an excess storage of fat in the body to such an extent that it causes health problems leading to increased mortality. The lipotoxicity theory implies that the fat stored in droplets of triglycerides in the cells are biologically inert and that the metabolic dysfunctions are primarily due to the increased exposure of the cells to fatty acids. If this is true, it has profound implications for the interpretations of the multiple epidemiological studies of the risk functions. It is obvious from all these studies that the sizes of the fat depots are risk indicators of health effects in various ways. Paradoxically, the sizes of the fat stores are also indicators of the preceding implementation of the ability of the body to protect itself against the toxic effects of the free fatty acids. The current risk of metabolic dysfunctions appears to be determined by the balance between the rate of loading of the body with fatty acids and the rate of eliminating the fatty acids by either triglyceride storage or oxidation. The progress in the development of the dysfunction then depends on the persistence of the imbalance leading to future cumulative exposure of the cells to the toxic effects of the fatty acids rather than on the current size of the fat depots. This may be considered as a reason for changing the definition of obesity to one based on better estimates of future risks of health problems derived from later metabolic dysfunctions rather than on the past coping with the exposure to the fatty acids by storage as triglycerides. Implementation of such definition would require a test that measures this residual capacity to avoid excess exposure of the cells to the fatty acids before the metabolic dysfunctions have emerged. In analogy with the glucose tolerance test, a fatty acid tolerance test may be needed to identify individuals who are at a level of risk for developing lipotoxicity induced metabolic dysfunctions such that they require intervention. This test would ideally be a single biomarker that would determine residual capacity for adipose expansion, fatty acid oxidation and safe ectopic lipid deposition.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian pineal gland is a prominent secretory organ with a high metabolic activity. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), the main secretory product of the pineal gland, efficiently scavenges both the hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals counteracting lipid peroxidation in biological membranes. Approximately 25% of the total fatty acids present in the rat pineal lipids are represented by arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3). These very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids play important roles in the pineal gland. In addition to the production of melatonin, the mammalian pineal gland is able of convert these polyunsaturated fatty acids into bioactive lipid mediators. Lipoxygenation is the principal lipoxygenase (LOX) activity observed in the rat pineal gland. Lipoxygenation in the pineal gland is exceptional because no other brain regions express significant LOX activities under normal physiological conditions. The rat pineal gland expresses both 12- and 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) activities, producing 12- and 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12- and 15-HpETE) from arachidonic acid and 14- and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (14- and 17-HdoHE) from docosahexaenoic acid, respectively. The rat pineal also produces hepoxilins via LOX pathways. The hepoxilins are bioactive epoxy-hydroxy products of the arachidonic acid metabolism via the 12S-lipoxygenase (12S-LOX) pathway. The two key pineal biochemical functions, lipoxygenation and melatonin synthesis, may be synergistically regulated by the status of n-3 essential fatty acids.",

     "abstract": "During atherogenesis, macrophage foam cells produce prodigious growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, which play the central roles in inflammatory process in atherosclerotic plaque formation. In the present study, we identified a new protein marker, N-Myc downstream-regulated protein 2 (NDRG2), which is significantly up-regulated in oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) treated macrophages and in human atherosclerotic plaques. Over-expression and siRNA knockdown studies showed that NDRG2 is a negative regulator of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) productions in macrophages. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of NDRG2 on MAPK signal activation. Our results showed ERK1/2 activation, but not P38 or JNK1/2 activation, is responsible for regulation of NDRG2 on VEGF and PDGF productions. Consistent with the PDGF levels, the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation was also regulated by the conditional medium of the oxLDL treated macrophages with NDRG2 knockdown or over-expression. Neutralizing anti-PDGF antibody can significantly inhibit the enhanced VSMC proliferation by macrophage medium with NDRG2 knockdown. Our present results demonstrate that NDRG2 participates in oxLDL-induced macrophage activation and modulates ERK1/2-dependent PDGF and VEGF production, which has potential application in atherogenesis.",

     "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that LDL oxidation is essential for atherogenesis and antioxidants that prevent oxidation may either decelerate or reduce atherogenesis. Current study focused on the effect and mechanism of 3\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetramethoxyflavone (DTF), a major metabolite of nobiletin (NOB, a citrus polymethoxylated flavone) on atherogenesis. We found DTF had stronger inhibitory activity than \u03b1-tocopherol on inhibiting Cu2+-mediated LDL oxidation measured by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay (TBARS), conjugated diene formation and electrophoretic mobility. Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation plays a vital role in early atherogenesis. DTF (10\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM) dose-dependently attenuated differentiation along with the reduced gene expression of scavenger receptors, CD36 and SR-A, in both PMA- and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, DTF treatment of monocytes and macrophages led to reduction of fluorescent DiI-acLDL and DiI-oxLDL uptake. In conclusion, at least three mechanisms are at work in parallel: DTF reduces LDL oxidation, attenuates monocyte differentiation into macrophage and blunts uptake of modified LDL by macrophage. The effect is different from that of NOB, from which DTF is derived. This study thus significantly enhanced our understanding on how DTF may be beneficial against atherogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The formation and mineralisation of bone are two critical processes in fast-growing Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The mechanisms of these processes, however, have not been described in detail. Thus, in vitro systems that allow the study of factors that influence bone formation in farmed Atlantic salmon are highly warranted. We describe here a method by which unspecialised primary cells from salmon white muscle can differentiate to osteoblasts in vitro. We have subsequently used the differentiated cells as a model system to study the effects of two factors that influence bone formation in Atlantic salmon under commercial farming conditions, namely polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFAs, and temperature. Muscle precursor cells changed their morphology from triangular or spindle-shaped cells to polygonal or cubical cells after 3\u00a0weeks in osteogenic medium. In addition, gene expression studies showed that marker genes for osteoblastogenesis; alp, col1a1, osteocalcin, bmp2 and bmp4 increased after 3\u00a0weeks of incubation in osteogenic media showing that these cells have differentiated to osteoblasts at this stage. Adding CLA or DHA to the osteoblast media resulted in a reduced PGE2 production and increased expression of osteocalcin. Further, temperature studies showed that differentiating osteoblasts are highly sensitive to increased incubation temperature at early stages of differentiation. Our studies show that unspecialised precursor cells isolated from salmon muscle tissue can be caused to differentiate to osteoblasts in vitro. Furthermore, this model system appears to be suitable for the study of osteoblast biology in vitro.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the effect of gallbladder hypomotility on cholesterol crystallization and growth during the early stage of gallstone formation in CCK knockout mice. Contrary to wild-type mice, fasting gallbladder volumes were enlarged and the response of gallbladder emptying to a high-fat meal was impaired in knockout mice on chow or the lithogenic diet. In the lithogenic state, large amounts of mucin gel and liquid crystals as well as arc-like and tubular crystals formed first, followed by rapid formation of classic parallelogram-shaped cholesterol monohydrate crystals in knockout mice. Furthermore, three patterns of crystal growth habits were observed: proportional enlargement, spiral dislocation growth, and twin crystal growth, all enlarging solid cholesterol crystals. At day 15 on the lithogenic diet, 75% of knockout mice formed gallstones. However, wild-type mice formed very little mucin gel, liquid, and solid crystals, and gallstones were not observed. We conclude that lack of CCK induces gallbladder hypomotility that prolongs the residence time of excess cholesterol in the gallbladder, leading to rapid crystallization and precipitation of solid cholesterol crystals. Moreover, during the early stage of gallstone formation, there are two pathways of liquid and polymorph anhydrous crystals evolving to monohydrate crystals and three modes for cholesterol crystal growth.",

     "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, two enzymes of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, oxidosqualene cyclase (Erg7p) and 3-keto reductase (Erg27p) interact such that loss of the 3-keto reductase also results in a concomitant loss of activity of the upstream oxidosqualene cyclase. This interaction wherein Erg27p has a stabilizing effect on Erg7p was examined to determine whether Erg7p reciprocally has a protective effect on Erg27p. To this aim, three yeast strains each lacking the ERG7 gene were tested for 3-ketoreductase activity by incubating either cells or cell homogenates with unlabeled and radiolabeled 3-ketosteroids. In these experiments, the ketone substrates were effectively reduced to the corresponding alcohols, providing definitive evidence that oxidosqualene cyclase is not required for the 3-ketoreductase activity. This suggests that, in S. cerevisiae, the protective relationship between the 3-keto reductase (Erg27p) and oxidosqualene cyclase (Erg7p) is not reciprocal. However, the absence of the Erg7p, appears to affect other enzymes of sterol biosynthesis downstream of lanosterol formation. Following incubation with radiolabeled and non-radiolabeled 3-ketosteroids we detected differences in hydroxysteroid accumulation and ergosterol production between wild-type and ERG7 mutant strains. We suggest that oxidosqualene cyclase affects Erg25p (C-4 sterol oxidase) and/or Erg26p (C-3 sterol dehydrogenase/C-4 decarboxylase), two enzymes that, in conjunction with Erg27p, are involved in C-4 sterol demethylation.",

Purified recombinant Lp-PLA2 was used as a source of exogenous enzyme whereas Pefabloc (serine esterase inhibitor) was used to inhibit the endogenous Lp-PLA2 activity associated with isolated lipoproteins. Cellular association studies were performed with DiI-labeled oxLDL or oxLp(a) and human monocyte-derived macrophages and HepG2 cells. Active Lp-PLA2 decreased the cellular association of oxLDL and oxLp(a) in macrophages and HepG2 cells by approximately 30\u201340%, whereas the inactive enzyme did not significantly change oxidized lipoprotein cellular association by either cell type. OxLDL pretreated by Pefabloc increased oxLDL cellular association by MDM and HepG2 cells compared to untreated oxLDL. Therefore, unlike some lipases, Lp-PLA2 did not appear to have any catalytic independent function in oxLDL cellular association. To assess whether the reduced cellular association mediated by Lp-PLA2 was due to the hydrolysis of oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPC), we measured the concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) in lipoprotein fractions after Lp-PLA2 treatment. LysoPC was increased by 20% (0.4\u00a0\u03bcM) and 87% (0.7\u00a0\u03bcM) by active Lp-PLA2 compared to inactive Lp-PLA2 for oxLDL and Lp(a), respectively. LysoPC at higher concentration dose-dependently increased the cellular association of oxLDL and oxLp(a) in MDM and HepG2 cells. We conclude that Lp-PLA2 mediates a decrease in oxidized lipoprotein cellular association in human macrophages and HepG2 cells by reducing the concentration of oxPC within these lipoproteins.",

However, imbalance between fatty acid uptake and \u03b2-oxidation has the potential to contribute to muscle insulin resistance. The action of insulin is initiated by binding to its receptor and activation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, resulting in the initiation of an intracellular signaling cascade that eventually leads to insulin-mediated alterations in a number of cellular processes, including an increase in glucose transport. Accumulation of fatty acids and lipid metabolites (such as long chain acyl CoA, diacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, and/or ceramide) can lead to alterations in this insulin signaling pathway. An imbalance between fatty acid uptake and oxidation is believed to be responsible for this lipid accumulation, and is thought to be a major cause of insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes, due to lipid accumulation and inhibition of one or more steps in the insulin-signaling cascade. As a result, decreasing muscle fatty acid uptake can improve insulin sensitivity. However, the potential role of increasing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation in the heart or skeletal muscle in order to prevent cytoplasmic lipid accumulation and decrease insulin resistance is controversial. While increased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation may lower cytoplasmic lipid accumulation, increasing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation can decrease muscle glucose metabolism, and incomplete fatty acid oxidation has the potential to also contribute to insulin resistance. In this review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms by which alterations in fatty acid uptake and oxidation contribute to insulin resistance, and how targeting fatty acid uptake and oxidation is a potential therapeutic approach to treat insulin resistance.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease and synovial fluid (SF) reportedly contains a variety of chemotactic factors. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of SF in migration of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and the molecular mechanism of SF-induced cell migration. SF from RA patients greatly stimulated migration of hBMSCs and the SF-induced migration was completely abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor antagonist Ki16425 and by small interfering RNA- or lentiviral small hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous LPA1/Edg2. Moreover, SF from RA patients contains higher concentrations of LPA and an LPA-producing enzyme autotoxin than normal SF. In addition, SF from RA patients increased the intracellular concentration of calcium through a Ki16425-sensitive mechanism and pretreatment of the cells with the calmodulin inhibitor W7 or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93 abrogated the SF-induced cell migration. These results suggest that LPA-LPA1 plays a key role in the migration of hBMSCs induced by SF from RA patients through LPA1-dependent activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.",

     "abstract": "Two major isoforms of human carboxylesterases (CEs) are found in metabolically active tissues, CES1 and CES2. These hydrolytic enzymes are involved in xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. CES1 is abundantly expressed in human liver and monocytes/macrophages, including the THP1 cell line; CES2 is expressed in liver but not in monocytes/macrophages. The cholesteryl ester hydrolysis activity in human macrophages has been attributed to CES1. Here, we report the direct inhibitory effects of several endogenous oxysterols and fatty acids on the CE activity of THP1 monocytes/macrophages and recombinant human CES1 and CES2. Using THP1 whole-cell lysates we found: (1) 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) is a potent inhibitor of carboxylesterase activity (IC50\u00a0=\u00a033\u00a0nM); (2) 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol had moderate inhibitory activity (IC50\u00a0=\u00a08.1\u00a0\u03bcM); and (3) cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol each had little inhibitory activity. 27-HC was a partially noncompetitive inhibitor of recombinant CES1 (Kiapp\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0nM) and impaired intracellular CES1 activity following treatment of intact THP1 cells. In contrast, recombinant CES2 activity was not inhibited by 27-HC, suggesting isoform-selective inhibition by 27-HC. Furthermore, unsaturated fatty acids were better inhibitors of CES1 activity than saturated fatty acids, while CES2 activity was unaffected by any fatty acid. Arachidonic acid (AA) was the most potent fatty acid inhibitor of recombinant CES1 and acted by a noncompetitive mechanism (Kiapp\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u00a0\u03bcM); when not complexed to albumin, exogenous AA penetrated intact THP1 cells and inhibited CES1. Inhibition results are discussed in light of recent structural models for CES1 that describe ligand binding sites separate from the active site. In addition, oxysterol-mediated inhibition of CES1 activity was demonstrated by pretreatment of human liver homogenates or intact THP1 cells with exogenous 27-HC, which resulted in significantly reduced hydrolysis of the pyrethroid insecticide bioresmethrin, a CES1-specific xenobiotic substrate. Collectively, these findings suggest that CE activity of recombinant CES1, cell lysates, and intact cells can be impaired by naturally occurring lipids, which may compromise the ability of CES1 to both detoxify environmental pollutants and metabolize endogenous compounds in vivo.",

The aim of the present study was to define the effect of apoC-I on the uptake of LDL and HDL3 by HepG2 cells. In experiments conducted with exogenously added purified apoC-I, no significant effect was observed on lipoprotein\u2013protein association and degradation; however, LDL- and HDL3-CE selective uptake was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. This study also shows that apoC-I has the ability to associate with HepG2 cells and with LDL and HDL3. Moreover, pre-incubation of HepG2 cells with apoC-I reduces HDL3-CE selective uptake and pre-incubation of LDL and HDL3 with apoC-I decreases their CE selective uptake by HepG2 cells. Thus, apoC-I can accomplish its inhibitory effect on SR-BI activity by either binding to SR-BI or lipoproteins. We conclude that by reducing hepatic lipoprotein-CE selective uptake, apoC-I has an atherogenic character.",

In this study we investigated the impact of the DNA methylation status of the 5-LO promoter on its activity and the role of methyl DNA binding proteins (MBDs) in transcriptional silencing of the 5-LO promoter. Using ChIP assays, we found that the methyl-DNA binding proteins MBD1, MBD2 and MeCP2 bind to the methylated 5-LO core promoter in U937 cells. Knock down of each of the MBDs upregulates 5-LO mRNA expression in U937 cells indicating that these proteins are involved in silencing of the 5-LO gene. In reporter gene assays with in vitro methylated 5-LO promoter constructs, the extent of 5-LO promoter methylation inversely correlated with its activity. Furthermore, we found that MBD1 overexpression repressed 5-LO promoter activity when the CpG sites at the Sp1 binding site close to the transcriptional start site (GC4) were methylated. Gel shift data indicate that recruitment of Sp1 to this binding site is prevented by methylation.",

The full-length protein and the C-terminal LOX domain were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the catalytic activities characterized by UV, HPLC, GC-MS, and CD. All omega-3 polyunsaturates were oxygenated by the LOX domain at the n-7 position and with R stereospecificity: \u03b1-linolenic and the most abundant fatty acid in A. marina, stearidonic acid (C18.4\u03c93), are converted to the corresponding 12R-hydroperoxides, eicosapentaenoic acid to its 14R-hydroperoxide, and docosahexaenoic acid to its 16R-hydroperoxide. Omega-6 polyunsaturates were oxygenated at the n-10 position, forming 9R-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid from linoleic acid and 11R-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid from arachidonic acid. The metabolic transformation of stearidonic acid by the full-length fusion protein entails its 12R oxygenation with subsequent conversion by the catalase-related domain to a novel allene epoxide, a likely precursor of cyclopentenone fatty acids or other signaling molecules (Gao et al, J. Biol. Chem. 284:22087-98, 2009).

We investigated the roles of PKC in the regulation of group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) expression in cytokine-stimulated rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells. Here we show that the induction of sPLA2-IIA by proinflammatory cytokines was under the control of both classical cPKC\u03b1 and atypical aPKC\u03bb/\u03b9 pathways by using PKC inhibitors, a PKC activator, and PKC knockdowns. Treatment of 3Y1 cells with PKC selective inhibitors having broad specificity, such as chelerythrine chloride and GF109203X, blocked IL-1\u03b2/TNF\u03b1-dependent induction of sPLA2-IIA protein in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates cPKC and novel nPKC isoforms, markedly attenuated the cytokine-dependent induction of sPLA2-IIA expression. In comparison, 24-h pretreatment with PMA, which down-regulates these PKC isoforms, markedly enhanced sPLA2-IIA expression. Results with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PKC isoforms revealed that the cytokine-induced sPLA2-IIA expression was markedly enhanced in cPKC\u03b1 knockdown cells compared to those in replicate control cells. In contrast, knockdown of the aPKC\u03bb/\u03b9 isoform reduced the cytokine-induced expression of sPLA2-IIA. These results suggest that the aPKC\u03bb/\u03b9 pathway is required for the induction of sPLA2-IIA expression and that the cPKC\u03b1 pathway acts as a negative regulator of sPLA2-IIA expression in cytokine-stimulated rat fibroblasts.",

Enantiomeric DAGs were separated by performing chiral-stationary-phase HPLC after direct derivatization from lipolysis product extracts. The fact that the ee% of 1,2-sn-diolein over 2,3-sn-diolein increased with the level of hydrolysis indicated that HSL has a preference for 2,3-sn-diolein as a substrate and therefore a stereopreference for the sn-3 position of dioleoylglycerol.

Plasma HDL-C, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and LCAT activity (exogenous substrate method) were measured in 260 nondiabetic men without cardiovascular disease.
