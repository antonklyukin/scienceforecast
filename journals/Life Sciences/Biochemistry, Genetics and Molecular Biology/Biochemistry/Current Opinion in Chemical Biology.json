     "abstract": "The biological activity and structural diversity of natural products are unsurpassed by any available synthetic screening libraries. As such, these privileged scaffolds serve as important, biologically prevalidated platforms for the design of compound libraries in the search for new drug candidates. Recent progress has focussed on improving the potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetics of bioactive natural products through structural modification, leading to the emergence of a number of drug-like lead compounds. Here, we review recent advances in the exploitation of terpenoid, polyketide, phenylpropanoid and alkaloid natural product scaffolds for inspiration in the design and development of important new drug candidates.",

     "abstract": "Chromatin, the nucleoprotein complex organizing the genome, is central in regulating gene expression and genome organization. Chromatin conformational dynamics, controlled by histone post-translational modifications (PTM) and effector proteins, play a key role in this regulatory function. Recent developments in chemical biology, cell biology, and biophysics sparked important new studies, which probe direct causal connections between histone PTMs, chromatin effector proteins that write or read these modifications, and the involved functional chromatin states. In particular, the mechanisms of heterochromatin silencing have been explored in great detail in recent years. These studies revealed the highly dynamic nature of this chromatin state, its conformational heterogeneity, and different mechanisms of its formation. Here, we review how chemical biology and biophysics shaped our current understanding of the dynamic processes observed in heterochromatin and discuss the emerging technologies to detect chromatin organization directly in the cellular environment.",

Recent advances have been made in understanding the complicated roles of miRNAs in epigenetic regulation. miRNAs, as epigenetic modulators, affect the protein levels of the target mRNAs without modifying the gene sequences. Moreover, miRNAs can also be regulated by epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, RNA modification, and histone modifications. The reciprocal actions of miRNAs and epigenetic pathway appear to form a miRNA-epigenetic feedback loop and have an extensive influence on gene expression proliferation. The dysregulation of the miRNA-epigenetic feedback loop interferes with the physiological and pathological processes and contributes to variety of diseases. In this review, we focus on the reciprocal interconnection of miRNAs in epigenetic regulation, with the aim of offering new insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can be used to combat diseases.",

Discovery of new antimalarial drugs with novel chemotypes or modes of action lie at the heart of these efforts. There is a particular interest in drug candidates that target stages of the malaria parasite lifecycle beyond the symptomatic asexual blood stages. This is especially important given the spectre of emerging drug resistance to all current frontline antimalarials. One approach gaining increased interest is the potential of designing novel drugs that target parasite passage from infected individual to feeding mosquito and back again. Action of such therapeutics is geared much more at the population level rather than just concerned with the infected individual. The search for novel drugs active against these stages has been helped by improvements to in vitro culture of transmission and pre-erythrocytic parasite lifecycle stages, robotic automation and high content imaging, methodologies that permit the high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries for drug discovery. Here, we review recent advances in the antimalarial screening landscape, focussed on transmission blocking as a key aim for drug-treatment campaigns of the future.",

For developing chemicals selectively acting on key disease-causing proteins, one useful concept is the direct conversion of such target proteins into biosensors. This approach provides ligand-binding assay systems based on protein-based biosensors, which can quantitatively evaluate interactions between the protein and a specific ligand in many environments. Site-specific chemical modifications are used widely for the creation of protein-based semisynthetic biosensors in vitro. Notably, a few bio-orthogonal approaches capable of selectively modifying drug-targets have been developed, allowing conversion of specific target proteins into semisynthetic biosensors in live cells. These biosensors can be used for quantitative drug binding analyses in native environments.

Covalent inhibitors offer advantages over non-covalent inhibitors in engaging otherwise challenging targets. Reactive cysteine residues on proteins are a common target for covalent inhibitors, whereby the high nucleophilicity of the cysteine thiol under physiological conditions provides an ideal anchoring site for electrophilic small molecules. A chemical-proteomic platform, termed isoTOP-ABPP, allows for profiling cysteine reactivity in complex proteomes and is one of many techniques that can aid in two aspects of the covalent-inhibitor development process: (1) to identify functional cysteines that lead to modulation of protein activity through covalent modification; and, (2) to determine cellular targets and evaluate promiscuity of electrophilic fragments, small molecules, and natural products.

The green and sustainable biotransformation can be driven by photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms where redox biocatalysis is coupled with photoelectrocatalysis. The main challenge is how to transfer photoexcited electrons to (or from) the enzyme redox centers for effective biotransformation using solar energy. This review commences with a conceptual discussion of biocatalytic PEC platforms and highlights recent advances in PEC-based biotransformation through cofactor regeneration or direct transfer of charge carriers to (or from) oxidoreductases on enzyme-conjugated electrodes.

The field encountered a fascinating lead in 2007 when oscillatory features were discovered in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic data\u2009\u2014\u2009the optical analogue of 2D NMR\u2009\u2014\u2009and were assigned to quantum coherence between donor and acceptor electronic states [4\u2022\u2022]. In this review, we describe the evolution in our understanding of quantum effects in photosynthetic energy transfer. A vibronic model is described to demonstrate the current opinion on how quantum effects can optimize energy transfer.",

The main rationale is that near-infrared light can penetrate biological tissues such as skin and blood more efficiently than visible light because these tissues scatter and absorb less light at longer wavelengths. The first clear window, defined as light wavelengths between 650\u00a0nm and 950\u00a0nm, has been shown to be far superior for in vivo and intraoperative optical imaging than visible light. The second clear window, operating in the wavelength range of 1000\u20131700\u00a0nm, has been reported to further improve detection sensitivity, spatial resolution, and tissue penetration because tissue photon scattering and background interference are further reduced at longer wavelengths. Here we discuss recent advances in developing biocompatible plasmonic nanoparticles for in vivo and intraoperative surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in both the first and second NIR windows. In particular, a new class of \u2018broad-band\u2019 plasmonic nanostructures is well suited for surface Raman enhancement across a broad range of wavelengths allowing a direct comparison of detection sensitivity and tissue penetration between the two NIR window.

These systems show mechanistic similarities in their repressive chromatin organization, which in somatic cells is comparable between the DNA-methylated alleles of imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and repressed ERVs. Here, we present how during development, nutrition and chemical components can perturb DNA methylation at imprinted genes and ERVs, and discuss the still poorly understood underlying mechanisms.",

Novel methods based on molecular dynamics simulations are particularly promising and yield a large number of transient pockets, but it has been shown that only a minority of such sites are generally capable of binding ligands with substantial affinity. Based on recent studies, current methodology can be improved by combining molecular dynamics with fragment docking and machine learning approaches.",

Engineered proteins displaying conformationally-defined epitopes may serve as attractive alternatives to natural protein partners as they can be strictly screened for tight binding. The advantage of focused screens with conformationally-defined protein scaffolds is that conservation of the geometry of the natural binding epitopes may preserve binding site specificity while allowing direct mimicry by various synthetic secondary structure scaffolds.

     "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases can arise from a multitude of different pathological drivers, however protein misfolding appears to be a common molecular feature central to several disorders. Protein folding, and attainment of correct secondary and tertiary structure, is essential for proper protein function. Protein misfolding gives rise to structural perturbations that can result in loss of protein function or a gain of toxic function, such as through aggregation, either of which can initiate and propagate biological responses that are deleterious to cells. Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease, each have identified molecular components in which protein misfolding perturbs cellular systems that ultimately lead to cell death, and this predominately occurs in neurons. Current efforts focused on developing therapies for protein misfolding disorders have employed diverse strategies; inhibiting the production of disease-relevant proteins prone to misfolding, inhibiting the aggregation of misfolded proteins, removing and preventing spread of aggregated misfolded proteins and manipulating cellular systems to mitigate the toxic effects of misfolded proteins. Each of these strategies has yielded therapeutic agents that have transitioned from preclinical proof of concept studies into human clinical testing.

Here, we review the last three years of literature on PPI inhibitors to understand what is working and why. From the 66 recently reported PPI inhibitors, we found that the average molecular weight was significantly greater than 500\u00a0Da, but that this trend was driven, in large part, by the contribution of peptide-based compounds. Despite differences in average molecular weight, we found that compounds based on small molecules or peptides were almost equally likely to be potent inhibitors (KD\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM). Finally, we found PPIs with buried surface area (BSA) less than 2000\u00a0\u00c52 were more likely to be inhibited by small molecules, while PPIs with larger BSA values were typically inhibited by peptides. PPIs with BSA values over 4000\u00a0\u00c52 seemed to create a particular challenge, especially for orthosteric small molecules. Thus, it seems important to choose the inhibitor scaffold based on the properties of the target interaction. Moreover, this survey suggests a (more nuanced) conclusion to the question of whether PPIs are good drug targets; namely, that some PPIs are readily \u2018druggable\u2019 given the right choice of scaffold, while others still seem to deserve the \u2018undruggable\u2019 moniker.",

     "abstract": "Glycans and glycoconjugates are involved in regulating a vast array of cellular and molecular processes. Despite the importance of glycans in biology and disease, characterization of glycans remains difficult due to their structural complexity and diversity. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques have emerged as the premier analytical tools for characterizing glycans. However, traditional MS-based strategies struggle to distinguish the large number of coexisting isomeric glycans that are indistinguishable by mass alone. Because of this, ion mobility spectrometry coupled to MS (IM\u2013MS) has received considerable attention as an analytical tool for improving glycan characterization due to the capability of IM to resolve isomeric glycans before MS measurements. In this review, we present recent improvements in IM\u2013MS instrumentation and methods for the structural characterization of isomeric glycans. In addition, we highlight recent applications of IM\u2013MS that illustrate the enormous potential of this technology in a variety of research areas, including glycomics, glycoproteomics, and glycobiology.",

Since so many structurally and functionally distinct carbohydrates are indistinguishable by MS, additional techniques are needed for detailed structural analysis. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), with its ability to resolve closely related isobaric structures, presents such a tool for alleviating the current limitations of MS.

In the absence of asparaginyl-tRNA and/or glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS and GlnRS), Asn-tRNAAsn and/or Gln-tRNAGln are produced by an indirect tRNA aminoacylation pathway that relies on misacylation of these two tRNAs by two different misacylating aaRSs, followed by transamidation by an amidotransferase (GatCAB in bacteria). This review highlights the central importance of indirect tRNA aminoacylation to accurate protein translation, mechanistic peculiarities that appear to be unique to this system, and the newly recognized connection between indirect tRNA aminoacylation and mistranslation as a strategy used by bacteria to respond to environmental stressors like antibiotics.",

Discussed is the plasticity of carbon metabolism, by which the cyanobacterial cells flexibly distribute intracellular carbon fluxes towards target products and adapt to environmental/genetic alterations. This intrinsic feature in cyanobacterial metabolism is being understood through recent identification of new biochemical reactions and engineering on low-throughput pathways. We focus our discussion on new insights into the nature of metabolic plasticity in cyanobacteria and its impact on hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene and isoprene) production. We discuss approaches that need to be developed to rationally rewire photosynthetic carbon fluxes throughout primary metabolism. We outline open questions about the regulatory mechanisms of the metabolic network that remain to be answered, which might shed light on photosynthetic carbon metabolism and help optimize design principles in order to improve the production of fuels and chemicals in cyanobacteria.",

The chemical biology of lignocellulose deconstruction is a complex and intricate process that appears to vary in response to specific ecosystems. These microorganisms rely on simple to complex arrangements of glycoside hydrolases to conduct most of these polysaccharide depolymerization reactions and also, as discovered more recently, oxidative mechanisms via lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases or non-enzymatic Fenton reactions which are used to enhance deconstruction. It is now clear that these deconstruction mechanisms are often more efficient in the presence of the microorganisms. In general, a major fraction of the total plant biomass deconstruction in the biosphere results from the action of various microorganisms, primarily aerobic bacteria and fungi, as well as a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Beyond carbon recycling, specialized microorganisms interact with plants to manage nitrogen in the biosphere. Understanding the interplay between these organisms within or across ecosystems is crucial to further our grasp of chemical recycling in the biosphere and also enables optimization of the burgeoning plant-based bioeconomy.",

The natural product spectrum of acetogens is natively restricted to acetate, ethanol, and 2,3-butanediol but is rapidly expanding to heterologous products. Syngas fermentation can achieve high carbon-efficiencies; however, the underlying metabolism is operating at a thermodynamic limit. This necessitates special enzymatic properties for energy conservation by acetogens. Therefore, the availability of cellular energy is considered to restrain the efficient production of energy-intense products with complex production pathways. The optimization of the feed-gas composition and other process parameters, genetic engineering, and integration with other biotechnologies is required to overcome this limitation.",

This article highlights how the lipid composition of membranes determines specific organelle functions, how homeostatic mechanisms maintain these functions by regulating physical properties of membranes, and how cells disrupt lipid homeostasis to bring about regulated cell death (RCD). These are broad phenomena, and representative examples are reviewed here. In particular, the mechanisms of ferroptosis \u2013 a form of RCD brought about by lipid peroxidation \u2013 are highlighted, demonstrating how lipid metabolism drives cells\u2019 lipid composition toward states of increased sensitivity to lipid oxidation. An understanding of these interactions has begun to give rise to lipid-based therapies. This article reviews current successes of such therapies, and suggests directions for future developments.",

Moreover, how fibrils contribute to disease remains unclear. Here we review recent advances in the development of small molecules and other reagents that are helping to define the mechanisms of protein aggregation in molecular detail. Such probes form a powerful platform with which to better define the mechanisms of structural conversion into amyloid fibrils and may provide the much-needed stepping stone for future development of successful therapeutic agents.",

Aldolases are useful catalysts for the stereoselective synthesis of bioactive small molecules; however, despite fluoropyruvate being a viable nucleophile for some aldolases, the potential of aldolases to control the formation of fluorine-bearing stereocentres has largely been untapped. Very recently, it has been shown that aldolase-catalysed stereoselective carboncarbon bond formation with fluoropyruvate as nucleophile enable the synthesis of many \u03b1-fluoro \u03b2-hydroxy carboxyl derivatives. Furthermore, an understanding of the structural basis for the stereocontrol observed in these reactions is beginning to emerge.

Additionally, the polyketide synthesis pathway has recently been attracting interest as a promising alternative biofuel production route. In this article, recent trends in advanced biofuels production are reviewed by categorizing them into three types of advanced biofuels: alcohols, biodiesel and jet fuel, and gasoline. Focus is given on the strategies of employing synthetic biology and metabolic engineering for the development of microbial strains producing advanced fuels. Finally, the prospects for future advances needed to achieve much more efficient bio-based production of advanced biofuels are discussed, focusing on designing advanced biofuel production pathways coupled with screening, modifying, and creating novel enzymes.",

It is necessary because oxygen is a competing substrate of the CO2-fixing enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, forming 2-phosphoglycolate that negatively interferes with photosynthesis. Photorespiration very efficiently recycles 2-phosphoglycolate into 3-phosphoglycerate, which re-enters the Calvin\u2013Benson cycle to drive sustainable photosynthesis. Photorespiration however requires extra energy and re-oxidises one quarter of the 2-phosphoglycolate carbon to CO2, lowering potential maximum rates of photosynthesis in most plants including food and energy crops.

This review article summarizes the recent advances in the development of reversible covalent chemistry for biological and medicinal applications. Specifically, we document the chemical strategies that allow for reversible modification of the three major classes of nucleophiles in biology: thiols, alcohols and amines.

The diversity of structures has now been increased through the development of helix-based pores as well as the better-known \u03b2 barrels. New developments also include truncated pores, which pierce bilayers through lipid rearrangement, and hybrid pores, which do away with bilayers altogether. Pore dimers, which span two lipid bilayers, have been constructed and pores based on DNA nanostructures are gaining in importance. While nanopore DNA sequencing has received enthusiastic attention, protein pores have a wider range of potential applications, requiring specifications that will require engineering efforts to continue for years to come.",

The most investigated type of histone modifications is lysine acetylations. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetylations from lysines, thereby influencing (inflammatory) gene expression. Intriguingly, apart from histones, HDACs also target non-histone proteins. The nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway is an important regulator in the expression of numerous inflammatory genes, and acetylation plays a crucial role in regulating its responses. Several studies have shed more light on the role of HDAC 1\u20133 in inflammation with a particular pro-inflammatory role for HDAC 3. Nevertheless, the HDAC-NF-\u03baB interactions in inflammatory signalling have not been fully understood. An important challenge in targeting the regulatory role of HDACs in the NF-\u03baB pathway is the development of highly potent small molecules that selectively target HDAC iso-enzymes. This review focuses on the role of HDAC 3 in (NF-\u03baB-mediated) inflammation and NF-\u03baB lysine acetylation. In addition, we address the application of frequently used small molecule HDAC inhibitors as an approach to attenuate inflammatory responses, and their potential as novel therapeutics.

Efforts to characterize the molecular basis for KL4 function have revealed the peptide exhibits a helical structure which differentially partitions in response to both lipid saturation levels and pH. The penta-residue repeat of KL4 leads to adaptive peptide helicity, varying with partitioning depth, and suggests structural plasticity may represent an important mechanism for differential trafficking of lipids, particularly in intra-alveolar surfactant for the formation of stable DPPC monolayers at air-water interfaces.",

Recent progress in treating RA has been achieved with janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (Jakinibs), an orally available disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug targeting the intracellular kinase JAK and with similar efficacy to biologics. The first Jakinib approved for RA was tofacitinib, which exerted superiority to methotrexate and non-inferiority to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. In recent years, the Jakinib baricitinib has demonstrated superiority to both methotrexate and a TNF inhibitor, adalimumab. Given these promising findings, Jakinibs are expected to represent the next generation compounds for treating RA, and a number of Jakinibs are currently in clinical trials. Jakinibs can differ substantially in their selectivity against JAKs; tofacitinib and baricitinib target multiple JAKs, whereas the most recently developed Jakinibs target only a single JAK. The influence of Jakinib selectivity on efficacy and side effects is of great interest, requiring further careful observation.",

In rheumatoid arthritis, citrullinated proteins serve as key antigens for rheumatoid arthritis-associated autoantibodies. These data suggest that citrullinated proteins may serve more generally as biomarkers of specific disease states, however, the identification of citrullinated residues remains challenging due to the small 1\u00a0Da mass change that occurs upon citrullination.

These cell factories can be efficiently generated by constructing libraries of diversified genomes followed by screening for the desired phenotypes. However, methods available for microbial genome diversification far exceed our ability to screen and select for those variants with optimal performance. Genetically encoded biosensors have shown the potential to address this gap, given their ability to respond to small molecule binding and ease of implementation with high-throughput analysis. Here we describe recent progress in biosensor development and their applications in a metabolic engineering context. We also highlight examples of how biosensors can be integrated with synthetic circuits to exert feedback regulation on the metabolism for improved performance of cell factories.",

Corresponding synthetic compounds are non-fluorescent in solution due to photoinduced isomerization of the benzylideneimidiazolidinone core. Restriction of this internal rotation by binding to host molecules leads to pronounced, up to three orders of magnitude, increase of fluorescence intensity. This property allows using GFP chromophore analogs as fluorogenic dyes to detect metal ions, proteins, nucleic acids, and other hosts. For example, RNA aptamer named Spinach, which binds to and activates fluorescence of some GFP chromophores, was proved to be a unique label for live-cell imaging of specific RNAs, endogenous metabolites and target proteins. Chemically locked GFP chromophores are brightly fluorescent and represent potentially useful dyes due to their small size and high water solubility.",

Two of the intrinsic limitations include the rotational flexibility of the peptide backbone and the limited number (20) of natural amino acids.

In photosynthesis, high quantum yield charge separation is achieved by a series of rapid, photoinitiated electron transfer steps that take place in proteins called reaction centers (RCs). Of current interest are new strategies that couple RC photochemistry to the direct synthesis of energy-rich molecules, offering opportunities to more directly tune the products of photosynthesis and potentially to increase solar energy conversion capacity.

Adenosine metabolites, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), have in particular been co-opted by these secreted virulence factors to reprogram host pathways. While some host targets for secreted virulence factors have been identified, other toxin and effector substrates have been elusive, which require new methods for their characterization. In this review, we focus on chemical reporters based on NAD and ATP that should facilitate the discovery and characterization of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation and adenylylation/AMPylation in bacterial pathogenesis and cell biology.",

Fortunately, the past few years have provided a number of important advances, including new abiotic routes for the synthesis of nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides. Recent discoveries also provide additional support for the hypothesis that RNA is the product of evolution, being preceded by ancestral genetic polymers, or pre-RNAs, that are synthesized more easily than RNA. In some cases, parallel searches for plausible prebiotic routes to RNA and pre-RNAs have provided more than one experimentally verified synthesis of RNA substructures and possible predecessors. Just as the synthesis of a contemporary biological molecule cannot be understood without knowledge of cellular metabolism, it is likely that an integrated approach that takes into account both plausible prebiotic reactions and plausible prebiotic environments will ultimately provide the most satisfactory and unifying chemical scenarios for the origin of nucleic acids.

Since the first report, the list of proteins that are successfully labeled by the LDT chemistry has been increasing. A growing number of studies have demonstrated its utility to create semisynthetic proteins directly in cellular contexts. The in situ generated semisynthetic proteins are applicable for various types of analysis and imaging of intracellular biological processes. In this review, we summarize the basic properties of the LDT chemistry and its applications toward in situ engineering and analysis of native proteins in living systems. Current limitations and future challenges of this area are also described.",

Ground-state discrimination applies to enzymes where selectivity is achieved primarily at the level of substrate binding. Exemplified by DNA methyltransferases and the ribosome, ground-state discrimination imposes strong accuracy-rate tradeoffs. Alternatively, transition-state discrimination, applies to relatively small substrates where substrate binding and chemistry are efficiently coupled, and evokes weaker tradeoffs.

Indeed, assembly or degradation of carbohydrates requires carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) able to act on a vast range of glycosidic monomers, oligomers or polymers in a regio-specific or stereo-specific manner in order to produce the desired structure. Sequence-based analyses allow finding the most original enzymes. Novel screening methods have emerged that enable a more efficient exploitation of the CAZyme diversity found in the microbial world or generated by protein engineering. Computational biology methods also play a prominent role in the success of CAZyme design. Such progress allows circumventing current limitations of carbohydrate synthesis and opens new opportunities related to the synthetic biology field.",

Another trend in chiral amine chemistry is the development of strategies allowing for the synthesis of secondary amines. For example the smart choice of substrates for amine transaminases provided access to secondary amines by chemoenzymatic reactions. Furthermore novel biocatalysts for the synthesis of secondary amines such as imine reductases and Pictet-Spenglerases have been identified and applied.

Along with chemo-enzymatic synthesis, glycans isolated from natural sources have played important roles in array development and will continue to be a major source of glycans. N-glycans and O-glycans from glycoproteins, and glycans from glycosphingolipids (GSLs) can be released from corresponding glycoconjugates with relatively mature methods, although isolation of large numbers and quantities of glycans is still very challenging. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are less represented on current glycan microarrays. Glycan microarray development has been greatly facilitated by bifunctional fluorescent linkers, which can be applied in a \u2018Shotgun Glycomics\u2019 approach to incorporate isolated natural glycans. Glycan presentation on microarrays may affect glycan binding by GBPs, often through multivalent recognition by the GBP.",

Recently it has been appreciated that glycolipid and lipid complexes, formed from two or more individual species, can interact to create molecular shapes capable of being recognised by these autoantibodies whilst not binding to the single individuals. As a result of this, novel autoantibody targets have been identified. This newly termed \u2018combinatorial glycomic\u2019 approach has provided the impetus to redesigning the assay methodologies traditionally used in the neuropathy-associated autoantibody field. Combinatorial glycoarrays can be readily constructed in house using lipids of interest.

The standardization ideas of Synthetic Biology emerged in the late 1990s from a convergence of research on cellular computing, and were motivated by an array of applications from tissue regeneration to bio-sensing to mathematical programming. As the definition of Synthetic Biology has grown to be synonymous with Biological Engineering and Biotechnology, the field has lost sight of the fact that its founding premise has not yet been validated. While the value of standardization has been proven in many other engineering disciplines, none of them involve self-replicating systems. The engineering of self-replicating systems will likely benefit from standardization, and also by embracing the forces of evolution that inexorably shape such systems.",

Improved intact protein separations coupled to high-performance instruments have increased the quality and number of protein and proteoform identifications.

     "abstract": "The vast majority of bottom-up proteomic studies employ reversed-phase separation of tryptic digests coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. These studies are remarkably successful for the analysis of samples containing micrograms of protein. However, liquid chromatography tends to perform poorly for samples containing nanogram amounts of protein, presumably due to loss of trace-level peptides within the chromatographic system. Capillary zone electrophoresis provides a much simpler flow system and would appear to be an attractive alternative to liquid chromatography for separation of small peptide samples before electrospray ionization and mass spectrometry detection. However, capillary zone electrophoresis has received very little attention as a tool for analysis of complex proteomes. In 2012, we reported the use of capillary zone electrophoresis for the analysis of the secretome of Mycobacterium marinum, a model system for tuberculosis. Roughly 400 peptides and over 100 proteins were identified from this medium-complexity proteome; this identification required analysis of a set of 11 fractions and occupied three hours of mass spectrometer time. We have recently employed an improved capillary zone electrophoresis system for the analysis of 100\u00a0ng of the Escherichia coli proteome and observed over 1300 peptides and nearly 350 proteins in a single separation. More interestingly, analysis of 1\u00a0ng of the E. coli proteome yielded over 600 peptide and 140 protein groups. This sample size approaches that of a large eukaryotic cell, suggesting that capillary zone electrophoresis may ultimately be a useful tool for chemical cytometry.",

The RNA modifying enzymes RlmN and Cfr catalyze methylation via a methyl synthase mechanism. These enzymes use SAM in two distinct roles: as a source of a methyl group transferred to a conserved cysteine and as a source of 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical (5\u2032-dA). Hydrogen atom abstraction by this species generates a thiomethylene radical which adds into the RNA substrate, forming an enzyme-substrate covalent adduct. In another recent study, methylation of the indole moiety of tryptophan by the radical SAM and cobalamin-binding domain enzyme TsrM has been reconstituted. Methylcobalamin serves as an intermediate methyl donor in TsrM, and is proposed to transfer the methyl group as a methyl radical.

In the last 10 years, many new RSFPs have been developed and novel applications in cell imaging discovered that rely on their photoswitching properties. This review will describe research on the mechanisms of reversible photoswitching and recent applications using RSFPs. While cis\u2013trans isomerization of the chromophore is believed to be the general mechanism for most RSFPs, structural studies reveal diversity in the details of photoswitching mechanisms, including different effects of protonation, chromophore planarity, and pocket flexibility. Applications of RSFPs include new types of live-cell superresolution imaging, tracking of protein movements and interactions, information storage, and optical control of protein activity.",

Efficient labelling of proteins and nucleic acids is very important for any fluorescence method, and equally the development of novel fluorophores has been crucial in making biomolecules amenable to single molecule fluorescence methods. In this paper we review novel coupling strategies that permit site-specific and efficient labelling of proteins. Furthermore, we will discuss progressive single molecule approaches that allow the detection of individual molecules and biomolecular complexes even directly isolated from cellular extracts at much higher and much lower concentrations than has been possible so far.",

Development of fluorescent sensors for imaging studies has been a very active area of research; however the corresponding chemical tools for delivering metal ions have received less interest. Using the roadmap provided by Ca2+ predecessors, we describe how new photocaged complexes are being developed, and highlight some of the obstacles that must be overcome to investigate an emerging area in metal ion biology with different requirements.",

But formation of a metal-chelate can have biological ramifications that are much broader than metal elimination. Exploring these other possibilities could lead to pharmacological interventions that alter the concentration, distribution, or reactivity of metals in targeted ways for therapeutic benefit. This review highlights recent examples that showcase four general strategies of using principles of metal chelation in medicinal contexts beyond the traditional notion of chelation therapy. These strategies include altering metal biodistribution, inhibiting specific metalloenzymes associated with disease, enhancing the reactivity of a metal complex to promote cytotoxicity, and conversely, passivating the reactivity of metals by site-activated chelation to prevent cytotoxicity.",

Siderocalins have been identified in humans, chickens, and quail, among other animals. The differences in the respective siderocalins suggest that each was developed in response to the most serious pathogens encountered by that animal.

Here we discuss the application of cell-based photocrosslinking to the study of specific problems in immune cell signaling, transcription, membrane protein dynamics, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and chaperone-assisted protein folding.",

This article summarizes recent advances on studies of the OEC along with studies of synthetic oxomanganese complexes for artificial photosynthesis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid methods have enabled modeling the S1 state of the OEC, including the ligation proposed by the most recent X-ray data where D170 is bridging Ca and the Mn center outside the CaMn3 core. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations have explored the structural/functional roles of chloride, suggesting that it regulates the electrostatic interactions between D61 and K317 that might be critical for proton abstraction. Furthermore, structural studies of synthetic oxomanganese complexes, including the [H2O(terpy)MnIII(\u03bc-O)2MnIV(terpy)OH2]3+ (1, terpy\u00a0=\u00a02,2\u2032:6\u2032,2\u2033-terpyridine) complex, provided valuable insights on the mechanistic influence of carboxylate moieties in close contact with the Mn catalyst during oxygen evolution.

Secondly, biosynthetic studies of microbial metabolites have enabled us to not only access ingenious biosynthetic machineries, but also obtain a variety of biosynthetic intermediates.

Here we review the remarkable recent progress that has been made in these fields, highlight important mechanistic insights that have been gleaned from these studies thus far, and discuss what we envision lies ahead as these approaches continue to evolve and expand to address increasingly complex mechanistic and regulatory aspects of translation.",

     "abstract": "Splicing is an essential eukaryotic process in which introns are excised from precursors to messenger RNAs and exons ligated together. This reaction is catalyzed by a multi-MegaDalton machine called the spliceosome, composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and a core set of \u223c100 proteins minimally required for activity. Because of the spliceosome's size, its low abundance in cellular extracts, and its highly dynamic assembly pathway, analysis of the kinetics of splicing and the conformational rearrangements occurring during spliceosome assembly and disassembly has proven extraordinarily challenging. Here, we review recent progress in combining chemical biology methodologies with single molecule fluorescence techniques to provide a window into splicing in real time. These methods complement ensemble measurements of splicing in vivo and in vitro to facilitate kinetic dissection of pre-mRNA splicing.",

Unfortunately, the recent shift of the drug discovery paradigm from cellular screening to target-based approaches has not delivered the anticipated benefits. A recent renaissance of the traditional cell-based approach, on the other hand, has yielded several clinical candidates. Three successful examples are illustrated in this review, namely spiroindolone, thiazolidinone, and diarylquinoline for the treatment of malaria, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis, respectively. We describe in detail their identification, mechanism of action (MoA), and common features in the chemical structures. The challenges of the cell-based approach for anti-infective drug discovery are also discussed. We propose a shift from standard libraries to synthetic natural-product-like compound collections to improve the success of phenotypic lead finding and to facilitate the validation of hits.",

     "abstract": "The last decade has seen the development of automated microscopy and its adaptation for various areas of research, particularly infectious disease. Most of the high-content screening (HCS) platforms now integrate all of the following necessary steps: automated pipettes for assay miniaturization in 384-well plates, automated image acquisition and data storage and analysis. HCS was initially associated with RNA interference genetic screens for identifying host factors involved in host\u2013pathogen interactions. More recently, both in academia and in industry, HCS has been adapted for drug discovery purposes. High-content analysis enables intracellular tracking of viral particles to profile the antiviral mechanisms of each compound. Adaptation to high-throughput screening in bacteriology and parasitology has already led to the discovery of new types of host-specific inhibitors that differ from those inhibitors that act directly on microbes.",

A brief glance at these natural products, especially the substantial structural variation within a class of compounds, clearly demonstrates that Nature has long played the role of medicinal chemist. The recent explosion in genome sequencing has expanded our appreciation of natural product space and the vastness of uncharted territory that remains. One small corner of natural product chemical space is occupied by the recently dubbed thiazole/oxazole-modified microcins (TOMMs), which are ribosomally produced peptides with posttranslationally installed heterocycles derived from cysteine, serine and threonine residues. As with other classes of natural products, the genetic capacity to synthesize TOMMs has been widely disseminated among bacteria. Over the evolutionary timescale, Nature has tested countless random mutations and selected for gain of function in TOMM biosynthetic gene clusters, yielding several privileged molecular scaffolds. Today, this burgeoning class of natural products encompasses a structurally and functionally diverse set of molecules (i.e. microcin B17, cyanobactins, and thiopeptides). TOMMs presumably provide their producers with an ecological advantage. This advantage can include chemical weapons wielded in the battle for nutrients, disease-promoting virulence factors, or compounds presumably beneficial for symbiosis. Despite this plethora of functions, many TOMMs await experimental interrogation. This review will focus on the biosynthesis and natural combinatorial diversity of the TOMM family.",

Understanding with chemical precision how GPCRs function in biological membranes remains a central problem in biology. Recently a number of creative strategies have been developed that allow site-specific attachment of chemical probes or tags directly on expressed receptors or on biologically active peptide ligands or substrates. One particularly important advance is the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids (UAAs) with unique small bioorthogonal tags using amber codon suppression in mammalian cells.

H2O2 generated by RCCs can indirectly inhibit the catalytic activity of proteins by oxidizing accessible cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, histidine, or selenocysteine residues, and indeed several important classes of protein targets are susceptible to H2O2-mediated inactivation; protein tyrosine phosphatases, cysteine proteases, and metalloenzymes. The main sources of H2O2 in cells are the Nox enzyme/SOD systems, peroxisome metabolism, and the autoxidation of reactive chemicals by enzyme mediated redox cycling at both the microsomal and mitochondrial sites of electron transport. Given the role of H2O2 as a second messenger involved in the regulation of many signaling pathways it is hardly surprising that compounds that can generate intracellular H2O2 by enzyme mediated redox cycling would have pleiotropic effects. RCCs can therefore have serious negative consequences for the probe and/or lead generation process: primary HTS assay hit rates may be inflated by RCC false positives; crucial resources will be diverted to develop and implement follow up assays to distinguish RCCs from real hits; and screening databases will become annotated with the promiscuous activity of RCCs. In an attempt to mitigate the serious impact of RCCs on probe and lead generation, two groups have independently developed assays to indentify RCCs.",

The primary challenge in developing new sensor arrays is collecting together a sufficient number of recognition elements that possess different binding affinities for the analytes of interest. In this regard, the use of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as the recognition elements in sensor arrays has a number of unique advantages. MIPs can be rapidly and inexpensively prepared with different selectivities and tuned with different selectivity patterns via the choice of templates in the imprinting process. The array format also helps compensate for the low selectivities and high cross-reactivities of MIP sensors. These attractive qualities of MIP sensor arrays have been demonstrated in recent examples, which have established the viability and generality of the approach. In particular, the versatility of the imprinting process enables MIP sensor arrays to be tailored to specific analytes.

Post-translational chemistry offers access to these side chains. Nearly half a century ago, the idea of a \u2018chemical mutation\u2019 was proposed and the interconversion between amino acid side chains was demonstrated on select proteins. In these isolated examples, a powerful proof-of-concept was demonstrated. Here, we revive the idea of chemical mutagenesis and discuss the prospect of its general application in protein science.

Since the rate of catalysis is determined by the climb over a sequence of energy barriers, we focus here on the critical question of transition pathways. A combination of time-resolved NMR and simulation deliver a glimpse into how proteins can so efficiently move within the ensemble of the native conformations while avoiding unfolding during that journey. The loss of energy due to breakage of native contacts is compensated by non-native transient hydrogen bonds during the transition thereby \u2018holding on\u2019 to the energy until the new native contacts form that define the alternate functional state.

     "abstract": "Recent data increasingly reveal that conformational dynamics are indispensable to enzyme function throughout the catalytic cycle, in substrate recruiting, chemical transformation, and product release. Conformational transitions may involve conformational selection and induced fit, which can be viewed as a special case in the catalytic network. NMR, X-ray crystallography, single-molecule FRET, and simulations clearly demonstrate that the free enzyme dynamics already encompass all the conformations necessary for substrate binding, preorganization, transition-state stabilization, and product release. Conformational selection and substate population shift at each step of the catalytic turnover can accommodate enzyme specificity and efficiency. Within such a framework, entropy can have a larger role in conformational dynamics than in direct energy transfer in dynamically promoted catalysis.",

     "abstract": "ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling motors play fundamental roles in nuclear processes by regulating access to DNA. Yet compared to other cellular motors less is known about how these motors couple the energy of ATP to alter their substrates. Here we use recent studies on a key chromatin remodeling motor from the ISWI class, human ACF and its yeast counterpart, ISW2, to propose a model for how these motors use ATP to read structural cues presented by nucleosomal substrates. Substantial earlier work has shown that ACF activity is strongly regulated by the length of the DNA flanking a nucleosome as well as by the histone H4 tail. Recent bulk and single-molecule studies of human ACF suggest that this complex functions as a dimeric motor. These studies, together with studies of yeast ISW2 imply that at least two types of ATP hydrolysis events accompany each cycle of nucleosome movement. We propose that ISWI motors may employ a kinetic proof reading type of mechanism to favor action on nucleosomes that are poised to be in condensed chromatin while inhibiting action on nucleosomes that are in fully active or fully condensed chromatin.",

     "abstract": "The binding of ligands to proteins can be enhanced through improved packing within the proteins that may, or may not, occur with conformational change. Enzymes can similarly improve their catalytic magic through better packing in the transition state (TS) for reaction. In principle, the improved packing demands no more than the minute shortening of non-covalent interactions throughout much of the structure of the protein (positively cooperative binding). Improved protein packing can account for the remarkably high biotin/streptavidin affinity, and perhaps also for a major part of the catalytic function of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). As successive NAD+ molecules bind to the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase tetramer, they do so with positively cooperative binding (using the term as applied in crystallization and protein folding) that decreases at each step. This binding is negatively cooperative in the usage stemming from Monod and co-workers.",

     "abstract": "Although disordered proteins are able to carry out a variety of different functions, particularly those involved in signalling and regulation, they have been observed to perform catalysis only in a small number of cases. The presence of structural disorder is indeed expected to be poorly compatible with enzymatic catalysis, which requires a well-organised environment in the active site of the enzyme in order to facilitate the formation of the transition state of the chemical reaction to be catalysed. Despite this stringent requirement, current evidence suggests that certain partially disordered proteins could be catalytically active by becoming structured in the regions of their active sites, even if their overall states retain a significant degree of conformational heterogeneity. This type of mechanism, however, does not appear to be not very common, perhaps because the time required to the conformational search within a disordered state to establish a catalytic environment in the presence of the substrate should not be longer than the overall turnover time required for optimal function. In addition, the catalytic environment should be maintained for long enough despite the structural fluctuations to enable the catalytic reaction to take place. As some partially unstructured proteins have been reported to be capable of overcoming these severe limitations and act as enzymes, their study can increase our general understanding of the mechanism of enzymatic catalysis, as well as extend our ability to control the range of functions that can be performed by disordered proteins.",

     "abstract": "Red cells are the oxygen-carrying components of blood. In modern medical practice, transfusions are given as suspensions of type-matched red cells in saline to replace lost blood, preventing organ damage and allowing for recovery. Since red cells cannot be stored for more than about 40 days and because they can transmit infections, alternative materials for transfusions were developed to replace the oxygenation function of the red cells. One approach involves chemically stabilizing hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein of the red cell, while also adjusting its oxygenation properties to replicate that of the red cell. Evaluation of clinical trials of all products led to the conclusion that none that were tested would be suitable for clinical use [Natanson C, Kern SJ, Lurie P, Banks SM, Wolfe SM: Cell-free hemoglobin-based blood substitutes and risk of myocardial infarction and death: a meta-analysis. J Am Med Assoc 2008, 299:2304\u20132312]. Most notably, the materials increased blood pressure and some were associated with increased risk of heart attacks. More recently, it was found that materials from covalent addition of polyethylene glycol polymers (PEG) to hemoglobin do not elicit the undesired effects on blood pressure [Vandegriff K, Bellelli A, Samaja M, Malavalli A, Brunori M, Winslow RM: Rates of NO binding to MP4, a non-hypertensive polyethylene glycol-conjugated hemoglobin.

Also, materials with higher oxygen affinity than red cells are able to provide oxygenation at the sites in capillaries that have the most critical need for oxygen [Villela NR, Cabrales P, Tsai AG, Intaglietta M: Microcirculatory effects of changing blood hemoglobin oxygen affinity during hemorrhagic shock resuscitation in an experimental model. Shock 2009, 31:645\u2013652]. It had been considered that the origin of the negative effects of the tested hemoglobin derivatives was because of their scavenging of endogenous nitric oxide (NO), the signal for vasodilation. It has been observed that an increase in the concentration of nitrite in circulation leads to an increase in NO concentration. This is consistent with the well-known reaction of hemoglobin with nitrite that produces NO and oxidized hemoglobin [Cannon RO 3rd, Schechter AN, Panza JA, Ognibene FP, Pease-Fye ME, Waclawiw MA, Shelhamer JH, Gladwin MT: Effects of inhaled nitric oxide on regional blood flow are consistent with intravascular nitric oxide delivery.

Nat Med 2003, 9:1498\u20131505]. The PEG\u2013hemoglobin and nitrite results are especially interesting as the hemoglobin to which PEG has been conjugated produces NO from nitrite at an enhanced rate [Lui FE, Dong P, Kluger R: Polyethylene glycol conjugation enhances the nitrite reductase activity of native and cross-linked hemoglobin.

By making use of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening, they can circumvent our limitations in designing probes for particular recognition processes. Combinatorial chemists have proved how to derivatize fluorogenic scaffolds, tune their photophysical spectra and adjust their properties (from cell permeability to quantum yields) to generate libraries of potential sensors. Several platforms (in vitro assays, cell-based imaging) have also been optimized to screen these libraries in a high-throughput manner, and with the recent progress in image acquisition and analysis, their scope has been expanded toward more diverse and demanding biological systems. Supported by successful examples of fluorescent sensors for biomolecules, proteins, or even phenotypes, this review (together with a video abstract) stresses the important role that diversity-oriented approaches will continue to play in probe development in the near future.",

     "abstract": "Monomeric fluorescent proteins of different colors are widely used to study behavior and targeting of proteins in living cells. Fluorescent proteins that irreversibly change their spectral properties in response to light irradiation of a specific wavelength, or photoactivate, have become increasingly popular to image intracellular dynamics and superresolution protein localization. Until recently, however, no optimized monomeric red fluorescent proteins and red photoactivatable proteins have been available. Furthermore, monomeric fluorescent proteins, which change emission from blue to red simply with time, so-called fluorescent timers, were developed to study protein age and turnover. Understanding of chemical mechanisms of the chromophore maturation or photoactivation into a red form will further advance engineering of fluorescent timers and photoactivatable proteins with enhanced and novel properties.",

Aequorea green fluorescent protein (FP) and its engineered variants are a critical component of genetically encoded biosensors, as they serve to provide a \u2018read-out\u2019 of the biorecognition event under investigation. The family of FP-based biosensors includes a diverse array of designs that utilize various photophysical characteristics of the FPs. In this review, we will discuss these designs and their read-outs through reviewing some of the recent works in this area.",

     "abstract": "Cellular processes are orchestrated by the precise coordination and regulation of molecular events in the cell. Fluorescent protein-based biosensors coupled with live-cell imaging have enabled the visualization of these events in real time and helped shape some of the current concepts of signal transduction, such as spatial compartmentation. The quantitative information produced by these tools has been incorporated into mathematical models that are capable of predicting highly complex and dynamic behaviors of cellular signaling networks, thus providing a systems level understanding of how pathways interact to produce a functional response. Finally, with technological advances in high-throughput and in vivo imaging, these molecular tools promise to continually engender significant contributions to our understanding of cellular processes under normal and diseased conditions.",

     "abstract": "Reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as nitric oxide and its higher oxides, play important roles in cell signaling during many physiological and pathological events. Elucidation of the exact functions of these important biomolecules has been hampered by the inability to detect RNS reliably under biological conditions. A surge of research into RNS chemistry has resulted in the design of a new generation of fluorescent probes that are specific and sensitive for their respective RNS analytes. Progress in the field of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and nitroxyl sensing promises to advance our knowledge of important signaling events involving these species and lead to a better understanding of oxidative biochemistry crucial to health and disease.",

     "abstract": "As the primary consumers of oxygen within all aerobic organisms, mitochondria are a major source of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from the in vivo chemistry of oxygen metabolism. Mitochondrial ROS have been traditionally implicated in aging and in a variety of pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and diabetes, but recent studies also link controlled mitochondrial ROS fluxes to cell regulation and signaling events. Progress in the development of mitochondrial-targeted fluorescent small-molecule indicators that detect specific ROS with high selectivity offers a promising approach for interrogating mitochondrial ROS production, trafficking, and downstream biological effects.",

The use of optical probes with near-infrared fluorescence allows for improved photon penetration through tissue and minimizes the effects of tissue autofluorescence. There are several parameters that define the effectiveness of imaging agents in vivo. These factors include probe targeting, activation, pharmacokinetics, biocompatibility, and photophysics. Recent advances in our understanding of these variables as they pertain to the application of optical reporters for in vivo imaging are discussed in this review.",

For example, cryptophanes that exhibit 10-fold higher xenon affinity with distinct 129Xe magnetic resonance spectra have been synthesized. Also relevant are dendrimeric cryptophane assemblies and inorganic zeolites that localize many 129Xe atoms to rare targets. Finally, this article considers biosensors that produce measurable changes in 129Xe chemical shift based upon the activity of oligonucleotides, proteins, or enzymes, and includes the first cell studies.",
