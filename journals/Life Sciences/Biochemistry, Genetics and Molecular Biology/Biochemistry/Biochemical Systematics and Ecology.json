     "abstract": "The goal of this study was to find significant pathways associated with fruit color in Taxus chinensis var. mairei. Two Taxus chinensis var. mairei with fruits of different colors were sequenced using high-throughput sequencing. Then, unigene assembly, unigene annotation, and classification of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) were performed. Gene ontology (GO) classification and pathway enrichment analysis for unigenes were also conducted. Protein coding sequences (CDS) were predicted. Subsequently, differentially expressed unigenes, functional enrichment pathways of differentially expressed unigenes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were analyzed. The data of Taxus chinensis var. mairei were assembled into 45,112 unigenes with an average size of 1232 bp and an N50 of 1882 bp. The significantly enriched biological processes (BP) were metabolic processes, and cellular processes, followed by single-organism processes, and reproductive processes. Significantly enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were metabolic pathways, pathways related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and RNA transport pathways. Transition had a higher number of SNP sites than transversion. Trinucleotide had the highest SSR motif numbers. Metabolic pathways and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites may play significant roles in determining fruit color in Taxus chinensis var. mairei. In addition, the present dataset would provide a basis for future functional genomic research on Taxus chinensis var. mairei.",

     "abstract": "The variation of the essential oils composition of 10 Tunisian Mentha x rotundifolia (L.) Huds. Populations and their antioxidant activity were assessed. Essential oils showed high percentages of oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Rotundifolone, p-menthane-1,2,3-triol, \u03b2-caryophyllene and germacrene D were identified as main compounds at the species level. A variation in the essential oil composition was observed according to the populations and ecological factors. The populations 7, 8, 9 and 10 from the upper semi-arid bioclimatic zone and situated at high altitudes, exhibited the highest amount of rotundifolone. The populations 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 from the lower humid showed a rotundifolone/\u03b2-caryophyllene/germacrene D chemotype. The population 6, situated at the lowest altitude, was characterized by the highest amount of p-menthane-1,2,3-triol. The level of antioxidant activity of the populations was linked to their chemical composition difference. The highest scavenging activity and the best ability to reduce ferric ions were recorded for the population 10. The most important capacity to inhibit \u03b2-carotene bleaching was revealed for the population 8. For all populations, the antioxidant activities were substantial but lower than antioxidant standards used (Trolox and BHT).The populations (7, 8, 9 and 10) from the upper semi-arid showed the best yields of essential oils and the highest contents of rotundifolone. Chemotypes within these populations could be selected for improvement programs.",

The concentration of total alkaloids was quantified using the oxoaporphine alkaloid liriodenine as reference standard. In addition, the liriodenine concentration was measured and the profile evaluated by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Results have shown that alkaloids are present in all phases and in all tissues, at higher concentrations in roots (up to 100 times). The proportion of total alkaloids and liriodenine was modified in response to the application of plant regulators. Roots doubled the content of alkaloids and liriodenine. In cotyledonary leaves, the amount of total alkaloids decreased; however, liriodenine remained unchanged. Our results have shown that the use of plant growth regulators based on gibberellins and cytokinins modified the production of alkaloids in tissues in a specific way.",

     "abstract": "Juniperus oxycedrus L. (Cupressaceae Bartlett) is widely distributed in countries with a Mediterranean climate. All plant parts contain highly aromatic essential oil (EO) and recently there have been efforts to introduce it as a cultivated crop. The species is known for its large morphological and chemical variation and its debatable taxonomic status. This study aimed to (1) compare content, composition, and antimicrobial activity of J. oxycedrus EO samples from plants growing in Bulgaria and Serbia, and (2) quantify morphological variations of leaves. \u0422he EO content (yield) in dried juniper leaves varied from 0.06% (\u041aopaonik, Serbia) to 0.24% (Markovo, Bulgaria). We identified 51 EO constituents, belonging to monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. The class monoterpenes (monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes) were the predominant compounds, representing 38.6\u201365.4% of the total EO, consisting primarily of \u03b1-pinene, limonene, sabinene, \u03b2-pinene, and \u03b2-myrcene. In addition, \u03b1-pinene was the major oil constituent in plants from all locations. Sesquiterpenes (sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes) were the second largest class of constituents, which represented 19.3% t\u043e 33.6% of the total EO. \u03b3-Elemene was found only in the EO of J. oxycedrus from Bulgaria, while a high concentration of \u03b1-curcumene was found only in samples from Serbia (7.5\u20137.8%). Significant differences in antimicrobial activity of the EO were found in bacterial strains Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. There was no significant difference among the mean leaf width of the six combinations location x sex, and the overall leaf mean width was 1.24\u202fmm. However, there was a significant difference between the mean leaf lengths. In this study, none of the studied populations had a higher concentration of limonene than of \u03b1-pinene, indicating that the flora of the two countries include J. oxycedrus and not the previously reported J. deltoides.

     "abstract": "Polyamines (PAs) are involved in plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses, however, their role in biochemical insect-plant interactions is not clear. Therefore, we compared the involvement of polyamines and key enzymes of their biosynthesis in gall formation process. The present study had used galls on oak leaves caused by asexual generation (\u2640\u2640) of three Cynipidae species, namely Cynips quercusfolii L., Neuroterus numismalis (Fourc.) and N. quercusbaccarum L., as a model. The obtained results indicate that gall formation on oak leaves affected amine content, but intensity of the changes in their levels were strongly dependent on the insect species. Nevertheless the downward trend was dominant among those changes. Changes in the activity of lysine decarboxylase (LDC), tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) usually corresponded with the direction of changes in polyamine contents. Several cases of divergence between changes in amine levels and the rate of their biosynthesis may suggest the involvement of other regulation mechanisms such as: arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) as well as amine oxidases involved in its catabolic pathways. Thus, the future studies on biochemical mechanism of regulation of PAs accumulation during galls formation should be focused on importance of these enzymes.",

This study exogenously overexpressed PtGSTF4 from Populus trichocarpa and its two orthologs from Populus yatungensis and Populus euphratica in Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. To elucidate the function of three GSTF4 proteins in stress response, we compared germination and seedling growth in transgenic Arabidopsis with salt and drought treatments. All three Populus GSTF4 genes overexpressed Arabidopsis showed enhanced resistance to salt stress and drought. GSTF4 transgenic plants accumulated less hydrogen peroxide and more chlorophylls and decreased levels of lipid peroxidation under salt stress and drought comparing to the mock control plants. The difference observed by GSH and GSSG measurements indicated GSTF4 proteins may involve in glutathione-dependent peroxide scavenging which lead to reduced oxidative damage. The Arabidopsis transformed with the GSTF4 gene form P. euphratica showed higher germination rate and different performance of affecting GSSG contents comparing with the other two orthologous GST genes under NaCl treatment. These results suggested three Populus GSTF4 orthologs may have functional divergence in stress responding.

Increased metal accumulation in the soils may trigger competition between toxic metals and essential nutrients for absorption by plants and consequently leads to the development of oxidative stress. Soybean plants have a delicate system of defense mechanisms. We assume that the influence of heavy metals on plant growth as a whole can be traced through a change in the activity of enzymes. We studied the stress-reducing reaction against the toxic effects of copper sulphate and zinc sulphate, identified different endurance classes, and observed differences in the biochemical adaptation i.e. ribonuclease (RNase) activity in the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts. Sulphates of both zinc and copper at maximum permissible concentration and double maximum permissible concentration affected the multiple forms of RNase and its specific activity in the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts (grown for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days). Wild soybean sprouts had higher RNase activity as compared to cultivated soybean sprouts. It is shown that the limits of endurance for wild soybean during intoxication are observed on days 1, 3 and 5, while for cultivated soybean they vary depending on the type of toxicant and its concentration. Sulphates of copper and zinc affect the wild and cultivated soybean sprouts in a time and dose-dependent manner.",

This study focused on previously reported Icelandic Huperzia selago genotypes, and aimed to evaluate the chemotaxonomic value of LAs in resolving them. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), alkaloid fingerprints of H. selago taxa were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA).

Genotype 1 and 3 form distinct groups in a PCA plot, where genotype 2 is an intermediate between the other two genotypes.

The study aimed at in-depth characterization of GOTCABs from root extracts of cultivated Gypsophila scorzonerifolia Ser., G. acutifolia Stev. ex Spreng., G. altissima L., G. pacifica Kom., G. paniculata L., G. oldhamiana Miq. and G. zhegualensis Krasnova using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupol-Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Based on the accurate mass measurements, elemental composition, isotopic peak profiles, fragmentation pattern in tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and literature data, a total of 53 GOTCABs were tentatively identified. In addition, 29 core structures, forming between 2 and 12 isobaric isomers were described. They possess gypsogenin, quillaic and gypsogenic acid as sapogenin, substituted at C-3 with O-\u03b2-d-galactopyranosyl-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f2)-[pentosyl-(1\u202f\u2192\u202f3)]-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranoside (\u03b2-chain). According to the C-28 ester-bonded oligosaccharide (\u03b1-chain) saponins were classified into four groups: GOTCABs with C-28 tetra- and pentasaccharide (type I), GOTCABs with C-28 oligosaccharide substituted with methoxycinnamoyl group (type II), GOTCABs with mono- and diacetylated C-28 oligosaccharide (type III) and GOTCABs with C-28 oligosaccharide substituted with both acetyl and methoxycinamoyl groups (type IV). The possible fragmentation pathways of saponins were proposed. Eleven core structures forming between 2 and 7 isobars are undescribed in the literature. To examine the differences between the assayed Gypsophila species at the same environmental conditions, the variation of saponins was estimated by hierarchical clustering on isobaric fingerprints of GOTCABs. The clustering of the studied species revealed three well-defined clusters. The first cluster comprises G. scorzonerifolia (G1) and G. altissima (G3), characterized by GOTCABs from type III. G. acutifolia (G2) and G. pacifica (G4) formed the second cluster accumulating saponins from types II and III. The third cluster grouped G. paniculata (G5), G. oldhamiana (G6) and G. zhegualensis (G7) sharing GOTCABs from types IV in addition to II and III. This is the first report on the saponins from G. scorzonerifolia and G. zhegualensis. An in-depth depiction of the GOTCAB saponin composition of seven cultivated Gypsophila species was achieved.

The effective ecological restoration of abandoned agricultural fields, especially of highly degraded ecosystems, remains a challenge. Germination is imperative to restore natural ecosystems and to save the environment. Low germination rate is key player to disturb the ecosystem. Cyclobalnopsis gilva is an economically important woody plant, however its germination rate is less than 50% in its natural habitats compared to that of other plants. A comparative proteomics approach was carried out to investigate this feature on germinated and non-germinated seeds of C. gilva. Proteins from seeds of C. gilva were extracted using phenol extraction, separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and identified through matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry. In addition, the results of proteome were verified through the RT-qPCR determination. More than 700 proteins were reproducibly detected. Among 26 proteins with 2-fold changes in abundance, the 24 differential proteins were identified successfully. Many differential proteins were involved in starch metabolism. \u03b2-amylase abundance and mRNA level were both up-regulated in germinated seeds of C. gilva. An important point to provides new insights into the understandings of C. gilva seed germination problems are found through 2-DE and RT-qPCR analyses to save the forest ecology and solve the problem of woody plants with low germination rate all over the world.",

     "abstract": "For more than six decades, bumblebee death, which mainly occurs in August, has been assumed to be associated with intake of presumed toxic nectar from linden trees (Tilia spp.), a hypothesis which has been sustained by observations of a significant number of dead bumblebees under these trees during their flowering season. Several theories exist in current literature to account for these observations. The nectar has been assumed to contain compound(s) toxic to the bumblebees including the monosaccharide mannose, which cannot be metabolized by bumblebees. The presence of toxic compounds such as the alkaloid nicotine or pesticides of anthropogenic origin has also been indicated. However, none of the above suggested compounds have hitherto been properly characterized from the nectar. In the current paper we report on characterization of the composition of nectar of linden trees, under which a significant number of dead bumblebees were observed. The structure determinations were performed by selective 1D TOCSY NMR and extensive applications of 2D NMR spectroscopy. The nectar of the linden flowers was readily available in significant amounts during the entire period when dead bumblebees were observed under these trees. The nectar only contained non-toxic sugars such as \u03b1-glucopyranose, \u03b2-glucopyranose, sucrose, fructose and minor amounts of xylose. The nectar did not contain mannose, nor alkaloids or pesticides. Initial toxicity studies using brine shrimp lethality assay showed that the nectar did not exhibit any toxic effects even at concentrations higher than 1\u202fmg/ml dry weight, providing disproving evidence against the assumption of the nectar's toxic character.",

In particular, we employed the Sporne diagrams to provide information about the evolution of some different Lamiaceae species in relation to their content in secondary metabolites. In more details, fifteen species belonging to six different genera were studied i.e. Ajuga L., Galeopsis L., Melittis L., Sideritis L., Stachys L. and Teucrium L. The selected secondary metabolites were iridoids because of their wide occurrence and distribution within all the family, thus providing a more accurate and general overview. Nineteen different compounds of this class were identified in the studied species. The aim of this work was to verify if the evolutionary data available in literature for the studied species and based on molecular studies, matched with those obtained from a more phytochemical approach or not. The final objective was to ascertain a correspondence between these two opposite methods. The results of this study clearly showed that, only in some cases, this correspondence was present. This may suggest the possibility to use both methods for drawing phylogenetic trees of plants. Anyway, this study is not general and is quite limited in studied species and in collection areas and does not intend to affirm its absolute accuracy even though it may be a good starting point for future researches in this field.",

     "publication date": "12-2018",
     "abstract": "There are numerous chemotaxonomic studies on arthropods, but such are largely missing for millipedes. This appears curious since particularly in millipedes, the major taxa are clearly distinctive by different exocrine products, such as alkaloids (Glomerida), terpenoids (Polyzoniida), phenolics and cyanogens (Polydesmida), and benzoquinones (Juliformia). However, there is low within-taxon variation of the chemicals mentioned which - in almost invariable blends - characterize the particular taxa. The Julida, for instance, one of the three orders of Juliformia, typically produce uniformly composed benzoquinonic secretion profiles across most species, not showing enough heterogeneity for chemotaxonomy.Recently, however, a new class of julid exocrine products, namely complex bends of alkyl esters has been reported. We here tested the chemotaxonomic potential of these compounds by performing a comprehensive study on alkyl esters across the julid tribe Cylindroiulini. Exocrine secretions of 20 species from all five cylindroiuline genera (Allajulus, Cylindroiulus, Enantiulus, Kryphioiulus, Styrioiulus) were analyzed by gas chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry. Apart from typical benzoquinones, 33 alkyl esters and 1 alkenyl ester belonging to hexyl-, octyl-, octenyl- and nonyl-esters with saturated and mono-unsaturated acid moieties ranging from C13 - C18 were detected. Only two species (Cylindroiulus caeruleocinctus and C. luridus) exhibited no esters at all. Ester profiles appeared to be specific, indicating five major chemical groups in cylindroiulines, characterized by specific ester arrangements. We here provide evidence for i) the widespread occurrence of alkyl esters in the Julidae, ii) their high specificity, iii) their intra-species stability, iv) along with sufficient inter-species variability, rendering them promising novel tools for millipede chemotaxonomy.",

     "abstract": "There are two groups of plant species that spread in gypsiferous soils. While gypsophytes only grow on gypsiferous soils, gypsovags can grow on both gypsum and non-gypsum soil. Adaptation of plants to gypsum soils requires biochemical arrangements in addition to proper morphological and physiological characteristics. In this study, three gypsophyte species and on-gypsum and non-gypsum speciments of three gypsovag species were examined for antioxidant capacities. The average phenolic substance contents were 126.5, 30.5 and 37.6\u202f\u03bcg\u202fg\u22121 DW in gypsophile, on-gypsum and in non-gypsum gypsovag species respectively. Gypsophyte, Thymus leucostomus var. gypsaceus species was identified as having seven different phenolic compounds and the highest phenolic substance content. However, phenolic substance compositions of gypsophyte and gypsovag plant species do not have common properties and show specific differences for each species. The total antioxidant capacity and carotenoid levels of gypsophyte were found to be quite high even though there was no significant difference between the chlorophyll values of the plant groups under investigation. Differences in car/chl and aox/chl ratios of gypsophiles and gypsovag species suggest that antioxidant compounds have a role in the adaptation of these plants. On the other hand, the values observed in on-gypsum and non-gypsum gypsovag species should be assessed as having no specific role in the formation of oxidative stress in gypsum soils.",

     "abstract": "Family Boraginaceae has drawn the attention of many botanists for many years because of its systematic position and the presence of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Some researcher used these alkaloids as chemotaxonomic markers at the family and subfamily level in several botanical families. Therefore, this explorative study carried out with an aim to determine the distribution of selected PAs and their chemotaxonomic significance in the tribe Lithospermeae. For this, Lithospermeae species along with other Boraginaceae members from different parts of Pan-Himalayan regions in Pakistan and China were brought to Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. For HPLC fingerprint analysis, dried silica gel aerial parts (500\u202fmg) of twenty-four mature flowering species of Lithospermeae and the available PAs: supinine, heliotrine, lycopsamine, europine, and echimidine were used as chemotaxonomic markers. In the laboratory, the plants of Lithospermeae were investigated for pyrrolizidine alkaloids by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Five pyrrolizidine alkaloids were identified qualitatively in 24 species of tribe Lithospermeae from Pan-Himalaya. The results of the study support the previous research that PAs can be used as a taxonomic marker. The PAs lycopsamine and echimidine were common in all Onosma species except O. sinicum Diels, O. waddellii Duthie, and O. griffithii Vatke. So we proposed that lycopsamine and echimidine can be used as taxonomic markers for Onosma species from Pan-Himalayan regions. In the case of the genus Maharanga, M. emodi (Wall.) A. DC. and M. bicolor (Wall. ex G. Don) A. DC. show the same composition of PAs lycopsamine and echimidine. But these two species could be easily distinguished from each other; heliotrine is present in M. emodi but absent in M. bicolor. Arnebia guttata Bunge was the only species in the genus Arnebia which was detected for only europine. A. benthamii (Wall. ex) G. Don. I.M. Johnst. and A. euchroma (Royle) I.M. Johnst. were similar in PA composition for heliotrine, lycopsamine, and echimidine. These two species can easily be distinguished from each other: europine is present in the former genus but absent in the latter one. Moreover, the result of HPLC fingerprint analysis shows that supinine is distributed throughout all investigated species from the Pan-Himalayan regions except Lithospermum arvense L. So we proposed that supinine could serve as a chemotaxonomic marker in the tribe Lithospermeae.",

     "abstract": "Effective ecological restoration of abandoned agricultural fields, especially highly degraded ecosystems, remains challenge. Germination is imperative to restore natural ecosystems and save the environment. Low germination rate is key player to disturb the ecosystem. During germination, seeds undergo physiological and morphological changes. Starting with imbibition, seeds consume stored food and biosynthesize different proteins. Afterward, radical emergence leads to the seedling establishment. Coordinated activities during seed germination correspond directly with transcription of genes playing crucial roles. Despite the presence of rigid seed coats, up/down-regulation of some genes coding specific proteins require thorough investigation. We have focused topical advancements in transcriptomics with reference to seed germination. Over the years model plant species such as Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana have been analyzed through transcriptomic studies with respect to seed germination. A daunting challenge is to provide detailed transcriptomic profiling of germination process in woody plants. So far there is a shortage of transcriptomics data regarding woody plants. Cyclobalnopsis gilva is a woody plant having very low seed germination and no transcriptomics analysis has been conducted. Omics technology can offer increments to existing information about C. gilva seed germination. The review aims to reveal the involvement of molecular biological mechanisms during seed germination and their effects on ecology. It will be helpful to solve low germination problem of all over the world woody plants to save forest ecology.",

     "abstract": "Floral scent is one of the crucial cues to attract specific groups of insect pollinators in angiosperms. We examined the semiochemical diversity in the interactions between \u201cfruit fly orchids\u201d and their pollinator fruit fly species in two genera, Bactrocera and Zeugodacus (Tephritidae: Diptera). Two known attractants for the Dacini fruit flies, methyl eugenol (ME) and raspberry ketone (RK), have been identified from the Bulbophyllum orchids. Additionally, zingerone (ZN), with a hybrid chemical structure between ME and RK, and attracts both ME- and RK-sensitive fly species, was also identified. Male flies utilize the floral scent as sex pheromone precursor or components to attract conspecific females and gain mating advantage. We analyzed the floral components of two sibling orchids, Bulbophyllum macranthum collected from Southeast-Asian countries and Bu. praetervisum collected from Sabah, Malaysia. For Bu. macranthum, the major floral component from Malaysia and Thailand was identified as ZN; whereas that from the Philippines was ME. For Bu. praetervisum, RK was found as the major constituent, but chemical profiles of the attractants were different among individuals, i.e. in addition to RK, ZN was also found in some of the Bu. praetervisum flowers; and one of the specimens contained ME besides RK and ZN. These differences in fruit fly-attracting floral scents shown by the sympatric chemotypes of Bu. praetervisum are contrary to that shown by the allopatric chemotypes of Bu. macranthum, demonstrating the versatility in the floral synomone biosynthetic processes. Phylogenetic analysis using chloroplast DNA shows that the Malaysia- and Thailand-chemotypes of Bu. macranthum and Bu. praetervisum belong to the same lineage, although their chemical profiles are distinctly different. This demonstrates that diversification of floral synomone may happen even within a putative orchid species in order to attract a wider community of fruit fly pollinators from different genera to maximize pollination success.",

These results indicated that the chloroplast pathway as well as the production of signaling, the ROS-scavenging pathway and the Calvin cycle pathway may collectively mediate adaptation to high altitudes in H. pedunculosum.

Herein, we focused on analyzing the characterization, transcript abundance, and correlation of DOXC-class 2OGDs in safflower with flavonoids for the first time. TBLASTN analysis showed that they were implicated in the biosynthetic pathway of ethylene (DOXC1 and DOXC2), indole-3-acetic acid (DOXC3, DOXC4, and DOXC5), flavonoids (DOXC6, DOXC7, and DOXC8), and scopolamine (DOXC9 and DOXC10).

Coexpression analyses displayed that the transcript level of DOXC1, DOXC2 and DOXC8 was positively correlated with hydroxysafflor yellow A, a major quinochalcone in orange-yellow-flowered safflower line. DOXC3, DOXC4, DOXC5, DOXC7, and DOXC9 displayed a marked positive correlation with kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, a main flavonols in white-flowered safflower line. The response models of DOXC3, DOXC4, DOXC5 and DOXC9 showed amazing similarity in different safflower line, but the correlations with flavonoids were actually quite distinct.

In sum, ten DOXC-class 2OGDs from safflower displayed different sequence features. Simultaneously, their expression pattern in two safflower lines in response to MeJA treatment, as well as their correlation with flavonoids, was different. These results implied the diversification of DOXC-class 2OGDs is partly responsible for the diversity and complexity of specialized metabolites in different phenotypes and chemotypes of safflower lines.",

For this purpose, eleven native chamomile populations were studied concerning the main constituents of the essential oil (a-bisabolol and chamazulene), and a pre-breeding evaluation experiment was initiated, setting up as main target the essential oil composition and agronomical traits. The two most remarkable populations were further assessed, in comparison to five commercial chamomile varieties, through a honeycomb arrangement in the field. The results showed that, the native populations were classified in lower levels concerning morphological and agronomical traits; however they exhibited high stability for the agronomical characteristics evaluated, in comparison with those of the commercial varieties. Furthermore, the essential oil of the selected native germplasm revealed values up to 32.6% for a-bisabolol and 15.3% for chamazulene, approaching or even exceeding the corresponding values of most of the commercial varieties. According to these results it can be concluded that a promising native germplasm can be exploited for further breeding purposes, to produce a new cultivar with medicinally important essential oil composition.",

The poison gland was previously reported as the source of sex pheromone, but the finding that queens and workers exhibited the same ester patterns tends to refute their role in sex attractants, and their biological significance remains elusive. The composition of cuticular hydrocarbons in this species is also highly original as it mostly comprises alkadienes and alkatrienes (70%), which is unusual and may be an adaptation to subterranean life.

The n-hexane extracts of 263 samples, originating from 15 native populations of four P. nigra subspecies (nigra, dalmatica, banatica and pallasiana), were investigated by GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. In all studied populations n-alkanes represent the most abundant compound group, while the contents of diterpenes and alcohols were lower and variable. Multivariate statistical analyses (Canonical Discriminant Analysis and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) suggest existence of two clearly differentiated chemical entities with the basic difference in the content of primary alcohols (especially cis-9-octadecen-1-ol and 1-hexadecanol). The first group (low alcohol content) included all populations of ssp. nigra, ssp. dalmatica and ssp. banatica, as well as the two northernmost populations of ssp. pallasiana from Serbia and Bulgaria, while the second group (high alcohol content) comprised individuals from Greek and Macedonian populations of ssp. pallasiana. According to the recently proposed concept of ancient split of major genetic lineages of P. nigra, both chemical entities detected in this study belong to the same (Balkan Peninsula) genetic group.

Analyses of PCA and HCA applied to the samples of leaf oils presented a quantitative variation in their compositions, attributed to the rainy and dry periods. Also, it was observed a significant influence on the volatile constituents of the oils in the rainy season, depending on the time of collection. Thus, it was confirmed that the seasonal variation in the oil composition from leaves of M. sylvatica should be due to the influence of the climatic parameters, during the plant collection.",

The effect of metal pollution was evaluated using some biochemical markers [glutathione-S-transferase (GST), acetylcolinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione reductase (GR), metallothionein (MT)] in the digestive gland of the mussels. Mussels were collected from four sampling sites of dam lake in the winter and summer of 2016. The metal levels in the mussel samples varied significantly across the sites and seasons (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Fe was the most accumulated metal, followed by Zn, Cu, and As, while Hg was the least accumulated metal. There were significant differences among sites and between seasons for enzyme activities and MT levels (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Although AChE was inhibited in summer at all sites, the lowest level of AChE was determined for the Sitilce site. Our results showed that there were statistical differences for CaE, GR, and GST activities among sites and between seasons. MT levels were statistically higher in summer than in winter at all sites (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The highest MT level was detected at the Sar\u0131su site in summer, while the lowest MT level was detected at Sitilce in winter. According to the results of correlation analysis, we observed strong correlations between MT and some metal concentrations in both winter and summer (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

     "abstract": "Vernonieae species are known to biosynthesize sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids as their main secondary metabolites. Dereplication strategies in natural products research have been widely explored, with benefits highlighted in the identification of secondary metabolites using databases. In this study, the chemical composition of Brazilian Vernonieae species was investigated, aiming to provide more details about the major chemical similarities and differences between subtribes of Vernonieae. An in-house database was built, comprising 651 metabolites previously reported in the literature for Vernonieae. One hundred and ten Vernonieae species, belonging to 10 different subtribes, were analyzed, employing UHPLC-UV-HRMS. The compounds were identified based on their ultraviolet spectra and molecular masses calculated from accurate mass measurements; and supported through the in-house database. Additionally, the fragmentation patterns in the mass spectra were used for structural elucidation and to confirm the peaks assignments. Forty-nine metabolites were identified by this approach including eight hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, 24 flavonoids and 17 sesquiterpene lactones. Thus, Brazilian Vernonieae species were characterized by the presence of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavones, flavonols, flavone C-glycosides, flavonol O-glycosides and sesquiterpene lactones, mainly glaucolides, hirsutinolides and furanoheliangolides. Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were identified in all the investigated subtribes and a great diversity of flavonoids was found especially in Lepidaploinae, Lychnophorinae, Piptocarphinae and Vernoniinae species. Species of subtribes Lepidaploinae and Vernoniinae exhibited glaucolide-type and hirsutinolide-type sesquiterpene lactones, while Lychnophorinae species showed goyazensolide-type and eremantholide-type sesquiterpene lactones. Moreover, subtribes Centratherinae and Pipocarphinae were characterized by the presence of goyazensolides while a chrestanolide was exclusively identified in Chrestinae and Elephantopinae species. Based on their differential distribution in the analyzed subtribes, this study demonstrated the chemotaxonomic significance of sesquiterpene lactones within the tribe Vernonieae.",

All samples were rich in sesquiterpenes, mainly those from cadinene, germacrene and caryophyllene cyclization pathways, including (E)-caryophyllene, \u03b1-copaene, \u03b2-selinene, \u03b1-cadinene, selina-3,7 (11)-diene, germacrene B and caryophyllene oxide. Chemical profiles of N. obscura from different restingas presented high variation in the relative amount of some compounds. Fewer compounds were produced in a semi-arid climate (Massambaba restinga). Comparing samples collected during different seasons in Marambaia restinga, (E)-caryophyllene presented highly variable concentrations. The highest concentration was observed in August, which is the month of least rainfall. In contrast, germacrene B presented the lowest concentration in August. Leaf secretory structures were described using light and scanning microscopy and histochemical tests. The main sites of lipophilic and terpenoid accumulation are located in the secretory cavities of mesophyll. Our data indicate that the production of essential oils and volatiles in N. obscura is influenced by both plant developmental stage and environmental conditions.",

The aim of the present research was to classify Tunisian olive cultivars based on their phenolic profile and to test the potentiality of chemometrics as a tool for cultivars discrimination. The phenolic compounds present in 21 samples of olive leaves, collected during the normal picking period for olive oil production in South Tunisia, were analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Models based on principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used for discrimination purposes as a function of the tree varieties and cultivation zone.Qualitative and quantitative compositional analysis revealed 12 major phenolic compounds among which oleuropein (110.38\u20134741.62\u202fmg/kg), hydroxytyrosol (5.40\u2013290.19\u202fmg/kg), apigenin 7-O-glucoside (9.44\u20132475.53\u202fmg/kg), tyrosol (2.10\u2013174.62\u202fmg/kg), catechin (0\u201337.60\u202fmg/kg) and vanillic acid (3.23\u2013256.57\u202fmg/kg) were identified. Oleuropein showed the highest amount in Fougi cultivar (4741.62\u202fmg/kg), whereas the lowest level was registered in Zarrazi injassi cultivar (110.38\u202fmg/kg). However, Zalmati Zarzis exhibited high concentrations of tyrosol, vanillic and caffeic acid, and vanillin. In general, rutin and luteolin 7-O-glucoside were the two main flavonoids detected.

Regarding to its anatomy, the gall has an homogeneous mesophyll and flavonoids in its outer epidermis compared to an isobilateral mesophyll and epidermal flavonoidic idioblasts observed in the leaf. The increase in the expression of waxes suggests it is a protective function against the desiccation by preventing water evaporation in the structure.

The results showed that the contents of some FAs were quite different between these two populations. Therefore, the FA composition could be used as a potential indicator for the identification of Dai-qu stock and Min-yuedong stock large yellow croakers.

The objective of this study was to profile the alkaloid composition of D. ramosum throughout its geographical distribution using both field and herbarium specimens. Two alkaloid profiles were identified, one that contained significantly greater concentrations of the MSAL-type alkaloids than the other. Plants containing each respective alkaloid profile were unique in their geographical distribution. Populations of these two chemotypes will likely differ in their toxic potential and consequently pose different risks of poisoning when grazed by livestock species.

Based on Shannon diversity index (I), such morphological characters as flower head diameter, ray floret, shape of apex, and main color of ray floret revealed more variability than the other traits. Significant genotypic variations were also observed in essential oil content (ranging from 0.1 to 0.56% (w/w)) and composition. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the essential oil was conducted to identify 47 compounds in which camphor (0\u201344.6%), chrysanthenone (0\u201348.96%), chrysanthenyl acetate (0\u201316.22%), verbenol (0\u201311.78%), (+)-5-epi-neointermedeol (0\u201325.41%), and aromadendrene (0\u201314.98%) were the main constituents. Results of cluster analysis of essential oil compositions divided the cultivars into four groups. Hybridization among cultivars of divergent clusters led to heterotic effects for flower quality and phytochemical characters. The relationships established between the components revealed high correlations of anthocyanin with the two major aroma compounds of verbenol and chrysanthenyl acetate while they also provided a clue to the association between aroma compounds and color pigmentation. Moreover, a correlation was established between chrysanthenone and flower head diameter (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.502). Based on the results obtained, it might be suggested that smaller flowers are capable of accumulating higher amounts of chrysanthenone. Clearly, the associations between morphological traits and essential oil components provide new insights for improved breeding programs in chrysanthemum.",

A total of 36 samples were collected in the Provinces of Salta (El Maray, La Paya, El Sunchal, El Alisal, Chorrillos), Jujuy (Chilcayo, San Roque), Catamarca (Mutquin, Colana) and Tucum\u00e1n (Amaicha del Valle) in Argentina.Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation (Clevenger) of naturally air-dried plant material. Yields ranged from 0.16% to 1.93% (v/w), being the highest those of the collections of Mutquin. More than 65 compounds were identified by CG-FID-MS. Only 19 of these constituents, accounting from 77.3 to 98.9% of the total oil, present in more than 4.0% in at least one sample, were considered as variables for statistical analysis. Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster analysis was conducted, showing at 65% of similarity, five groups. This grouping was in direct accordance to the biosynthetic pathways of main compounds (chemotypes).In the two sites of Jujuy, 21 collections evidenced four different chemotypes, named after the dominant component as follows: thujones, citronellal, carvone, and citral (neral\u00a0+\u00a0geranial). In the populations of Salta and Catamarca, linalool appeared as a new different chemotype.Though cedron is considered as a citral-bearing plant, curiously, in the 36 samples collected in the NW of Argentina, only two samples contained citral as main constituent. On the other hand, a dominance of citronellal and thujones compositions were found in the bulk of the samples collected, while others had very high content of linalool or carvone and its derivatives. Northwestern Argentina has repeatedly been mentioned as the center of biodiversity of this species.The new evidences found on the chemical biodiversity of essential oils of Aloysia citrodora in natural populations in this region, reinforce firmly this idea.",

The J.\u00a0spinosa and D.\u00a0nigropicta mitogenomes both contained 37 genes and the gene order was similar to that in other leafhoppers. All of the protein-coding genes started with ATN. In the J.\u00a0spinosa mitogenome, the nad3, nad4L, and cytb genes used TAG as a stop codon, the atp8 and nad1 genes used TGA, and the cox2 gene used a single T. However, in the D.\u00a0nigropicta mitogenome, three genes used a single T as the stop codon, whereas the nad3 gene used TAG. We predicted the secondary structures of the rRNAs in J.\u00a0spinosa and D.\u00a0nigropicta. The secondary structure of rrnL comprised six domains (domain III is absent in arthropods) with 42 helices and that of rrnS comprised three structural domains with 26 helices. Comparisons of J.\u00a0spinosa and D.\u00a0nigropicta detected some differences in H577 and H673. We determined the structural organization of the control regions in the mitogenomes of leafhoppers, where three types of repeat regions were found in most.

The quantitative variation of flavonoids and rosmarinic acid was found to be relatively consistent from year to year in Z.\u00a0marina during a period of three years. The two species appeared though to have a different flavonoid production in the various seasons at the West coast. While Z.\u00a0marina had the highest content in young leaves in May or June, with a markedly decrease from June to September and the lowest measured content in February, Z.\u00a0noltii had the lowest measured flavonoid content in May/June followed by an increase from June to September and the highest measured content during wintertime in February. The observed seasonal differences may be related to the fact that Z.\u00a0noltii is considered a perennial, thermophilous species, and the increasing flavonoid production during the colder seasons from September to March/April in Norway may serve as a protective function.",

To explore the regulation mechanisms of reed to adapt to nitrogen deficiency, we treated reed seedlings under long-term extremely low nitrogen conditions and profiled the physiological and metabolic features of photosynthesis, metabolism, growth, nutrient balance, and enzyme activities. Unexpectedly, the photosynthesis, biomass and carbon content were still maintained at high levels in reed under N-deficient conditions regardless of the decreased content of chlorophyll and nitrogenous compounds. Using mass spectrometry, we profiled metabolism of 627 metabolites and found the concentrations of lactic acid and galactinol were accumulated under the treatment. The development of underground organs and nutrient accumulation (B, P, Zn and Na) were also enhanced under the condition. Unlike the positive correlation of nitrate reductases and N levels in other plants, we found the catalytic activities of nitrate reductases were dramatically elevated in roots under the N-deficient condition, which may increase the intracellular NO3\u2212 and NH4+ levels. Our experiments characterized the unique features of reed under extreme nitrogen deficiency conditions and also provided valuable information for other corps to develop the cultivars with high yield under low nitrogen input.",

The taxonomy of this group remains controversial as there are several unresolved issues.In the present study, we aimed to resolve the taxonomic uncertainty of the Anatolian mountain frogs through two mitochondrial genes (CYTB, 481 bp and COI, 743 bp) and two protein-coding nuclear genes (POMC, 401 bp and RAG1, 717 bp). The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers were found to be highly polymorphic in this group. Haplotype network analysis revealed that R.\u00a0tavasensis was different for at least 33 and 52 mutational steps according to CYTB and COI gene regions, respectively. High bootstrap and posterior probability values obtained from the mtDNA genes support the idea that Anatolian mountain frogs are represented by two distinct species in Anatolia: R.\u00a0macrocnemis and R.\u00a0tavasensis. However, no genetic variation was detected according to nuclear DNA (nDNA) markers.The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed no differences among the groups of R.\u00a0macrocnemis, R.\u00a0camerani, and R.\u00a0holtzi.

The percentage of AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) polymorphic fragments was 78.2%, indicating high genetic diversity. To evaluate the genome methylation level and methylation polymorphism, we used the MSAP (methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism) technique to analyze the 30 C. nankingense lines. The total DNA methylation level ranged from 54.6% to 62.6%. Most of the MSAP-methylated fragments (97%) were polymorphic in the lines. The U-values associated with hemi-methylation were larger than those associated with full methylation in four of the 30 lines, and six individual values were statistically significant (U\u00a0>\u00a01.96). The high genomic diversity as well as the high methylation polymorphism may be responsible for the morphological polymorphism.

In Bavaria it can be found, therefore, only in four geographic regions, which are Franconia, the Franconian-Swabian Jura, the prealpine transitions region and the prealpine moraine belt with the Alps. In German forestry, provenance delineations are used since 1987. Similarly for herbs seed provenances and production areas are applied in commercial seed production and restoration. In this study we analyzed whether the genetic variation of H. nobilis reflects the geographic distribution of the species in Bavaria or the provenance delineations used for seed production.We applied AFLPs to study genetic variation within and between 24 populations of H. nobilis.Our analysis revealed high levels of genetic variation within and moderate variation between populations. Variation between seed production areas and seed provenances was low and comparable to the variation between geographic regions. Genetic variation within populations or rare fragments did not differ between production areas, provenances or geographic regions. A significant positive relation of genetic and geographic distances was present within 100\u00a0km.Pollination and seed dispersal seem mainly to happen within populations of the myrmecochorous H. nobilis, whereas long-distance dispersal is presumably occasional and random. Our study supports the relevance of dispersal traits for seed collections used in conservation. The protection of historically old beech and oak forests is exceedingly important to preserve the genetic variation of H. nobilis in Bavaria.",

At the species level, A. davidii has a slightly higher genetic diversity (mean observed heterozygosity, HO\u00a0=\u00a00.180) than A. morrisonense (HO\u00a0=\u00a00.119). AMOVA showed that most of the variations in A. davidii occurred among individuals within populations and within individuals.

PCoA showed that A. davidii and A. morrisonense were significantly divided into two genetic groups. In addition, asymmetrical weaker gene flow was detected among the two forest tree species.

Floral scent was collected from the inflorescences/plants of eight flowering populations of G. bohemica and three populations of G. germanica using dynamic headspace methods, followed by GC/MS analyses. Both species emitted several aromatic and terpenoid compounds and multivariate analyses revealed differences in scent between the two species and within species among G. bohemica populations. Volatile components overlapped as expected for closely related species but floral scent was taxon-specific. Floral scent differentiation among G. bohemica populations was in high congruence with the genetic differentiation suggesting that scent differences among populations have a genetic basis and showing that scent is a suitable chemotaxonomic marker in this species.",

From a total 641 individual parasitoids, seven distinct haplotypes containing a total of 32 polymorphic sites were observed from cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences along with five distinct haplotypes containing a total 16 polymorphic sites from 16S rDNA sequences. Values obtained through pairwise FST comparisons and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated significant genetic differentiation among D. longicaudata populations in Thailand. Congruent relationships showing separation of these populations into three groups were obtained from Neighbor joining and Bayesian phylogenetic tree analyses along with the use of haplotype networks. This SSCP analysis of populations of the D. longicaudata species complex is the first report using molecular population genetic methods to analyze the structure of this parasitoid species in Thailand. This may provide useful information for release of parasitoid strains to maximize their benefit in biological control programs.",

The results displayed a high genetic diversity, and the nucleotide diversity of the 16S rRNA gene was higher than that of the ITS sequence. The phylogenetic analyses grouped the four populations into two cryptic species (Bc-JT and Bc-FL) with strong support. The two cryptic species were found in lakes with different trophic levels, demonstrating significant ecological specialization. The origins of clone TW12 were not consistent in the phylogenetic trees between two genetic markers, which might be attributed to the effects of male-mediated gene flow on the phylogenetic relationships of rotifers. The nucleotide diversity of the cryptic species Bc-JT was higher than that of Bc-FL, indicating that eutrophication might decrease the genetic diversity of cryptic species. The total phosphorus concentration in water bodies might be the most important factor affecting the genetic diversity of species.",

The results of the genetic analyses performed were consistent with these results. However, Bayesian analysis revealed the possible presence of a fourth species, which could not be discriminated by classical taxonomy. Caranx crysos possibly comprises two different species. Other population indexes, such as unique alleles, degree of structuring and genetic identity, also pointed to different species. Therefore, based on evidences from classical taxonomy, geometric morphometric analyses together with genetic data from allozymes molecular markers it is possible to support that at least four different Carangidae species are present in fish landings from Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, whereas fish capture records for the same location have recorded only two species.

The results showed that the 100 selected accessions did not exactly follow the geographical distribution. These results were further confirmed by the phylogeny inferred from five morphological characteristics (i.e., leaf shape, leaf area, plant shape, seed area, and 100-seed weight). Together, the genetic and morphological evaluations suggested conclusively that the selected population did not follow the geographical distribution pattern.

Therefore, in the present study, we clarified the phylogenetic relationships in the genus Meles around its distribution boundaries, based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosomal genes. From 71 badgers examined, 29 mtDNA haplotypes were identified, including new 26 types. Multiple haplotypes of SRY and CAN-SINEs were identified from 23 males, including two new haplotypes of SRY. The mtDNA phylogeny showed that the Ural Mountains were not a current distribution boundary between M. meles and M. leucurus. In addition, our results supported the hypothesis that the Bosphorus Strait is a geographical barrier between M. meles and M. canescens. The badgers from Bulgaria north of the Bosphorus Strait shared haplotypes with M. meles.

Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences were analyzed for molecular authentication of seahorses in this study. Many single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were detected among COI sequences of nine seahorse species. Based on the SNP sites, four pairs of modified specific primers were designed respectively for authentication of Hippocampus kuda, Hippocampus japonicus, Hippocampus trimaculatus and Hippocampus kelloggi using allele-specific PCR. Moreover, a multiplex allele-specific PCR for simultaneous authentication of H. kuda, H. japonicus and H. trimaculatus was also developed. The study showed that allele-specific PCR required no sequencing and electrophoresis, and the only necessity is to add fluorochrome into PCR products. Hence the whole authentication procedure only takes about 1.5\u00a0h. This work provides an effective method for rapid and reliable identification of seahorse species.",

A rearrangement in the IQM gene cluster, an unusual elongation in rrnS gene and supposedly functional tandem repeat sequences in the A+T-rich region are synapomorphies of Cephini. Mitogenome evolution of the Cephini was investigated in a dataset of seven species representing all genera. The noticeably divergent mitogenomes of the Cephini both at nucleotide and amino acid level, and the variable rates of \u03c9 values, indicate the effects of different selective forces, rather than neutral evolution. The effect of positive selection is revealed by radical amino acid changes with ten physicochemical properties (P\u03b1, Br, pK\u2032, h, El, Hnc, \u03b1c, \u03b1n, Ra and Hp) throughout each branch of the tree. The radical changes in the ND and ATP complexes are mostly related to chemical and energetic properties due to different energy requirements among species.

Although the chemical data of all families were obtained, the data of Brassicaceae, Capparaceae, and Cleomaceae were the most studied.

In Brassicales, the predominantly allyl glucosinolates are usually found in Brassicaceae, Capparaceae, and Cleomaceae families.

By using multiple sequence alignment, a novel motif, WRKYGQR, was identified from StWRKY076 along with three variations of the WRKYGQK heptapeptide (WRKYGMK, WHKCGQK, and WRKYGKK) that might execute new biological functions. Chromosomal location analysis showed that the 82 StWRKY proteins were located in 11 of the 12 chromosomes, excluding chromosome 11. Phylogenetic analyses also showed that the 82 StWRKY proteins could be clustered into three large groups and five subgroups which shared typical characters of WRKY. The results provide fundamental information to inform further analysis and understanding of WRKY gene functions in potato.",

     "abstract": "We performed a phylogenetic estimation of the family Mytilidae in the East China Sea based on nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes and two mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S RNA). Analysis of five mytilid species based on each of the three genes resulted in mostly congruent trees, although there were some discrepancies in the classification of these species. We combine the results obtained from the three separate analyses to provide a phylogenetic estimation of Mytilidae. We found that the Mytilidae was divided into two major lineages: in one clade, Mytilus galloprovincialis was grouped with Mytilus coruscus; in the second clade, Septifer bilocularis was placed at the basal position in an individual clade, and Perna viridis and Musculista senhousia were recovered as a monophyletic group. Although these finding provide important insights into the taxonomic relationships among the Mytilidae, many aspects of Mytilidae phylogeny remain unresolved. Further analysis based on more molecular information and extensive taxon sampling is necessary to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages within the Mytilidae.",

Recently, the existence of severe blooms attributable to a single Cochlodinium Sch\u00fctt species has been questioned by many researchers. Herein we investigated the dinoflagellate composition of harmful algal blooms (HABs) attributed to C. polykrikoides in Korean coastal waters at nine different stations (St.). The component species of Cochlodinium blooms were examined by using microscopic and gene-cloning methods. In the nine study areas, C. polykrikoides was the predominant species of HABs in St. 2, 4, 7, and St. 9. Based on the morphological identification, the bloom was initially thought to be caused only by C. polykrikoides; however, we detected additional bloom-forming dinoflagellates (Polykrikos schwartzii B\u00fctschli and Polykrikos kofoidii Chatton), and diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia americana (Hasle) Fryxell) along with C. polykrikoides. The parasitic dinoflagellates Amoebophrya Koeppen and Euduboscquella Coats, Bachvaroff & Delwiche were found to be co-located with Cochlodinium in our study, and for the first time, Cochlodinium fulvescens Iwataki, Kawami & Matsuoka was detected in Korea (west coast). These results suggest co-existence of multiple dinoflagellates in bloom populations of Cochlodinium and describe the composition of other dinoflagellate blooms (e.g., Polykrikos spp.) in Korean coastal regions. This co-occurrence may be considered during efforts to monitor and control HABs.",

Also, we discuss the role of food availability (type of phytoplankton assemblage) in relation to autotrophic carbon significance and in the establishment of FA profiles of octocorals from the West and East coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.

Twelve morphological characters were measured in 542 individuals to perform the comparative analysis. Among these characters, only the caudal peduncle length (LCP) revealed significant difference (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) among these four species.

A total of 186 COI fragments for the five loaches investigated were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that interspecific K2P distance was much higher than intraspecific distance within the five species.

In addition, we analyzed molecular phylogeography of the Bulgarian population of the marbled polecat, using cytochrome b and control region sequences of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The phylogenetic tree of cytochrome b indicated that the haplotypes of the Bulgarian population comprised two haplogroups, which were the most ancestral clades. Additionally, the control region phylogeny showed that the haplotypes of Bulgaria formed two haplogroups: one was the most ancestral clade, and the other was the derivative clade. One individual with the most ancestral cytochrome b clade had a control region haplotype of the derivative clade.

We determined the complete mtDNA of Japanese sparrowhawk, and estimated phylogenetic trees based on the complete mtDNA alignment of it and 36 other raptor species, to clarify raptor phylogenetics. Phylogenetic trees were also estimated using a multiple sequence alignment of 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA from 81 typical species in GenBank, to further clarify the phylogenetic relationships of several groups among the raptors. The new mtDNA is a circular molecule, 17\u00a0917\u00a0bp in length, containing the 37 typical genes, with a pseudo-control region. ATG is generally the start codon, TAA is the most frequent stop codon. All tRNAs can be folded into canonical cloverleaf secondary structures except for tRNASer (AGY) and tRNALeu (CUN), which are missing the \u201cDHU\u201d arm. Phylogenetic relationships demonstrate that raptors can be divided into four branches: Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes and Caprimulgiformes in this study. We suggest that Accipitriformes should to be an independent order, Accipitriformes. The results also indicate that Accipitriformes contains three clades: Accipitridae, Pandionidae and Sagittariidae. Strigiformes includes species from Tytonidae and Strigidae. Caprimulgiformes contains Aegothelidae and Caprimulgidae.",

Therefore, species-specific genetic markers are needed for species identification among them. In this study, a total of 991 SSR primer pairs were identified in 8923 SSR-containing sequences (transcripts >1\u00a0kb) by RNA-Seq. Then, 566 loci were randomly selected for primer synthesis and 394 of which were successfully amplified in S. chuatsi. All the non-polymorphic loci (308) were evaluated among three Siniperca species, and 18 species-specific microsatellite markers were finally validated among three Siniperca species. These species-specific microsatellite markers would not only easily discriminate these three Siniperca species at juvenile stage, but also effectively monitor the statuses of hybridization and introgression for germplasm resources protection.",

The growing herbal market has led to the introduction of adulterants, and difficulties in morphological based discrimination has also resulted in concerns over consumer safety. ITS2 as a potential barcode was employed to discriminate officinal rhubarb sampled from the entire distribution range and its adulterants. The minimum K2P interspecific distance between officinal rhubarb source plants and the adulterants were higher than the maximum K2P intraspecific distance within the officinal rhubarb source plants. When the phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods, all Rheum species were grouped into one clade, while Polygonum and Rumex species were clustered in another clade. In the Rheum clade, all the officinal rhubarb source plants constituted a distinct subclade, while other Rheum species formed other subclades.

The remaining two native species in the genus Trigonostigma, T. heteromorpha and T. espei were also identified using Boraras urophthalmoides as an outgroup species. The 707-bp fragments were successfully amplified and sequenced in all fifteen fish samples. In the genus Trigonostigma, the genetic distance within and between species ranged from 0.000 to 0.005 and 0.016 to 0.039, respectively.

Here C. gigas in Japan was investigated using mtDNA and microsatellite markers to elucidate its genetic structure and phylogeny.

The pattern of MtDNA diversity suggested that C. gigas had experienced population expansion about 112 Kya, prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM), which accorded well with other marine organisms. For microsatellites, a Bayesian-based assignment test demonstrated that C. gigas is nearly panmictic. However, on the basis of estimates of FST, Kumano populations differed significantly from other populations, a recent occurrence based on low RST. Irrespective of geographical distance, genetic similarity was observed in the main aquaculture regions with large-scale transportation of cultured spat. Unlike in the Yellow Sea, a genetic bottleneck was not detected in Japanese populations.

The results indicated that the A genome of tetraploid wheat originated from T. urartu rather than T. monococcum, and Aegilops speltoides was the donor of the B and G genomes. Hulled tetraploid wheat accessions formed a subclade, and naked tetraploid wheat got other subclade, indicating that at least two intermediary subspecies were involved in the evolution of T. turgidum.

This is a bird-dispersed species, and studies targeting species with this seed dispersal syndrome are scarce. First, we performed a careful screening of cpDNA markers to identify regions suitable for intraspecific genetic studies, and then we investigated the diversity and genetic structure in ten populations of B. coccolobifolia. The cpDNA regions selected (trnS-trnG and trnH-trnK) revealed considerable divergence among populations and a striking geographical structure, separating populations in two groups, east and west. Although seed dispersal by birds is expected to reach long distances, our results strongly corroborate studies targeting trees with limited seed dispersal. This suggests that historical fragmentation of Cerrado (possibly during cold and dry periods of the Quaternary) might have limited long distance dispersal events after climate amelioration even in bird-dispersed species, especially while Cerrado was expanding but still fragmented.",

All populations present high genetic diversity (mean: He\u00a0=\u00a00.23, P\u00a0=\u00a099%), with significant differences between the Raudales and Rancho Guadalupe localities. The AMOVA analysis revealed a significant population structure (14.5% variation among populations), consistent with the gene differentiation coefficient (GST\u00a0=\u00a00.21), and spatial analysis of population structure. Our results suggested that the original introduced population did not suffer a loss of genetic diversity during establishment on the island, possibly a result of different biological conditions. Population structure analysis leads us to suggest that one island population is similar to the original genetic profile, whereas the genotypic profile of the other island population reflects recent introductions from the mainland. We identified a potential risk of extinction for one local mainland population, suggesting that this species may be a successful invader in a new environment but endangered in some parts of its natural area.",

The data confirmed that the existence of hybrids originated from the interbreeding between R. delavayi and R. irroratum in Baili Rhododendron Nature Reserve. R. decorum did not appear to be involved in the hybridization.

In the present study, the complete mitochondrial genome of Picumnus innominatus was determined and described, which was the first complete mitogenome reported in the Picumnus. The circular mitogenome of P. innominatus was 17,180 bp in size and consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNA genes, a control region (CR), and a noncoding region. The gene order and arrangement of the P. innominatus mitogenome were identical to other mitogenomes of the Picidae. Moreover, strikingly large tandem repeats were found in the noncoding region of the P. innominatus mitogenome, which have not yet been covered in other picid species to date. At the family level (Picidae), the highest dN/dS ratio was detected for the ND1 gene (1.38726) among 13 PCGs, indicating that positive selection was powerful for this gene.

Genetic and genotypic diversity analyses were performed for 37 populations of E. annuus based on inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms. In total, 684 plants were analyzed; 342 were from stable habitats and 342 were from disturbed habitats. The genetic differences among the populations from the different habitats were studied using a Bayesian cluster analysis and an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and by calculating the genetic and genotypic diversity parameters. A germination test using the juglone index was employed to examine the potential allelopathic properties of the plants from the different habitats. Bayesian cluster analysis, AMOVA and allelopathic effects evaluation revealed differences in the allelopathic potential and genetic structure of the E. annuus populations from the disturbed and stable habitats.

In order to identify the adaptations to salt stress that are common to each type of these poplars, we compared transcriptome changes in the four poplar species after exposure to continuous salt stress. We identified 7822 1:1 orthologs between the four species and 702 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the 48\u00a0h time course. The result of hierarchical clustering suggested that the patterns of gene expression were significantly different between the two types of poplar.

Among these DEGs, in which the functions related to responses to salt exposure are significantly over-represented, 11 genes were found to be continuously up or down-regulated in response to salt stress in the two types. We also found that most of the orthologous candidate genes evolved under purifying selection and one ortholog (GDSL) showed positive selection. These genes probably played important roles when their ancestral clade underwent adaptive divergence into the two types, differentiated by habitat salt-content.",

Here we assessed the phylogenetic relationships and genetic variation of Eurasia badgers using partial mitochondrial fragments to elucidate the evolutionary history and taxonomic status of badgers from the Korean Peninsula. Forty-eight unique haplotypes from 125 individuals were observed. Phylogenetic reconstructions and reduced median networks indicate that Eurasian badgers consisted of four geographic clades (Japan, Eastern Eurasia, Western Eurasia, and Caucasus) with a relatively weak split observed within Eastern Eurasia. Estimated divergence time between the Japanese and Eastern Eurasian clades, including the Korean population, was 467,100 years (69,200\u20131,085,500 years). The results of this study support the hypothesis that the Japanese badger migrated from the Eurasian continent over the Korea-Japan land bridge and that the Korean Peninsula was an important refugia during the Pleistocene. Our study confirmed that the South Korean badger, Meles meles, belongs to the Eastern Eurasian clade.

Researches have shown the relevant role that chemical communication plays in lizards. However, the knowledge about the female scents is scarce. The aim of this paper is to characterize, by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the lipophilic fraction of precloacal gland secretions of adult males and females of the lizard Liolaemus wiegmannii and evaluate intersexual differences in composition and proportion of their chemical profiles. We identified 48 and 41 lipohilic compounds in males and females, respectively. The main compounds were steroids and waxy esters. We also found squalene, alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Overall, we found significant differences between sexes with respect to the relative proportions of compounds. We also found differences in proportions of three of the five predominant compounds shared by both sexes (squalene, cholesta-3,5-dien and cholesta-2,4-dien). Our study describes that females of L. wiegmannii hold lipids in their precloacal secretions, which are further clearly different from those of males. Further researches are needed to understand the ecological implications of these sexual differences in precloacal secretion of L. wiegmannii.",

Haplotype analyses revealed a lack of gene flow between A. mangal populations in Peninsular Malaysia and those in Singapore. Populations of A. dang showed isolation-by-distance throughout the range of the species from Laos to Singapore.

We estimated the genetic diversity of R. tanguticum using the cpDNA trnL-F region for 95 individuals from nine populations. The results demonstrated high genetic diversity in this species (Ht\u00a0=\u00a00.632), primarily due to variation among populations (68.4%, GST\u00a0=\u00a00.6839), as opposed to variation within populations (31.6%, Hs\u00a0=\u00a00.2).

The reason for high genetic differentiation among populations might be due to the geography of the alpine environment of the region and human activity.

To understand the genetic diversity and structure of S. glabra, eleven natural populations from four areas of Hainan Island in China were analyzed by inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Thirteen primers were screened out and used to amplify 157 DNA samples. A total of 122 bands were obtained, among which 114 (93.4%) bands were polymorphic. Genetic parameters including average number of effective alleles (1.547), Nei's gene diversity (0.321), Shannon's information index (0.482), and gene differentiation coefficient (0.1944) revealed a high level of genetic diversity maintained in S. glabra populations. The variation within populations accounted for 85.6% of total variation based on analysis of molecular variance. Genetic distance analysis showed that 11 populations could be divided into three groups and populations from the same areas were classified as one group, suggesting that high genetic diversity of S. glabra was attributable to geographic isolation. Together, introduction of germplasm from distant natural distribution areas would be a sound strategy for germplasm resource conservation of S. glabra and selection of elite individuals from populations of far relationship for hybridization is of great importance for breeding improvement programs in future.",

We examined the berries in different phases of the biological cycle for 1 year (at six ripening stages). Hydrodistilled essential oils from the fresh berries were analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013flame ionization detection (GC-FID), gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and principal component analysis (PCA). A total of 90 components were detected, and remarkable qualitative and quantitative differences were observed in the chemical components during the ripening stages, from the green unripe berries to the bluish-black berries harvested at full maturity. The essential oils were an \u03b1-pinene (13.43\u201332.34%) chemotype. The monoterpene hydrocarbons decreased during the ripening with a progressive increase in sesquiterpenes such as germacrene D (12.29\u201317.59%) and \u03b2-caryophyllene (7.71\u20138.51%), which are the major components in ripe berry essential oils.

The complete sequence was 16,273\u00a0bp long, including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and 1 major noncoding region. The base composition and codon usage were described. The putative origin of replication for the light strand (OL) of P. roborovskii was approximately 45\u00a0bp long and was highly conserved in the stem-loop and adjacent sequences, but the starting sequence of replication varied between genera among Rodentia. We analyzed the three domains of the D-loop region, and the results indicated that the central domain had higher G\u00a0+\u00a0C content and lower A\u00a0+\u00a0T content than two peripheral domains. Phylogenetic analyses indicated high resolution in four main divergent clades using mitogenomes data within Cricetidae. Within Cricetinae clade, P. roborovskii was at basal position which was in line with previous researches, and it shared a common ancestor with other extant hamsters.

The present study revealed that combination of morphological, micro-morphological and ISSR data can delimit the species. We did not encounter any intermediate forms throughout the studied area. AMOVA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed that the species of this section are genetically differentiated but have some degree of shared common alleles. Reticulation analysis by T-REX also showed some degree of gene flow for Cp-DNA. This low degree of genetic and morphological variability in Cousinia, can help the species to cope with environmental variability they face.",

Methanolic extracts of non-galled and galled tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Differences in the secondary metabolite profiles, and their relation with plant responses to gall development were evidenced. Transverse sections of non-galled host organs and galls were done, and observed under light and scanning electron microscopies. One stem gall (conical) and one leaf gall (globoid) morphotypes were identified. The globoid and conical galls have dense trichomes, large nymphal chambers, and develop mainly by tissue hyperplasia. The chemical profiles of stems, leaves and galls are distinct, except for the concomitant detection of pyrogallol in galls. The highest abundance of terpenes and phenols in gall tissues were identified, and two triterpenes were firstly reported for the non-galled tissues of S. polygamus. Host plant tissues are highly responsive to the Psyllidae stimuli toward the over development of a phenolic-rich parenchyma, which ends up favouring the Callophya sp. establishment and gall development.",

The genetic distance FST (0.993\u20131.000) based on the ITS suggested a significant genetic divergence between the northern and southern populations. Limited dispersal ability, occurrence of a large geographic gap of the species\u2019 distribution range, and the isolation effects of marginal seas along China\u2019s coastline during the Pleistocene glaciations, may be the main reasons for this divergence.

However, the wild swamp eel is facing the serious challenge of declining population and germplasm degeneration because most of farming swamp eel fingerlings was collected by fishing wild individuals. In this study, the genetic variation of Monopterus albus in six dominant farming regions was investigated based on the mitochondrial DNA D-Loop of 1008\u00a0bp in length. 180 individuals from 6 populations were examined and 74 haplotypes were observed. The overall genetic diversity was abundant and which its SD population was highest but CQ population was lowest. There was obvious genetic differentiation among investigated populations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these individuals were divided into four distinct genetic clades, clade A, B, C, and D. Clade A should be the most common ancestor clade. AH and CQ populations might originate from one single ancestor in maternal clade A. Clade C should be a native important clade in China. Though the genetic diversity did not suffered obvious decreasing, it is still imperative to take effective conservation measurements and establish an efficient selective breeding program.",

In total, 444 specimens belonging to seven Opsariichthys species were collected from 43 populations.

The results of a statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis suggested that the ancestral populations of the genus Opsariichthys were widely distributed over East Asia before diversification.

The complete DNA is 17,009\u00a0bp in length and contained 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes and a long putative control region. The gene organization and nucleotide composition are identical to those of other Bramidae fishes. In contrast, the 12S rRNA gene contains a big poly C structure which is larger than those from other Bramidae species. Of 37 genes, twenty-eight are encoded by heavy strand, while nine are encoded by light strand. Among the 13 protein-coding genes, twelve employ ATG as start codon, while only one (COI) utilizes GTG as start codon. The terminal associated sequence (TAS), the central and conserved sequence block (CSB-E and CSB-D) and a variable domain (CSB-1, CSB-2 and CSB-3) are identified in the control region, while the typical central conserved CSB-F is not detected.

Presumptive molecular structures are proposed for all these molecules. A higher diversity of saponins is found in the body wall (12) than in the Cuvierian tubules (8). In addition to this qualitative difference, saponins were also 2\u20133 fold more concentrated in the Cuvierian tubules than in the integument.

The \u03b413C values of POM and phytoplankton indicated that Particulate Organic Matter (POM) is of terrestrial origin in LQ and phytoplankton origin in LT. The different signature of \u03b415N of phytoplankton and POM also showed the different extent of anthropogenic impacts on the two lakes, with higher impacts in LT than in LQ. In LQ the trophic levels of silver and bighead carps were significantly different (2.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 and 2.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19, respectively), while in LT the difference was not significant (2.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.54 and 2.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38, respectively). Using a mixing model, we found that silver and bighead carps consumed a major proportion on phytoplankton and/or POM in both lakes with higher contribution of phytoplankton in more eutrophic lake. Silver and bighead carps had clear differentiation in food resources with silver carp more on POM and bighead more on zooplankton in deep and mesotrophic lakes.

The aims of this study were to investigate whether secondary metabolites of Vernonia polyanthes and Tithonia diversifolia are metabolized, excreted intact and/or sequestered during the larval stage of C. lacinia and if they affect feeding behavior or performance. The HPLC-DAD-MS analyses of plants and C. lacinia extracts led to the identification of 25 compounds. Larvae fed with T. diversifolia developed until the 4th instar completing metamorphosis into the adult phase, while larvae fed with V. polyanthes developed only until the 2nd instar. In addition, the larvae in the 3rd and 4th instars fed with T. diversifolia accumulated secondary metabolites taken from these leaves. On the other hand, larvae in the 2nd instar showed an accumulation of apigenin-7-O-glycuronyl and hydroxylated 3-O-E-caffeoylquinic acid when fed with V. polyanthes. The latter compound was probably produced after oxidation of the 3-O-E-caffeoylquinic acid by the phase I metabolism of larvae. Therefore, C. lacinia may have developed tolerance to deterrent compounds produced by T. diversifolia, while some compounds present in V. polyanthes may have been the cause for deficient development and the death of larvae.",

In the present study, 54 species representing 11 genera of Salicaceae sensu lato (now including the genera of Flacourtiaceae) were studied using a combined rbcL and matK gene sequence dataset with a total length of 2134 bp, to explore the closest genera that are relatives of Populus-Salix and to determine the relationships between Populus and Salix. The resulting phylogenetic trees showed high resolution in each of the main clades. The results confirmed that (1) Idesia and Bennettiodendron are the closest relatives to Populus-Salix, followed by Poliothyrsis, and (2) Populus and Salix are a truly monophyletic lineage in which the most recent ancestor is shared by the two genera. This finding is significant for a wide variety of evolutionary studies and for understanding the classification and biosystematics of Salicaceae.",

     "abstract": "In order to explore the effect of different dam structures on the genetic diversity of freshwater fish, the genetic diversity of Sinibrama macrops in Min River was investigated using mitochondrial control region (D-loop) sequences. Populations of S. macrops at Jianyang and Shaowu rivers were separated from the rest of the system by low dams and the population at Gutian was isolated from the rest of the river by a high dam. The haplotype diversity in the samples analyzed varied from 0.577 to 0.933 and nucleotide diversity varied from 0.0031 to 0.00441. The lowest values of haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were obtained from Gutian. Indices of genetic differentiation between populations, gene flow, analysis of molecular variance and net genetic distance between populations showed widespread gene exchange among different populations, with the exception of Gutian and Yongtai. These results may be associated with the isolation of Gutian by the high dam. The result of neutrality test and mismatch distributions showed that the evolutionary history of Gutian population was different from others in the river system. Our results imply that high dams have a larger effect on S. macrops, leading to reduction of genetic diversity and genetic differentiation from other populations.",

Species of Terminalia in India belong to four sections and species identification within the sections is considered to be complex due to the lack of sufficient taxonomical characters and the existence of morphotypes. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of three chloroplast DNA barcodes (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) and a nuclear DNA barcode (ITS2) for the discrimination of Terminalia species. A reference DNA barcode library consisting of 120 DNA barcodes from ten species of Terminalia was created. Intra-specific divergence was not observed among the accessions for any marker. Inter-specific divergence was highest in trnH-psbA (10.6%), followed by ITS2, matK and rbcL markers. The success of species differentiation by DNA barcodes was 100% with trnH-psbA, 80% with matK and ITS2, and 10% with rbcL. In the phylogenetic trees, the rbcL marker did not differentiate the species in any section. Two species from the section Catappa were not differentiated by matK and ITS2 markers. Only trnH-psbA resolved all the species and ranked the best among four markers for species identification.

The inbreeding coefficient (Fis) at the MHC region was lower than previous measurements, which may have reflected different sampling strategies. However, R. roxellana has relatively high diversity in MHC genes, even though it has probably experienced serious past population bottlenecks and reduced gene flow between populations.

However, little is known at the genetic level about how secondary metabolites are biosynthesized in this plant. Thus, transcriptome sequencing of G. jasminoides fruit at two developmental stages was performed using the Illumina sequencing platform. A total of 55,376,454 clean reads were obtained. Assembly of the clean reads resulted in 100,889 transcripts, including 51,908 unigenes. Of these, 23,361 (45.0%) were unigenes with significant similarities to publicly available plant protein sequences, and 6225 unigenes were mapped to 246 KEGG pathways. There were 1757 differentially expressed unigenes between the two developmental fruit stages, including 902 up-regulated and 855 down-regulated unigenes. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that 29 unigenes were predicted for the biosynthesis of carotenoids, with 10 genes differentially expressed between the two fruit stages. The globally sequenced genes covered a considerable proportion of the G. jasminoides transcriptome, and these data provide a valuable resource for genetic and genomic studies on secondary metabolite synthesis in G. jasminoides.",

Under our search criteria, the total numbers of 1\u20136\u00a0bp perfect microsatellites detected ranged from 90,346 to 282,728 and covered from 0.13 to 0.49% in the complete genomes of the six bird species.

However, there is was a little difference in the most common repeat motifs for each length among the six different bird species considered, with obvious relation to the AT-richness of their genomes. The distribution of SSRs in the different genomic regions of three bird genomes (G. gallus, M. meleagris, and T. guttata) indicated that the intergenic regions exhibited the highest relative abundance compared to the intron and exon regions in all the six motif lengths. In the genome of G. gallus, the motif of (AGGA)n made up the most iterated microsatellite locus (spanning 108 repetitions) and 83.6% of these most abundant SSR motifs had a repeat number less than 12. What\u2019s more, the number of microsatellites in different chromosomes was positively correlated with the size of the chromosomes in the genome of G. gallus.",

In the Iberian Peninsula, most natural fleshy fruits are red, purple or black, although there do exist a few plants that naturally present white fruit, such as Corema album (L.) D.Don (Ericaceae). This is a wild shrub of Atlantic coastal areas, which presents white fleshy fruit that ripens throughout the summer. We analysed the reflectance of fully ripened fruit in the field, and laboratory (before and after hexane washing and pericarp removal). The aqueous and ethyl acetate extract was successively obtained from the crushed fruit and submitted to column chromatography on Silicagel. The fractions were analysed through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and two compounds were separated and identified as oleanolic and ursolic acids. The reflectance measurements were taken with the UniSpec-SC Spectral Analysis System. The fruit in the field and laboratory exhibited elevated UV reflectance. The ethyl acetate extract, fractions, and isolated compounds showed high reflectance in UV, which indicated that these triterpene acids could be responsible for reflectance in natural berries. Ursolic and oleanolic acids can play a photoprotective role in berries of Corema album. In sunny environments white fruit can be more visible to dispersers.",

The results indicated high levels of control region diversity, lack of significant phylogeographical structure and historical population expansion after the Pleistocene. The Last Glacial Maximum marine environment, the present ocean currents and life history with high dispersal potential should be responsible for high levels of genetic connectivity among the analyzed populations and shallow phylogeographical pattern.

We then studied the intraspecific variation of F. deltoidea subsp. deltoidea in Peninsular Malaysia using morphological and molecular approaches. Based on the morphological variations, we further determined the varieties that occur regionally under the above subspecies based on the leaf characteristics. As for molecular data sets, we used both chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nSSR markers to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship among the varieties. The cpDNA dendrogram yielded poorer resolution where most of the clades were forming paraphyletic complex. The cluster analysis based on nSSR is largely congruent with the morphological classification, with F. deltoidea subsp. deltoidea classified into four main varieties, namely var. deltoidea, var. angustifolia, var. kunstleri and var. lutescens.

Corydalis parviflora differs from its putative parents in both cpDNA and nDNA sequences and represented a separate lineage within section Sophorocapnos. These findings demonstrate that C. parviflora is not a hybrid and is more closely related to species in section Sophorocapnos than in section Thalictrifoliae.

This study characterizes the microsatellite loci isolated from E. rhodotricha and cross-amplification in thirteen other cactus species. Twelve microsatellite loci were developed from an enriched genomic library. Eight of these were polymorphic and characterized in 48 individuals from three E. rhodotricha populations. The loci showed a mean of 3.2 alleles per locus and overall levels of expected and observed heterozygosities ranging from 0.00 to 0.83 and 0.00 to 0.66, respectively. Five loci showed significant departures from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium and also exhibited signs of null alleles. Cross-amplification in other Cactaceae species was successful, ranging from one (Ferocactus latispinus, Cacteae and Harrisia adscendens, Trichocereeae) to twelve loci (Echinopsis calochlora, Trichocereeae). The development of these microsatellite markers will contribute to investigations of population structure, genetic diversity, and gene flow in E. rhodotricha populations, as well as in other cactus species, providing information useful for the creation and delimitation of conservation areas in the Brazilian Chaco region.",

The ITS2 regions were sequenced from 67 specimens representing 14 species and six morphotypes of Tenthredopsis and their secondary structure were predicted and characterised. A sequence-structural alignment dataset of ITS2 was analysed by application of maximum likelihood method to see relationship among the specimens. Here, a relaxed approach has been adapted to identify and to elucidate species boundaries by considering the presence of CBCs, hemi-CBCs and unique length size of ITS2 in combination with morphology. The predicted secondary structure of ITS2 was extremely branched in contrast to common core structure found in many eukaryotes.

The results indicated that this species is characterized by moderate levels of genetic polymorphism (46.4% polymorphic loci) and genetic diversity (He\u00a0=\u00a00.163), and by moderate to high levels of differentiation among the geographical populations. Principal coordinate and Bayesian assignment analysis were used to investigate the genetic structure of this species. No genetically distinct groups among the individuals were detected. The results provided new genetic information and have wide implications for genetic assessment, fishery management and conservation of the rock carp.",

Then, we used a geographical information system approach to evaluate the change in genetic diversity of D. indica under climate change scenarios. There was a significantly negative relationship between climatic suitability and the genetic diversity of the clonal plant species. Using a proxy of genetic diversity, we found that climate change may alter the genetic diversity and even lead to a reduction in regional genetic diversity in D. indica. Annual precipitation, in particular, contributes to these changes in genetic diversity. Hence, climatic factors can be used as indicators of genetic diversity for clonal plant species, and studies should examine the impact of climate change on the maintenance of genetic diversity in plant species.",

Evolutionary process that led to the diversity of HSP70 specific to vertebrates was also analysed. Results revealed that HSP70 is highly homologous in other fish families. The conservation of the HSP 70 gene among fish families could be driven by forces of natural selection due to climatic change. We exposed C. striatus to heat shock (32\u00a0\u00b0C) and cold shock (16\u00a0\u00b0C) respectively, in order to examine the differences of temperatures in influencing the expression patterns of HSP70.

There are few studies on ITS2 in teleostean fishes; particularly no reports on flatfishes. In this study, we focused on ITS2 in Zanzibar tonguesole, Cynoglossus zanzibarensis (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae). Three types of ITS2 sequences (Type A, B, and C) coexisted and mainly differ in length, nucleotide diversity (\u03c0), secondary structure, and minimum free energy. Based on these different features, Type B and C were speculated as the putative pseudogenic ITS2 region. Moreover, Type C sequences were detected as recombinant from crossing over between Type A and B sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first report on ITS2 recombination in animal ribosomal RNA genes. The high degree of ITS2 sequence polymorphism at the intraindividual level supported a non-concerted evolution pattern in the C. zanzibarensis genome.

Through successive selective breeding, four shell color variants of white (W), gold (G), black (B) and purple (P) C. gigas have been developed. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to scan the genomes of the four variants with different shell colors and one wild population (C) to identify candidate markers for shell polymorphism. Fifteen AFLP primer combinations were used, 1079 loci were scored as polymorphic loci, and the percentage of polymorphic bands was 95.5%. In the gold, white, black, purple and wild populations, the percentages of polymorphic loci were estimated to be 90.5% (G), 90.0% (W), 91.1% (B), 95.3% (P) and 93.2% (C); the expected heterozygosity values were 0.3115 (G), 0.3044 (W), 0.3102 (B), 0.3285 (P) and 0.3105 (C). The white shell variant was observed to have slightly lower genetic diversity than others, with a FST value of 0.1483.

Linkage disequilibrium was not observed between loci, but all of them presented high heterozygote deficiencies, possibly because of recent colonization events along the Brazilian coast. Five loci successfully amplified the co-generic species M. vesiculosus, but the low diversity described indicates a low transferability of this primers. The microsatellite markers developed herein can be used in future studies of this species that has been registered outside the natural distribution boundaries in several regions of the world, aiming at elucidating the dynamics of this important invasive species inside and outside its native geographic limits.",

Population declines in the Laurentian Great Lakes resulting from the introduction of dreissenid mussels and habitat destruction in the 20th Century have greatly reduced and limited its distribution. To properly inform restoration and management efforts for L. nasuta, fine-scale genetic analyses must be performed on the remnant populations. This study used Illumina paired-end shotgun sequencing to identify potential microsatellite loci for L. nasuta, utilizing two samples to develop the Illumina paired-end shotgun library. Forty-eight primer pairs were tested on the remaining 24 samples. Twenty-nine of the 48 microsatellite primer sets screened were successfully amplified using 24 L. nasuta samples collected from the Great Lakes watershed. The estimated fragment size ranged from 167 to 445 base-pairs (bp) and the number of alleles per locus varied between 5 and 16 (mean\u00a0=\u00a09.7). Only five of the loci deviated significantly from Hardy\u2013Weinberg expectations after Bonferroni corrections.

     "abstract": "The period of Cenozoic Himalayan orogeny was the developmental stage of the marginal seas and islands adjacent to the western Pacific. In the study, the molecular divergence dating between the northern and southern groups by fossil calibration was approximately 10.9\u00a0Myr, which was earlier than the time of the formation of Taiwan Island. Statistical-Dispersal Vicariance Analysis (S-DIVA) suggested that mantis shrimp of the China seas originated from two different ancestral regions (i.e., the Yellow Sea and South China Sea). However, the fluctuation of the Taiwan Strait in the late glacial period further influenced the phylogeographic structure of the mantis shrimp. In addition, the opposite ocean currents of the northern and southern seas of China, driving the planktonic larvae of marine species in opposite directions in the reproductive season, further accelerated their genetic divergence. In contrast, there were weak differences among the three northern seas due to their sharing one common ancestral region and then facing the dispersal event in the Cenozoic era and later sudden population expansion in the late Quaternary interglacial (54\u201375\u00a0ka). In conclusion, geological and climatic changes in past geological periods have greatly influenced the geographical distribution, dispersal and genetic divergence of the mantis shrimp.",

In this study, we investigated the geographical distribution of genetic variation and the genetic structure of P. paucidens populations using mitochondrial DNA sequences and genotypes identified from four microsatellite loci. Our results showed that populations from westward-flowing river systems that drain into the Yellow Sea have more genetic diversity than those from southward-flowing river systems, and that the highest genetic variance revealed by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) using both genetic markers was observed in river systems grouped as HAN\u00a0+\u00a0GEUM, NAKDONG\u00a0+\u00a0JEJU, YOUNGSAN, and SEOMJIN.

Lupinus spp. may contain quinolizidine and/or piperidine alkaloids that can be toxic and/or teratogenic to grazing livestock. Lupinus leucophyllus and Lupinus polyphyllus in particular represent important species in the rangelands of southeast Washington and northeast Oregon. The objectives of this study were to identify the alkaloid profiles of these two species, and to explore the phylogenetic relationship among the different populations using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Two chemotypes were found among the 14 accessions of Lupinus leucophyllyus. Chemotype A contained anagyrine, a potent teratogen in cattle, and thus would pose a risk to cause crooked calf syndrome in grazing cattle, while Chemotype B did not contain anagyrine and poses no teratogenic risk. No alkaloids were detected in the L. polyphyllus plants collected in this area. Phylogenetic analysis showed that L. leucophyllus accessions with the same chemotype that were geographically proximal were closely grouped in the cladogram; however, accessions that were geographically proximal that represented different chemotypes did not cluster together. Taken together, these results suggest that for the studied species, chemotype is the principle factor in determining relatedness followed by geography.",

Fifty-five populations were analyzed using four chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions and (nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer) nrITS sequence data. In all, 21 cpDNA haplotypes and 13 nrITS sequence types were detected. Analyses of the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships detected two rarely reported glacial refugia. One was the Yushu\u2013Nangqian area, and the other consisted of the area from the Songpan Plateau to the southeastern margin of the QTP. Sibiraea species populations experienced divergent evolution and founder effects when they recolonized the QTP platform and adjacent high-altitude regions following glaciations. The divergence times of the main lineages and haplotypes were in the range of 1.60\u20132.58 Ma. The population size of Sibiraea species in the QTP decreased approximately 23-fold during the last 0.12 Ma, indicating that Sibiraea species were significantly affected by environmental changes in the QTP. Therefore, the rapid uplift of the QTP and subsequent glaciations likely played an important role in driving genetic divergence and population size changes of Sibiraea species in the QTP.",

The norditerpene alkaloids are secondary compounds in Delphinium (larkspur) species which are divided into two classes: the N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL-type) and non MSAL-type, and are known to be toxic to herbivorous insects and livestock. Alkaloid concentrations were measured in a whole plant context in vegetative and reproductive tissues in Delphinium nuttallianum at different stages of plant maturity at two locations to explore how plant maturity affected alkaloid concentrations within a growing season. Alkaloid concentrations differed between vegetative and reproductive tissues, with vegetative tissues having significantly lower alkaloid concentrations than reproductive tissues. However, no systematic differences in alkaloid concentrations were observed at different plant maturity stages across the growing season. Based on the data we suggest that alkaloid allocation in different plant parts of D. nuttallianum is influenced by life history of the plant, consistent with plant defense theory. At one location, as pods mature the qualitative alkaloid composition changed through structural diversification of the alkaloids present. The ecological significance of this structural diversification awaits further exploration.",

The results reflect that the structural characteristics, nucleotide content and codon usage bias of the mitochondrial genome of the Himalayan serow were similar to those of other serows. A phylogenetic analysis using two rRNA genes and 12 encoded protein-coding genes indicated that C. thar is clustered within the C. milneedwardsii clade, which is a sister group of C. sumatraensis.

Yet the origin of chrysanthemum cultivars has been highly debated. In this study we employ the nuclear low-copy LFY gene to study the evolutionary history of chrysanthemum cultivars. The structure of the LFY gene in all Chrysanthemum species examined is highly conserved with three exons and two introns. The length of the LFY gene in Chrysanthemum varied from 2, 887 to 3, 348\u00a0bp. The two introns exhibited high levels of variation in length and sequence composition at the intraspecific and interspecific levels. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole LFY sequences of Chrysanthemum resulted in topologies that contained three major clades. The LFY sequences from the same cultivars are present in two or three clades, supporting that hybridization and allopolyploidy were important mechanisms in the origins of different chrysanthemums. Our results suggest that different cultivars had different ancestors. Chrysanthemum indicum, C. zawadskii and C. nankingense were likely the direct ancestors of most chrysanthemum cultivars examined. Chrysanthemum vestitum is a putative ancestor for some cultivars, and may have indirectly involved in the development of the chrysanthemum cultivars. Sequences of the LFY gene are informative to shed insights into the origin of chrysanthemum cultivars and show great potential as a phylogenetic marker to decipher the phylogeny of Chrysanthemum and its close relatives.",

A total of 40 individuals from 15 populations were characterized according to nucleotide diversity, number of haplotypes, and number of potentially informative characters. The results revealed that nucleotide substitutions and indels are the main source of variation, with the largest divergence between species found in trnS-trnG. The trnL intron and petL-psbE showed intraspecific variability in both species. The psbD-trnT, atpI-atpH, trnS-trnG, and trnT-trnL, which are the most variable regions in one species, showed no variation in the other. Finally, the nuclear gene PhyC showed more resolution between Cereus species than within species. We thus found considerable heterogeneity among widely used plastid markers, even between closely related species, and suggest the use of PhyC as a marker for phylogenetic inference in these species. These results reinforce the need of screening as a preliminary step to conduct phylogeographic or phylogenetic studies in face of unpredictable sequence variation of molecular markers in plants.",

Fifty four specimens of C. gliroides, sampled throughout eastern Indochina (Vietnam and Laos), have been sequenced for the mitochondrial (cytb and control region) and nuclear (IRBP) genes. The results have revealed the existence of two highly divergent allopatric lineages showing a genetic divergence of 12% cytb and occurring in different regions of Vietnam. The northern lineage occurs in northern and central Vietnam, central Laos and the highlands of southern Vietnam, and the southern lineage occurs in lowlands of southern Vietnam. In the south, representatives of both lineages were collected at the distance of less than 130\u00a0km from each other. The occurrence of both genetic lineages in southern Vietnam seems to testify for an important role of Dalat Plateau as a possible refuge for small mammals.

Increasing N significantly increased M. micrantha biomass. All grasses suppressed the growth of the vine to varying degrees. P. maximum and P. purpureum decreased the biomass of the invasive vine by at least 88.9% and 75.0%, respectively, while P. incomtum caused at least a 63.5% decrease.

This study assessed the degree of genetic diversity and population structure of Ecuadorian V. floribundum as a preliminary step towards the establishment of effective conservation and sustainable-agriculture strategies. Morti\u00f1o individuals (126 in total) sampled from 3 regions in the northern highlands of Ecuador were characterized using 11 heterologous SSR markers originally developed for Vaccinium corymbosum. Expected heterozygosity (He\u00a0=\u00a00.49) revealed a moderate degree of genetic diversity for Ecuadorian morti\u00f1o, and pairwise F statistics between sampling regions (0.019\u2264\u00a0Fst\u00a0\u22640.041) demonstrated low-to-moderate population differentiation. Population structure analysis clustered morti\u00f1o germplasm into 3 groups, each representing the 3 distinct regions from where samples were collected. The geographic patterning of genetic diversity for V. floribundum could be explained by an isolation-by-distance model, where physical barriers along the Andean highlands reduce genetic exchange between distanced populations. To confirm the latter, this study should extend to a wider sampling range, covering other regions along the Andean alley where the species is found.",

In the recent cluster, we identified a certain degree of genetic variability, whereas the ancient cluster exhibited none. We recorded significant differences in leaf shape between the clusters. Genotypes with narrow leaves were more characteristic of recent localities. Although the ancient cluster showed no variability in ISSR primers, it did show variability in leaf traits, indicating that some of the morphologically expressed genetic variability cannot be detected using ISSR primers. All samples were diploids (2n\u00a0=\u00a046), with an identical relative DNA content.

     "abstract": "Diaspores of myrmecochorous plants often include nutrient rich elaiosomes, which are known as appendages of seeds to attract ants for seed dispersion. The benefits of myrmecochory were investigated thoroughly in previous studies, such as, the diaspores may be carried to the ant nests where the elaiosomes are consumed and the seeds are discarded unharmed. However, it remained unclear whether the secondary dispersers could shape the traits of diaspores in myrmecochory. In this study, we analyzed the nutritional quality of seeds and their corresponding elaiosomes of the myrmecochorous plant Stemona tuberosa (Stemonaceae), whose diaspores are dispersed by ants and/or hornets. Our results show significant differences in the quantitative pattern of nutrients between seeds and elaiosomes, respectively. The elaiosomes of S. tuberosa contain significantly higher concentration of proteins, free fatty acids, free amino acids, soluble carbohydrates, and micronutrients than the seeds. The low mass ratio of seed/elaiosomes in S. tuberosa compared to other myrmecochorous species imply that seed dispersal by hornets might be discriminated from seed dispersal by ants. In conclusion, we suggest that hornets and ants obtain the essential nutrients from the elaiosomes of S. tuberosa and these rewards contribute to shape the hornet/ant-plant mutualism.",

Two species of hedgehogs occur in the country: the North African hedgehog Atelerix algirus and the desert hedgehog Paraechinus aethiopicus.

The mitochondrial phylogenetic analysis identified two major clades corresponding to the two species, whereas no phylogenetic structure was observed within either species. However, analysis of the morphological data indicated the presence of two morphotypes within A. algirus. The more common and widespread morphotype agrees well with the standard description of A. algirus, while the other recognized morphotype was found almost exclusively in the Mediterranean coastal belt and is distinguishable by a combination of morphological characters. A most remarkable finding was the detection of A. algirus individuals, with taxonomic identity confirmed by both molecular and morphological data, at extralimital localities in oases deep in the Sahara. Two of these records in central Algeria extend the distribution of the species approximately 500\u00a0Km to the south.

Five primer combinations produced a total of 344 unambiguous bands, of which 311 (90.4%) were polymorphic.

The F statistics revealed constant high genetic differentiation among populations, contributing about 30% of the total gene diversity.

We analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) the lipophilic fraction of femoral gland secretions of two closely related wall lizard species, Podarcis bocagei and Podarcis carbonelli to test for possible interspecific differences in chemical composition. We found 56 lipophilic compounds in femoral gland secretions of male P. bocagei and 60 in P. carbonelli. The main compounds were steroids and waxy esters, but we also found carboxylic acids and their esters, alcohols, amydes, aldehydes, squalene, ketones and furanones. There were significant differences between species with respect to the number and relative proportions of compounds. Differences in chemical composition might be a consequence of phylogenetic differences per se, but they could also be explained by ecological adaptation to different microclimatic conditions. These differences in chemical profiles may explain the known chemosensory interspecific recognition between these two lizards, contributing to their reproductive isolation.",

Our results showed temporal variation in amounts of elatol, which peaked at the beginning of the light and dark periods. The \u03a6PSII during the light phase, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, was higher when the elatol concentration was lower. We conclude that under constant conditions, i.e. without the influence of natural habitat and genetic variability, there is diel variation in elatol production that is inversely correlated with \u03a6PSII. We suggest that both metabolic activity of secondary metabolite production and photosynthetic activity are under an endogenous control in this red seaweed.

The expected and observed heterozygosities ranged from 0.433 to 0.933 and from 0.505 to 0.762, respectively. Cross amplification among five Tetraclita barnacle species found in the Indo-West Pacific was successful with all eight microsatellite markers, although success rate varied among species. Therefore, the microsatellite markers developed in this study can be useful tools in future genetic studies with tetraclitid barnacles.",

To date, extensive harvesting by local people for medical use has led to a sharp decline in wild populations of this plant. To investigate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of the species, differences in the composition of one nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus (NADPH) and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments (trnH-psbA and trnG introns) from wild populations of this plant were analysed. Six chlorotypes and 17 nuclear genotypes were identified in a survey of 8 populations distributed in the current geographic regions of C. tomentella. Two cpDNA haplotypes were shared in two present distribution regions, Shennongjia and Nanchuan in Central China, while there were no similar nDNA genotypes in these regions. As a whole, Shennongjia's populations had greater gene diversity than found in Nanchuan's population of C. tomentella. Greater population differentiation was also detected along with low gene flow in the distribution regions. This may result from the plants predominantly self-mating system, the short-distance dispersal system associated with the plant, and the specific habitat requirements for growth. These data suggest that Shennongjia region should be regarded as the priority area for conservation of C. tomentella due to its greater diversity of this plant found there.",

Plants were continually subjected to folivory, florivory and folivory\u00a0+\u00a0florivory treatments for two days. We measured floral emissions with proton transfer reaction/mass spectroscopy (PTR-MS) at different times during the application of the treatments. The emissions of methanol, ethyl acetate and another compound, likely 3-butenenitrile, increased significantly in response to florivory. Methanol and 3-butenenitrile increased 2.4- and 26-fold, respectively, in response to the florivory treatment.

Folivory alone had no detectable effect on floral emissions. All VOC emissions began immediately after attack, with no evidence of delayed induction in any of the treatments. Folivory and florivory had a synergistic effect when applied together, which strengthened the defensive response when the attack was extended to the entire plant.",

The diversification of Chesneya (crown age ca. 16.56\u00a0Ma) is speculated to have been associated with Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) uplift. The following aridification process resulted in the Pliocene diversification of four sections of Chesneya during 4.8\u20132.06\u00a0Ma.

The split between the two Matudaea species was estimated during Middle Miocene. The colonization of Matudaea into South America could have been facilitated by the closure of the Isthmus of Panama and the global decreasing of temperature during Miocene. Five haplotypes of M. colombiana were identified, which show an eastwards decline of genetic diversity and suggest a founder effect in the colonization of Eastern cordillera of the Colombian Andes. We detected a niche conservatism signal between the two Matudaea species related with Temperature of Coldest Month and Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter bioclimatic variables; this signal might be related to the narrow altitudinal range occupied by the two species.",

We assess the in\u00a0vivo growth rate, doubling time, biomass yield, glycolytic flux, and enzyme expression of T. evansi. Then, we explore the metabolic changes likely occurring during its growth. At low T. evansi densities, most host glucose is used to produce energy, which results in the release of pyruvate. Part of glucose is used for NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway. At high T. evansi densities, fructose, mannose, and glycerol become additional energy sources. Part of host glucose is used for biosynthesis and for NADPH production through alternative metabolic pathways, which results in the release of succinate, alanine, and acetate. The ability of organisms to adjust to resource changes is crucial to their survival.

In spite of a high frequency of null alleles detected in part of the loci, a recurrent phenomenon in Lepidopteron, the estimation of pairwise FST seems rather insensitive to the presence of these null alleles as shown by the high correlation between FST calculated after correction for the presence of null alleles and non-corrected FST, indicating that the loci may be usable in population genetics, more specifically for the study of populations genetics structure.",

The genetic diversity of Laiwu pigs is dramatically low, with the observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.067 to 0.767. Among the 27 microsatellite markers, 10 were high polymorphic loci, 10 were moderate polymorphic loci, six were low polymorphic loci, and no polymorphism was detected at one locus (IGFI). Further analyses with the 10 high polymorphic loci and five moderate polymorphic loci revealed that the Laiwu pig breed was inbred and heterozygous deficient to some extent, but not severely, and that the Laiwu pigs were relatively pure, with almost no hybridization with other breeds. Two subgroups of the current 13 Laiwu pig pedigrees were identified.

Low genetic diversity predominates in the populations from NY, and even lower for the populations in MI. Our results also indicate that AHTF from NY and MI are genetically differentiated from each other, as well as the populations within them. There is no positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances, as well as between genetic distance and census population size. The significantly high among population genetic variation and low gene flow value are common indicators of a predominant inbreeding mating strategy within populations, limited spore dispersal, and genetic drift.

In this paper, we targeted Ephemeroptera, a key taxonomic insect group for biomonitoring of water bodies and present an overview on the efficacy of the DNA barcoding approach to document species identity in the Mediterranean region. We sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) in 39 nominal species. Sample discrimination and species identification were investigated by evaluating haplotype identity and similarity, intra-/interspecific genetic distances, optimal identification of barcoding gap thresholds, estimates of species monophyly and comparative species matches on available reference libraries. The resolving power of the obtained data was discussed in the light of statistical tools such as Spider R-package and Poisson Tree Processes. High levels of species identification were achieved with all the used methodologies, and the occurrence of cryptic species was suggested. We conclude that DNA barcoding is a powerful tool for taxonomic research in Mediterranean mayflies, with great promise to ameliorate biodiversity inventories of freshwater ecosystems and to provide the necessary accuracy for water quality assessment programs.

Intra-population neutral genetic diversity in non-grazed population was significantly higher than three grazed populations; however, the highest value among grazed populations appeared in the moderately grazed population. A relatively low degree of genetic differentiation among populations by AMOVA analysis and a high level of gene flow existed among populations (Gst\u00a0=\u00a00.2649, Nm\u00a0=\u00a01.3875\u00a0\u3009\u00a01).

Here we determined the foliar and root N, P concentrations and clarified the patterns of N:P stoichiometry across functional groups and community types along a 2000\u00a0m altitudinal gradient in Qilian Mountains, China. Generally, foliar N remained constant but P increased, therefore foliar N:P ratio decreased against elevation. Foliar N, P and N:P were different considerably and correlated highly with that in root, respectively. One-way ANOVA demonstrated stable root N content across the communities, and remarkably higher root P at the higher rather than at the lower sites. For the foliar, the alpine bushwood had the lowest foliar P, but highest N content, whereas the alpine cold-desert presented the lowest foliar N, but higher P concentration. The well-constrained N:P ratios indicated no significant limitation in N or P in the study area. These results together suggest that plant foliar N, P contents do not simply increase with elevation, and the vegetation type, specifically at the arid and low temperature environments, may play crucial roles on patterns of plant N:P stoichiometry at alpine region.",

     "abstract": "Amygdalus mira (Koehne) Ricker is native to China and has many good economical traits. However, its genetic diversity information has not been extensively studied. In this study, to assess the genetic diversity and relationships of A. mira and other peach species (nineteen accessions from Zhengzhou, Henan Province and seven accessions from Harbin) we used simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Here, 10 SSR primers were used, and 100% of the SSR primers were polymorphic, with an average of 5.5 alleles per primer pairs, suggesting that these primers were informative for this study. Additionally, polymorphism information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.82 to 0.96 with an average of 0.91. All the accessions were clustered into two groups (cluster 1 and cluster 2) based on SSR data. Principal coordinate analysis recovered similar results that all accessions were divided into two major clusters. The genetic variations within and among populations were 63.9% and 36.1%, respectively. In conclusion, A. mira maintains high genetic variation levels. This research will be potentially useful to aid breeding and enhance the economic and ornamental value of this wild peach.",

     "abstract": "Ploidy differences can occur between and within species. To decipher the genetic structure of a species with different ploidy levels, we investigated an area of China where diploid and triploid individuals of Lycoris radiata co-occur. Twenty-six populations of L. radiata were sampled across its natural range, and SCoT markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure. Chromosome counts revealed that 10 populations were diploid and 16 were triploid, each population showed a single cytotype. SCoT analysis revealed high genetic diversity at the species level (PPB\u00a0=\u00a093.1%; H\u00a0=\u00a00.258; I\u00a0=\u00a00.396). However, compared to the triploid strains of Lycoris, the diploid strains had a relatively higher genetic diversity. One possible interpretation for these results is that the triploid strains only propagated using bulb division, while the diploid strains reproduced using sexual propagation and bulb division. Our investigation of the genetic structure, based on UPGMA and PCoA cluster analyses, revealed that populations of L. radiata are divided into three genetic groups. In addition, our results indicate that Yangtze River can affect population diffusion, which played an important role in the genetic differentiation of L. radiata. Lastly, our results suggest that the triploid sterile species of L. radiata might possess two origins.",

The percent of polymorphic bands (94.8%), Nei's genetic diversity (0.2134), and Shannon's information index (0.3426) revealed a high level of genetic diversity at the genus-level. At the taxon level, P. tabulaeformis f. shekanensis and P. henryi showed a higher genetic diversity than the others. The coefficient of genetic differentiation among taxa (0.3332) indicated a higher level of genetic diversity within taxon, rather than among taxa. An estimate of gene flow among taxa was 1.0004 and implied a certain amount of gene exchange among taxa. The results of neighbor-joining cluster analysis and principal co-ordinate analysis revealed that P. tabulaeformis, P. tabulaeformis var. mukdensis and P. tabulaeformis f. shekanensis were conspecific, which was in agreement with the traditional classification.

Despite sustained interest to this phenomenon, the underlying physiological mechanisms of latitudinal adaptation remain poorly understood. Thyroid hormones (THs) are key regulators of metabolism, development, and growth, and are involved in shaping adult phenotypes in lower vertebrates, fishes and amphibians. We tested the hypothesis that concentrations of triiodothyronine (T3), the most active form of THs, correlate with latitudinal gradient in ectotherms using a cyprinid fish, the common roach Rutilus rutilus as an example. Fish from seven locations between 46\u00b045\u2032 and 58\u00b004\u2032 N were studied for T3 concentrations. Our results show a strong positive correlation between latitude and T3 concentrations. There was a three-fold difference between the means of the extreme southern and northern samples. This is a first finding of latitudinal gradient of thyroid hormones in ectotherms. Photoperiodism and temperature were tested as main environmental factors influencing TH levels. In our results, the increase in T3 concentrations along the south\u2013north axis in ectotherms is, seemingly, associated with adaptation to differing thermal environments.",

Combination of markers and the morphological descriptors further reduced the number to two groups; one group including four wrinkle-seeded accessions and one including two other wrinkle-seeded accessions. A combination of genotypic and phenotypic markers proved a good method to identify true and false duplicates.

Trichomes can produce chemicals, but also acts as a quantitative defense and in water loss. The shifting defense hypothesis (SDH) poses that invasive plants reduce the production of qualitative defenses against specialist herbivores because those are frequently absent in invaded regions, while increasing defenses against generalist herbivores. Chemical and physical leaf surface defensive traits could give information about direct plant\u2013herbivore interaction in native and non-native regions. We studied leaf surface morphology and epicuticular chemistry of the invasive C. solstitialis in plants from native and non-native regions. Across regions, the main chemical components were sesquiterpene lactones, similar densities of sessile glandular trichomes and a variable number of large multicellular trichomes. Exotic plants face different sets of challenges in the new regions. In accordance with SDH, plants from non-native regions presented higher total sesquiterpene lactones concentrations (qualitative defense). Trichome density was possibly associated to differences in local climatic conditions. Sesquiterpene lactones are likely to play an important role on the invasion success of Centaurea. Leaf surface components provide meaningful information that should be consider in future studies to unravel the mechanisms involved in plant invasions.",

We sequenced two cpDNA fragments and nrITS to examine genetic variations in 22 natural populations across the range of distribution in this region to investigate the phylogeographical distributional pattern of Gentiana straminea (Gentianaceae) in the QTP. The high haplotype diversity from populations on the platform suggested the existence of intraspecific diversification. Molecular dating estimated that all haplotypes have differentiated before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Moreover, the haplotype distribution map based on both cpDNA and nrDNA data suggested expansions from QTP to its outer edges. Finally, ecological niche modeling further demonstrated the glacial survival of this species on the platform and continuous expansion to the platform edge.

Eight AFLP primers selected from 64 primers were used to generate 1343 discernible DNA bands, of which 1338 (99.6%) were polymorphic.

However, species delimitation among the Mekong Glyphidrilus remains unclear because the key morphological traits in semi-aquatic earthworms are highly polymorphic. This study assessed the distinction between G. vangviengensis and G. mekongensis using allozyme electrophoresis. A total of 752 individuals collected from 33 localities were screened for 10 putative loci from seven enzymatic systems, revealing that G. vangviengensis and G. mekongensis are two distinct species, according to their different allelic patterns and high genetic distance. A low genetic differentiation within each species was indicated by the pairwise Nei's D and FST analyses, and the absence of population structure was detected by AMOVA and Bayesian structure analyses. However, a significant isolation by distance, but not vicariance, was observed, which is probably due to the river current causing translocation downstream and so gene flow between adjacent localities. The genetic diversity of the Mekong Glyphidrilus was relatively high and comparable to other earthworm taxa, and several localities showed deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium. An additional cryptic species from Ban Hat Khamphi, Loei, Thailand, was inferred.",

We searched for differences in the emission profiles between anemophilous and entomophilous flowers by considering the effects of phylogeny in our analysis. The floral emissions from the two groups were significantly different. Entomophilous species presented highly diverse emissions in both magnitude of emission rates and richness of compounds depending on the species, but overall, the flowers from entomophilous species had much higher VOC emission rates and VOC richness, both for terpenes and benzenoid compounds, than those from anemophilous species (two orders of magnitude higher emissions).

We tested 477 variable, 800 conserved, and 253 informative sites in the Glb1 gene sequences. On the basis of \u03c0 \u02c6 per base pair and \u03b8 \u02c6 per base pair, the highest level of sequence variation was detected in parviglumis, followed by maize landraces and common maize. Z. luxurians and T. dactyloides retained a low level of variation. For Glb1 gene, negative or almost zero estimates for Tajima's D and Fu and Li's statistics in the 8 taxa, show that neutral evolution can be accepted. A large number of shared polymorphisms existed with no fixed differences between parviglumis and both the maize landrace and common maize. Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis showed that sequences from maize landraces, common maize, parviglumis, and Z. luxurians were separated into two well-supported clades, and sequences from T. dactyloides constituted a distinct group. Excluding T. dactyloides and Z. luxurians, median-joining (MJ) network analysis clustered the remaining taxa into five haplotypes, revealing a higher level of haplotype diversity in the landrace.

Pinus dabeshanensis Cheng et Law is an endangered species endemic to the Dabieshan Mountains of eastern China. To obtain fundamental information of genetic diversity, population history, effective population size, and gene flow in this species, we explored patterns of genetic variation of natural populations, in addition to an ex situ conserved population, using expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSR) markers. Our results revealed moderate levels of genetic diversity (e.g., HE\u00a0=\u00a00.458 vs. HE\u00a0=\u00a00.423) and a low level of genetic differentiation (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.028) among natural and conserved populations relative to other conifers. Both contemporary and historical migration rates among populations were high. Bayesian coalescent-based analyses suggested that 3 populations underwent reductions in population size ca. 10,000\u00a0yr ago, and that two populations may have experienced recent genetic bottlenecks under the TPM. Bayesian clustering revealed that individuals from the ex situ population were largely assigned to the \u2018red\u2019 cluster. Additionally, our results identified private alleles in the natural populations but not in the ex situ population, suggesting that the ex situ conserved population insufficiently represents the genetic diversity present in the species. Past decline in population size is likely to be due to Holocene climate change.

These fossils record ozopores, the openings of chemical defense glands, occurring along the length of the body. The secretions of these glands may consist of topical irritants, repellents, antifeedants, or, in the case of the large and widespread Order Polydesmida, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas that can be fatal to other arthropods or even small vertebrates in a confined environment. M\u00fcllerian mimicry rings may develop in which unrelated species of millipedes that co-occur closely resemble one another, while participating in a completely differently patterned ring in another part of their geographic range. Chemistry is not the only defense of millipedes. Polyxenids carry tufts of entangling setae, many species rely on crypsis and the ability to roll into a smooth, resistant sphere or coil, and still others have spikey projections that may deter soft-mouthed predators. Nevertheless, chemical defense has been of significance in helminthomorph millipedes at least since the Lower Carboniferous. The distribution of classes of chemical defense compounds follows major phylogenetic groupings.

In this study, we analyzed genetic differentiation and the geographic boundary between Pinus henryi and Pinus tabuliformis using chloroplast microsatellite markers. Our data show high levels of among-population differentiation, consistent with the effects of historical demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and climate effects. Three main geographic boundaries coinciding with mountain systems indicate natural landscapes, such as large rivers, and habitat loss caused by anthropogenic deforestation, are significant barriers to genetic exchange among populations. The divergence between populations in the eastern and western Qinling Mountains populations may possibly be ascribed to fragmentation driven by climate change.

We sequenced four chloroplast DNA regions (around 3100\u00a0bp in length) and two mitochondrial DNAs (around 1000\u00a0bp in length). We identified 21 chlorotypes and 10 mitotypes. Both chlorotypes and mitotypes recovered from four species with long disjunction and restricted distributions in northern or northwestern China, Pinus sibirica, Pinus koraiensis, Pinus wallichiana and Pinus pumila are species-specific, suggesting that these cytoplasmic DNAs can distinguish them from the close relatives. Allopatric isolations should have contributed greatly to their genetic divergences.

Flow cytometry revealed that the ploidy level was higher in curcumin-containing accessions than in curcumin-free accessions (average ratio 1.43). This indicates that the ploidy level correlates with the presence or absence of curcuminoids. Curcumin synthase genes (CURS1, CURS2 and CURS3) and diketide-CoA synthase genes (DCS1 and DCS2) play an important role in biosynthesis of curcuminoids. Sequencing of conserved regions of CURS1, CURS2, CURS3, DCS1, and DCS2 revealed significant sequence variations.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that CURS2 diverged from CURS1 and CURS3, whereas the DCS genes evolved independently of the CURS genes.

The use of DNA barcoding is of importance to this group, allowing species identification at the molecular level and in determining the phylogenetic relationships within the group. The objective of this study is to obtain DNA barcoding and to determine the phylogenetic relationships among the species. For this, DNA from six species of the genus was extracted and amplified by PCR using sequences from the rbcL and matK genes and the trnH-psbA spacer gene, followed by sequencing using the Sanger method. The results show that the matK and rbcL genes cannot be used for DNA barcoding, because their discriminatory level between species is low.

     "abstract": "There are approximately 100 species and 10,000 cultivars of Lilium and in general their phylogeny is understood. Difficulties remain, however, in understanding the breeding relationships of cultivars and commercial hybrids. One solution to this problem is to identify a selection of validated and transferable SSR markers for use in genotyping. Although over 100 Lilium SSRs have been developed, they have not been validated for use with broad populations. Here, were-evaluated 112 SSRs with 69 lily accessions from different sources, and selected 70 SSRs as easy to score, transferable and polymorphic in all accessions tested. Based on the marker data from 70 SSRs, two main clusters were established for 69 accessions using TREECON, one includes Asiatic hybrids, Longiflorum\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Asiatic hybrids and Asiatic local landraces (Lilium brownii, L. brownii var. giganteum, Lilium pumilum, Lilium davidii var. unicolor and Lilium lancifolium), the other is composed primarily of Oriental hybrids and Oriental\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Trumpet hybrids, which is in agreement with previous studies and the breeding pedigree. The utility of the 70 SSR markers for establishing parentage and taxon identity of landraces was validated. Our study offers valuable information and validated markers for Lilium systematic classification and the establishment of identity.",

     "abstract": "Many lizards use femoral gland secretions in reliable intraspecific communication. Based on mass spectra, obtained by GC\u2013MS, we found 57 lipophilic compounds in femoral secretions of males and females of El Hierro giant lizards, Gallotia simonyi (fam. Lacertidae). Compounds included steroids (mainly cholesterol) and fatty acids ranging between n-C16 and n-C22 (mainly hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acids), followed by aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, squalene and waxy esters. There were important intersexual differences in the presence, abundance and number of compounds (more numerous in males). Males had higher proportions of the most odoriferous compounds (fatty acids and aldehydes), while females had higher proportions of more stable compounds (steroids, waxy alcohols, waxy esters and terpenoids). This suggests sexual differences in function of femoral secretions. In addition, some compounds could reflect the physiological state, allowing monitoring health of lizards from secretions samples, which is especially important given the critical conservation status of this lizard.",

     "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that populations at the margins of the distributional range of a species show reduced genetic diversity and increased inter-population differentiation compared to central populations. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining the structure of genetic diversity in marginal populations of black poplar, Populus nigra L. (Salicaceae). This species occurs mainly in Europe but its range extends to central Asia. We collected 117 individuals from 10 populations at the edge of the distributional range of the species in central Asia to examine the structure of genetic diversity based on genetic polymorphisms at 20 microsatellite markers. As expected, the genetic diversity within these marginal populations is relatively low, with an average observed heterozygosity Ho of 0.337 and an average expected heterozygosity He of 0.466, compared to the genetic diversity of populations from central distributions. However, we recovered very low genetic differentiation between populations, with an average Fst of 0.0745, a value similar to those reported for central populations. AMOVA analyses confirmed this result, showing that only 9.2% of the total variation could be attributed to between-population variance (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Our findings do not fully support hypotheses about the structure of genetic diversity in marginal populations formed from observations on other species. We suggest that a high rate of outcrossing and possible postglacial colonization at the edge of the distributional range of this long-lived poplar may explain the observed structure of the genetic diversity.",

A high level of genetic differentiation among S. scabriflora subspecies (S. scabriflora spp. scabriflora, S. scabriflora spp. megacalycina, S. scabriflora spp. gallaecica and S. scabriflora spp. tuberculata) was observed (Gst\u00a0=\u00a00.3685), which was illustrated by UPGMA dendrogram.

Only a single lineage (south lineage; SOL) occurred in the YS, whereas two lineages (SOL and the north lineage, NOL) occurred in the ES. The larval occurrence of NOL was much higher than that of SOL (5.2:1) in the middle ES, but the two lineages occurred at similar levels (1.1:1) in the southern ES.

Here, 21 polymorphic microsatellites for H. marcidus are described, obtained using 454\u00a0GS-FLX pyrosequencing. The number of alleles per locus varied from 2 to 9 and no significant linkage disequilibrium was observed. To test applicability, 40 individuals were used from two lakes in the Tatra Mts (Western Carpathians). Observed and expected heterozygosity varied from 0 to 0.9 and 0.102 to 0.888, respectively. In both populations, three loci deviated significantly from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium after Bonferroni correction, probably due to presence of null alleles or undetected biological processes. Application of microsatellites was tested on six alpine lake populations. Bayesian cluster analysis assigned individuals to lakes of their origin and revealed limited gene-flow between them. Five loci were successfully cross-amplified in the related midge Macropelopia sp. (Tanypodinae) and two in Pseudodiamesa branickii (Nowicki, 1873) (Diamesinae). The microsatellites described herein proved to be useful for genetic studies of alpine populations, and can provide important data for management and conservation of these threatened habitats.",

A partial D-loop of 364 base pair gene was extracted from 88 individuals through PCR amplification and direct sequencing. The results show that haplotype diversity (hd\u00a0=\u00a00.7956\u20130.9485) was high, with low nucleotide (\u03c0\u00a0=\u00a00.0045\u20130.0080) variation for each of the populations examined. A molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) revealed few differences between the four populations. A Tajima D test and Fu Fs test were used to investigate the neutrality of each population, revealing that the all examined populations might experience recent population expansion or the bottleneck effect. A phylogeny tree and mismatch distribution analysis provided further evidence that three of four populations had recently expanded, as well as indicating that the Kahang population had in contrast remained stable. Overall, this study concludes that the populations of O. melanopleurus distributed throughout the river systems of Peninsular Malaysia probably originated from a single ancestral source during the last glaciation period, and should therefore be treated as a single evolutionary unit in any conservation efforts.",

The natural resources of A. bidentata in its geo-authentic product area have rapidly declined in recent years because of the over-collection of its roots. To devise adequate conservation and management strategies for this species, its genetic diversity and population structure should be characterized. Roche 454 pyrosequencing combined with magnetic bead enrichment was used to develop microsatellite markers for A. bidentata. A total of 903 microsatellite loci were identified from 42,004 individual sequence reads. One hundred microsatellite loci were selected to test the primer amplification efficiency across 16 individuals from two A. bidentata populations. Of these tested markers, 8 yielded polymorphic amplification products, 29 yielded single alleles. For polymorphic primer pairs, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 4, with an average of 2.75. The observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.353 to 0.671 and 0.250 to 0.938, respectively. The inbreeding coefficient varied from \u22120.692 to 0.627. This set of markers will provide useful tools for examining genetic diversity and population structure, and aid in better understanding of the conservation of A. bidentata.",

A comparison between phylogenetic and chemical data for Ericales demonstrated a low correlation, except for Primuloid families. Flavonoids and triterpenes were characterized as good taxonomic markers for the order, due to their general occurrence and molecular diversity. Nevertheless, saponins are markers only for Primulaceae and lignans are the exclusive markers for Styracaceae. Analyses of correlation among chemical parameters based on flavonoidal, morphological and chemo-morphological indexes, showed low phylogenetic affinity for certain groups, positioning Primuloids and Balsaminoids as the highest and the lowest evolutionary advanced taxa, respectively. Flavonoids produced are mainly flavonols rather than flavones. Hydroxyl protection occurs mainly by glycosylation and to a lesser extent by methylation.

In this study, all 38,444 unigenes were used to screen the SSR loci. A total of 1527 primer pairs were designed for marker development. Tri-nucleotide repeat motifs were the most abundant type, with a frequency of 47.4%, followed by mono- (28.5%), di- (21.1%), tetra- (0.16%), hexa- (0.1%) and penta-nucleotide repeat motifs (0.05%). A total of 50 primer pairs were synthesized, of which 31 (62%) yielded PCR amplification products. Eight individuals were used to examine amplifications and polymorphisms for all 50 loci. In eight P. umbellatus accessions, eight markers were polymorphic. To describe the genetic diversity and genetic relationship of P. umbellatus, the genotypes of 42 accessions representing diverse wild genotypes of P. umbellatus were analyzed. The number of alleles per locus varied from 7 to 13 alleles, and the genetic diversity values ranged from 0.345 to 0.785. We performed genetic diversity analysis using these 8 polymorphic markers. A UPGMA dendrogram was constructed based on Jaccard's similarity coefficients, revealing distinct clusters among the 42 accessions.

     "abstract": "To explore the effects of CO2 concentration on the sestonic stoichiometric values and the community structure of crustacean zooplankton in a eutrophic lake, in situ microcosm experiments were conducted at the Lake Taihu Ecosystem Station in spring and summer of 2012. The experimental treatments were three concentrations of CO2, 270, 380 and 750\u00a0ppm, which represented preindustrial and present levels and the level predicted for the end of this century, respectively. The elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increased the sestonic C:P ratio, particularly in the spring when the C:P ratio was two-fold greater at the high level of CO2 than at the low level of CO2. As a result, the contribution of Bosmina to total crustacean zooplankton abundance increased, most likely because of the low phosphorus content and high adaptability to foods with large elemental ratio variation. The other dominant crustacean zooplankton genera, including Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, Diaphanosoma and Sinocalanus, had no response to the change in pCO2 during the microcosm experiments. The shift in crustacean zooplankton community structure between two seasons was primarily due to the transition of the phytoplankton community.",

The phylogenetic analyses of the COI regions did not support geographically restricted groups among the global samples of Aurelia sp.1. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a complex genetic population structure and pattern of connectivity. Populations of Aurelia sp.1 were highly structured between most sampling sites over distances as small as 100\u00a0km (Rizhao and Qingdao) in certain cases. However, non-significant pairwise FST values were also observed between short geographic distances (Yantai, Rongcheng and Qingdao) and relatively distant sampling sites (Caofeidian, Rizhao and Japan). The life-cycle characteristics, together with the prevailing ocean currents in this region and possible anthropogenic introduction, were proposed and discussed as the main factors that determined the genetic patterns of Aurelia sp.1.",

With the aid of bioinformatics tools and searches for genome/transcriptome information about closely related sequences, new lectin members of Millettieae were also identified. Electrophoresis profiling and amino acid sequence analysis suggested that DBL-Gal and DSL do not undergo post-transcriptional ConA-like circular permutation.

Despite its cultural and commercial significance, limited information exists with regards to the degree of genetic variation and ecological history of P. serotina in Ecuador. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of genetic diversity and population structure of Ecuadorian P. serotina, as a preliminary step towards understanding the distribution history of this species in Ecuador and establishing germplasm conservation programs. P. serotina samples (217, representing 8 provinces from the Ecuadorian highlands) were characterized using 8 heterologous SSR markers derived from related Prunus species. Expected heterozygosity across samples (He\u00a0=\u00a00.71) reveals a moderate level of genetic diversity for Ecuadorian P. serotina. Nevertheless, simple allele-count analysis indicates that Ecuadorian capuli has a narrower degree of allelic richness relative to collections from the species\u2019 center of origin in North America. Furthermore, pairwise F statistics (0.0069\u00a0\u2264\u00a0Fst\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0319) and Nei genetic distance estimates (0.02\u00a0\u2264\u00a0Ds\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.09) indicate minimal population differentiation within Ecuadorian capuli. However, Bayesian population structure analysis suggests a subtle genetic contrast between germplasm from the Northern and Southern highlands. Certainly, it is of interest to analyze whether this underlying genetic differentiation between the Northern- and Southern-Highland groups is also manifested in morphological, agronomic or other phenotypic characters that could indicate adaptive differences to divergent agro-ecosystems.",

The average coefficient of variation was higher among regions (26.9%) than within regions (19.8%). Correlation analysis revealed that the diameter/thickness and fruit wing length were significantly correlated with environmental factors.

The obtained data indicated a crucial role of cat1 and cat2 genes in overcoming aphid-triggered disturbances in the redox homeostasis in the infested maize seedlings. It has been revealed dissimilar patterns of transcriptional reprogramming of the analysed cat genes in seedlings of resistant and sensitive maize cultivars. However, there were no significant changes in cat3 gene expression in maize plants in response to cereal aphids' attack. It was also found that all tested Z. mays genotypes responded an elevation in H2O2 content compared to the uninfested control, and this accumulation was linked with resistance degrees to the aphids' colonization.",

     "abstract": "Clarifying the evolutionary relationship between island organisms and those of the adjacent mainland is critical in understanding the dispersal and evolution of species. Considerable research has been conducted on the relationship between plants of the East Asian mainland and the Japanese archipelago as well as the roles of the East China Sea and the Korea (Tsushima) Strait in plant evolution. However, most previously studied species have limited range distributions, which may preclude a comprehensive understanding. Acer mono is a widespread deciduous tree in East Asia. By integrating chloroplast DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite data, we identified a close genetic relationship between Japanese and subtropical mainland populations. However, different details are revealed by chloroplast DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite data. The chloroplasts from the northwestern part of the eastern subtropical populations were more closely related to the archipelago populations (CP2 clade), but no shared haplotypes were found, which may indicate an ancestral connectivity. Contrarily, plants from the eastern part of the eastern subtropics and the archipelago populations were assigned into the same gene pool based on nuclear microsatellite data (K\u00a0=\u00a06), which probably reflects a recent glaciation connection via pollen dispersal. Our study implies that the Korea (Tsushima) Strait may have been a long-term barrier for A. mono, while the East China Sea may have served as a corridor for pollen dispersal.",

However, it is not clear whether there is a special phylogeographic pattern for plants occurring across the Tanaka Line. To better understand the role of the Tanaka Line in shaping genetic structure of plant species occurring either side of this line, we employed Bombax ceiba, an economically and ecologically important tree species with a distribution across the Tanaka Line, as a proxy to study whether or not the Tanaka Line acts as a boundary to gene flow. We scanned and analyzed genetic variation at three chloroplast DNA fragments (psbB-psbF, trnL-rpl32 and psbI-psbK) within and among 17 natural populations (201 individuals). We identified eight chloroplast haplotypes (A-H) in total. Geographically, seven haplotypes were found southwest of the Tanaka Line, but only two haplotypes (B and H) were located northeast of the Tanaka Line. Meanwhile, both mismatch distribution analysis and environmental niche modeling (ENM) analysis suggested that multiple glacial refugia were maintained in the southwest range of B. ceiba during the last glacial maximum and that northeastern populations underwent strenuous retreatment during the Quaternary climatic oscillations. The present study highlights the importance of historical climate change and topographical circumstances in shaping population structure across the Tanaka Line.",

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed highest percentage of variation within individuals of populations (73.6%) and 21.7% among populations.

The data suggests that high genetic flow is one of the major factors responsible for low genetic differentiation. Preservation of genetic diversity of B. ciliata is important, both to promote adaptability of the populations to changing environment as well as to preserve a large gene pool for future prospection.

Our results revealed an extremely low level of genetic diversity in each population at the northern margin of its range and strong genetic differentiation between southern China and South Asia. Cultivated and natural populations showed no significant differences in genetic variability. Genetic admixture in a nuclear gene was detected in 10 of the 13 populations at the northern margin of their range. The founder effect, in which a small number of individuals colonize the northern margins of its range, may explain the extremely low genetic diversity. During the establishment of new populations, different source populations may mix and undergo further genetic drift and differentiation. This study indicates that patterns of genetic diversity in tropical species at the margin of their range may also be severely influenced by founder effects.",

In this study we ana\u00a0lyzed genetic diversity and variation of 69 E. sibiricus accessions from the species range and constructed DNA fingerprinting profiles of 24 accessions using SCoT markers. A total of 173 bands were generated from 16 SCoT primers, 154 of which were polymorphic with 89.0% of polymorphic bands (PPB) occurring at the species level. The PPB within 8 geographical regions ranged from 2.3 to 54.3 %. Genetic variation was greater within geographical regions (57.9%) than between regions (42.1%). The 24 accessions from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Mongolia Plateau, Kazakhstan, and Russia were distinguished by their unique fingerprinting. This is the first report using SCoT markers for identifying cultivars and accessions of E. sibiricus. The DNA fingerprinting profiles of E. sibiricus were useful in germplasm collection and identification. The genetic diversity of worldwide E. sibiricus germplasm has been substantially affected by ecogeographical factors. Our results suggest that collecting and evaluating E. sibiricus germplasm from major geographic regions and unique environments broadens the available genetic base and illustrates the range of variation.",

Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were employed to study the genetic variation in five C. rotundicauda populations from the east and west coasts of the Malay Peninsula. Both markers showed differing levels of genetic variation, but concurred on the pattern of genetic structuring among populations of the species. This includes showing that little, although significant, genetic differentiation is present among populations, suggesting a low rate of gene flow among populations. The results also suggested that C. rotundicauda may be subjected to the land barrier effect of the Malay Peninsula, whereby gene flow is limited between populations occurring on both sides of the peninsula, increasing their genetic differentiation through time.",

Total cuticular wax load of S. pennellii plants was much higher than in the other plant species. Hydrocarbons were usually the most abundant wax components, followed by minor quantities of triterpenes and other compounds. Interspecific hybrids showed intermediate wax characteristics. The amount and composition of surface waxes were not correlated with the abiotic stress tolerance in S. lycopersicum.

Studies examining the nature of genetic variability in natural populations are important for the utilization of these traits in conservation and breeding programs. In this study, we analyzed 12 populations of P. setacea from different locations distributed in three agro-ecological zones within the Bahia state of Brazil. Eleven ISSR primers and four pairs of RGA primers were used to assay 109 and 49 unique and reproducible loci, of which 108 (99%) and 49 (100%) were polymorphic. Although the level of genetic diversity in \u2018somnus\u2019 passion fruit trees was greater than that observed for other species of the same genus, preferential collection of certain populations, such as those located in the cities of Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista and Licinio de Almeida, is important when considering the fact that \u2018somnus\u2019 passion fruit trees occur in areas that are highly disturbed. This disturbance is primarily due to the deployment of pasture, predatory extraction and accelerated urban expansion. An analysis of molecular variance revealed a balance between the estimated genetic variation within and among populations. These data may be useful for developing strategies for preservation of this species in the Cerrado.",

The most frequent colonisers recovered of C. guianensis were Colletotrichum sp. 1, Diaporthe cf. mayteni, and Pestalotiopsis sp. 1. The fungal community had a moderate richness but high diversity and evenness indices. Colletotrichum sp. and Pilidiella wangiensis displayed selective antibacterial activity; Diaporthe cf. mayteni and Endomelanconiopsis endophytica showed high activity against amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi; and Colletrotrichum sp. Guignardia mangiferae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Diaporthe melonis were able to inhibit yellow fever virus proliferation.

The capability of these endophytic fungi to produce bioactive compounds may be part of their chemical defense and adaptive response to survive and colonizing the plant host in wild environment.

Bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) landraces in Turkey are highly genetically diverse. However, the limited genomic resources available for this crop hinder the molecular characterization of Turkish bottle gourd germplasm for its adequate conservation and management. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of 40 SSR markers from major cucurbit crops (Cucurbita pepo L. and Cucurbita moschata L.) in 30 bottle gourd landraces, together with 16 SRAP primer combinations. In addition, we compared the genetic relationship between bottle gourd and 31 other cucurbit accessions (11 Cucurbita maxima, 3 C. moschata, 5 C. pepo subsp. ovifera, 10 C. pepo and 2 Luffa cylindrica). Twenty-seven Cucurbita SSR markers showed transferability to bottle gourd. SSR markers amplified 59 alleles, in bottle gourd genome with an average of 1.64 alleles per locus. Together, SSR and SRAP markers amplified 453 fragments across the 61 accessions, and clearly discriminated L. siceraria and L. cylindrica from the other cucurbit species. Genetic diversity analysis separated edible cucurbit from ornamentals, while population structure analysis classified L. siceraria in two subpopulations defined by fruit shape, rather than geographical origin. The results indicated that the genomic resources available for Cucurbita species are valuable to study and preserve the genetic diversity of bottle gourd in Turkey.",

DNA analyses were assessed by sequencing cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The obtained sequences were analyzed in terms of nucleotide composition, nucleotide pair frequency and haplotype diversity. Genetic divergence among haplotypes was estimated by constructing genetic distance matrix using DNA sequence variations, by Kimura 2-parameter model. Variable sites and average variations of the sequenced 603 base pair long DNA fragment were calculated. All COI barcodes were matched with reference sequences of expected species according to morphological identification. Neighbor-joining tree was drawn based on DNA barcodes and all the specimens clustered in agreement with their taxonomic classification at species level. The evolutionary history inferred using the UPGMA method indicated two distinct mitochondrial haplotype lineages.

The composition of each fatty acid does not differ among species, which suggests that the feeding ecology and habitat use of the fish in the coral reef ecosystem are similar. The fatty acid concentrations, particularly that of PUFA, increase with the fish growth, which suggests that the diet and habitat shift during the life history of the fish.

     "abstract": "To explore the responses of arid-tolerant alpine plants to Pleistocene climatic oscillations, we examined the evolutionary history of Orinus thoroldii, a grass species endemic to the western Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) in China. Three maternally inherited chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers (matK, rbcL, and trnH-psbA) and the bi-parentally inherited nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) were sequenced for 243 individuals from 28 populations. In all, seven chloroplast haplotypes (H1\u2013H7) and seven nrITS types (S1\u2013S7) were detected. Whereas two haplotypes were widespread, each of the remaining five was restricted to single populations or shared with only its adjacent population. Phylogenetic analyses of the cpDNA haplotypes revealed two distinct lineages distributed in the eastern and western regions of the western QTP. Our analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated the major partitioning (66.56%) of cpDNA variation between the western and eastern groups. A significant phylogeographical structure was detected (NST\u00a0=\u00a00.81, GST\u00a0=\u00a00.72; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) based on the cpDNA dataset. The distribution of nrITS types also showed a certain geographical pattern. Whereas types S1 and S5 were widely distributed across the region, the others were exclusively restricted to specific populations. However, the two lineages discerned by the cpDNA sequence variations were not supported by phylogenetic and AMOVA analyses of nrITS variation. Based on documented mutation rates for grasses, we estimated that the two cpDNA lineages of this species diverged at 0.64 Ma during the Pleistocene. This divergence was very consistent with the largest glaciation recorded in the QTP. Long-distance pollen migrations probably blurred the divergence boundary at the nrITS sequence variations. These findings imply that O. thoroldii probably experienced a long-term allopatric divergence plus more recent regional expansions that corresponded to Pleistocene climate changes. Our data also suggest that this grass species survived throughout the Pleistocene glacial stage within the extremely adverse habitats of the QTP.",

However, the genetic background of Rehmannia glutinosa and related species remains largely unknown partially due to the lack of the molecular genetic markers. In this study, we developed 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers from Rehmannia glutinosa transcriptome databases and determined the genetic diversity among Rehmannia species. A total of 11,048 contigs containing perfect SSR loci were isolated from 374,444 Rehmannia glutinosa transcriptome reads. Among them, tetranucleotide repeat unit is the main type of SSR, accounting for 27% of all repeat types, followed by pentanucleotide, trinucleotide, dinucleotide and hexanucleotide motifs. Genetic diversity analysis showed that the number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 16, with the mean value of 9 and the average polymorphic information content of 0.71. The range of mean observed heterozygosity (Ho) and mean expected heterozygosity (HE) were 0.21\u20130.54 and 0.24\u20130.34, respectively, indicating the relatively low level of genetic diversity in Rehmannia. Both clustering and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) supported that populations from the same Rehmannia species formed one distinct lineage, Rehmannia glutinosa, Rehmannia solanifolia and Rehmannia henryi are closely related while Rehmannia piasezkii are separated from other species. Our work offered a rapid and simple method to develop microsatellites and these novel set of SSR markers provided an effective tool for population genetics study of Rehmannia.",

We examined the genetic variation and population structure of 12 populations (76 individuals) of P. clematidea from Fujian, Guangdong, and Hainan Provinces in China using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis. From an initial set of 69 ISSR primers, 10 were selected which yielded 80 reproducible bands. Polymorphic bands (P) were 100%, Shannon's information index (I) was 0.4226, and Nei's gene diversity (H) was 0.2791. We infer that the high levels of genetic diversity exhibited by P. clematidea may have contributed to its invasiveness. Gene flow among populations was 2.4930, which has led to homogenization. The coefficient of population differentiation (Gst\u00a0=\u00a00.1671) indicated low levels of genetic variation among populations and high levels of genetic polymorphism within populations. There was a negative correlation between population elevation and genetic diversity, while there was a significant positive correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance based on a Mantel test (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5820, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

We identified 86,501 reads (8.1% of all reads) that contained our definition of microsatellite loci. AC and TC were the most abundant motifs in the P. lewyana genome. TGC and AAAC were most abundant tri and tetra-nucleotide motifs respectively. 72.7% of microsatellite reads had flanking sequence regions suitable for primer design and PCR amplification. We validated the identified potentially amplifiable loci (PAL) and tested for polymorphism by selecting 15 loci corresponding to tetranucleotides. Twelve loci showed polymorphism in eight individuals.

In this study, phylogenetic relationships of Actinidia species with sympatric distributions were investigated using three chloroplast introns (trnL-F, atpB-rbcL and rpl32-trnL) and three Exon primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers. Chloroplast phylogeny supports non-monophyly of the five species studied excluding Actinidia fulvicoma var. lanata. The non-monophyly was also revealed by EPIC markers. Our results showed EPIC markers are more variable and informative for phylogenetic inference than that of chloroplast markers. The incongruences between loci from the plastid and nuclear DNA phylogenic trees may stem from incomplete lineage sorting or historical introgression hybridization. Incomplete lineage sorting may explain the non-monophyly between Actinidia chrysantha (section Maculatae) and other four species (section Stellatae), and introgression hybridization and high level of interspecific gene flow may explain the non-monophyly among the species of sect.

These analyzes reveal a continuous northwestern-southeastern gradient in population differentiation, and not two distinct clusters of populations as suggested in some previous studies. This more comprehensive analysis also reinforces that a simple process of stochastic differentiation do not explain the observed patterns.

Significant differences in T3 concentrations were detected. B. ballerus had substantially reduced T3 levels as compared to most other species of fish. Two hypotheses explaining the thyroid divergence are discussed. Despite differences in absolute T3 concentrations, both species manifest similar seasonal cycling with increased plasma T3 levels in warmer seasons and decreased T3 in colder seasons. Several peaks of plasma T3 level were registered: at pre-spawning periods, at mid-summer and in the early autumn. The pre-spawning peak noted in cyprinids was a novel observation.

These compounds have been proposed to be potential chemotaxonomic markers, but this application has not been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, sesquiterpenoids from 149 species of the genus Senecio were investigated to assess their taxonomic utility. The presence and absence were encoded as binary taxonomic characteristics and subsequently utilised in a clustering analysis. The previously biosynthesis pathway of sesquiterpenoids was taken into account to explore the relationship among these species contained different sesquiterpenoid types. In addition, the DNA phylogeny was also considered to explore the distribution and evolution of sesquiterpenoids in genus Senecio further. As a result, seven chemical major sections within the Senecio were recognised based on the chemical character. Although with several exceptions, the biosynthesis pathway, molecular phylogeny and the geographical origin of these sesquiterpenoid were found to be related to the chemical sections, which largely confirmed the validity of our chemo-classification for genus Senecio. In conclusion, we suggest that the sesquiterpenoid character in Senecio has some value for the genus taxonomy but should be analysed carefully and critically.",

Analysis of population genetics of the species aimed to clarify morphological variation, current distribution patterns, strong adaptability to habitats, and the effects of geological factors in the HHM region. The genetic structure results, based on PCoA and NJ cluster analyses, revealed that the populations of B. crispa were divided into two genetic groups. Furthermore, the peripheral populations had lower genetic diversity than the populations in the center of the distribution areas (Three Parallel Rivers). We conclude that the gene flow (predominantly seed and pollen flow) and the population differentiation of B. crispa might be more affected by the barriers formed by rivers and mountains than by geographic distance.",

Nonetheless, in this frame, genomic and organelle DNA isolation has been reported to be a limiting step, since downstream applications of molecular biology, such as restriction enzyme digestion, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing are hampered by the presence of compounds that are concurrently extracted. In this work we compared different DNA extraction techniques in three marine organisms and tested the downstream applications. One of the species utilized in this work was the Nudibranch Doris verrucosa L., a species with a well-known pharmaceutical interest. The phylogeny of this mollusc has long been discussed on the basis of morphological characters. As a result, D. verrucosa has often been misidentified with other sister species. Mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequence was chosen to better solve this concern and to accurately settle D. verrucosa into the right position. A partial sequence of the mt 16S rDNA of the Nudibranch D. verrucosa was obtained for the first time.The results here presented will provide knowledge useful to a better management and use of marine genetic resources, as well as in resolving taxonomic and identification issues currently open in these marine invertebrates.",

A pair of deletions (22 and 26\u00a0bp in length) in an intron part of the germacrene A synthase 1 gene differentiated the diploid from the tetraploid karyotype of H. decapetalus. The same deletion was found in one of the two alleles (299\u00a0bp in length) in H. x multiflorus, whereas a second allele (350\u00a0bp in length) showed a very high similarity with the sequence found in H. annuus. Quantification of the two amplification products in H. x multiflorus showed a higher concentration of the larger amplicon thus suggesting that H. annuus has contributed an unreduced genome to the hybrid. Comparison of variable regions of the cpDNA showed highest identity of H. x multiflorus with cpDNA sequences of the diploid H. decapetalus.

This mt-genome was 17,952\u00a0bp in length and consisted of 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, one control region (CR) and one pseudo-control region (CCR). Phylogenetic analyses of 14,644\u00a0bp of mitochondrial DNA (12 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs) revealed the phylogenetic position of Cathartidae (Cathartes aura) was more closer to Ciconiidae (storks) than Accipitridae. To investigate the divergence times of the CCRs in Falconiformes, detailed analyses of the noncoding regions (CR and CCR) were performed. We found the recently reported novel gene order in Falconiformes had multiple independent origins and hence cannot be used to infer phylogenetic lineages. Indeed, the molecular clock suggested the CCR in Falconidae emerged about 65.4 million years (Mya), while that in Pandionidae\u2013Accipitridae clade emerged about 19.16\u00a0Mya. The intra-genomic homology between the noncoding regions was detected in Spilornis cheela, which supporting the duplication hypothesis.

Although relatively high level of differentiation among the populations were observed, mismatch distribution and neutrality tests showed no evidence of recent demographic population expansion. Phylogenetic inference exhibited two identified population groups showing a disjunctive distribution of dominant haplotypes. The split in cpDNA was largely consistent with the Tanaka line and Red River geographically. Molecular clock estimations revealed that the two lineages diverged during Pleistocene approximately 1.16 Ma. Therefore, the disjunct distribution of T.chantrieri could be explained by both the vicariance caused by Red River as well as ecological barriers caused by the different monsoon climates (Southwest monsoon vs. Southeast monsoon) that developed during the Pleistocene. The Tanaka line can be considered as a climatically driven barrier that influenced present-day plant dispersal.",

There are three extant populations of the species; two large ones (approximately 300 and 620 adults) separated by under two kilometres, and a third very much smaller one slightly further away. Genetic theory expects that smaller, isolated populations face a loss in genetic variation through inbreeding and genetic drift and that as declining genetic variation is linked to a loss in fitness, this species may face extinction in the long term. This study used the ISSR-PCR genetic methods linked to an automated detection platform to determine if these populations are genetically distinct, and whether they are genetically depauperate. Two ISSR primers were used, and the automated detection system identified a total of 572 ISSR loci. An UPGMA clustering analysis showed each population to be genetically distinct, and that the genetic diversity of each population does not appear to be particularly low. F. tigrina is separable from the related Faucaria britteniae L. Bolus using the ISSR method, suggesting that this method may be appropriate for systematic studies in the Aizoaceae, which comprises many genera with closely related species.",

Genetic diversity and relationships among wild Lens species from Turkey has seldom been investigated. Additionally, a limited number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed for use in breeding and genetic studies of lentil crop. In this study, molecular characterization of 50 accessions mostly from Turkey, belonging to 6 wild and 1 cultivated Lens species, was performed using newly developed inter-primer binding site (iPBS) retrotransposons and inter-SSR (ISSR) markers. The 10 iPBS primers generated a total of 151 scorable bands, of which 150 were polymorphic (99.3%) with an average of 15.0 polymorphic fragments per primer. The 10 ISSR primers detected 138 scorable bands showing 100% polymorphism, with an average of 13.5 bands per primer. The average polymorphism information content (PIC) value for ISSR markers (0.97) was higher than that for iPBS markers (0.90). Lens orientalis was found to be the most diverse species, raising the possibility of wide crosses with cultivated species Lens culinaris. Cultivated varieties also showed high level of polymorphism, at 82.92% and 51.92% with ISSR and iPBS markers, respectively. Lens lamottei and Lens tomentosus were found as the least polymorphic species using both marker systems. The grouping of accessions and species within clusters were almost similar when iPBS and ISSR graphs were compared. Our data also suggested the role of iPBS-retrotransposons as \u2018a universal marker\u2019 for molecular characterization of wild and cultivated Lens species.",

However, in recent years, E. japonicus experienced a deep recession caused by over fishing. Therefore, determination of population genetic structure is essential to underpin resource recovery and to aid delineating and monitoring populations for fishery management. In this study, sequence variation of a 402-bp fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene from ten populations of E. japonicus in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea was determined, detecting 73 haplotypes. Haplotype diversities and nucleotide diversities for the ten populations ranged from 0.4706\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1177 (D) to 0.9935\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.210 (WH), and from 0.0014\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0013 (D) to 0.0090\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0053 (WH), respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed no significant differences at all hierarchical levels, and almost all FST values were non-significant, indicating no significant population genetic structure in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. Two indistinct clades with low support values were detected and the analysis of haplotype frequency distribution showed no significant geographic differences among populations. These results supported the null hypothesis that E. japonicus within the Yellow Sea and East China Sea constituted a panmictic mtDNA gene pool. Based on the present study, the existence of separate genetic stocks in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea were not detected. Strong dispersal capacity of planktonic larvae, and ocean current could be the reasons for genetic homogeneity in this species in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.",

In this study, nine microsatellite markers were used to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of Rhododendron jinggangshanicum, a threatened Rhododendron species endemic to Mount Jinggangshan, Jiangxi, China. A total of 119 individuals were collected from five populations. The results showed that R. jinggangshanicum harbors a high level of genetic diversity (AR\u00a0=\u00a04.760\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.638, HE\u00a0=\u00a00.642\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.200) and that its genetic diversity is partitioned primarily within populations. AMOVA results demonstrated weak yet significant differentiation among the populations (4.60%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which was consistent with the results of the pairwise FST. A marginally significant correlation was found between genetic differentiation and geographic distance, indicating that the genetic differentiation among the populations roughly follows a pattern of isolation by distance. STRUCTURE analysis showed that all of the individuals could be divided into two gene pools, which may be related to the local complex topography of Mount Jinggangshan.

Furthermore, the individual analysis of each STPs or the SSPs analyses, separately, were not enough to discriminate all accessions, since it was necessary to combine the data resulting from all protein profiles together to differentiate all Opuntia genotypes. The UPGMA analysis indicated that there is no separation between accessions of species of the prickly pear (sweet fruits) and \u201cxoconostle\u201d (acidic fruits), even though the latter were grouped together.

One such species is the pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, which has become widely distributed throughout Western Europe occurring primarily lakes and reservoirs. Although the species is known to have existed at least for four decades and expanded its distribution range in Turkish waters widely, virtually there is no study on the factors behind the species' establishment success. We hypothesized high environmental tolerance as well as high population structuring result in more successful establishment of pumpkinseed in new environments. We sampled three reservoirs, one canal and one stream located longitudinally along western part of Turkey to test this hypothesis. Optima (uk) and tolerance (tk) levels of the species were calculated with weighted averaging values for several measured environmental factors. Invasiveness of pumpkinseed populations was determined with the model proposed earlier examining the relationship between juvenile growth and age at maturity. The phylogenetic network of mitochondrial haplotypes was constructed for Turkish populations and other populations of pumpkinseed from native (North America) and introduced range (Europe). Potential invasiveness of pumpkinseed populations in Turkey was categorized as invasive in one location (Sar\u0131\u00e7ay stream) and transitional in other locations. Environmental tolerance values were higher in southern populations. Likewise phylogenetic network showed that the Turkish populations have unique haplotypes, which were originated from native North American populations suggesting a high differentiation in haplotypes. Results clearly demonstrate the effect of environmental factors on genetic structure and the establishment success of pumpkinseed.",

The within-inbreeding coefficient was low, ranging from \u22120.011 to 0.094.

Bayesian analyses revealed that A. winkleri is composed by two genetic groups. The number of migrants per generation was high (>1), which maintain localities' cohesion and gene flow. Despite genetic erosion was not detected in the present study, our results revealed that the four localities sampled actually represent one population, the only known so far in nature. Management strategies for A. winkleri conservation should be undertaken as it is an endemic species which occurs in a biome that has gone through major deforestation and fragmentation. This would avoid the increase of inbreeding rates and the loss of genetic diversity.",

This project is aim to investigate genetic diversity and genetic structure of this species for its conservation and management, using SSR data obtained from seven natural populations sampled from southeast of QTP. Seventeen selected primer pairs generated a total of 166 polymorphic bands. The Shannon diversity was comparably low within populations (0.115), but higher at the species level (0.251). An obvious population structure and high level of genetic differentiation (AMOVA-derived \u03a6ST\u00a0=\u00a00.48, G \u2032 ST =\u00a00.54 from Shannon index) were detected by clustering, principle coordinate analysis and STRCTURE.

Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were high within MS and CF groups, and the mismatch distribution analysis showed a bimodal profile in both groups, suggesting secondary contact between allopatrically evolved MS and CF groups.

In addition, FST estimates and Mantel test suggested that the population structure of P. yokohamae might have been influenced by low or restricted gene flow with isolation by distance, whereas no such population structuring was implied for P. schrenki. The observed difference in population structuring between two species was surmised by the difference of migration character.",

The results showed high genetic differentiation between eutrophic lake and oligotrophic lake. The genetic distances between P. pectinatus populations were significantly correlated with the species evenness, but not with difference in species richness of aquatic plant communities.

Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the haplotypes identified from the four putative populations (TXL, LX, PJ and LD) did not cluster into separate geographic branches. Despite habitat fragmentation, we failed to find evidence of genetic depletion or impediment of gene flow within the 6 localities.

Here we report the development of 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci from the genome of Eospalax cansus using 454 shot-gun sequencing. Genetic diversity was assessed using DNA samples of 47 individuals of E. cansus from a single location. Cross-amplification in Eospalax baileyi was also tested, with five polymorphic markers being amplified successfully. These markers are the first published microsatellites loci from E. cansus and will be invaluable for studies addressing ecological and behavioral questions involving E. cansus and E. baileyi, and potentially other species in Mysopalacinae.",

The results showed that S. younghusbandi populations had high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity, and the population genetic diversity of this species was at a low level. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most genetic variation occurred within populations, and that genetic differentiation was at low or moderate levels. The network of haplotypes based on Cyt b gene showed that there were two groups within the examined populations. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution analysis suggested that this species might have undergone a population expansion and the expansion time was estimated to be 0.25\u20130.46 Ma BP.

These primer combinations produced a total of 1,553 fragments and 1,517 polymorphic bands with a polymorphism percentage of 97.7%. Furthermore, the Shannon's information index of each primer combination ranged from 0.1593 to 0.4456. Neighbor-joining analyses revealed two main genetic clusters, corresponding to the fruit flesh types: (A-1) MF (melting flesh) with clingstone and ornamental peaches; (A-2) MF with freestone and NMF (non-melting flesh) with clingstone. Finally, cluster analyses revealed that all ornamental peaches are closely related to the MF with clingstone peach cultivars. The application of these primer combinations identified using SSAP will facilitate future cultivar identification and germplasm management in peaches.",

In the current study phylogeographic structure and diversification history of Spiraea alpina across the QTP were investigated for the first time based on nuclear internal transcribed spacer. The nuclear internal transcribed spacers (ITS1a\u2013ITS4) were generated for a total of 284 individuals distributed within 31 natural populations. A clear phylogeographic structure was found for S. alpina. The results showed that this species colonized in three different glacial refugia during the Quaternary extensive glaciation and expanded during the Interglacial period. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed 74.13% genetic diversity among populations and 25.87% genetic variation within populations with distinct phylogeographic structure (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.741*). The estimated divergence time revealed that the main lineages of S. alpina diversified during the Quaternary 1.2\u20130.6 million years ago. The study concluded that severe climatic oscillations during Quaternary and the uplift of QTP had a profound effect on intraspecific divergence of S. alpina.",

In order to protect the decreasing natural genetic resources of I. indigotica, three candidate DNA barcodes (ITS2, trnL-F and rbcL) were employed to establish an accurate and effective identification system for I. indigotica. The results demonstrated that all three candidate DNA barcodes have performed very well in I. indigotica. The interspecific genetic distances were obviously greater than the intraspecific distance among I. indigotica as indicated by ITS2, trnL-F and rbcL. Sequence alignment analysis of I. indigotica genotypes revealed that four SNPs (54, 108, 146 and 181\u00a0bp) located in ITS2, three (2, 30, 709\u00a0bp) in trnL-F and one (531\u00a0bp) in rbcL, respectively. UPGMA phylogenetic tree constructed from trnL-F and rbcL could allote I. indigotica to the correct corresponding genus, whereas rbcL could not distinguish I. indigotica from its adulterants. Meanwhile, UPGMA tree of ITS2 could accurately identify I. indigotica from its adulterants according to the corresponding species. Consequently, it can be concluded that ITS2 is a more suitable and accurate DNA barcode for identifying I. Indigotica and its adulterants than trnL-F and rbcL.",

An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) also revealed two genetic clusters. These results could reflect current aquacultural practices, with breeds and eggs exchanged between hatcheries, and/or genetic drift due to intensive breeding practices. Therefore, for the optimal management of resources, the genetic variation of hatchery stocks should be monitored and inbreeding controlled for the seven-band grouper stocks.

Those four molecular markers might be related to melon fruit maturing time. A considerably low level of genetic diversity was detected in Xinjiang melon accessions. Genetic distances indicated the relatively narrower genetic base but specific taxonomic status of Xinjiang landraces compared with foreign reference accessions.",

Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal cistron and the trnL-trnF regions. The phylogeny was constructed using the neighbor joining inference method. Results indicate that the examined samples were evidently diverged into 2 distinct clades.

To investigate the effects of grazing on genetic diversity in native plants, the dominant perennial wheatgrass Elymus nutans was used as a model to examine genetic diversity and spatial population structure under different grazing intensities. Intra-population genetic diversity in three grazed areas was higher than un-grazed area; however, the genetic diversity decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Genotypes from four areas were separated into two groups (grazed and un-grazed) through a clustering analysis. Approximately 12% (Gst\u00a0=\u00a00.1487) of the DNA variation was apportioned among populations by AMOVA indicating a relatively low degree of inter-population genetic differentiation. Significant spatial auto-correlations and subpopulation structure were also observed within the four areas, and the genetic \u2018patch\u2019 size decreased with increasing grazing intensity.

In the study, 22 chloroplast (cp) haplotypes were identified based on two cpDNA sequences (trnH\u2013psbA and ycf6\u2013psbM), and five ITS sequence variations were found. Shown in the cp haplotype network, the two common cp haplotypes mainly distributed along the northern and southern rims of the basin respectively and intersected in the center of the basin, whereas in the ITS network, ITS genotype 1 was widespread across the whole distribution area, and rare genotypes were concentrated in the western rim of the basin. Genetic variation primarily occurred among populations and SAMOVA groups. Fragmented desert habitat may have caused gene flow barrier among populations or groups far from each other, leading to significant genetic differentiation at these levels. It appears that expansion and contraction cycles of river systems and oases during the middle Pleistocene was the source of the observed fragmentation. Geographic range expansion in H. polydichotoma was supported by the significant value for Tajima's D, Fu's FS, and by a unimodal mismatch distribution. It was possible that the enlargement of the Taklimakan Desert during the middle Pleistocene may have provided appropriate conditions for the range dispersal.

The results showed that Genetic diversity at species level was high (PPB: 76.7%; HE: 0.3131; H: 0.4524). However, relatively low genetic diversity existed within populations. Population in Guangdong (GD) exhibits the greatest level of variability (PPB: 65.1%; HE: 0.2573, H: 0.3766), whereas the population in Fengyangshan (FYS) finds its own variability at the lowest level (PPB: 51.5%; HE: 0.1959, H: 0.2886). Based on the genetic analyses of the ISSRs, a relatively high level of genetic differentiation among populations was revealed by Nei's gene diversity statistics (22.3%), Shannon's information measure (21.5%) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (18.4%). The main factors responsible for the relatively high level of differentiation among populations are probably related to the predominant outcrossing reproductive system and recent habitat fragmentation, and a significant correlation was found between genetic distance and geographic distance (r\u00a0=\u00a00.9087, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Here, ISSR analysis of a common wetland species Heleocharis valleculosa (Cyperaceae) was conducted to evaluate if the seed bank has higher, equal or lower genetic variation than the above ground vegetation. Our results showed high genetic diversity in the seed bank, so the seedbank can act as a storehouse of genetic variation for the above ground vegetation, especially in unfavorable conditions. Thus, unlike terrestrial habitats where genetic diversity is often low, wetlands that are connected with water flow can accumulate many genotypes in the seed bank and the question of how genetic diversity varies above and below ground is still open.",

Here we provide the first description of the genetic diversity of this species in the Caribbean using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) sequences and seven microsatellite loci from 25 skin samples collected from four stranding events in Jamaica, Puerto Rico, British Virgin Islands, and Trinidad and Tobago. Overall, three CR haplotypes were identified; of these, one was unique for the Caribbean (Car 1), while a second (haplotype D) was previously reported in the Western North Atlantic, and a third (Haplotype A) was found to be common in the South Pacific. Even though sample size (n\u00a0=\u00a025) was small, microsatellite analysis showed a low level of relatedness between the stranded whales. Our results provide relevant preliminary information on the genetic diversity of short-finned pilot whales in the Caribbean, reporting one previously unknown and unique haplotype for this region. Further research should be carried out in the Caribbean to further our knowledge on this species, particularly since its prone to mass stranding.",

Ammonia levels decreased in the liver and increased in the muscle with increasing water pH. In the kidney, lower ammonia levels were observed at neutral pH. An increase in water pH decreased the glucose, glycogen and lactate levels in the liver and kidney (except for glycogen levels in the kidney and lactate levels in the liver, which presented lower levels at neutral pH). In muscle, the glucose and glycogen levels decreased with increasing water pH, whereas lactate levels tended to be lower at neutral pH. Gill and kidney Na+/K+-ATPase activities tended to increase in alkaline water, and the highest value was observed in fish exposed to pH 9.0. The optimal levels of the analyzed biochemical parameters occurred at neutral pH.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to observe groupings and trends in the data matrix. An orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed which resulted in clear groups between the two taxa. Several flavonoid and triterpenoid glycoside derivatives contribute to the quantitative chemotypic variation within and between the species as observed.

In order to explore the advantages, limitations and designing aspects of this method, we have used the conventional (electrophoretic) MHS-PCR as a reference, and designed species-discrimination assays for three fishes of the genus Spicara: Spicara smaris, Spicara maena and Spicara flexuosa. These small-size fishes exhibit marked phenotypic diversity that hinders their discrimination. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from twelve Mediterranean Spicara individuals and were used for the designing of two primer-sets that were subsequently tested on Spicara specimens from six sampling locations of Eastern Mediterranean. All examined samples were correctly assigned by both conventional and melt-curve MHS-PCR, proving that the MC-MHS-PCR is as reliable and discriminatory as the MHS-PCR. Moreover, the MC-MHS-PCR is very rapid, easily implemented, straightforward, and minimizes the risk of sample mix-up and laboratory contamination. These features render the method suitable for large-scale discrimination tests, particularly for studies that include small number of species.",

In germination bioassays, neither of the \u03b1-pinene stereoisomers showed change when compared to the control with respect to seed vigour; but root growth was increased, while \u03b2-pinene (racemic mixture) inhibited germination and plant length. In the growth bioassay, all of the pinene isomers decreased the plant length. In general, \u03b2-pinene terpene was more phytotoxic than \u03b1-pinene in both bioassays. Differences in germination and growth of maize treated with the pinene isomers can be attributed to different action mechanisms which depends both on the growth phases of maize and on the particular pinene isomers.",

We compared the removal of pollutants by R. sceleratus in a eutrophic sewage system in the presence and the absence of algae. The rate of removal without algae was 16.2\u201320.5% of that with algae. NH 4 + \u2013 N was removed most readily by R. sceleratus. The effects of R. sceleratus on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa were also investigated in two allelopathic modes. The level of algal inhibition after the addition of an extract of Ranunculus scleratus was 57.1\u201378.9% greater than that in a co-culture test. To understand the role of allelopathy interference with algal development, we also determined the total flavonoid contents of plants, which ranged from 3.57\u00a0g to 20.19\u00a0g per plant. The cell density of Microcystis aeruginosa was negatively correlated with the total flavonoids in R. sceleratus, although aquatic macrophytes may contain other allelochemicals involved with algal inhibition in addition to flavonoid compounds. The environmental effects of R. sceleratus were significantly correlated with its growth stage (or water retention time), plant height, and biomass. This study suggests that R. sceleratus has potential for the low-effort and sustainable management of freshwaters, particularly the removal of nutrient pollutants and the reduction of excessive algal growth, which may be attributable to allelochemicals such as flavonoids. The in situ environmental restoration effects of R. sceleratus require further investigation at the ecosystem level.",

Additionally, a subset of 21 selected compounds, including hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols and terpenes, allowed a distinction between Eurasian otter, red deer and fallow deer. Eurasian otter scats were characterized mainly by the presence of aldehydes that may arise from oxidative degradation of unsaturated fatty acids present in fish species, included in their diet. Red deer volatile profile is characterized by terpenes compounds, presumably related with diet, while fallow deer achieved also chemical communication markers: 2-propanone and hexane. The scat volatile profiles provide information that explains their odour and also the type of diet (herbivorous or carnivorous) and intra-specific communication through chemical signals.

Herein we focused on the possible co-occurrence of ROS, (poly)phenols and IAA\u00a0at the same gall tissues, and their involvement in growth and development of different gall morphotypes.

There are about 400 rare or threatened plants and animals in this landform, but little information on genetic aspects of these species has been available. Of them, Firmiana danxiaensis is a dominant tree species endemic to Mount Danxia, a typical Danxia landform in northern Guangdong, China. In this study, we examined genetic diversity and population structure of F. danxiaensis, in comparison with two other narrowly distributed Firmiana species, Firmiana hainanensis and Firmiana kwangsiensis, which grow in non-Danxia-landform regions. Nine microsatellite markers were used to investigate genetic diversity and differentiation in a total of 256 individuals from nine populations of F. danxiaensis, three of F. hainanensis, and one of F. kwangsiensis. The results showed that F. danxiaensis had the lowest genetic diversity (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.364\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.019) among the three species, but weak population structure similar to another Firmiana species (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.042 and 0.020, respectively). This low genetic diversity observed in F. danxiaensis is possibly due to confined natural distribution range and strong selective pressure in soils of Danxia landform, which may also be true for other endemic species in Danxia landform. For the long term survival of these endemic species, habitat conservation and anthropogenic introduction to similar habitats such as the adjacent Danxia landform areas should be two major strategies.",

In this research it was intended to compare the growth, pigment composition, photosynthetic efficiency and extracellular polysaccharides production of unicellular and colonial strains of M. aeruginosa. A significantly growth inhibition under iron-limited condition on unicellular M. aeruginosa was noted, whereas the colonial strain could maintain a steady growth along with the culture time. This observation was reconfirmed by the content of chlorophyll a. Compared with unicellular strain; the colonial strain exhibited a higher PSII maximum light energy transformation, photosynthetic oxygen evolution and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) production in iron-limited condition. Further, in order to gain more information about the accessibility of iron in the two phenotypic Microcystis, we found the two strains could produce hydroxamate-type siderophores, the content of siderophores produced by the colonial strain was more than those in unicellular strain under the iron-limited condition. It was interpreted as an adaptation to the dilute environment. Our results demonstrated that the colonial phenotypes possessed stronger ability to endure iron-limited condition than unicellular strain by higher pigment contents, higher photosynthetic activities, higher EPS production and higher siderophores secretion. It might elucidate that the colonial M. aeruginosa bloom can sustain in eutrophic reservoirs and lakes.",

Six primers were used to generate 62 bands, of which 39 were polymorphic (62.9%). The total genetic diversity was similar in the wild (HT\u00a0=\u00a00.296) and orchard (HT\u00a0=\u00a00.291) groups, and slightly lower in the backyard group (HT\u00a0=\u00a00.281). Wild populations (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.13) were less differentiated than backyard (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.17) and orchard (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.21) populations. The wild and backyard groups were genetically closer (0.015) than the wild and orchard (0.018) groups. A Mantel test revealed a positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances (r\u00a0=\u00a00.433, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In conclusion, gene flow and the prevailing management system have efficiently maintained genetic diversity and facilitated inter-population differentiation in S. queretaroensis.",

However, it is not clear whether E. crassipes has an adverse impact on the waters in which heavy blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa occur. The objective of this study was to understand the interactions of E. crassipes with toxigenic M. aeruginosa and the consequences on environmental safety. Thus, the growth, physiological characteristics, microcystin production and release of M. aeruginosa influenced by E. crassipes were investigated using a co-existence experiment. The risk of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) accumulation in E. crassipes was also evaluated. Our results indicated that the cell death of M. aeruginosa occurred at a quicker pace due to the presence of E. crassipe. But the caspase-3 activity of M. aeruginosa, as the proxy for programmed cell death, was suppressed significantly by E. crassipes. Photosystem (PS) II-Hill reaction in M. aeruginosa was not significantly interrupted by E. crassipes, but a direct positive relationship between phycocyanin (PC) and algae biomass (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.661, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and a consistent relationship between phycocyanin/allophycocyanin (PC/APC) ratio in M. aeruginosa and algae biomass (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.598, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were found to be statistically significant. These results suggested that the energy harvest and electron transfer processes in the photosystem of M. aeruginosa might be disturbed by E. crassipes due to its damage of PC and a change in the PC/APC ratio. After this 12-day experiment, the level of extracellular MC-LR was significantly eliminated from 212.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.05\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 to 18.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 and the MC-LR production in M. aeruginosa was not stimulated by the influence of E. crassipes.

     "abstract": "The distribution of arable weeds extends over regions, where the species occur naturally in different kinds of habitats and regions, where they are mainly limited to arable fields.Here, we present a comparative study on the genetic structure of the arable weed Sherardia arvensis L. comprising populations from Mediterranean grasslands in Southern France and populations from arable fields in Germany. Enhanced by intensified land use since the 1960th, overall population density in Germany is very low compared to the density of populations in Southern France. We tested whether genetic variation within and among populations differ between France and Germany due to different patterns of distribution and land use. Therefore, we analysed 231 individuals of S. arvensis from 24 populations using AFLPs. Based on fragment analysis data we compared spatial genetic structure and genetic variation of populations from the two regions.Genetic variation within populations from the two regions (Shannon Index\u00a0=\u00a00.13 for both) and genetic variation among populations (26.8% and 30.0% in an analysis of molecular variance) were comparable. In both regions a drift-migration model supported the assumption of gene flow between populations. However, a clear correlation of geographical and genetic distances could only be reported for the indigenous populations from France (r\u00a0=\u00a00.46; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), whereas in Germany a spatial genetic relationship between populations was missing (r\u00a0=\u00a00.16; P\u00a0=\u00a00.21).Our study revealed that neither French nor German populations are genetically impoverished. For French populations further the spatial genetic structure suggests that there is current gene flow between populations through pollinators and seed dispersal by cattle. For German populations comparable levels of genetic diversity and gene flow were detected, but gene flow was random. This can be traced back in all likelihood to diffuse dispersal by agriculture and the mechanical reshuffling of the individuals from the soil seed bank.",

In this study, we used 454 pyrosequencing to discover microsatellites from A. pallidus that will enable the long-term mark-recapture work conducted at Mo-Singto to be complemented by molecular ecology and population genetic studies. In addition, we conducted fragment analysis to examine the level of genetic diversity exhibited by the Mo-Singto population.

Upon screening 26 loci via PCR-based genotyping assays, we identified nine polymorphic loci and used eight of these to examine genetic diversity in the Mo-Singto population. The results of these analyses suggest that the Mo-Singto population is moderately diverse (mean number of effective alleles across eight loci\u00a0=\u00a03.36, standard deviation\u00a0=\u00a01.78), is more-or-less in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, and has not recently been subject to severe population reduction.",

A low level of genetic diversity was detected: HE\u00a0=\u00a00.301 for SSR and HE\u00a0=\u00a00.28 for cpSSR. Populations were highly differentiated from one another: an AMOVA analysis that showed that 56.3% and 68.2% genetic variation resided between populations based on SSR and cpSSR analysis, respectively, and FST and FSTc (0.467 for SSR and 0.644 for cpSSR, respectively) were high. Significant differences were found between estimates of haplotypic differentiation calculated by using unordered alleles (GSTc\u00a0=\u00a00.857) and ordered alleles (NSTc\u00a0=\u00a00.728), which indicated the existence of phylogeographical structure in P. sinense.

Starting from 20 microsatellite loci, we identified a set of 9 polymorphic EST-SSRs, with a number of alleles per locus ranging from 2 to 7, and a number of genotypes from 3 to 13. The nine polymorphic EST-SSRs discriminated most of the analyzed genotypes with the exceptions of some cultivated clones having similar phenotypic features and probably belonging to cultivar-populations, and clarified some cases of homonymy.A neighbor joining dendrogram generated three main clusters which did not show a correlation with the distribution areas of the analyzed genotypes. A Bayesian analysis evidenced a high degree of admixture among the gene pools from the three countries.

This separation is based on the morphometric analysis of the fruits and in the high levels of asarone present only in the essential oil of the subsp. maximus. The remaining subspecies are difficult to distinguish from each other based on the morphology of the fruits and in DNA content. However, based on the essential oils, it was possible to distinguish the subspecies halophilus from the other two (subsp. gummifer and subsp. carota) because of its high content of elemicin, with the other two having high levels of geranyl acetate.Based on these results, the subspecies maximus is proposed as a different species (Daucus maximus Desf.) and the taxonomic status of other three subspecies (subsp. carota, subsp. gummifer and subsp. halophilus) is maintained.

The size of the SCAR fragments was concordant with that of the RAPD species-specific fragments.

In this work, we are reporting the occurrence of a new chemotype for L. origanoides, characterized by an essential oil rich in (E)-methyl cinnamate and (E)-nerolidol, with fruity-woody odor, reminiscent of cinnamon, strawberry and wood. The oil yield varied from 1.7% to 4.6%, which is considered a significant value for the production of essential oils on an industrial scale.

     "abstract": "Melastoma comprises more than 20 shrub species and is distributed in tropical Asia and Oceania. Melastoma penicillatum, the most narrowly distributed taxon of this genus in China, was recently incorporated into another morphologically similar species, M. sanguineum. Based on its distinct morphological traits, unique habitat and flowering time, we propose that M. penicillatum should be a distinct species. In this study, we sequenced three nuclear genes and four chloroplast intergenic spacers of M. sanguineum and M. penicillatum at two locations in Hainan to test this hypothesis. There was no sequence variation at all four chloroplast intergenic spacers within and between M. sanguineum and M. penicillatum, suggesting that they should have diverged recently. However, they showed strong divergence at all three nuclear genes and no shared haplotypes were observed between them. Bayesian clustering-based STRUCTURE analysis revealed that individuals of M. sanguineum and M. penicillatum were clustered into their own clades. Fst calculations showed that both taxa had marked population genetic differentiation, but population differentiation in M. penicillatum was stronger than that in M. sanguineum. Stronger population differentiation in M. penicillatum may be caused by its discontinuous high-elevation and understory habitats, which is disadvantageous for bird-mediated dispersal. Our analysis based on the isolation-with-migration (IM) model revealed bidirectional, asymmetrical gene flow in M. sanguineum and little gene flow in M. penicillatum. Taken together, our results indicate that M. penicillatum is a distinct species and should not be incorporated into M. sanguineum. The two species might have diverged recently, and lineage sorting has been incomplete. Differential adaptation to different elevations might have led to speciation in this case.",

     "abstract": "The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is the main oyster species cultivated in Korea. Despite a long history of hatchery practices, little is known about the population genetics of native populations of C. gigas in Korea. This study examined the population structure and genetic diversity of 297 individuals of C. gigas in six populations, representing two major geographically separated habitats along the coast of Korea, using multiplex assays with nine highly polymorphic loci. All populations showed very high genetic diversity, with a deficit of heterozygotes and a recent bottleneck. No significant differences were found in the genetic diversity of the two geographically separated oyster groups, although significant, but minimal, genetic differentiation was observed (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.003, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). This was mainly due to genetic differences between the oyster populations from Taean and Gaduk, suggesting that the oyster is not panmictic. This result was corroborated by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and multidimensional scaling analysis. It was inconsistent with a previous finding of no population differentiation using mitochondrial sequence analysis, implying rather recent separation of the two geographic populations. This genetic differentiation might have resulted from the combined of various factors, such as historical dispersal, the local environment, and ocean currents. Nonetheless, these results mean that the two geographical groups should be treated as independent units for proper resource management. Our results provide critical information on the ecological and economic potential of the Korean Pacific oyster.",

A relatively high species-level genetic diversity and low population-level genetic diversity exist in this species, and large genetic differentiation exists between two main populations with significant geographical isolation. Based on a previous artificial simulation mating test, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker was used in the present study to assess genetic diversity of filial generation colonies generated by different mating modes and to clarify genetic effects of various mating modes. The filial generation colonies generated by natural pollination and by geitonogamy were found to be similar to each other in terms of their relatively low genetic parameters and minimum genetic differentiation. This indicated that under natural conditions, selfing might occur at a higher proportion leading to the low genetic diversity within the population. The degree of genetic diversity of the filial generation colonies generated by outbreeding was highest, followed by inbreeding (xenogamy) and selfing (geitonogamy). Moreover, genetic differentiation between filial generation colonies generated by selfing (geitonogamy) and inbreeding (i.e., xenogamy) was much smaller than that between filial generation colonies generated by selfing and outbreeding. The results indicated that the genetic effect of outbreeding was much more dominant than other mating modes. Therefore, artificially promoting outbreeding between the two isolated geographically populations contributed to the enhancement of genetic diversity in populations in S. chinensis.",

Compounds emitted by flowers from five cultivars were collected using the static headspace method, and endogenous compounds in the flowers were extracted with ethyl acetate. Samples were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The result showed that benzenoids were the dominant compounds, of which benzyl acetate was the principal component contributing to the floral scent of P. mume. A clustering analysis of the floral volatiles from the different cultivars suggested that the scent traits of hybrids are related to the taxonomic relationship between their parents. The correlations between the amount of the endogenous and emitted compounds revealed that benzyl acetate had a stronger tendency to be volatile than the other compounds and the volatilisation rate of volatile compounds varied greatly among different cultivars.

     "abstract": "Satureja mutica (Lamiaceae) is an herbaceous medicinal plant which grows in Iran. The objective of the study was to obtain an overview of the genetic relatedness among and within seven populations of this species using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR). Fourteen ISSR primers amplified a total of 197 DNA fragments of which 176 (88.91%) were polymorphic. All ISSR primers were highly effective in discriminating among the populations. Genetic similarity coefficients ranged from 0.45 to 0.94, indicating considerable distance and diversity in the germplasm and were confirmed by clustering analysis. The dendrogram showed a clear clustering pattern of plants indicating a significant association between genetic similarity and geographical distance. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that a greater proportion of total genetic variation existed within populations (75%) rather than among populations (25%). The study indicated that ISSR markers were effective and reliable for assessing the degree of genetic variation of S. mutica. These findings can support future research on the selection of S. mutica for breeding and medicinal plant development.",

However, it has been strongly fragmented due to land use intensification during the last centuries.We analysed the impact of fragmentation on the genetic variation of a typical renosterveld species, the annual herb Nemesia barbata. For our investigation we selected populations of the species in 20 renosterveld fragments of different sizes in the Cape lowlands and determined genetic variation within and between populations using amplified fragment polymorphsims (AFLPs). We expected genetic pauperisation within small and isolated fragments and a lack of gene flow between these fragments.We observed considerable genetic variation within but only a low level of variation between populations. Genetic variation within populations was not correlated with the size of the fragment or the distance to the nearest adjacent fragment. However, genetic variation between populations was positively correlated with geographic distance between fragments, indicating historical and/or actual gene flow.Based upon our results, we conclude that habitat fragmentation does not yet influence the genetic variation of N. barbata. Historical and possibly actual gene flow, combined with buffering effects of the soil seed bank, appear to have minimized the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation on genetic variation of this renosterveld species.",

In this study, six natural populations of this species across Shanxi were selected to investigate the genetic variation of the species using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Results showed that in comparison with some other species of Larix, higher genetic diversity was revealed at the species level for L. principis-rupprechtii (percentage of polymorphic loci PPL\u00a0=\u00a071.9%, Nei's gene diversity HE\u00a0=\u00a00.225, Shannon information index I\u00a0=\u00a00.341).

The differentiation can be attributed to the limited gene flow (Nm\u00a0=\u00a01.035) among populations, which could be due to the spatial isolation and habitat fragmentation. The six populations can be divided into three groups based on the Nei's genetic distances between populations (from 0.033 to 0.076).

Analysis of short interspersed element (SINE) insertions, which vary among individuals, has been acknowledged to provide a unique way to study population divergence. SINEs isolated from C. nasus were characterized, and this enabled analysis of the SINE insertion pattern in six populations distributed throughout the Yangtze River basin. In all populations, four SINE loci displayed individual polymorphism, and two SINE loci showed a stochastic loss in all individuals of two resident populations. The correlation between genetic and geographic populations indicated a degree of genetic isolation in this species. In contrast with Coilia grayii and Coilia mystus, two SINE loci appeared only in C. nasus. Sequencing analysis indicated that the high insertion variability of SINEs was attributed mainly to the tails, which contained various repeat copies.

The chain length of n-alkanes from Bei-bei was longer than that from other areas. The even/odd predominance (EOP) or odd/even predominance (OEP) occurred in short-chain n-alkanes of plant epicuticular wax might be correlated with their growing environments. All Carbon Preference Index (CPIs) and Average Chain Length (ACLs) from Bei-bei were lower than those from other sampling areas, mainly attributing to the higher numbers of short- and mid-chain n-alkanes in plants from Bei-bei. Cluster analysis revealed that H. scandens from Bei-bei and F. virens from Mountain Jin-yun were different from other species. Based on these findings, it seems that environmental conditions contribute to the complex patterns and variation of n-alkanes and different plant species had different responses to environment changes.

Stressed plants of both accessions showed an increase in the sesquiterpenic fraction and a decrease in the monoterpenic one, although changes in volatile percentages were highly related to the accession.

Compared with the other orchids, G. elata showed a low level of genetic variation within populations (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.356\u20130.622).

     "abstract": "Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 23 populations of chamomile. Ten primers were applied, producing 193 polymorphic bands. The polymorphic bands were analysed using Simple Matching (SM) similarity index and UPGMA cluster analysis. The resulting dendrogram consisted of four major groups which were in accordance to the geographical regions from which the populations had originated. Populations from North-western (NW), South-Eastern (SE), Central (C) Iran and Europe tended to be classified separately into groups. The highest gene diversity was observed in populations from the Central regions of Iran (0.25). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) confirmed the results of cluster analysis, while morphological classification was not related to molecular results. The population from Hungary had the greatest yield of essential oil (0.88 gr/dw), whereas for Iranian ones the greatest and the lowest essential oil yields belonged to NW (Aza\u00a0=\u00a00.6 and Ard\u00a0=\u00a00.7) and C (Isf 4, Isf 5 and Isf 6\u00a0=\u00a00.44) regions, respectively.

Total lipids of P. caesia and corals were formed by the same lipid classes. The lipids of P. caesia contained specific for cnidarians monoalkyldiacylglycerols and phosphonolipids. The proportion between reserve and structural lipid classes of P. caesia was similar to that of alcyonarians (soft corals), but significantly differed from reef-building corals. This similarity may be caused by the similar energy budget of cnidarian colonies without hard exoskeleton. The distribution of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), such as 22:4n-6 and 22:5n-3, indicated pathways of biosynthesis of PUFAs in Palythoa to be closer to those in reef-building corals than in soft corals. The differences in the profiles of common FAs between P. caesia and reef-building corals were showed. Zoanthid lipids contained rare \u03945,9 non-methylene-interrupted (NMI) PUFAs (with two and three double bounds), which probably originated from microorganisms associated with P. caesia.

To better understand the genetic structure and differentiation among remnant populations of L. chinense, we determined the genotypes of 14 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) loci across 318 individuals from 12 natural populations and 750 seedlings from five offspring populations. We found that L. chinense maintained high genetic diversity (He\u00a0=\u00a00.7385) within populations but moderate genetic differentiation (Fst\u00a0=\u00a00.1956) and low gene flow (Nm\u00a0=\u00a01.0283) between populations. The genetic diversity was slightly lower for offspring populations than for their corresponding natural populations. Moreover, using a two-phased model of mutation (TPM), we demonstrated that significant bottlenecks had occurred in six populations. A Mantel test revealed a statistically significant correlation between the geographic distances and genetic distances between populations (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5011, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Hence, we presume that geographical isolation and habitat fragmentation might contribute jointly to current population structure of L. chinense.

However, most studies on genetic relationships in Paeonia are limited to the first group. This study used 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers that were developed by magnetic bead enrichment to explore the genetic diversity of 89 genotypes collected from Beijing, the USA and Canada and introduced to China. From 145 allelic loci that were detected from 15 primers, 140 (96.6%) were polymorphic. The number of allelic loci ranged from 4 to 16 with an average of 9.3, and the polymorphic index content ranged from 0.362 to 0.825 with an average of 0.678. Both cluster analysis and principal component analysis based on the 15 polymorphic primer pairs could distinguish the species from cultivars although the cluster analysis was better able to reflect the genetic relationships between all individuals.

Significant correlation between ROL and photosynthetic rate existed in Cyperus flabelliformis wetland (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Both ROL and photosynthesis represented close correlations with nutrient removal rates in all four monocultures. Significant differences in ROL, photosynthetic rate, removal rates of NH4+, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were found among the four species. ROL and photosynthetic rates showed single-peak daily and seasonal patterns, with maximum daily values around noon, and with maximum yearly values in summer or autumn for the four monocultures.

     "abstract": "Larix Mill., a boreal forest genus, distributes in Eurasia and North America. Larix sibirica and some related species of this genus have wide distributions in the northeastern, northwestern and southwestern regions of China. To elucidate the response of populations to different regional historical events, we investigated the spatial genetic structures and the divergence time of genotypes in these Larix species based on two cpDNA fragments. To approach this question, we have also modelled the change of glacial-interglacial distributions for populations in different regions using the species distribution modelling. The results of analyses of molecular variance indicate genetic variation mainly occurred between three isolated regions (74.4%). Distributions of Larix have possibly undergone contractions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period in comparison with their present-day distributions in all three regions. Recent rapid uplift of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau likely promoted the high level of genetic diversity (\u03c0\u00a0=\u00a00.69\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123, Hd\u00a0=\u00a00.711) and Plio-Pleistocene (1.9\u20132.7\u00a0Ma) lineage divergence in the southwestern region. Founder effect and genetic drift accompanied by postglacial colonizations are expected to shape one dominated haplotype and southern LGM distribution in the northeastern region.

Twelve EST-primer pairs efficiently differentiated wild and cultivated blueberries, making this technology valuable for genome mapping and for long-term conservation of blueberry resources for the benefit of germplasm conservation and breeding purposes.",

Reliable identification of cryptic species of Xiphopenaeus spp. has fundamental implications for management and conservation of the sea-bob shrimp fishery stocks. The assay was developed based on sequence polymorphisms of 130 specimens of both species, comprising samples from Venezuela to the southern coast of Brazil, validated by the amplification of 368 adult shrimp samples from nine different locations and confirmed by direct sequencing. The methodology has been optimized to enable the identification of equi-molar mixtures of DNA from up to 10 individuals by PCR reaction, allowing the fast and cheap identification of many specimens for large scale studies on fisheries biology and population genetics. The DNA pooling strategy enabled the identification of a new locality of occurrence of Xiphopenaeus sp. II in the Brazilian coast, Caravelas, indicating that the species distribution may be continuous on the coast, and not disjoint as observed so far.",

     "abstract": "The Baekdudaegan, a mountain range that runs north to south along the Korean Peninsula, has been suggested to harbor important glacial refugia for boreal and temperate plant species. A series of allozyme-based genetic studies supports this trend. A large effective population size (Ne) is suggested as one of major factors contributing to maintaining moderate or high levels of within-population genetic variation in these plant species. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels and patterns of allozyme diversity, tested recent bottlenecks, and estimated recent migration rates in 10 subpopulations (collected within a distance of ca. 640 m) of the boreal Lilium cernuum at Mt. Deokhang, in the central part of the Baekdudaegan. We found high levels of within-population genetic variation as well as a low between-population genetic differentiation (He\u00a0=\u00a00.206 and FST\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Based on the FST estimate and mean recent migration rate, we approximately calculated a total effective population size of 508 across 10 subpopulations. Consistent with this, we found no evidence of recent bottlenecks in the subpopulations. This study reveals that subpopulations of L. cernuum at Mt. Deokhang are effectively large (on the order of hundreds), and that high levels of gene flow occur among them, probably due to the species' high potential for seed dispersal. These demographic and life-history traits, coupled with its high levels of genetic diversity, suggests that this cold-adapted species would have found large refugial areas in these mountains (i.e., macrorefugia) during the Last Glacial Maximum.",

A 62.8% of the total of 194 SSRs/species combinations showed a successful, homologous and cross-species amplification. As expected, a great success in SSRs transferability among Cedrela species was observed. Twenty-one screened SSRs showed a successful amplification pattern in all target species and many of them were polymorphic (9, 13, 13 and 7 SSRs for C. fissilis, C. balansae, C. saltensis and C. angustifolia, respectively). The high number of evaluated SSRs from the Cedrela genus and Meliaceae family, allowed us to obtain a suitable set of validated markers that are highly variable and easily scored, and also identify those which were less sturdy. We were able to retain a useful set of markers for three of the target species, but not for C. angustifolia. This could be due to its greater phylogenetic and morphological distances to the other three species. The lack of SSRs developed for our target species, transforms the transferred SSRs reported here in a valuable tool to monitor the genetic consequences of forest overexploitation on Cedrela species.",

We hypothesized two scenarios of post-glacial re-colonization of warm-temperate species in relation to current levels of genetic diversity within their populations. If extant Korean populations originated from a single source (a single glacial refugium), we expect significantly lower levels of genetic diversity relative to those from Japan due to founder effects. Alternatively, if they were derived from multiple source populations, levels of genetic diversity within Korean populations will not be significantly reduced compared to those of Japanese ones. To test which of these scenarios is more likely, we investigated the patterns of genetic diversity in 14 populations (seven from southern Korea and seven from southern Japan) of the broad-leaved evergreen tree Machilus thunbergii, employing 11 allozyme loci. High levels of genetic variation in M. thunbergii were found both in southern Korea and southern Japan, with a considerable genetic homogeneity not only between the two regions but also between populations within the two regions. These results suggest a pattern of re-colonization after the LGM fitting the second scenario (immigration from multiple refugia), probably through multiple waves and/or with large founder populations.",

Under this scenario, high levels of genetic variation and low or moderate degree of differentiation among populations within these species were expected. To test this hypothesis, we examined levels of allozyme diversity (14 loci) in eight populations of the boreal herb Lilium cernuum, which in Korea occurs largely along the Baekdudaegan and, as a reference, in eight populations of its congener Lilium amabile, a temperate species that is distributed on lower hillsides in peripheral regions of the Baekdudaegan. L. cernuum harbored higher levels of genetic variation within populations than L. amabile (%P\u00a0=\u00a049.1 vs. 25.0, A\u00a0=\u00a01.71 vs. 1.34, and He\u00a0=\u00a00.159 vs. 0.048). Genetic differentiation among populations was low for both species (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.119 and 0.014 for L. cernuum and L. amabile, respectively). A series of historical and ecological factors may explain the contrasting levels of genetic diversity between L. cernuum and L. amabile: occurrence within the main ranges of the Baekdudaegan (enduring the glacial periods in macrorefugia) vs. low elevation peripheral areas (in microrefugia) and shade-tolerant vs. shade-intolerant. This study, as well as previous population genetics studies, strongly suggests that the Baekdudaegan merits high priority for conservation given its proposed role as glacial refugia for montane species.",

While the pheromone system of the red-sided garter snake has been the subject of many studies, relatively little is known about the pheromone systems of other garter snakes. Through chemical analyses, we demonstrate that female skin lipids of the red-spotted garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis concinnus), northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), and plains garter snake (Thamnophis radix) contain similar methyl ketones. The methyl ketone profiles of these snakes differ qualitatively from one another and from the methyl ketone profiles of red-sided garter snakes with differences particularly pronounced between sympatric species.

In this analysis, two groups resulted, the Larimichthys and Collichthys clade, and another clade including a total of five species: Johnius belangerii, Nibea albiflora, Pennahia argentata, Sciaenops ocellatus, and Argyrosomus japonicus; Johnius belangerii clustered with Nibea albiflora.

Increasing concentration of salinity induced decrease in chlorophyll content (Chl a and b) and root hydraulic conductivity (L0) in all species, especially in A. canescens. All three species showed marked increase in electrolyte leakage across the salinity gradient. In addition all species were able to accumulate a large quantity of sodium (Na), chloride (Cl) and proline and to maintain higher relative water content, which was probably associated with a greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, whereas potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) decreased with increase salinity. The data suggest that salt tolerance strategies in all Atriplex species could involve a delicate balance among ion accumulation, osmotic adjustment, production of osmotica and maintenance of relative water content and growth.",

     "abstract": "The germplasm collections of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) in Denmark and Norway are maintained in clonal archives funded by the national authorities. The plants have been collected over the last decades as part of a strategy to conserve plant genetic resources for future generations. The major part of the various collections consist of plants collected in villages and gardens. About 20% are plants used for breeding, mainly kept in a collection at Carlsberg, Denmark. In order to identify any duplicates and with a view to learning more about the various collections, a DNA fingerprinting study was initiated, analysing 62 Danish and 34 Norwegian clones with a set of five amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The AFLP analyses resulted in 41 polymorphic bands and were able to separate the majority of the Danish and the Norwegian accessions. UPGMA dendrograms showed 21 accession groups, and potential duplicates were found within 13 of these groups. Principal coordinates analysis revealed that plants were differentiated according to country of origin. In addition, regional separation of the plants within each country was also detected, and similar levels of diversity were found in the Danish and the Norwegian collections. Compared to the rest of the plants, there was less diversity within the Carlsberg material. For the Norwegian as well as a part of the Danish collection, morphological characterisation and chemical analysis was carried out, allowing a comparison of these to the AFLP data. A correlation with AFLP bands and both morphological and chemical characteristics was detected. The most promising results for further breeding was an association of AFLP bands with the content of colupulon in the cones, measured by relative values compared to the total alpha acid content. Further studies are needed to verify such an association with the potential to develop a PCR-based marker for hop breeding carried out in the clones now analysed with AFLP markers, making it possible to search for any association between AFLP data and phenotypic data.",

A total of 274 individuals were collected from 13 localities in Thailand and scored for 12 enzyme systems (18 presumptive allozyme loci) using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. Fourteen of these presumed loci were found to be polymorphic. In addition, a 660 bp fragment of the COI mtDNA gene was amplified and sequenced from one representative individual for each of the 13 geographical regions.

The monophyly of M. peguana across these regions was supported by Neighbor joining, Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference based phylogenetic analysis of the mtDNA COI sequences with no geographic location dependent pattern. This may be due to anthropogenic movement of M. peguana in soil or with plant scions throughout this region.",

Morphological variation was correlated with ecological conditions at the site of origin. Pulegone was the major essential oils compound in all of the populations collected at full flowering (68\u201383%), in different growing conditions (51\u201382%), and for all the developmental stages studied (47\u201382%). Although clusters were defined, the analysis revealed a high chemical correlation among all populations (Scorr\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.95%). Inter-simple sequence repeats markers were used to assess the population structure and genetic variation. Populations exhibited a relatively low genetic diversity (PPB\u00a0=\u00a014.3\u201364.6%, He\u00a0=\u00a00.051\u20130.222, I\u00a0=\u00a00.076\u20130.332), with high structuring between them (GST\u00a0=\u00a00.51). However, the genetic diversity at species level was relatively high (PPB\u00a0=\u00a097.7%; He\u00a0=\u00a00.320). The levels and patterns of genetic diversity were assumed to result largely from a combination of evolutionary history and its unique biological traits, such as breeding system, clonal growth, low capacity of dispersion and habitat fragmentation. The relatively low genetic diversity in the populations analyzed indicates that the maintenance of their evolutionary potential is at risk if population sizes are maintained and if there is no protection of the habitats.",

We selected Kirengeshoma koreana and Parasenecio pseudotaimingasa, endemic to mountains of Korea to test the scenario that the main mountain ranges of the Peninsula would also have acted as refugia. We undertook a population genetic analysis using 15 and 12 putative allozyme loci of K. koreana and P. pseudotaimingasa, respectively. We found contrasting levels of genetic diversity in the two species; extremely low within-population genetic variation and high among-population divergence in K. koreana and high within-population genetic variation and moderate among-population divergence in P. pseudotaimingasa. We can conclude that, whereas Korean mountains would have provided large refugial areas (i.e., \u2018macrorefugia\u2019) for P. pseudotaimingasa, K. koreana would have endured the Quaternary climate oscillations in small, isolated populations (i.e., \u2018microrefugia\u2019).

The identification of Lippia spp. indigenous to South Africa is currently based on the morphology and geographical origin of the specimen. However, morphological similarities are evident and due to sympatric distributions, different species may co-occur in the same natural environment, thereby presenting difficulties in the taxonomic delimitation of these taxa. In this paper, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and vibrational spectroscopic analyses were used to investigate the chemotaxonomic differentiation of four Lippia species (L. javanica, L. scaberrima, L. rehmannii and L. wilmsii), based on the essential oil composition. The results demonstrate that multivariate classification of chromatographic data enabled separation of Lippia oils into three distinct clusters representing L. scaberrima, L. rehmannii and L. javanica. With the aid of chemometric algorithms, it was also possible to use both mid infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for a clear distinction of the Lippia spp., with results comparable to those obtained by GC\u2013MS. Orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS) presented a better classification algorithm than principal component analysis (PCA), in both GC\u2013MS and spectroscopy analyses. Chemical variations within the Lippia spp. complex were evident, particularly for L. javanica and L. scaberrima, which exhibited significant intra-species variation.",

Bayesian multilocus genotype clustering from the microsatellite loci revealed that regional divergence estimates were quantitatively congruent between marker classes. These lineages should be recognized as the basic evolutionary significant units for S. scherzeri in China. Contradict to the previous studies on Coreoperca whiteheadi and Siniperca chuatsi, neither the Nanling\u2013Wuyi Mountain range nor the Qingling\u2013Dabie Mountain range represented a major phylogeographic barrier for S. scherzeri. Our fine-scale analyses of the genetic population structure of S. scherzeri provided insights into the evolutionary processes that shaped the genetic heterogeneity of this fish. This study may serve as a basis for the protection, monitoring and breeding improvement of germplasm resources of this commercially important fish.",

Thus, our results suggest two probable origins for Tunisian cultivars which confirm previous molecular studies and historical data. The set of 73 SNPs allowed the unambiguous discrimination of all the studied accessions. Our analysis showed that a set of 27 SNPs were able to identify all the analyzed cultivars.

     "publication date": "12-2013",
     "abstract": "The genetic structure of marine populations is greatly influenced by the dispersal ability of the organisms, and it is intuitive that a limited dispersal capability would result in greater genetic differentiation. Octopus variabilis is a typical cephalopod species that shows limited dispersal potential, and previous genetic surveys by a mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed high levels of genetic differentiation among its populations, suggesting the existence of cryptic or subspecies. To test this hypothesis, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and the cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene sequence were used to re-evaluate the spatial genetic structure of five populations of O. variabilis along the coast of China. Four distinct groups were identified within these five populations: the Dalian\u00a0+\u00a0Qingdao, Zhoushan, Wenzhou, and Dongshan groups. A deep genetic break among the Dongshan, Wenzhou, and other two groups were specifically recognized by both genetic markers. A considerable number of distinct alleles for AFLP and a deep divergence of 13.9\u201319.4% in the COII gene sequences were found among them, suggesting the occurrence of potential cryptic or subspecies of O. variabilis. A genetic structure of isolation by distance was identified in O. variabilis by a Mantel test, with the geographic distance explaining 62% of the variation in genetic differentiation. This result suggests that gene flow is geographically restricted for this species and that limited dispersal may be the main reason for the genetic differentiation among O. variabilis populations. The present results indicate that special care should be taken in future fishery exploitation and conservation efforts for this species and that conservation management should include populations representing all lineages.",

Levels of superoxide anion ( O 2 \u2212 ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increased when aphids were transferred from winter wheat to two cultivars (Witon and Tornado) of winter triticale. ROS increase in triticale depended on the length of time that aphids fed on the triticale. The increase in O 2 \u2212 after transfer was greater on the less susceptible cultivar Witon than on the more susceptible cultivar Tornado. The increase in H2O2 after transfer was greater in the monophagous S. avenae than in the oligophagous R. padi. Activities of the ROS-scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) increased after aphids were transferred from winter wheat to winter triticale; only the increase in CAT was greater in R. padi than in S. avenae. APX activity in R. padi was greater on Witon than on Tornado. The content of the non-enzymatic antioxidant ascorbate (ASA) in aphids decreased when aphids were transferred from winter wheat to Witon, the less susceptible triticale cultivar, but remained unchanged when aphids were transferred to Tornado. The results of these experiments highlight the important role of oxidative stress in interactions between cereal aphids and their host plants.",

The beach pea (Lathyrus japonicus) is a typical coastal species of this freshwater lake, and morphological and genetic differentiation between inland and coastal populations of this species have been reported. Inland and coastal habitats inflict distinct environmental stresses to plants, the latter imposing salt stress and high-light intensity, which leads to physiological differentiation. These abiotic stresses affect phenolic compounds, which play an important role in the response of plants to the toxic by-products of stress metabolism. We investigated physiological differentiation of phenolic compounds of the beach pea between inland and coastal habitats using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Flavonoid composition analyses revealed that patterns of flavonoid composition of inland populations at Lake Biwa were differentiated from those of coastal populations. All Lake Biwa individuals were fixed in the same flavonols glycosylated at 3- and 7-positions. In contrast, most coastal individuals contained flavonols glycosylated at 3-position alone, and these populations exhibited higher variation in flavonoid composition compared to among/within inland populations. Variation was likely lower in inland populations because of a bottleneck during landlocked periods, which is consistent with previous phylogeographic studies. A qualitative HPLC survey of flavonoid content revealed substantial variation among individuals regardless of locality. These results suggest that changes in the habitat environment may have led to beach pea acclimation via alteration of the quantity and quality of flavonoids.",

In this study, two methods\u2014long fragment cloning and homology cloning\u2014were used to obtain full-length cDNAs and partial genomic DNA sequences for the F3'H genes in two medicinal chrysanthemum populations, \u2018Chu-ju\u2019 and \u2018Gong-ju\u2019. Analysis of gene structure showed that in both populations the F3'H gene contained three exons and two introns, with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the introns conforming to the GT/AG rule. The F3'H genes of the two medicinal chrysanthemum populations both encoded 509 amino acids in their open reading frames (ORF) with 98.88% homology, which indicated the gene is highly conserved. Analysis of intron structure showed that the second intron of the F3'H genes in the two populations contained motifs closely related to gene transcription that were similar to TATA-box, CAAT-box, AT-rich element, MYB binding site, HD-Zip, and HSE motifs. This suggested that introns may be involved in expression regulation of medicinal chrysanthemum F3'H genes. The two medicinal chrysanthemum populations had abundant allelic variation in their intron regions. Besides 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), \u2018Gong-ju\u2019 had a 39\u00a0bp insertion sequence compared with \u2018Chu-ju\u2019, and there were four or six structures similar to the TATA-box and one CAAT-box in this sequence. In addition, in another site, \u2018Gong-ju\u2019 had two G-box structures related to light response regulation that \u2018Chu-ju\u2019 did not have. These intron variations may be related to physiological differences between the two populations; in \u2018Gong-ju\u2019 the expression of F3'H is higher, the yellow tubular florets are smaller, the content of flavonoids like apigenin is higher, and the content of luteolin is lower than in \u2018Chu-ju\u2019.

Levels of differentiation (genetic distances and FST values) among samples from different locations are minimal, suggesting the local occurrence of a large and geographically undifferentiated population, with the possible exception of population Solan. Nevertheless, overall genetic variability is substantial, with 10 different haplotypes detected in 16 individuals and only one of these \u2013 likely the original one as it occupies a central position in the network and is found at a relatively high frequency \u2013shared between multiple populations. The phylogenetic analysis of local B. tau samples in the context of the different sibling species that constitute the B. tau complex in its South-East Asia region of origin revealed that local B. tau is closely related to B. tau species A from Thailand. This should be taken into account in any intervention aimed at the control of this pest, e.g. area wide integrated pest management (AW IPM). The marked local genetic uniformity and predominance of one single species of the species complex further suggest that the sterile insect technique (SIT) may be a viable option.",

However, the germplasm resources of different cultivated regions are extremely variable. Here, new simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were mined to analyze the frequency and distribution of SSRs, assess the validity of developed EST-SSR marker and identify new EST-SSR marker for the preparatory investigation of the population structure in cultivated S. miltiorrhiza. This study showed that 5160 unique ESTs were accumulated from database, 760 SSRs combined with 41 types of SSR motifs were mined. High polymorphism and transferability were presented in newly developed EST-SSR marker. It also showed that cultivated S. miltiorrhiza were mainly divided into three large groups. The results suggested that S. miltiorrhiza may has high abundance of SSRs in transcribed regions of genome and the developed EST-SSR marker may be useful for analysis of genetic diversity and population structure.",

South Africa is currently the major producer of Tagetes essential oil which is used in perfumery, cosmetics and aromatherapy. The organoleptic and therapeutic properties of an essential oil are dependent upon the chemical profile of the oil. Tagetes essential oil from India, Egypt and the United Kingdom has been reported to be highly variable. In this study, possible chemotypic variation of South African Tagetes oil was explored. Eighty-three individual plants were collected from twenty-one different localities in South Africa. Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus and the oil yield obtained ranged between 0.38 and 1.52%. The essential oils were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with flame ionisation detector (GC\u2013MS\u2012FID) and the major compounds accounting for >85% of the total composition were identified as: (Z)-\u03b2-ocimene (27.9\u201356.0%), (E)-ocimenone (7.4\u201337.2%), (Z)-tagetone (1.4\u201324.9%), dihydrotagetone (n.d.\u221223.4%), (Z)-ocimenone (4.5\u201313.9%), limonene (n.d.\u22126.5%) and (E)-tagetone (n.d.\u22123.2%).

     "abstract": "Thorictus beetles of the Dermestidae are obligate myrmecophiles. To understand how these beetles are integrated into and tolerated by their host colonies, the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of different species of the Thorictus castaneus group that are generally associated with Cataglyphis were examined. The beetles are characterized by small amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons, which render them partly chemically \u201cinsignificant\u201d. They also have the same cuticular hydrocarbon profiles as their hosts and thus likely use chemical mimicry to evade worker hostility but, like slaves in slave-maker species, they maintain some partial chemical identity. Thorictus martinezi from Burkina Faso were immediately adopted by conspecific colonies of their host, Cataglyphis sp. aff. bicolor, but were never adopted by colonies of other species (i.e. Cataglyphis viatica and Formica selysi). Thorictus buigasi from Morocco also mimicked the chemical profile of its host, C. viatica, but, in contrast to T. martinezi, individuals were adopted by colonies of Cataglyphis velox from Spain. This result can be explained by the similarity between the hydrocarbon profiles of C. viatica and C. velox, which may facilitate adoptions. T. buigasi beetles remained in Formica selysi colonies for some time but were ultimately rejected, probably due to their very different hydrocarbon profiles. In contrast, they were sometimes adopted by Camponotus herculeanus colonies and eventually chemically matched their new hosts, probably by passive camouflage. These data suggest that Thorictus of castaneus group myrmecophily is the result of coevolution with Cataglyphis hosts and that the mimicry is plastic, such that beetles can live with different hosts if the hosts show very limited CHC differences.",

There was a significant negative correlation between the density of R. padi populations and lysine decarboxylase activity. Such correlations did not occur for the other decarboxylases. Aphid feeding induced a decrease of lysine decarboxylase activity within both cultivars after one week of infestation and increased its activity after two weeks in the moderately resistant Witon. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was induced in tissues of the susceptible Tornado and inhibited in Witon after two weeks of infestation. Aphid infestations did not change tyrosine decarboxylase activity in Witon, whereas in Tornado it decreased in activity after one day of aphid feeding and then increased after two weeks.

However, little research has been conducted in planta to verify the validity of this hypothesis. We examined the emission rates of representative benzenoid and phenylpropanoid volatiles from seven cultivars of Phlox subulata L. to determine if cultivars had metabolic flux differences in terms of these two compound categories. Cultivars that produced large quantities of methyl benzoate and benzaldehyde were found to emit little or no phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, and vice versa. These results suggest that P. subulata cultivars experience phenylalanine substrate flux directed toward one pathway and away from the alternate branch. Such a pattern may be the result of differential selection pressures, in which gene expression has been altered to direct flux away from either benzenoid or phenylpropanoid production. Moreover, if these patterns hold true in wild populations, metabolic flux may lead to differential pollinator behavior and further phenotypic evolution. Future research using molecular tools could verify the role of metabolic flux in determining scent phenotypes and pinpoint the exact nature of the genetic mutations leading to phenotypic differences in odor.",

     "abstract": "Many lizards use femoral gland secretions in intraspecific communication. Although there is a consistent interspecific variation in chemical composition of secretions, considerable variation is also often found between populations, which may affect conspecifc recognition and lead to speciation processes. Balearic lizards (Podarcis lilfordi) are currently distributed only in several isolated islets offshore of the main islands with different environmental conditions (vegetation, diet, density of population, etc). Also, there is a high genetic variability between populations. We examined whether there was a similar variation in the composition of the femoral secretions of male lizards, and which could be the causes of such variation. By using GC\u2013MS analyses, we found 75 lipophilic compounds in femoral gland secretions of male P. lilfordi from three representative island populations. Main compounds were steroids (94.4%), mainly cholesterol, but we also found alkanes, ketones, waxy esters, squalene, carboxylic acids and their ethyl esters, alcohols and other minor compounds. However, there were clear differences between populations with respect to the number and relative proportions of compounds. Using the patterns of presence and abundance of compounds in secretions it is possible to predict the population of origin of a lizard. We discuss how these differences could be explained considering genetic and environmental differences between populations.",

Eight North American native warm-season perennial legumes were evaluated: Leucaena retusa Benth. (littleleaf leadtree), Desmanthus illinoensis (Michx.) MacMill. Ex B.L. Rob. & Fernald (Illinois bundleflower), Lespedeza stuevei Nutt. (tall lespedeza), Mimosa strigillosa Torr. & A. Gray (powderpuff), Neptunia lutea (Leavenworth) Benth. (yellow puff), two ecotypes of Acacia angustissima var. hirta (Nutt.) B.L. Rob (prairie acacia), and Desmodium paniculatum (L.) DC. var. paniculatum (panicledleaf ticktrefoil). Two introduced legumes were also included: Arachis glabrata Benth. (rhizoma peanut) and Lespedeza cuneata (Dum. Cours.) G. Don (sericea lespedeza). Forages were fermented with cattle rumen fluid for 48\u00a0h anaerobically using an in\u00a0vitro gas production technique. D. paniculatum, L. stuevei, and M. strigillosa were high in CT, ranging from 11.7 to 12.5%. D. illinoensis, L. cuneata, N. lutea, and two ecotypes of A. angustissima var. hirta had less CT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), ranging from 8.1 to 8.9%, whereas L. retusa and A. glabrata had the least CT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), measuring 3.2 and 0.5%, respectively. Weight-average molecular weight (MW) of CT ranged from 1483\u00a0Da for L. cuneata to 552\u00a0Da for L. stuevei. In\u00a0vitro CH4 production was greatest for L. retusa and A. glabrata at 40.7\u00a0mg/g DM and 38.2\u00a0mg/g DM, respectively. The least amount of in\u00a0vitro CH4 was produced by fermentation of two ecotypes of A. angustissima var. hirta, which measured 0.8 and 0.6\u00a0mg/g DM, respectively. In\u00a0vitro CH4 production regressed on CT MW resulted in a R2 of 0.0009 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.80), strongly suggesting that CT MW does not explain the biological activity of in\u00a0vitro CH4 production by the forage legumes surveyed. Five of the seven North American native warm-season perennial legumes have promise for use in ruminant diets for the purpose of CH4 emission mitigation.",

Calculated genetic divergence was highest for LSU ribosomal RNA D1-D5 (p-distance of 12.3), followed by 5.8S (7.7), ribulose-1, 5-biphoshate carboxylase oxygenase (7.4), small subunit (6.6), and psbA (3.7). The phylogenetic trees for individual genes effectively separated taxonomically tested centric diatoms with different phylogenetic resolutions; however, psbA was incongruent with others. These taxonomic resolving powers were in agreement with genetic divergences. Parsimony analysis showed that LSU evolved 1.97 times more rapidly than psbA and 1.07 times more rapidly than 5.8S. These results suggest that all of the tested genes except psbA can be used as taxonomic markers for centric diatoms and that LSU is the best molecular marker.",

The reciprocal monophyly mitochondrial cytb and nuclear sequences strongly suggest that C. whiteheadi has significantly reduced gene flow between populations and may be in the process of speciation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed phylogeographical structuring into two major clades (highly supported by bootstrap analysis) corresponding to the two regions divided by Nanling-Wuyi Mountain Range. Subsequent nested clade analysis confirmed this structure. The results suggest that Nanling-Wuyi Mountain Range represents a major phylogeographic barrier for C. whiteheadi. Six evolutionarily significant units of C. whiteheadi were designated from the genetic analysis for conservation and management.",

Analysis by the UPGMA method grouped the samples into three main clusters, with coefficients of similarity ranging from 0.57 to 0.97. Morphological traits were correlated with four of the contents of phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid, rutin, hyperoside and quercitroside. Correlation analysis revealed that the hyperoside concentration was significantly and positively correlated with the density of black glands found along the vertical edges of the stem. The information generated by the SRAP markers was closely associated with some morphological variability. However, there was only a partial correlation between the chemistry and genetic data.",

We describe for the first time the presence of a myoglobin in the triturative stomach of Biomphalaria gastropods. We compared biochemical parameters of myoglobins of stomach and radular muscles of Biomphalaria glabrata and Biomphalaria tenagophila. Apomyoglobin and holomyoglobin were obtained. Myoglobin was the most abundant protein in the stomach (85.0%) and radular muscles (80.0%) of the two Biomphalaria species evaluated. The Molecular mass and isoeletric point of stomach myoglobins were 16,124.93\u00a0Da and 7.98 and 16.095.28\u00a0Da and 7.77 for B. glabrata and B. tenagophila, respectively.

Analysis of N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that stomach myoglobins are blocked in this region for a chemical group. Concluding, the differences we observed in the biochemical properties of stomach and radular myoglobins of B. glabrata and B. tenagophila suggest they may be isoform representing an evolutionary event related to the adaptation of these proteins.",

RARE-1 was homologous to the soybean retroelement 1 (SORE-1) and exhibited abundant cis-regulatory motifs involved in various stress responses in its LTRs. Using the sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP) technique, we obtained a total of 112 bands for two R. apiculata populations from Hainan, China and Ranong, Thailand. The Hainan population showed slightly higher S-SAP polymorphism but fewer unique bands than the Ranong population. Moreover, the Hainan population also had significantly more copies of RARE-1 than the Ranong population as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Our results suggested that RARE-1 might have been domesticated in the R. apiculata genome, as a result of the long-term evolution of mangroves under the extreme environment.",

Furthermore, SA pretreatment enhanced remarkably the superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase activity in the Cd-stressed plants, but decreased catalase activity. Overall, SA might regulate the antioxidant defense activities, reduce Cd uptake and stimulate nutrient elements absorption in Cd-treated with Kentucky bluegrass, thereby improving its resistance to Cd stress.",

This differentiation may be primarily attributable to genetic differences between populations from Geomundo and other localities, based on relative low level of gene flow, a high level of pairwise FST and RST or the position of this population in a phylogenetic tree. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) also revealed a greater part of the variation within the population and genetic differentiation among the samples analyzed and identified two genetic clusters. The possibility of a recent genetic bottleneck was observed in some populations of S. cirrhifer. Given the prevailing ocean currents and the intensity of threadsail filefish harvesting activities in Korea, the possibility that human harvest and stock enhancement activities may have partially contributed to our detected genetic pattern cannot be excluded. Management strategies that take these findings into account might lower the risk of harmful genetic change in the species.",

The main advantage of NGS over traditional methods of identifying microsatellite markers is the generation of many more sequences with less effort. It is possible to design primers from unenriched DNA, thereby further reducing the workload and also allowing the use of SSRs that are difficult to enrich (e.g., TA/AT and TAA/ATT). We present microsatellite primer pairs that may be used for phylogeographic analysis as well as to infer the geographical origin of traded material of Catha edulis, which contains two amphetamines that are controlled substances in many counties. We used data from two partial 454 pyrosequencing runs that generated about 2000 sequences containing microsatellites (3% of all sequences) as well as flanking regions sufficient for primer design. Using 23 samples of C. edulis we identified 27 single-copy markers that were broadly amplified across the sampled individuals; 18 showed polymorphism information content (PIC) higher than 0.5. The genetic structure in wild individuals is concordant with their geographic origins; wild samples from northern Kenya are more closely related to Ethiopian samples than are other wild samples from Kenya. The geographic differences in allele frequencies indicate that microsatellite analysis can be used to determine the geographic source of cultivated and wild collected material.",

S. tudes presented reduced diversity for both markers, which may be related to overexploitation by local fisheries. Most of the genetic variation in the four species was found in the 5\u2032 portion of the Control Region, corresponding to a region of 210\u00a0bps, characterized by multiple substitutions (mutational hotspots) at the same sites. These mutations clearly biased the genetic diversity and affected the reliable of the analyses based exclusively on the Control Region. As Cytochrome b was not affected by these mutational events, this marker provided more reliable parameters for the evaluation of patterns of demographic expansion only for R. porosus. The present study indicated that the analysis of both markers is essential to guarantee the reliability of estimates of genetic variability, given that estimates based on the Control Region may be biased, and thus reduce the effectiveness of conservation and management measures designed to guarantee the long-term protection of stocks.",

Genetic similarity varied from 0.4969 to 0.8616, the average value of the effective number of alleles, Nei's genetic diversity and Shannon's information index was 1.4716, 0.3072 and 0.4590, respectively. Forty nine varieties were classified into six groups according to the ISSR (D\u00a0=\u00a00.72). These results showed that two methods combined were accuracy for characterization of the genetic diversity and identification of potato onion cultivars.",

All populations showed very high genetic diversity and a deficit of heterozygotes. The minor but significant genetic differentiations (both FST and RST) observed were mainly due to genetic differences between populations from Pyoson and other localities, suggesting that abalone may not be panmictic. The Pyoson abalone population showed a significant difference in allelic richness that could be related to harvesting intensity and stock enhancement activity. This result was also corroborated by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Overall, this report presents novel observations of the wild genetic population structure in H. diversicolor supertexta from Korea using microsatellite markers and provides critical information for supporting conservation strategies for this species, namely that the Pyoson abalone population should have a higher conservation priority due to its unique genetic characteristics.",

The accurate identification of natural enemies is crucial in order to develop successful biological control programs. This paper presents phylogenetic analyses of Trissolcus species based on data sets consisting of 18S, 28S, ITS1, ITS2 and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes. The most commonly used genetic loci in Trissolcus species identification is the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). Also restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of PCR amplified COI gene have been developed to discriminate closely related species. We suggest that Trissolcus grandis Thompson and Trissolcus semistriatus Nees split significantly into two different genetic groups while there is another species diverging from T. semistriatus which is decsribed as \u2018Trissolcus flavotibialis Kocak & Guz, n. sp.\u2019",

     "abstract": "One of the galling herbivores associated to the superhost Schinus polygamus (Cav.) Cabrera (Anacardiaceae) is Calophya duvauae Scott (Hemiptera: Calophyidae). The galls are located on the adaxial surface of leaves and vary from red to green. The levels of their pigments were herein investigated in relation to age. Samples were collected between June 2008 and March 2009, in a population of S. polygamus at Cangu\u00e7u municipality, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Galls were separated by color, measured, dissected, and the instar of the inducer was determined. The levels of photosynthetic (chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophylls, and carotenoids) and protective pigments (anthocyanins) were also evaluated. Red galls were more numerous than the green ones, and the induction should occur preferentially on young leaves, but may also occur on mature leaves. Immature stages of C. duvauae were observed in all samples throughout the year, characterizing its life cycle as multivoltine. There was a significant correlation between the instar of the inducer and the size of the gall (r\u00a0=\u00a00.675, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with larger galls corresponding to more advanced instars. The ratio between red and green galls varied over the samples, with the highest (96%) and lowest (38%) frequency of red galls observed in September, and December 2008, respectively. The average amounts of chlorophyll b and total chlorophylls were 70% lower in the gall tissues when compared to non-galled portions of galled leaves. There is a notable reduction in the contents of all pigments in the galls when compared to non-galled leaves, especially for total anthocyanins in green galls. The red galls presumably had the constant stimuli of healthy gall inducers, whereas in green galls they died prematurely, due to the interference of parasitoids and inquilines. The alterations in gall structure and color were related to the gradual decreasing in galling stimuli.",

The norditerpene alkaloids are significant secondary compounds in Delphinium (larkspur) species which are divided into two classes: the 7, 8-methylenedioxylycoctonine (MDL-type) and N-(methylsuccinimido) anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL-type), and are known to be toxic to herbivorous insects and livestock. Alkaloid concentrations were measured in a whole plant context in vegetative and floral tissues as well as rewards (pollen and nectar) in Delphinium barbeyi and Delphinium nuttallianum. Alkaloid concentrations differed between vegetative tissues, floral tissues and floral rewards. Alkaloid concentrations in floral parts were consistent with optimal defense theory, with tissues more closely tied to plant fitness, such as fruits, being more heavily defended than foliage. However, alkaloid concentrations were significantly lower in nectar compared to other tissues. The norditerpene alkaloids influenced the activity of bumble bees, the dominant pollinator of larkspur, but the effects were concentration dependent. Alkaloids in nectar are found at concentrations that have no effect on bee activity; however, if alkaloid concentrations in nectar were similar to those in foliage bee activity would be reduced significantly. These results suggest that nectar with low alkaloid concentrations may be beneficial to plant fitness by limiting adverse effects on pollinator activity.",

To further our understanding of the relationships, we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of the Himalayan goral, Naemorhedus goral, an IUCN Redlist near threatened conservation dependent species. Then we conducted molecular phylogenetic relationships of the Bovidae based on Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. The results indicate that the basal divergence within the Bovidae is between the Bovinae and a strongly supported clade of the remaining Bovidae species. The two Neotragus species (the suni and pygmy antelope) clustered with the impala, Aepyceros melampus (Aepycerotinae), and together they formed the most basal of the non-Bovinae. All the genera of the Antilopinae clustered together except Neotragus, which suggested that the Antilopinae was a paraphyletic subfamily. The present study confirmed a close relationship between the genera Capricornis and Naemorhedus while supporting their designation as separate genera and suggested that the Capricornis-Naemorhedus-Ovibos clade (serows, gorals, and the muskox) should be placed in the Caprinae. Bison, Bos, and Tragelaphus (bison & cattle and kudus and nyalas) were paraphyletic. The very close relationship between Bison and Bos suggested that Bos and Bison should be integrated into a single Bos genus. Saiga and Pantholops (the Chiru or Tibetan Antelope), unique genera which have sometimes been lumped together, were placed in different groups: Saiga within the Antilopinae and Pantholops at the base of the Caprinae. Our results also supported a new taxonomy which places the three species of Hemitragus into three monospecific genera: the genus Hemitragus is restricted to the Himalayan tahr, and two new genera are created: Arabitragus for the Arabian tahr and Nilgiritragus for the Nilgiri tahr.",

     "abstract": "We are using Flourensia cernua as a shrub model to study how terpenes affect livestock herbivory. Two experiments were conducted to examine distribution of volatile chemicals within a plant in an effort to minimize sample variability. In Experiment 1, leaves (current year's growth) were collected from 20 tarbush plants. Two leaders were sampled from each of three positions (outer canopy, subcanopy, and basal) in all four quadrants (based on ordinal direction). In Experiment 2, 10 leaders of current year's growth were removed from another 20 plants. Leaders were collected from the outer canopy of each quadrant and separated into thirds before removing leaves, thereby creating three leaf age categories. Volatile compounds were extracted with ethanol and analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Ninety-four chemicals (including 15 unknowns) were present on the leaf surface of F. cernua. Although 14 and 21 compounds differed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) among quadrants in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, no consistent quadrant effect was detected in either study. Leaf position differed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for 52 chemicals in Experiment 1 but outer canopy and subcanopy leaves differed for only 10 compounds. In Experiment 2, 63 compounds differed among leaf age categories. Immature leaves contained greater concentrations of 46 chemicals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than intermediate or mature age categories, but intermediate and mature leaves differed for only seven compounds. Estimated total concentration (i.e., cumulative concentration of all compounds) was not affected by leaf position but varied among leaf age categories (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; immature\u00a0>\u00a0intermediate\u00a0>\u00a0mature). Differences in leaf position were attributed about equally to mono- and sesquiterpenes, whereas leaf age differences were primarily due to sesquiterpenes. Leaf position and age both affect terpene concentration and sampling variability for tarbush. However, little difference was detected between subcanopy and canopy positions. Thus, by avoiding basal sprouts and sampling from the mid-point of current year's growth, sampling variation should be minimal.",

This ecosystem, dominated by the genera Brachystegia, Julbernardia and Isoberlinia, has an immeasurable socio-economic and environmental value, playing a key role in formal and informal economies and in energy, water and carbon balances. Anthropogenic fires represent one of the major threats, compromising the stability of miombo. In this study we report on the usefulness of ISSR markers to assess, for the first time, the genetic diversity in two typical miombo species, Brachystegia boehmii Taub. and Burkea africana Hook. f. across a fire gradient in the Niassa National Reserve (NNR). According to our data, ISSR seem to be a suitable molecular marker's system for biodiversity studies in both species, generating high levels of polymorphisms coupled with a convenient resolving power. The results point to a link between fire-tolerance and genetic diversity, as judged by the higher diversity levels observed in B. africana (fire-tolerant) and by the evolutive fire response of B. boehmii. Although fire differentially affects the biodiversity in each species, in general, the overall genetic diversity was high and their survival does not seem to be compromised by the frequency of fires, agreeing with the fact that NNR is one of the least disturbed areas of deciduous miombo.",

The average values of Effective Multiplex Ratio (EMR), Marker Index (MI), effective number of alleles (Ne), Nei's gene diversity (He) and Shannon's information index (I) for all primers were 8.0, 3.75, 1.756, 0.416 and 0.595 respectively. Based on these results, ISSR analysis can be used for the characterization and grouping of cornelian cherry accessions. This is the first study demonstrating that ISSR analyses can be used to differentiate and classify cornelian cherry accessions.",

The He was 0.643 and 0.222 for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively. The moderate levels of genetic diversity were related to the limited size of the species' distribution area, the latitudinal position of populations, the impacts of logging and the species' spatial distribution pattern. Genetic differentiation among populations was low for both markers (4.9% and 4.1% for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively). Four genetic clusters homogeneously distributed were distinguished. These observations may relate to the considerable historical gene flow measured (3.71 and 4.47 for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively).

Highly variable small-scale spatial structure with adjacent ramets of identical MLGs and different sizes was detected in quadrates up to monoclonality of some plots. Differences in local disturbances and land-use history of populations were found to be associated with their variable genotypic structure and diversity. Sexual reproduction was locally suppressed in abandoned grassland at places with a dense cover of competing grasses and thick litter layer, however, still occurring in suitable or disturbed places. Strong competition at sites densely covered with adult plants has led to the local elimination of small clones and preferential spread of survived clones. High clonal richness observed in long transects with up to 100% consisting of unique MLGs suggests ability of sickle medic for repeated sexual reproduction in established populations. Local disturbances are supposed to provide suitable microsites for seedling recruitment, evidenced by the presence of unique and small MLGs of recent origin.",

     "abstract": "The genus Macrobrachium (Bate, 1868) belongs to the Palaemonidae family. These species are commonly found in lakes, floodplains and rivers in tropical and subtropical regions of South America. The Macrobrachium genus encompasses nearly 210 species of ecological and economic importance. In this study, three species of Macrobrachium (Macrobrachium jelskii, Macrobrachium amazonicum and Macrobrachium brasiliense) were studied in order to characterize the esterase patterns in the hepatopancreas, which were still unknown. Esterases are enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of esters. In the hepatopancreas, these enzymes play important roles in several metabolic processes involved in some functions of this organ, such as detoxification and digestion. Twelve esterase bands (EST1 to EST12) were detected in these species, and a comparison among them showed no qualitative differences in interspecific bands, or between males and females. Inhibitors were used to classify the esterase bands. The results indicated seven acetylesterases, two carboxylesterases, one arylesterase, and one cholinesterase. The EST11 band was not detected in these procedures because of its lower frequency. Statistical analyses showed no variability among the species, in either interspecific or intraspecific assays. These results support the hypothesis of a high evolutionary conservation of esterases in the hepatopancreas of these crustaceans. The data enabled us to assess the genetic structure of these species through the use of esterasic enzymes. It also contributes to our knowledge about the biology of these poorly studied species. Knowledge on the genetic structure of populations and species are essential when defining priorities for their management and conservation.",

     "abstract": "Selective pressure induces pathogens to change their method of infection and, sometimes, causes species to become infectious. Pathogenic fungi must differentiate different morphological and physiological properties during the process of host specialization in their life cycle. In the present study, we conducted a genetic investigation and compared similarities within a generation of Fusarium oxysporum forma speciales (f. sp.) infecting tomato and forma (f.) infecting eggplants using selected ISSR and RAPD markers, two horticultural commodities belonging to the same taxon of the Solanaceae. Interestingly, genetic data showed that fungi belonging to F. oxysporum f. sp. infecting tomato have a close genetic relationship with the fungi f. infecting eggplant. Furthermore, F. oxysporum f. sp. infecting tomato showed less genetic variation than F. oxysporum f. melongenae, suggesting that it could be developed more recently during host adaptation. On the other hand, the gene sequence of inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers resulting in high polymorphism showed matches with gene sequences encoding specific proteins related to pathogenicity of F. oxysporum species. These findings support the notion that selected ISSR markers can be used to follow host-associated divergence of F. oxysporum species infecting tomato and eggplant and that differentiation of their specific genes can also be related to pathogenicity and development as predictive studies before initiating detailed sequencing analysis.",

     "abstract": "Pleistocene ice ages in addition to geographical and geological modifications have affected the natural range and habitat of marine organisms in Northwestern Pacific. The effects of glacial events have left a genomic signature, resulting in concordant phylogeographical structures among many species. To investigate the effects of Quaternary climatic changes on the evolution in H. otakii, fragments of 471\u00a0bp at the 5\u2032 end of mitochondrial DNA control region were sequenced for 275 individuals from 10 localities in the Northern China and Japan. Both mismatch distribution analyses and neutrality tests suggested recent population expansion (64,000\u2013227,000 years ago). Although estimated value of pairwise population differentiation (FST) was low, half (23 of 45) of the comparisons showed statistically significant. Coalescent-based estimates show that gene flow was asymmetric or directional, most of all comparisons (57 of 65) among populations showed low evaluation value of Nm (Nm\u00a0<\u00a010). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed genetic structuring among groups when the data was partitioned into six groups in this study. The defined pattern of genetic variation suggested a crucial role of habitat requirement, marine current, marine gyres and history process. Absence of genetic structure over hundreds of kilometers between AO and assemblage of QD, RZ and GY might imply the common coalescent other than current gene flow. Specific exchange mechanism and fine scale genetic structure need further research using faster evolution molecular markers (microsatellite markers) and further sampling.",

Extractable and fiber-bound condensed tannins (CT) were not different but protein-bound CT concentrations were greater in browsed trees.

Terpene components analyzed on a percent total oil basis had 3 differences versus 12 significant differences on a mg/g DW basis. The terpenoid components profile differed little between browsed and non-browsed trees. Total CT are negatively associated with oil yields. No association was found between crude protein and oil yields or between digestibility (IVDMD, NDF, ADF) and oil yields. The question of whether individual plants or populations may invest less in CT when greater amounts of terpenes are produced (or\u00a0vice-versa) may have evolutionary implications since individual browsers or populations may adapt to consuming or avoiding either CT or terpenes. The fact that browsed tree leaves were less digestible than non-browsed tree leaves may be a result of complex interactions between CT, terpenes, fiber, and nutrients.",

Levels of genetic variation in B. striata were substantially lower than those reported in most other terrestrial orchids.

The major morphological traits and chemical compositions were characterized in the bulbs of nine widely cultivated Fritillaria species in China. LSD analysis revealed that the morphological traits differed significantly among nine species, which were clustered into four groups using PCA; the ZB-Ft and WY-Fwu were relatively distantly related to other species. Morphological traits could be used to identify species which differ significantly in bulb size from the others, and \u2018short diameter of bulb\u2019 could be used as the most important identification indicators. Based on the chemical composition data, all those species were clustered into two groups.

The large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea, was once an important commercial marine species in China. At present, this croaker is seldom captured in the wild. In this work, mitochondrial DNA data was obtained from five populations of the yellow croaker from the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea to investigate their genetic divergence and demographic history. Results of phylogenetic analysis suggest two genetic lineages for this croaker, although the divergence was relatively shallow. This might reflect the effects of glacial isolation on population structure. Furthermore, our Bayesian based approach showed that the effective population size for both genetic lineages experienced recent sharp decline. This study provides new insights into the genetic divergence and historical demography of this croaker. Strict measures must be taken to protect this species.",

Samples from various geographically distinct populations from Bulgaria and the Balearic Islands were studied by GC\u2013MS. The alkaloid pattern of the plants of L. aestivum (subsp. pulchellum) from the Balearic Islands were dominated by crinine type compounds. Populations of homolycorine chemotype were distributed along the Danube river in the north part of Bulgaria, which is separated from the south part by the Balkan mountains. Populations with high accumulation of lycorine were found in East Bulgaria near the sea coast, while the south populations were dominated by galanthamine type synthesis. The average of the galanthamine content was found to vary from 0.003 to 0.08% (referred to dry weight) in the north, and up to 0.42% in the southern Bulgarian populations. Some individuals showed up to 0.65% galanthamine. The galanthamine content of the plants from the Balearic island was 0.1% of DW. The galanthamine percentage in the total alkaloid mixture ranged from 0.2 to 95% of the total alkaloids. Our study demonstrated that the geographic isolation of the populations of L. aestivum has led to divergation in the alkaloid biosynthesis and consequently to the occurrence of different chemotypes. This chemodiversity in both alkaloid patterns and galanthamine content provides an opportunity for further selection work toward a galanthamine-rich crop, on the one hand, and makes the species an excellent biological system for molecular studies leading to further improvement of the galanthamine production, which is a valuable alkaloid used in medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

The AFLP-based principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) divided the entire accessions into three parts, reinforcing the AFLP-based clustering. Moreover, the Bayesian-based structuring assigned the anthurium accessions to three subgroups but with 27 accessions retained in the admixed groups, probably implying the highly heterozygous genome of the investigated anthuriums.

Due to the increasing urban pressure, natural populations are now reduced to small nuclei located in the center of the region. Genetic variation within and among three populations of this species was evaluated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. A total of eight primers generated 128 well defined bands, with an average of 16 bands per primer. At the population level, the percentage of polymorphic bands ranged from 55 to 73%, while at the species level this value increased to 98%. The population showing the highest genetic variability was Olh\u00e3o and the lowest was Gambelas. According to the cluster analysis based on UPGMA, the population Gambelas was clearly separated from the other two, which clustered together. The three populations revealed a high level of genetic diversity, with a Nei\u2019s genetic diversity of 0.197 and Shannon\u2019s diversity index of 0.324. A high level of gene flow was observed among populations (Nm\u00a0=\u00a02.199), reflecting a moderate level of genetic differentiation (GST\u00a0=\u00a00.185), and no correlation between genetic and geographical distances (r\u00a0=\u00a01.000; P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Results showed 17 predominant compounds for L. lucida, among which (E)-caryophyllene (19.0%) and \u03b1-humulene (33.0%) were the major components. L. salzmannii showed the presence of 58 compounds, the most abundant of which were (E)-caryophyllene (15.6%) and selin-11-en-4-ol (11.2%). Next, cluster analyses of the chemical composition of the volatile fraction of five Lantana species from our studies (Lantana radula, Lantana canescens, L.\u00a0lucida, L. salzmannii and Lantana camara), as well as 10 Lantana species published in the literature (Lantana achyranthifolia, Lantana aculeata, Lantana balansae, Lantana hirta, Lantana involucrata, Lantana fucata, Lantana salviifolia, Lantana trifolia, Lantana velutina and Lantana xenica) were performed. Species fell into three main groups. A cluster analysis of (E)-caryophyllene content was also performed which resulted in the 15 Lantana species being segregated into four main groups. In addition, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) was used to evaluate the genetic variation between five Lantana species collected from northeastern Brazil (L. radula, L. canescens, L. lucida, L. salzmannii and L. camara). Analysis showed a 36% similarity between, L. salzmanii and L. canescens, and a 48% similarity between L. lucida and L. canescens. Overall, results, indicate that it is possible to discriminate between groups of Lantana taxa based on both their chemical, composition and ISSR markers. In addition, this study provided further support for using (E)-caryophyllene as a chemical marker for species belonging to the Lantana genus.",

The phylogenetic relationships of A. rupestris and its genetic variation were studied to assess the distribution of genetic variability within and among six subpopulations from two remnants locations. We obtained sequences of internal transcribed spacer ITS2 of three Anthyllis species and ISSRs markers to estimate gene diversity and the genetic structure of the subpopulations. A. rupestris was closely related to two other endemic species to southeastern Spain. The ISSR analyses revealed high level of genetic diversity [61.59% average polymorphism; and HT\u00a0=\u00a00.269] in subpopulations and a moderate level of genetic differentiation [(GST)\u00a0=\u00a00.267] among subpopulations. Furthermore, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 18% of the total genetic diversity resided among the two analysed areas, 12% among subpopulations and 70% variation was found within subpopulations. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCA) partially grouped together the genotypes according to their geographical origin. Three out of the four subpopulations from one location were genetically related to each other, and the remaining subpopulation, which was fenced, was isolated from the obtained clusters. The data are interpreted as a result of recent fragmentation and isolation. Threats to this species are mainly anthropogenic. Because A. rupestris currently retains a high genetic variation among individuals within subpopulations, a metapopulation perspective preserving and expanding the habitat at each site, in order to promote connectivity would be an additional strategy to ensure conservation before populations become too small to persist naturally.",

The N. albiflora populations were characterized by medium/high haplotype diversity (0.580\u20130.815) and low nucleotide diversity (0.00125\u20130.00219). Analysis of neutral evolution and mismatch distribution implied that N. albiflora might have experienced a recent population expansion. Pairwise fixation index (Fst) analysis indicated significant genetic differentiation among populations from different localities. The hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) analysis also showed significant genetic divergence (\u03c6st\u00a0=\u00a00.0233, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) among these populations.

The differences among populations were low in comparison with the previous studies on other species using the same technique. Low level of the genetic differences among Rhododendron populations investigated in the present study might be due to their outcrossing reproductive system.

Particular attention was paid to analysing antigenic patterns derived from western blotting carried out with different antisera. Similarity (SJ) and distance (DBC) indices were further used to carry out Cluster Analysis (UPGMA) and Principal Coordinate Analysis. Antigenic patterns of species of Opuntioideae and Cactoideae were obtained using anti-Cereus aethiops. Between both subfamilies SJ varied from 0.412 to 0.697 while DBC varied from 0.172 to 0.387. On the other hand, between the two species of Cereus SJ was 0.971 and DBC was 0.091. Also, antigenic patterns of species of Cactoideae and Opuntia were obtained using anti-Opuntia elata var. cardiosperma. Between both subfamilies SJ ranged between 0.537 and 0.738 while DBC ranged between 0.128 and 0.247. Among species of Opuntia SJ varied from 0.744 to 0.946 while DBC varied from 0.082 to 0.168. Thus, findings from our study demonstrate that variability is lowest at the intraspecific level while it increases when different species of the same genus, subfamily, family or class are considered. This indicates that differences in antigenic patterns are tightly related to systematic affinities. It can thus be concluded that western blotting could help bring consensus to the current different points of view on systematic relationships at low taxonomic levels.",

The study confirmed that the unripe cones accumulate more essential oils than leaves (1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 0.63% and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 0.14%, respectively), and the amount of essential oils in leaves negatively significantly correlated with illumination (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and soil acidity (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.83, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of habitats. The \u03b1-pinene was the main essential oil compound in 97% and 98% of all analysed leaf and unripe cone samples, respectively. Leaves and unripe cones contained very similar amounts of this monoterpene (54.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 13.9% and 58.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 14.62%, respectively). Significant positive correlations between the percentage of \u03b1-pinene and the ratio of (1R)-(+)-\u03b1-pinene/(1S)-(\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene in essential oils of cones and leaves implies that the synthesis of this monoterpene and its enantiomers both in leaves and cones is interdependent. It was established that the (1R)-(+)-\u03b1-pinene is more prevalent than (1S)-(\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene both in leaves and unripe cones of J. communis growing wild in Lithuania, and that purity of (\u2212) enantiomer varied more than purity of (+) enantiomer. Our study showed that the amount of \u03b1-pinene and its enantiomeric composition did not correlate significantly with the illumination and soil characteristics of habitats neither in leaves nor in unripe cones.",

Due the great morphological plasticity and its large number of species, several taxonomic treatments have been proposed for the genus Solanum, but its infrageneric classification is problematic. The aim of this study was to analyze the alkane composition of the leaf epicuticular waxes of nine species of the subgenus Leptostemonum to evaluate the chemotaxonomic potential of the alkanes. As results, were identified in nine species thirty-one alkanes, including iso- and anteiso-alkanes. The major constituent of wax in most species was tritriacontane. Hentriacontane was the main constituent of Solanum paraibanum and Solanum torvum, and pentatriacontane was predominant in different populations of Solanum stramonifolium. The phenetic analysis of nine species based on the distribution profile of alkanes (Euclidean distance and UPGMA method) show three clusters with distinct main homolog. The profiles of alkanes showed some qualitative taxonomic value for species analyzed, although, a larger number of representative samples of this subgenus must be investigated.",

Attention to genetics can enhance strategies for using fishery resources sustainably, and a potentially important application is the use of molecular markers to assess the genetic stock structure of a harvested species. In this study, seven microsatellite loci were analyzed in five littleneck clam samples from the western and southern coasts of Korea to investigate the genetic characteristics of these clams. Very high genetic diversity was present in all five of the populations (overall He\u00a0=\u00a00.813), but no significant differences among the localities were detected (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The results showed a significant global FST (0.045), indicating genetic heterogeneity among the populations. We found three genetically distinct regions: a western coastal region (FST range 0.0137\u20130.0218, P\u00a0>\u00a00.005) and two regions along the southern coast of Korea (FST range 0.0473\u20130.1121, P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Neighbor-joining, principle coordinate analysis, and Bayesian clustering revealed the existence of these three groups. This result was also corroborated by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and an assignment test. This report presents novel observations of the wild genetic population structure in littleneck clams along the coast of Korea and provides critical information to support conservation strategies for this species. The three groups mentioned above could be considered independent management units, and the southern groups would have a higher conservation priority due to their unique genetic characteristics.",

We analyzed variation patterns in leaf stoichiometry, correlated leaf stoichiometry with leaf traits, and determined nutrient limitations based on leaf stoichiometry. Leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio averaged 18.58\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121, 2.24\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 and 9.56, respectively.

Despite the fact that sex recognition is often based on colour signals, such pheromone communication occurs in many species of lizards. Epidermal gland secretions of reptiles can have pheromone properties and might play an important role in sexual signalling and territorial scent marking. The house-dwelling geckos Hemidactylus turcicus, Hemidactylus flaviviridis, and Cyrtopodion scabrum are good examples of geckos having pre-anal glands in males only. We used GC\u2013MS chemical analysis of gland secretions, compared secretions of different species, and compared secretions from two populations of H. turcicus. Surprisingly, we detected monoglycerides of fatty acids, and one 1,3-alkanediol. These compounds have been detected once before in reptiles. In addition, carboxylic acids, alcohols, steroids, alkanes, amides, one aldehyde, carboxylic acid esters, hydrocarbons, and squalene occurred. Polyol glycerol seems to play a role in the composition of the secretions probably as an adhesive of some kind for the secretion as a whole.

In this study, we assessed the temporal course of genetic diversity during an outbreak of the long-tailed mouse Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. This outbreak was associated with a mast seeding event of the bamboo Chusquea culeou (\u201ccolihue\u201d) in a temperate Chilean forest. We studied the putative effects of diverse microevolutionary mechanisms by sequencing 500 nucleotides of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We sequenced seventy-nine specimens of O. longicaudatus trapped in a local site of Villarrica National Park (Southern Chile) throughout three temporal windows: pre-outbreak, outbreak, and post-outbreak. The results showed a large difference in haplotype and nucleotide composition between each temporal phase. The migration of individuals due to the food (seed) availability probably explains the haplotype and nucleotide variation during outbreak (high food availability) and post-outbreak (low food availability or food shortage), suggesting that at regional scale gene flow is the main mechanism underlying changes in genetic variability at local scale.",

Artemisia oil (0.14\u20130.70\u00a0mg/ml) enhanced the levels of H2O2, O 2 \u2212 \u2022 , and proline suggesting induction of oxidative stress. ROS generation was confirmed by in situ detection of cell death, loss of membrane permeability, H2O2 accumulation, and lipid peroxidation in intact roots. The activities of the scavenging enzymes- superoxide dismutases, catalases, ascorbate- and guaiacol- peroxidases, and glutathione reductases- were significantly elevated in response to Artemisia oil suggesting their induction as a secondary defense mechanism to scavenge increased ROS generation.

In the present study, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were employed to investigate the genetic variability in 20 natural populations of P. tenuifolia. The genetic diversity was low at the population level (PPB\u00a0=\u00a029.95%, h\u00a0=\u00a00.0795, I\u00a0=\u00a00.1261), but substantially higher at the species level (PPB\u00a0=\u00a090.91%, h\u00a0=\u00a00.3100, I\u00a0=\u00a00.4620).

Both Bayesian assignment analysis and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) supported the grouping of the sampled populations (excluding MX and NS) into three genetic clusters, corresponding to three geographic groups; moderate genetic differentiation occurred among the geographic groups (\u03a6ST\u00a0=\u00a00.1500). The isolation-by-distance pattern revealed by Mantel test (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5336, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001, 9999 permutations) indicated a clear geographic tendency in the distribution of genetic diversity in this species.

A correlation analysis was conducted to understand the influence of the species' ecological characteristics on the genetic diversity parameters. The genetic patch widths were estimated through a spatial genetic structure (SGS) analysis. The genetic diversity at the species level was quite compatible (P\u00a0=\u00a090.5%; h\u00a0=\u00a00.352), but reduced by almost half (P\u00a0=\u00a045.6%; h\u00a0=\u00a00.173) at the population level. The genet diversity was high at the species level (Gm/N\u00a0=\u00a00.528; DG\u00a0=\u00a00.980), but it varied among the populations. The high level of interpopulational genetic differentiation (\u0424ST\u00a0=\u00a00.532) appeared to have been influenced by the genetic drift because of the small population size. The flowering rate was positively correlated with each genetic parameter. On the other hand, the coverage of the canopy layer and the number of shoots per bunch were negatively correlated with the genetic parameters. The SGS was significant, but its intensity was low (Sp\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Sexual propagation enhanced the SGS magnitude within a short distance (<1\u00a0m), but not the SGS pattern. Thus, the genetic patch was about 4\u00a0m wide at both the genet and ramet levels. The small and isolated populations of S. chabyoungsanica could be at risk of extinction due to their continuously shrinking population sizes and the accelerated genetic drift. Therefore, several specific conservation measures were suggested.",

Although the plant has a remarkable growth rate under extreme conditions of drought and temperature, biochemical defense-related mechanisms remain unexplored. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the physiology of C. lancifolius under abiotic stress conditions. The plant was exposed to variable drought, salinity and temperature stress conditions and in addition to antioxidant defense compounds, photosynthetic and electron transport rates were measured. Ascorbic acid, phenols and flavonoids were quantified as defense compounds in C. lancifolius. The photosynthetic and electron transport rates decreased under drought and high salinity, but increased with increasing temperature. Phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid contents were positively correlated with electron transport and photosynthetic rates in experiments at higher temperature. Plant phenols increased significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) from 5.37\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 in controls to 8.75\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 in drought-stressed plants. This increase paralleled with an increase in flavonoid content. A consistent increase in phenols/flavonoids was also observed with increasing temperature, salinity and polyethylene glycol (PEG stress). The tolerance of C. lancifolius to extreme temperature stress showed a high correlation with the synthesis of ascorbic acid and flavonoids, indicating their biochemical role in protecting plant cells from damaging reactive oxygen species produced under stress. Ascorbic acid significantly increased (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) from 426\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 in response to temperature stress at 10\u00a0\u00b0C to 477\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g\u22121 in plants grown at 40\u00a0\u00b0C.

We analyzed the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) of the two fragmented populations from the Dalei Mountain and Daming Mountain in China. Significantly positive SGS was observed at a distance of 20\u00a0m in the Dalei Mountain population. Significantly positive SGS was observed at a distance less than 20\u00a0m and a distance of 90\u00a0m in the Daming Mountain population. The Sp (a ratio used to compare the extent of SGS among populations) statistics were quite different between the two populations. The similar genetic patches, but different SGS patterns and intensities, might be due to the population fragmentation and subsequent change of population density and environmental factors, as well as inherent biological traits of S. chinensis. The SGS within different age classes in Daming Mountain population significantly differed from that in Dalei Mountain population, which might be due to different causes of the SGS. The main cause of SGS in Daming Mountain population might be the species traits and anthropological disturbances, while that of SGS in Dalei Mountain population might be the seed shadow overlap caused by population density and subsequent self-thinning.",

We studied patterns of spatial genetic structure and populational differentiation from four natural populations in the North of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Genetic diversity from 240 individuals using allozyme loci was analyzed and inferred by heterozygosity index, Nason's kinship coefficient and assessment of historical population bottlenecks. We did not find evidence of inbreeding within fragments, but from the fitting tests into the infinite allele model of mutation no population was shown to be in equilibrium, indicating recent bottlenecks. Only one population (Japonvar) showed positive coancestry value indicating the tendency of increased structure among trees that are spatially closer to each other. Although the average genetic differentiation in each population pair was generally low (DG\u00a0=\u00a00.036), Mantel tests showed tendency for distance dependence of genetic structure (rm\u00a0=\u00a00.905, P\u00a0=\u00a00.084).

Percentage of polymorphic loci, estimated using Nei's genetic diversity index and Shannon's information index revealed low or moderate levels of genetic variations within each F. imperialis population. Similarly, the mean coefficient of gene differentiation between populations (Gst) for RAPD, ISSR and AFLP were 0.415, 0.47 and 0.63 respectively, indicating that 58.5%, 52.3% and 36.1% of genetic diversity resided within the population.

For ten of these species, 2\u20138 samples were examined to investigate a possible infraspecific variation in flavonoids. Nineteen flavonoids belonging to various different classes (flavone C- and O-glycosides, flavonol glycosides, isoflavone glycosides and flavanones) were detected. Previous DNA sequence analyses have resulted in the grouping of Adenocarpus species into four different clades, so that the results of the flavonoid survey could be compared with that of molecular studies. A good correlation was found in that each of the clades could also be characterised by a combination of flavonoids. For example, the species in clade 4, which are distributed in\u00a0South and South-East Europe and tropical Africa, are characterised by the presence of\u00a0flavonol O-glycosides and 5-hydroxyisoflavone O-glycosides. In contrast, flavonol O-glycosides were absent from all but one species of the other three clades, which have a mainly North Africa distribution, and these species produce flavone mono-C-glycosides and/or flavone 7-O-glycosides instead. In addition flavone 4\u2032-O-glycosides were only found in species of clade 1 and flavanones were mainly restricted to clade 3. The relationships among species of Adenocarpus suggested by flavonoid profiles and DNA sequence analyses provide a framework that can be used as a basis for a new classification of the genus.",

Relatively high levels of genetic variation within (He\u00a0=\u00a00.651\u20130.732) and moderate level of genetic differentiation among the populations (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.0647, P\u00a0<\u00a010\u22124) were observed. Two divergent stocks may exist: one included all populations from ECS extending to off eastern coast of Hainan Island in SCS, and the other comprised one population off southern coast of Hainan Island. It indicated a higher gene flow and a preferential migration dispersion pattern for this species in ECS. S. japonicus had not undergone recent genetic bottlenecks, and this inference is supported by Wilcoxon signed-rank test and mode-shift indicator of allele frequency distribution.

     "abstract": "Employing distance-based, maximum likelihood-based, and Bayesian coalescent methodologies and utilizing mitochondrial control region sequence data, the present study reports the importance of Pleistocene glacial epochs on the demographic expansion of the white catfish, Ameiurus catus. White catfish are endemic to the southeastern region of the United States, the region that had never glaciated during the Pleistocene epoch; however, compared to the present day meandering river patterns, the region did exhibit braided river patterns during the late Quaternary. The present study revealed the existence of two distinct matrilineal lineages of white catfish, southeast Gulf coast (SEGC) and southeast Atlantic coastal plains (SEACP), which are estimated to have diverged from their common ancestor approximately 0.71 (0.37\u20131.1) million years ago. Consistent with the results of the mismatch distribution and site frequency spectrum based summary statistics such as Fu's F, the Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) has also showed evidence for population expansion. The BSP showed two phase growth: a static phase until 0.2 million years, followed by a sudden population expansion thereafter, which is the time that coincides with the late Quaternary epoch. The changing patterns in drainage systems in response to the Quaternary climate change might have had a significant impact on the demographic expansion of white catfish.",

Twenty-eight L. aculeata, five Lactuca serriola, and three putative hybrids L. aculeata\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0L. serriola, i.e. total 36 accessions, representing 13 populations from Israel and 3 from Jordan, were studied. Material originated from various elevations (222\u2013968\u00a0m\u00a0a.s.l.) and habitats. Seeds (achenes) were collected from individual plants, generally separated by at least 2\u00a0m to avoid collection of duplicated material, at different sites across Israel. The material was regenerated and taxonomically validated at the Department of Botany, Palack\u00fd University in Olomouc, Czech Republic. Morphological characterization showed that the Israeli populations of L. aculeata do not exhibit broad morphological variability. Eight enzymatic systems were analysed for their polymorphism (esterase, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, leucine aminopeptidase, malic enzyme, NADH dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase). In total, nine of 21 loci scored for the entire set of Lactuca spp. samples exhibited polymorphic character. A highly homogeneous group of the 28 (ca 75%) L. aculeata accessions were grouped in one compact cluster, while the remaining accessions formed additional two smaller clusters with higher values of genetic distance indices. The five L. serriola accessions constituted the most distant cluster. Three accessions exhibiting a phenotypically intermediate character between L. aculeata and L. serriola, grouped together. They are considered natural putative hybrids of L. aculeata\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0L. serriola. The origin and evolutionary consequences of these hybrids are discussed.",

S. adstringens accessions from populations found in Cerrado regions in the states of Goi\u00e1s, Minas Gerais and S\u00e3o Paulo were analyzed using the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique. A total of 236 polymorphic bands were scored and higher proportion of genetic diversity was found inter populations (70.9%), rather than intra populations (29.1%). FST value was found to be significantly greater than zero (0.2906), demonstrating the complex genetic structure of S. adstringens populations. Accessions collected in Cristalina, GO, showed higher percentage of polymorphic loci (87.3%) and the highest genetic diversity. The lowest genetic variability was detected among accessions from the population growing in Caldas Novas, GO. The genetic distance among populations was estimated using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), which grouped populations into 3 clusters. Moreover, chemotypes with tannin concentration above 40% showed higher genetic similarity. AFLP analysis proved to be an efficient gene mapping technique to determine the genetic diversity among remaining populations of S. adstringens. Obtained results may be employed to implement further strategies for the conservation of this medicinal plant.",

Furthermore, we found highly similar estimates of within-population genetic variability without evidence of genetic differentiation between Sardinian and Adriatic populations. The lack of a signature of a founder effect in the Sardinian samples, notwithstanding their recent introduction, indicates that the number of R. philippinarum individuals released into the Gulf of Olbia may have been high enough to reduce the loss of genetic variability due to genetic drift. Furthermore, the absence of genetic differentiation observed between samples from the two areas suggests that the two populations belong to the same gene pool.

No allelopathic effects were observed when the dichloromethane extracts of T. catappa fruit or leaf extracts were applied to the weeds E. heterophylla and C. benghalensis. Bioassays with seasonal sampling revealed an influence on the allelochemical potential of T. catappa. Considering the methodology adopted and the experimental results, the allelopathic activity of T. catappa seems to be related to the interaction of different groups of substances, some of them identified and characterized in this work.",

Ornus and Fraxinus chiisanensis in Korea (as incertae sedia sensu Wallander).

The gain of O-flavone appears to be a significant evolutionary step; however, the sporadic occurrence of O-flavone in some species is the result of chemical advancement. The present study demonstrated that flavonoid chemistry may indeed be as variable as the morphological features, with no significant flavonoid differences observed at the species level. However, F.\u00a0hopeiensis, found in the mountain regions of Hebei in northern China, has petals like Fraxinus sieboldiana and F. lanuginosa and is clearly different from other related taxa, including Fraxinus rhynchophylla and Fraxinus chinensis.

When C. reinhardtii cells were exposed to the VOCs from the salt-stressed cells, the cell density was reduced, but the content of chlorophyll, Fv/Fm and antioxidant enzyme activity were increased.

Understanding its genetic diversity is essential for its conservation and sustainable utilization. Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and differentiation in 7 wild populations of E. mollis. Ten primer pairs yielded a total of 163 alleles. Allelic richness (Ar\u00a0=\u00a012.3), Nei\u2019s gene diversity (H\u00a0=\u00a00.69) and observed heterozygosity (HO\u00a0=\u00a00.63) indicated high species-level genetic diversity.

The present genetic structure of E. mollis may be explained by its life-history traits, breeding system, unique biological traits and anthropogenic disturbance. Considering the high intraspecific genetic diversity, the endangerment of E. mollis has more likely resulted from anthropologic effects. A proper conservation strategy is proposed for this plant.",

We compared the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) of two Mexican cycads, Dioon caputoi and Dioon merolae, which differ in aspects such as distribution range, density and population size, and habitat requirements, with the premise that this interspecific comparison will help to contrast the effects of these aspects on local genetic organization and thereby infer the possible causes of differences in distribution. We estimated the autocorrelation index rij, for the delineation of genetic neighborhoods. We used 14 alloenzymatic loci in D. caputoi and ten in D. merolae, and found that populations of D. caputoi have higher autocorrelation coefficients (rij\u00a0=\u00a00.113 and 0.082) than that of D. merolae (rij\u00a0=\u00a00.034). Contrary to expectations, we found that the inferred dispersal distance is not lower in D. caputoi, of narrow distribution compared to D. merolae. Contrasting population densities and habitat types may explain these differences, even when both species have the same type of seed and pollen dispersal vectors. We conclude that wide distribution and greater population density of D. merolae (compared to D. caputoi) is probably not due to greater dispersal ability, but to a higher capacity for colonization.",

Fungus-growing ants, a tribe of over 230 species within the subfamily Myrmicinae, are unique among ants because they cultivate fungus gardens inside their nests as food. Here the chemistry of the exocrine glands of the two genera most closely related to the conspicuous leaf-cutting ants are examined. Based on a recent phylogeny of the fungus-growing ants, these genera comprise three clades that together link the more basal species to the most derived, leaf-cutting species. The leaf-cutting ants possess many derived characteristics such as extensive leaf-cutting behavior and massive colony sizes, effectively making them major herbivores in many Neotropical habitats. This is the first comparison of the chemistry of eight Trachymyrmex and one Sericomyrmex species in a phylogenetic context. Most of the compounds found in the Trachymyrmex species examined were terpenes. In one species, the major component was \u03b1,\u03b1-acariolide, the first example of this compound, which was only previously reported in mites, from an insect.

Cephalic labial gland secretions of 29 specimens from these different taxa were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). About 50 compounds were identified, including a mixture of straight-chain fatty acid derivatives (alkenoles, acids, acetates and esters), and the usual pattern of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons C21\u2013C29. The secretions of all specimens investigated were very similar: ethyl dodecanoate was identified as the main component (90\u201397% peak area). Since the sum of percentage peak areas for the hydrocarbons amounted up to 3\u20136%, most of the remaining compounds (8 alkenoles, 6 acids, 6 acetates and 20 esters) could only be detected at very low levels (<0.1% peak area).

Male cephalic labial gland secretions of 20 specimens from these sympatric taxa were also investigated to see how far their pattern of compounds differed from that of the cryptarum complex taxa (cryptarum\u2013burjaeticus\u2013florilegus\u2013moderatus). Besides some quantitative differences in ethyl dodecanoate and ethyl octadec-9-enoate, the occurrence of octadeca-9,12-dien-1-ol, octadeca-9,12,15-trien-1-ol and octadec-11-en-1-ol was an essential qualitative difference that separated the labial gland secretions of B. magnus, B. patagiatus and B. occidentalis from those of their sympatric counterparts. A principal component analysis confirmed this separation. Due to their low variability and differences in pattern of compounds compared to those of closely related sympatric bumblebees, the labial gland secretions of B. cryptarum, B. burjaeticus, B. florilegus and B. moderatus distributed across Europe, the Russian Far East and North America are very well suited to function as \u2018species recognition signal\u2019.

     "abstract": "Many species of the Papilionidae are unpalatable and protected from natural enemies by aristolochic acids (AAs) sequestered from their Aristolochiaceae food plants. Battus polydamas (Papilionidae, Troidinii) is an Aristolochia-feeding papiloinoid butterfly. The uptake of AAs and other secondary metabolites by B. polydamas larvae from Aristolochia c was examined. The AA composition of larva, pupa and imago of B. polydamas was determined by HPLC-PDA, HPLC-MS-MS and comparison with authentic samples. The plant is rich in AA-II which is accompanied by minor amounts of AAs I, III, IV, Ia, IIIa, IVa and IVb. All eight AA analogs plus four O-glucosides from the phenolic AAs Ia, IIIa, IVa and IVb were present in the insect extracts. The AA-analogs IVb, Ia O-glucoside, IVb O-glucoside are described for the first time. The larval haemolymph qualitatively reflects the AA-pattern of the plant and is also rich in AA-II. Analysis of the larval tissues and the osmeterial secretion shows that the phenolic AAs are significantly O-glucosylated. Except for AA-I, all the AAs are gradually catabolized into unknown compounds throughout the life stages of B. polydamas, being therefore much less abundant or absent in the imago. In the imago AA-II becomes undetectable whereas AA-I remains as the major AA. Results suggest that predominance of AA-I in the adult may be due to repressed degradation of this acid rather than selective sequestration from the plant or de novo synthesis by the insect. Some aspects related to aristolochic acid uptake and metabolism are discussed.",

Samples of the two species were collected during different stages of their growth period. The HPLC generated chromatographic data were analyzed using principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Two major clusters were formed, each consisting of a single species. The entire dataset was then divided into two: a training set and a test set. Supervised pattern recognition techniques, soft independent modeling by class analogy (SIMCA) and back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), were performed. SIMCA failed to predict one sample, whereas BP-ANN precisely predicted the whole test set. In conclusion, fingerprint analysis assisted by pattern recognition techniques is a potential strategy for the authentication and differentiation of species used in herbal medicines.",

Thus, the quantification of polyamines and tryptamine within tissues of less and more susceptible triticale cultivars (cvs.) to bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) was performed. The obtained results showed that shoots of the studied cvs. contained such polyamines as putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine and spermine, and aromatic monoamine tryptamine. More susceptible Tornado cv. was characterised by a higher content of putrescine and spermidine, and a lower level of cadaverine compared to less susceptible Witon cv. The aphid feeding on Tornado seedlings at the beginning caused an increase of tryptamine and spermine content. Prolongation of the infestation reduced the amines level with the exception of spermine after one week of infestation. The less susceptible Witon cv. reacted by increase of putrescine and spermine level, and by decrease of cadaverine and tryptamine content in initial period of infestation. Further extension of R. padi feeding to one week caused reduction of the level of all analysed amines. After two week period the putrescine level was still decreased, while cadaverine, spermidine and tryptamine was enhanced.",

However, the study of 19 populations scattered along the taxon\u2019s range, revealed that the plants are characterized by a variety of odors. In particular plants from 10 populations, having essential oils rich in carvacrol (up to 62.3% of the total oil), emitted an \u201coregano\u201d odor, while plants from seven populations, with oils rich in p-cymene (up to 49.8%) and/or thymol (up to 48.1%) had a \u201cthyme\u201d odor; the plants from the other two populations, with linalool-rich oils (59.2 and 82.7%) had a prominent \u201clavender\u201d odor. A discriminant analysis with pre-defined groups the bioclimatic zone wherefrom the plants were collected has shown that the essential oil content and the amount of carvacrol gradually decrease from the Mesomediterranean to the Temperate Axeric bioclimates, while the amounts of p-cymene, thymol and linalool, increase. Our results, supported by similar findings concerning East Mediterranean taxa traded as \u201coregano\u201d, have shown that in order to characterize a herb as \u201ctrue oregano\u201d, the plant odor, reflecting the oil composition, as well as the collection areas of the plants should be taken into account.",

Thirteen accessions of Rauvolfia collected from different locations in the Western Ghat region of the peninsular India were analyzed for genetic variation using 15 ISSR primers. The 91 polymorphic amplicons generated were statistically analyzed using WinDist and PopGene software to calculate various diversity indices. Contrary to the general concept of low genetic variation associated with inbreeders, R. serpentina exhibits high genetic diversity as the similarity index value based on Nei and Li\u2019s similarity coefficient ranges from 0.44 to 0.92 with mean value of 0.70. This is supported by other diversity parameters like Degree of genetic differentiation (Gst), Gene flow (Nm), Nei\u2019s gene diversity (h) and Shannon index of genetic diversity (I). Cluster analysis showed characteristic grouping which is not in accordance with their geographical affiliation. The result indicates that ISSR markers are sufficiently informative in assessing genetic diversity across wild accessions of R. serpentina.

The highest nucleotide diversity of the RPB2 data set was found for P. spicata among the taxa analyzed. Our phylogenetic analyses separated the accessions of P. spicata into several groups, with 7\u00a0accessions of P. spicata forming a highly supported subclade (BS\u00a0=\u00a0100%, PP\u00a0=\u00a01.00). The\u00a0phylogenetic analysis also suggests that P. spicata, Pseudoroegneria gracillima and Pseudoroegneria stipifolia have a closer relationship than the other species within Pseudoroegneria. Pseudoroegneria libanotica and P. tauri were also found to exhibit a high level of sequence homology, however, only nuclear gene data (RPB2 and EF-G) clearly indicated the differentiation between the P. libanotica\u00a0+\u00a0P. tauri group with other St\u00a0genome species.",

The GC\u2013MS data was exported to MetAlign\u2122 for spectral alignment and differentiation. The mid-infrared red (MIR) spectral data was processed using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) algorithms. The oil from E. punctulatus showed a different profile from the commercial sample which mostly contained 1,8-cineole, piperitone, yomogi alcohol and pogostol. MetAlign\u2122 successfully discriminated between the oil obtained from the two species and this data together with multivariate analysis showed that the commercial oil was similar to E. tenuifolius oil. Using the MIR data, a three component OPLS-DA model was constructed which convincingly discriminated between E. tenuifolius and E. punctulatus oil.

The significant genetic differentiation found among S. zunasi populations might also be due to geographic isolation, because a pattern of isolation-by-distance was observed. The weaker but significant structures between the Japanese Aichi and Kagawa populations might be impacted by the semi-enclosed coastal topography there.

The inhibition effect of the VOCs on the tested grass species was significantly greater from damaged than from undamaged plants of A. frigida.

     "abstract": "The sometimes-distant association between dispersal movements and mating strategies may govern seabird ecology. Despite their large dispersal capability, pelagic seabirds are subject to the influence of physical and non-physical barriers that may limit the magnitude of realized effective dispersal and gene flow. The Magnificent Frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) is a widespread, tropical, pelagic, sequentially monogamous seabird capable to breach physical barriers, such as land masses. Nevertheless, Mexican frigatebirds have shown movement preferences by sex (female migration and high male site fidelity), which, along with the complex female mate choice behavior, may promote breeding isolation. In order to ascertain if levels of population structure are influenced by physical or non-physical barriers, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA variation of adult Magnificent Frigatebirds breeding in the main nesting colonies in Mexico, three in the eastern Pacific Ocean and one in the Caribbean Sea. Control region sequences revealed significant genetic structure between Pacific and Caribbean frigatebirds (AMOVA, \u03a6SC\u00a0=\u00a00.105, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but none among Pacific breeding colonies (non-significant pairwise \u03a6ST). Whereas the C-haplotype was shared by Pacific and Caribbean frigatebirds, the T-haplotype was absent in the Caribbean. Genetic differentiation between ocean basins and available evidence of Mexican frigatebird movements suggest that in spite of the capability of frigatebirds to breach physical barriers, movement preferences by sex and mate selection acting in a large inter-oceanic scale are the prime behaviors promoting population structure, which is highly consequential for their conservation.",

Moreover trees in competition allocate proportionally more biomass to the trunk and less to foliage and branches.

To test this hypothesis, 10 enzyme systems were screened using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis, from which 14 presumed allozyme loci were scored and 13 found to be polymorphic. For these 13 polymorphic loci the expected heterozygosity levels were moderate (Hexp\u00a0=\u00a00.036\u20130.183, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.101). Genetic differentiation among the samples was low, with a low FST value (0.254) and genetic distance (D\u00a0=\u00a00.000\u20130.124, mean\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and no significant isolation by distance (IBD) across the whole sampled range of Thailand or Thailand plus Malaysia. However, an IBD pattern in the population substructure in the central Thailand region was detected. The low FST and moderate Hexp values in various populations of C. siamensis suggests a high degree of gene flow/migration between populations across the three geographic regions of Thailand (northern, central and southern) as well as the sampled population in Malaysia, perhaps associated with the anthropochoric effect of snail dispersal. The apparent IBD in the central Thailand region could be the consequence of local dynamics though this region.",

     "abstract": "Host recognition is a key process in oligolectic bees but the mechanisms through which they find and recognize appropriate pollen host plant are not entirely clear. Hoplitis adunca is a monolectic bee collecting pollen only from Echium spp. (Boraginaceae). We aimed to test whether Echium vulgare floral scent plays a major role in the attraction of H. adunca females, and to identify components of E. vulgare scent that may be involved in this specific attraction. We used a combination of behavioral and chemical (GC/GC\u2013MS, PTR-MS) analyses. In order to identify the chemical cues likely to be involved in the specific attraction of H. adunca, we compared the scent of fresh flowers, nectar, pollen, and whole plants of E. vulgare and Anchusa officinalis, another Boraginaceae, which does not attract H. adunca. H. adunca females were attracted to the scent of E. vulgare flowers when offered against a blank or against the scent of A. officinalis flowers. However, H. adunca females were not attracted to the scent of A. officinalis flowers when offered against a blank. The emission spectra of the two plant species differed markedly, as did the emission spectra of various flower components (pollen, nectar and whole flowers) within a species. Pollen presented a low volatile release, but emitted significantly higher amounts of mass 55 (butanal, 1,3-butadiene, or other volatiles of molecular mass 54), and mass 83 (hexanal, hexenols, hexenyl acetate, or other volatiles of molecular mass 82) in E. vulgare than in A. officinalis. Nectar produced a particular emission spectrum with high emission rates of masses 109 and 123. Mass 109 may likely correspond to 1,4-benzoquinone, a volatile specifically measured in E. vulgare in parallel studies to this one. The flower emission spectrum was mainly a combination of the pollen and the nectar scents, although it also contained additional volatile compounds such as those of mass 63 or mass 81. As for terpenes, E. vulgare emitted limonene, longicyclene, junipene, trans-caryophyllene and \u03b1-humulene, that were not detected in A. officinalis, and the most emitted monoterpenes were \u03b1-pinene, junipene and limonene whereas the most emitted terpenoid by A. officinalis was \u03b1-pinene. After identifying these chemical cues, olfactory/behavioural assays with specific volatiles and combinations of volatiles are necessary to understand the chemical interactions of the H. adunca-E. vulgare system.",

We conducted the experiments to investigate the difference in diversity and community structure of actinobacteria with respect to sampling sites and seasons and to determine effect of plant species on selection of rhizosphere community from different sampling sites. Total genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from rhizosphere soils collected from two plantations in Phetchabun province and one plantation in each Nakhonnayok province, Rayong province and Chiang Mai province of Thailand during dry and rainy seasons. The UPGMA dendrogram generated from DGGE fingerprints showed that the actinobacterial community was separated corresponding to sampling sites, suggesting sampling sites effect. The shift in community and diversity between two seasons was detected in all sampling sites. RNA-based analyses showed that several actinobacterial groups appeared to be ubiquitous but different in metabolic activity in different environments. Species diversity (S) and simple indexes (I) indicate the increase in species diversity of actinobacteria from all sampling sites in rainy season. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments obtained from DGGE bands revealed that 14 of 40 dominant species of actinobacteria in the rhizospheres of this plant belonged to uncultured actinobacteria. Besides the uncultured actinobacteria, Nocardioides sp., Streptomyces sp., Mycobacterium sp., Rhodococcus sp. and Actinoplanes sp. were indentified and frequently found more than other genera.",

Eight AFLP primer combinations revealed 150 polymorphic bands (59.5%). The highest and the lowest PIC were 0.87 and 0.81 for E-CAA/M-ACC and E-CAA/M-AGA primer combinations, respectively, with average polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.84 over all primer combinations. Cluster analysis based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic Average (UPGMA) and Jaccard\u2019s coefficient grouped the five species and varieties into two main clusters. The first cluster contained the accessions belonging to O. ciliatum and the second comprised different botanical varieties of O. basilicum and O. minimum. The means of Shannon\u2019s diversity index and Nei\u2019s index of genetic diversity indicated that O. basilicum had the greatest variation, while O. ciliatum showed the least variation. Nei\u2019s genetic identity measured in five Ocimum species and botanical varieties revealed the highest identity (0.939) between O. minimum and O. basilicum var. purpurascens and the lowest genetic identity (0.611) between O. basilicum var. purpurascens and O. ciliatum. In conclusion AFLP results indicated that O. minimum should be considered as a variety of O. basilicum.",

In this study, we examined whether the genus Rheum, with extensive diversification in the Qinghai-Tibeten Plateau (QTP) and adjacent regions, possessed the duplication of the chalcone synthase (CHS) genes and whether it underwent positive evolution. Here we cloned CHS-like genes from 16 Rheum species. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that CHS-like genes from Rheum comprised two monophyletic lineages (subfamilies), both of which were sisters to another related genus. The results showed that a genus-specific duplication occurred after this genus originated. The comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratios between the two lineages in Rheum further indicated that a few sites along the duplicate branch underwent positive selection. The findings indicate that the duplication of Rheum species could contribute to their adaptive ability to rapidly changing environments which was resulted from the large-scale uplifts stages of QTP.",

Thus, the possible factors for low germination percentage in this cultivar have not been reported. The effect of three different temperatures (10, 25, or 35\u00a0\u00b0C), polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) and polyamine synthesis inhibitor, methylglyoxals-bis (guanyl-hydrazone) (MGBG) on in\u00a0vitro pollen germination and pollen tube growth were investigated in P. dulcis L. \u2018Mamaei\u2019. All temperatures and chemicals significantly affected both pollen germination percentage and pollen tube growth. In general, different polyamines stimulated the pollen germination percentage compared to the control at all temperatures, but increasing the temperature, particularly to 35\u00a0\u00b0C, had demonstrated inhibitory effects on pollen germination. At a concentration of 0.05\u00a0mM putrescine and spermidine and 0.005 and 0.025\u00a0mM spermine revealed longer pollen tube growth than that of the control at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, while higher concentrations tended to inhibit pollen tube growth. At 25\u00a0\u00b0C, most of the treatments had an inhibitory effect on pollen tube growth except for 0.25\u00a0mM putrescine and 0.005\u00a0mM spermine, which slightly stimulated pollen tube growth. Pollen germination and pollen tube growth were inhibited by MGBG at all temperatures and in all concentrations.",

The two genera are not included in the major classification systems. However, their systematic position and origin have been subject to intense debate in the last decade. In this study, the phylogeny and divergence times of both Apterosperma and Euryodendron were inferred using combined dataset of chloroplast DNA trnL-F and atpB-rbcL non-coding sequences and nrDNA ITS sequences. The results from Bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood consistently showed that (i) Euryodendron is a valid genus, which is closer to Eurya than to Cleyera and (ii) Apterosperma is a genus of the tribe Theeae along with Tutcheria and Camellia. It was first reported that the divergence time of Apterosperma was 61.98 million years ago (mya), whereas that of Euryodendron 20.51\u00a0mya, indicating Tertiary origins in south China. The divergence of Apterosperma appears to be the result of increased ecological opportunity after Cretaceous/Tertiary extinction events and related with high temperatures and high humidity environments. By contrast, the origin of Euryodendron may be associated with historical mountain building events as well as the significant climate changes that established cooler temperatures prevailing until today.",

The coefficient of gene differentiation (GST, 42.8%) and the results of analysis of molecular variance (AMVOA) indicated that genetic differentiation occurred mainly within populations. The estimated gene flow (Nm) from GST was 0.669. It indicated that the fragmentation and isolation of populations might result from specific evolutionary history and anthropogenic activity.

Simple regressions of gall incidence and chemical diversity and the tree origin elevation and latitude were very weak. The linear multiple regression to explain gall incidence with 33 foliar compounds and geographical data produced a model with low predictive power (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.13).

The gray mullet, Mugil cephalus, represents an interesting case of a marine species with a coastal ecology and a cosmopolitan distribution. In this study, partial cytochrome b sequences were resolved for 177 M. cephalus specimens sampled from 14 different geographic sites, in order to investigate the genetic divergence and the phylogeographic relationship among populations at a global scale. Demographic parameters were also assessed. Analysis of partial cyt b sequences showed high levels of differentiation among populations from distant geographic areas as most populations harbored private alleles and showed reciprocal monophyly. Both phylogenetic trees and haplotype network indicate the East Australian haplotypes as the closest to the ancestor sequences, which leads to the hypothesis of an Indo-West Pacific center of origin for M. cephalus. The analyses of the molecular variance showed that the genetic variation in M. cephalus is mainly harbored among populations rather than within populations. The high variability indices (h, \u03c0) calculated on M. cephalus individuals pooled together and the very low variability indices detected at some geographic sampling sites suggest that gray mullet populations have undergone a long-term reproductive isolation characterized by events of population abundance reductions which may have favored genetic differentiation among populations.",

Some of the odoriferous compounds are very likely originated in the anal-sac secretions, and later incorporated onto feces during defecation. However, the abundance of the main odoriferous compounds in feces could be explained by the result of the bacterial action on food components. Feces of pups only had 26 compounds, most of these were also found in adults\u2019 feces, but four compounds were only found in pups\u2019 feces, and there were also age-related differences respect to the proportions of shared chemicals. These differences could be partly due to the absence of anal-sac glands in pups, which would not need to scent mark substrates.",

     "abstract": "Many marine gastropods are sedentary as adults but have planktonic larvae which can potentially be dispersed over large distances. Consequently larval transport is expected to play a prominent role in facilitating gene flow and determining population structure. The spotted babylon (Babylonia areolata) is a dioecious species possessing an approximately two week planktonic larval stage. We analyzed the population structure of the spotted babylon using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). One hundred and sixteen AFLP loci were analyzed in 63 individuals from three populations and revealed a high level of genetic diversity, with all individuals harboring a unique banding pattern. AMOVA results and an assignment test revealed that population differentiation was present. PCoA, pairwise FST and UPGMA tree all revealed that gene flow might be present only on a small geographic scale (around 160\u00a0km), but, over a large distance (around 1000\u00a0km), only reduced gene flow occurred. A mantel test indicated a highly significant positive correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distance.",

In this context, six C. menthoides populations collected in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, were analyzed by ISSR. The populations were sorted as four clusters according to geographic distribution. The six C. menthoides populations analyzed presented low genetic variability, indicating that each population derives from a limited number of plants in a low gene flow scenario. In situ and ex situ conservation approaches may be useful in this species. Conservation strategies for the species should be based on in situ and ex situ approaches.",

The analysis of molecular variance demonstrated that almost the variation (86.64%) occurred within populations. The differentiation among populations was not significant, and population structure was weak. These results revealed that three natural populations of G. maculatum are not genetically differentiated and the large disparity of living altitude did not caused genetic differentiation between different populations.

A significant level of genetic differentiation was detected in pairwise group comparisons. Pairwise FST values ranged from 0.019 to 0.028, indicating, however, a level of similarity among the groups higher than that observed in other species of the Picea genus. Cluster analysis indicated that the three groups analyzed here derived from a single gene pool. We propose that moisture differences in the sand dunes may lead to the observed differentiation in P. mongolica populations, which may be accelerated by habitat fragmentation.

This alkaloid has been proposed to have a restricted distribution within the former lilioid subfamily Wurmbeoideae. After the disintegration of the broadly circumscribed lily family this subfamily has been known as Colchicaceae. Phylogenetic analysis of lilioid monocotyledons has shown that the family Colchicaceae includes a number of genera previously not placed in Wurmbeoideae, eg. Burchardia, Disporum, Schelhammera, Tripladenia and Uvularia. By using the sensitive technique of nanospray mass spectrometry we here show that these genera do contain colchicine. In the case of Burchardia and Uvularia this is contrary to published reports. To test the assumption that colchicine is restricted to Colchicaceae we analysed samples from all genera in the family lacking information, or having conflicting reports, for colchicine content. We also sampled the closest relatives of the family according to phylogenetic results, and a number of genera with historical reports of colchicine presence. All samples from Colchicaceae contained colchicine, while none of the samples from genera in other families did. This implies that the biosynthesis of colchicine evolved within the common ancestor to Colchicaceae, and that this alkaloid may be regarded as a synapomorphic character for the family.",

In addition, the pre-mating females showed no clear preference for the host or non-host plants. These findings suggest that pre-mating females do not actively search for host plants. In contrast numbers of landings increased in post-mating females, immediately after mating, and there was a markedly higher preference for cabbage than lettuce.When plant odors were blocked by covering the plants with transparent or black polyethylene bags there was no difference in the landing preference of adult post-mating females, indicating that the adult females were unable to distinguish between cabbage and lettuce when their olfactory sense was blocked. The greater number of adult females landing on the plants covered with transparent polyethylene bags than those covered with black bags indicated that the females recognize the plants visually. When the transparent and black polyethylene bags had holes that enabled olfactory signals to reach the females, there was a clear preference for cabbage over lettuce. These results together with a preference for lettuce plants treated with cabbage volatile extracts than lettuce plants treated with lettuce volatile extracts indicate that the adult females detect host plants using their olfactory sense.",

High degrees of population differentiation were found in both M. chejuense (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.245) and B. ternatum (FST\u00a0=\u00a00.414).The extremely low levels of genetic diversity in M. chejuense would be attributable to inbreeding coupled with random genetic drift and rarity. In situ protection of habitats of standing populations and ex situ preservation of several populations are suggested for the development of conservation strategies for M. chejuense.",

The analyses were based on 287-bp of the mitochondrial control region from 122 Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and two Atlantic humpback dolphins (Sousa teuszii). All specimens from China grouped together in a well-supported clade with high bootstrap (BS) and Bayesian posterior probability values (BPP), strongly suggesting that only one species of Sousa exists in China. Six haplotypes were identified in 65 individuals from Xiamen and Pearl River Estuary in China. The extremely low level of detected mtDNA genetic diversity strongly suggests a high priority in conservation of Sousa. The highly significant genetic differentiation between the two populations in Xiamen and Pearl River Estuary supports the designation of these two populations as separate management units (MUs) when designing management programs for this species.",

This innovative procedure, using a cation exchange resin (Dowex), allows separating precisely different fractions of EPS, especially pure bound EPS. Moreover, it avoids the contamination of EPS fractions by residual and intracellular polymers, enabling to properly estimate polymeric contents in each fraction. The results were partly similar to conventional results described in the literature and the amount of colloidal carbohydrates (146\u00a0\u03bcg/g of dry sediment) extracted by the Dowex method fitted well with different EPS estimation in European mudflats. Colloidal carbohydrates were essentially composed of glucose (>50%), a carbon source rapidly consumed by the various communities in the sediment. Pure bound carbohydrates were composed of specific carbohydrates (28% rhamnose, 22% xylose). Residual fractions, considered as containing some refractory bound EPS and mostly other internal polymeric substances, presented a more varied composition rich in carbohydrates: galacturonic acid (20%), mannose (19.5%), glucose (19%), arabinose (15%), xylose (8%), galactose (7%).",

In this study, we used AFLP marker to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of rice grasshoppers collected from south China, with emphasis on testing the hypothesis that there was significant genetic differentiation among grasshopper populations associated with different hosts (i.e. wild vs. cultivated rice). Seven populations consisting of 104 individuals were sampled from Hainan Island and the mainland of south China. Eight primer combinations produced 564 reliable bands, of which 563 were polymorphic. O. japonica showed considerable genetic variation at population level, with gene diversity (HE) ranging from 0.1103 to 0.2035. Genetic diversity were studied on seven populations, and generally three populations from wild rice had higher levels of genetic diversity (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.1635) than the other four populations feeding on cultivated rice (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.1327).

The FA composition of the muscles of the five populations was similar within each year, with larger differences between the years. Multivariate, supervised learning method PLS, applied pairwise, showed distinct FA composition, between the scallops from the five locations, indicating population differences. The relatedness between the populations was different in the two years, but the distinct FA profiles of the adductor muscle could be used to distinguish between scallop populations on a local scale. The results indicate habitat-specific lipid metabolism which may have important implications for the scallop aquaculture industry in the context of producing well adapted individuals for the specific locations.",

     "abstract": "Chemical signals can be the basis of interspecific recognition and speciation in many animals. The Columbretes Islands wall lizard, Podarcis atrata is very close genetically to the mainland Iberian wall lizard Podarcis hispanica. However, a previous study suggested that chemosensory interspecific recognition would avoid reproductive interactions and hybridization between these two species. These results suggested that chemicals used in intraspecific communication might differ in composition and/or proportions between these two species. In this paper, we used gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) to characterize the chemical composition of the lipophilic fraction from femoral gland secretions of male P. atrata and P. hispanica. The analysis showed that chemicals found in femoral secretions varied in composition and proportions between species and between populations. Seven steroids and two unidentified waxy esters, were exclusive of P. atrata lizards from the islands. In contrast, nine steroids and other six compounds were only found in mainland P. hispanica. There were also differences in proportions of shared compounds between species. Moreover, all these differences were higher between P. atrata and P. hispanica than between any population of P. hispanica. Chemical differences might be consequence of genetic differences, but they could also be explained by adaptation to different habitats with different climatic conditions or diet resources. Compounds that are specific of each species, or differences in the pattern of compounds, could explain species recognition. Therefore, these results of chemical composition and previous studies of chemosensory recognition reinforce the fact that the genetic differences between P. hispanica and P. atrata may result in an effective reproductive isolation between these two taxa.",

The pH of the pigmented epidermal cell sap of the jade vine petal was exceptionally high, 7.90, while the pH value of the colourless inner tissue was 5.60. Copigmentation test using the mixtures of malvin and saponarin (1:9\u00a0M ratio) at various pH values revealed that the characteristic blue green colour of the jade vine is developed by copigmentation of malvin with saponarin in slightly alkaline cell sap, pH 7.9.

Three chloroplast regions and six nuclear genes were sequenced to assess the genetic variation of a species of mangroves, Sonneratia ovata, from China and Thailand. No nucleotide polymorphism was found in the three chloroplast regions and in the six nuclear genes from all of the four populations examined. The depauperation of polymorphism in S. ovata in comparison to moderate polymorphisms of other congeneric species is surprising, particularly considering high level of polymorphism in the past and relatively wide geographic distribution of the species. Since multiple independent loci were surveyed in this study, the most plausible explanation for our observation is that S. ovata has experienced severe demographic bottlenecks in the Pleistocene glaciation, followed by subsequent recolonization by sea currents in China and Southeast Asia regions. The lack of polymorphism may also be attributable to its small population size, despite its wide geographic distribution.",

Structure elucidation was accomplished by means of gas chromatography retention parameters and GCMS. Eight new fatty acids were identified by their methyl esters and N-acylpyrrolidide derivatives (i.e. 5-methyl-6-octadecenoic, 16-methyl-11-heptadecenoic, 8-methyl-4-tetracosenoic, 8,17-dimethyl-5-octadecenoic, 23-methyl-8-tetracosenoic, 20-methyl-18-tetracosenoic, 4,17-tetracosadienoic and 22,27-dimethyl-5,9-octacosadienoic acids).

In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the RPB2 (RNA polymerase subunit II) gene from Hordelymus europaeus (L.) Harz, and its potential diploid ancestor species those were suggested in previous studies. The focus of this study was to examine the phylogenetic relationship of Hordelymus genomes with its potential donor Hordeum, Psathyrostachys, and Taeniatherum species. Two distinguishable copies of sequences were obtained from H. europaeus. The obvious difference between the two copies of sequences is a 24 bp indel (insertion/deletion). Phylogenetic analysis showed a strong affinity between Hordeum genome and Hordelymus with 85% bootstrap support. These results suggested that one genome in tetraploid H. europaeus closely related to the genome in Hordeum species. Another genome in H. europaeus is sister to the genomes in Triticeae species examined here, which corresponds well with the recently published EF-G data. No obvious relationship was found between Hordelymus and either Ta genome donor, Taeniatherum caput-medusae or Ns genome donor, Psathyrostachys juncea. Our data does not support the presence of Ta and Ns genome in H. europaeus, and further confirms that H. europaeus is allopolyploid.",

The results unambiguously support several previously published proposals to unite Coelonema with Draba and accommodate C. draboides in the latter genus on the basis of morphological re-examination. Our molecular data presented here also provide evidence that these two genera should be combined as a monophyletic group with high support.

A total of nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were employed to study five populations occurring in middle and lower reaches of the river. The results revealed low-to-moderate genetic diversity. The number of alleles per locus varied between 3 and 8 with an average of 4.8. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.15 to a maximum of 1.00. Significant deviations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium were observed for all the tested locus-population combinations with clear heterozygosity deficits. AMOVA indicated that majority of the variance lies within populations (93.81%) than among the populations (7.05%). Pairwise FST and unbiased genetic distance pointed out significant differentiation among the samples from populations with different connections to the Yangtze River. In the UPGMA dendrogram, clustering pattern of populations indicated that most of the populations are reproductively isolated due to anthropogenic interventions. Clustering of PYL and DTL populations shows ongoing gene flow through the mainstream. The recent hydrological alterations and overfishing are major factors shaping the current genetic structure.

Establishing the genetic diversity of the species would assist in its conservation and breeding program. Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population genetic structure in 13 wild populations of R. tanguticum from Qinghai Province. Thirteen selected primers produced 329 discernible bands, with 326 (92.94%) being polymorphic, indicating high genetic diversity at the species level. The Nei's gene diversity (He) was estimated to be 0.1724 within populations (range 0.1026\u20130.2104), and 0.2689 at the species level. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the genetic variation was found mainly within populations (71.02%), but variance among populations was only 28.98%. In addition, Nei's differentiation coefficients (Gst) was found to be high (0.3585), confirming the relatively high level of genetic differentiation among populations. Mantel test revealed a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances (r\u00a0=\u00a00.573, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) clustering and Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) demonstrated similar results. Meanwhile, the genetic diversity of R. tanguticum positively correlated with altitude and annual mean precipitation, but negatively correlated with latitude and annual mean temperature. This result might be an explanation that the natural distribution of R. tanguticum is limited to alpine cold areas. We propose conservation strategy and breeding program for this plant.",

At night, the aposematic coloration is probably not efficient and, if an individual is seized by a predator, thanatosis or stridulation can be used as second lines of defense. The last line of defense is the use of chemical irritants. The defensive secretion is a mixture of two compounds: 2-methyl-5-ethylphenol and 2,5-dimethylphenol. Whereas the anterior half of the ozopore is ornamented with many sharp projections, the posterior half is smooth and membranous, probably causing the secretion to flow only to the lateroposterior area of the body.

A total of 1052 AFLP fragments (of which 94.1% were polymorphic) produced from twelve primer combinations indicate a relatively high level of polymorphism among the accessions. Three major genetic groups that do not strictly follow a geographic distribution pattern were identified using Neighbour-joining and the principal coordinate (PCo) analyses. Accessions from Togo showed higher numbers of private fragments and the highest percentage polymorphism (59.4%). The detection of highest genetic diversity in accessions from Nigeria and Togo and their relationship to other accessions suggest that these countries are the centre of origin and diversity of D. dumetorum. The moderately high genetic diversity (average of 61%) is suggesting great influence on the D. dumetorum germplasms through exchange and transfer of cultivars among local farmers in the sub-region. In contrast, DNA sequence data from the psbA-trnH and the rpoB-trnC chloroplast regions revealed no variation among accessions from the different localities and clearly differentiated by AFLP patterns.

Inflorescences of the wild species, Cleome serrulata Pursh. (Rocky Mountain bee flower) are also two-toned because of the deeper pink colour of the unopened bud. No AVIs were seen.

     "abstract": "Species identification is fundamental to address questions about community ecology, biodiversity, conservation and resource management, at any life history stage. Current studies on fish larval ecology of tropical species are hampered by the lack of reliable and effective tools for identifying larvae at the species level. Emperors and large-eye breams comprise fish species from the perciform fish family Lethrinidae. They inhabit coastal and coral-reef habitats of the tropical Indo-Pacific, and they are important fishery resources. Their taxonomy is considered difficult and identification to species is often problematic. Lethrinidae larvae and juveniles can be identified on the basis of meristic counts at the sub-family level, but no further. In this study, we developed a set of polymorphic PCR markers (size polymorphisms at the intron regions from 4/5 nuclear protein-coding genes and single-strand conformation polymorphism of a 205-bp fragment at the mitochondrial 16S rRNA locus), to characterize 341 specimens from 21 Lethrinidae species from New Caledonia (southwestern tropical Pacific). A genetic data-bank was constructed using the genotypes screened from the multiple gene loci of adult or sub-adult specimens used as references for these species. The 16S rRNA gene fragment was able to differentiate species for the genus Lethrinus, but it provided little diagnostic resolution among different species within the genus Gymnocranius. A combination of the 16S rRNA marker and 4 nuclear markers developed herein allowed to sort out species within Gymnocranius spp. from New Caledonia. Using genotype distributions at nuclear loci to test for reproductive isolation, we found that three apparently undescribed large-eye bream species may exist, provisionally referred to as Gymnocranius sp. A, sp. B and sp. C. Subsequent genotyping of 137 Lethrinidae larvae collected from the bays of the Noumea peninsula, New Caledonia, found a total of three species (Lethrinus genivittatus, Lethrinus olivaceus and Gymnocranius sp. A).",

Genetic diversity was evaluated through allozyme electrophoresis in this rare columbine, together with its widespread congener Aquilegia vulgaris. Low levels of genetic diversity were detected in both taxa, especially for A. paui. Genetic identity between the two columbines was particularly high (I = 0.990), and the allele pool of A. paui is a subset of that of its widespread congener (with the exception of a low-frequency allele that was only detected in one population of A. paui). A. paui may have recently evolved from nearby populations of A. vulgaris. Speciation of this taxon, which may still be ongoing, seems to be driven by ecological differentiation, as generally occurred for the European columbines as well as in many Mediterranean endemic species.",

This result supports the designation of the genus Pseudophilautus to accommodate the Indian and Sri Lankan species. Pseudophilautus consists of two major lineages, one comprises the majority of Indian species, Chinese species, and Southeast Asian species, and one comprises all Sri Lankan species and a few Indian species.

Such compounds may serve multiple ecological roles including anti-predation, anti-fouling functionalities and are implicated in border defense or attack during spatial competition. Relative size of benthic organisms may also play an important role in competitive interactions. To determine if a relationship exists between individual size and bioactive metabolite production in the context of spatial competition, we examined three sponge species with different morphologies: the massive Coscinoderma matthewsi, the club-shaped branching Hyrtios erecta, and the fan-shaped Ianthella basta. Extracts from sponges of various sizes and competitive environments were examined using a cell based bioassay as a proxy of bioactivity. For I. basta, sponge size was correlated with bioactivity; the largest individuals generally being the most bioactive. In contrast, there was no correlation between size and bioactivity for either C. matthewsi or H. erecta. Bioactivity of sponges in this study were however highly variable among individuals, regardless of levels of competition. The prevalence of encroaching organisms was not correlated with sponge size for any of the three sponge species, suggesting that potential bioactivity is not influenced by surrounding competition.",

We found that dragonfly larvae predators consistently produced a negative ion, m/z 501.3, when they fed on bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and mink frog (Rana septentrionalis) tadpoles, but this ion was absent when dragonflies were fasted or fed invertebrate prey. When tadpole behavioral responses to dragonfly chemical cues were examined, tadpoles reduced their activity, particularly in response to dragonflies feeding on tadpoles. Furthermore, a negative correlation was noted between the level of tadpole activity and the concentration of the m/z 501.3 compound in dragonfly feeding trials, indicating that this ion was possibly responsible for tadpole anti-predator behavior.",

Of them, nine loci were successfully amplified in red-spotted tokay geckos using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). A total of 208 different alleles were observed in the 70 wild black-spotted and red-spotted tokays, and the average number of alleles per locus was 17.3. The average values for observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity and polymorphism information content were 0.762, 0.891 and 0.871, respectively, which showed that the wild G. gecko population had a high level of genetic variability. Both black-spotted tokays and red-spotted tokays showed a significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) deficit of heterozygotes. The red-spotted tokay (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.881, A\u00a0=\u00a016.4) had a higher level of genetic variability than black-spotted tokay (HE\u00a0=\u00a00.804, A\u00a0=\u00a010.7). The pairwise FST (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) estimates of the two types of tokay were 0.143, which indicated that there was a significant level of genetic differentiation between the two.",

     "abstract": "Hybrid poplars with Populus maximowiczii parentage have demonstrated antixenotic resistance against adult poplar-and-willow borers, Cryptorhynchus lapathi (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in the summer, and antibiosis against C. lapathi larvae in the spring. We examined phenological and biochemical differences among hybrid poplars with and without P. maximowiczii parentage that are resistant and susceptible, respectively, to C. lapathi, to test the hypotheses that resistance was due to physical hydraulic forces, inadequate nutrition, or abundant secondary metabolites. The hybrids with P. maximowiczii parentage flushed earlier than susceptible hybrids, but no differences were found between hybrids with respect to sap flow or bark moisture content that could explain larval mortality in the spring. Similarly, constitutive levels of nutritive compounds (sitosterol, nitrogen, linoleic and linolenic acids, and carbohydrates) were lower or not different in the most susceptible hybrid TN 302-9. Thus, all hybrids appear to be nutritionally sound. TN 302-9 contained the highest constitutive levels of condensed tannins and catechin, but overall phenolic glycoside levels (salicin and salicortin) were similar among all hybrids, with the exception of one sampling date; however, this difference would not likely explain resistance. Neither induced or constitutive polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity nor induced levels of secondary metabolites could explain resistance. Thus, we conclude hybrids that contain P. maximowiczii parentage have a novel mechanism for resistance.",

     "abstract": "We performed a comparative analysis of the genetic diversity and structure of two congeneric tree species, one critically endangered, with only 21 known individuals in the wild, Dimorphandra wilsonii, and the other widely distributed Dimorphandra mollis. Eight populations of D. mollis and all known trees of D. wilsonii, from three areas, were screened for variability with ISSR markers. Percentage of polymorphic bands, Nei's gene diversity and Shannon's index were considerably lower in D. wilsonii (P\u00a0=\u00a040.0%, h\u00a0=\u00a00.124 and I\u00a0=\u00a00.190), as compared to D. mollis (P\u00a0=\u00a070.4%, h\u00a0=\u00a00.190 and I\u00a0=\u00a00.297). Bayesian clustering showed that D. wilsonii individuals are clustered in three populations, which had high differentiation among them. Several measures for their conservation were suggested: protection of all extant populations, ex situ conservation of seeds, production of saplings in nurseries and foundation of new populations in reserve areas.",

     "abstract": "The chemosystematic value of UV-absorbing leaf constituents was considered in previously uncharacterised representatives of Aloe section Pictae, the problematic maculate species complex. Comparative data indicate that the anthrone C-glycoside, 6\u2032-malonylnataloin (7-hydroxychrysaloin 6\u2032-O-malonate) is typical of maculate species in East Africa, but is unconvincing as a synapomorphy for section Pictae. A naphthalene derivative found widely in Aloe, plicataloside, was detected in Aloe greatheadii. Biogeographical trends were observed in the occurrence of the flavonoids isoorientin (luteolin-6-C-glucoside) and isovitexin (apigenin 6-C-glucoside). Isoorientin is a common constituent of tropical and sub-tropical species of Aloe, whereas isovitexin is restricted to a few southern African species. Isoorientin and isovitexin co-occur in the southern African maculate species Aloe parvibracteata, and the disjunct West African maculate species, Aloe macrocarpa. This is the first report of isoorientin and isovitexin in maculate species of Aloe; the presence of flavonoids in section Pictae is of taxonomic interest.",

High percentage of polymorphism observed by these two markers indicated a high level of genetic diversity existed among P. cablin populations. The percentage of polymorphic bands revealed by these two markers showed genetic variations were much higher between populations of P. cablin than within. The UPGMA clustering results using ISSR, SRAP or ISSR\u00a0+\u00a0SRAP combination showed most accessions from the same or adjacent regions were classified together. However, cluster results based on the absolute contents of patchouli alcohol and pogostone did not keep in good accordance with their geographic distributions, which revealed that the forming of patchouli alcohol and pogostone were relevant to the cultivation conditions except for genetic factors and environmental conditions. Finally, an appropriate strategy for conserving the patchouli germplasm was proposed.",

     "abstract": "Pinus pinaster is one of the most popular conifers used for reforestation in Morocco and represents an economically and ecologically important species for the region. In this study, nuclear microsatellites (ncSSRs) are used to compare genetic structure and diversity estimates of natural populations of Moroccan maritime pine. Samples were collected among 10 natural populations distributed in three biogeographically different regions, the Rif Mountain, the Middle and the High Atlas. Forty-five nuclear alleles at seven variable loci were found with a mean of 6.4 alleles per locus. A number of private alleles (17.1%) were shown in populations from Rif and Middle Atlas. Moreover, in Morocco, P. pinaster showed a lower genetic diversity than in other parts of its geographic range. Significant departures from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium with excess homozygosity are observed indicating a high level of mating inside populations. Genetic diversity was structured with high variability among populations (Fst = 12%). Results show a correlation between genetic and geographic distances with an R-squared of 0.436. Two clusters were found using STRUCTURE, whereas three main clusters can be distinguished based on genetic distances of phylogenetic tree. Genetic relationships among maritime pine populations in Morocco appear to be related to historical, ecological as well as anthropogenic factors, suggesting the need for conservation strategies at the population level.",

The complete mtDNA NADH 3/4 dehydrogenase (ND-3/4) gene amplified by PCR was digested with eight restriction enzymes. These enzymes produced 20 composite haplotypes for G. rufa populations. All the mtDNA haplotypes detected were highly diverged from each other and each lineage had a unique genetic profile. The evaluation of mtDNA PCR-RFLP data coupled with geological history of Anatolia indicated a deep genetic divergence among the mtDNA haplotypes of G. rufa populations from drainages of the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf, suggesting an early isolation of Tigris-Euphrates with Orontes river and other rivers draining into the Mediterranean Sea. In general, data from both mtDNA and nDNA were congruent.",
