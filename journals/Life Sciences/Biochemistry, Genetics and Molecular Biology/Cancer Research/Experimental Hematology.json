     "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 44 (USP44) is a nuclear protein with deubiquitinase (DUB) catalytic activity that has been implicated as an important regulator of cell cycle progression, gene expression, and genomic stability. Dysregulation in the molecular machinery controlling cell proliferation, gene expression, and genomic stability in human or mouse is commonly linked to hematopoietic dysfunction, immunodeficiency, and cancer. We therefore set out to explore the role of USP44 in hematopoietic and immune systems through characterization of a Usp44-deficient mouse model. We report that USP44 is dispensable for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell numbers and function under homeostatic conditions, and also after irradiation or serial transplantation. USP44 is also not required for normal lymphocyte development. Usp44-deficient B cells show normal activation, proliferation, and immunoglobulin class switching in response to in vitro stimulation, and Usp44-deficient mice mount normal antibody response to immunization. We also tested the effects of USP44 deficiency on disease progression and survival in the Emu-myc model of mouse B-cell lymphoma and observed a trend toward earlier lethality of Usp44\u2013/\u2013 Emu-myc mice; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, we conclude that USP44 is dispensable for the normal physiology of hematopoietic and immune systems, and its functions in these systems are likely redundant with other USP family proteins.",

However, the genetic mechanisms and mutational background of these patients have not been fully explored. To improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this subgroup of CLL, seven CLL patients with several chromosomal gains were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-targeted approach. The mutational status of 54 genes was evaluated using a custom-designed gene panel including recurrent mutated genes observed in CLL and widely associated with CLL pathogenesis. A total of 21 mutations were detected; TP53 (42.8%), ATM (28.5%), SF3B1 (28.5%), and BRAF (28.5%) were the most recurrently mutated genes. Of these mutations, 61.9% were detected in genes previously associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. Interestingly, five of the seven patients exhibited alterations in TP53 or ATM (deletion and/or mutation), genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), which could be related to a high genetic instability in this subgroup of patients. In conclusion, CLL patients with several chromosomal gains exhibit high genetic instability, with mutations in CLL driver genes and high-risk genetic alterations involving ATM and/or TP53 genes.",

     "abstract": "More than 2million human erythroblasts extrude their nuclei every second in bone marrow under hypoxic conditions (<7% O2). Enucleation requires specific signal transduction pathways and the local assembly of contractile actomyosin rings. However, the energy source driving these events has not yet been identified. We examined whether different O2 environments (hypoxic [5% O2] and normoxic [21% O2] conditions) affected human CD34+ cell erythroblast differentiation. We also investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying energy production in erythroblasts during terminal differentiation under 5% or 21% O2 conditions. The results obtained revealed that the enucleation ratio and intracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) M3H, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 in erythroblasts during terminal differentiation were higher under the 5% O2 condition than under the 21% O2 condition. We also found that the enzymatic inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and LDH, key enzymes in anaerobic glycolysis, blocked the proliferation of colony-forming units\u2013erythroid and enucleation of erythroblasts, and also reduced ATP levels in erythroblasts under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Under both conditions, phosphorylation of the Ser232, Ser293, and Ser300 residues in pyruvate dehydrogenase (inactive state of the enzyme) in erythroblasts was involved in regulating the pathway governing energy metabolism during erythroid terminal differentiation. This reaction may be mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4, the major PDK isozyme expressed in erythroblasts undergoing enucleation. Collectively, these results suggest that ATP produced by anaerobic glycolysis is the main source of energy for human erythroblast enucleation in the hypoxic bone marrow environment.",

     "abstract": "Transcription factor RUNX1 plays a crucial role in hematopoiesis and its activity is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. However, translational control of RUNX1 expression has not been fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that RUNX1b mRNA is translated from two alternative initiation sites, Met-1 and Met-25, giving full-length RUNX1b and a shorter protein lacking the first 24 amino acids (RUNX1\u0394N24). Presence/absence of strong Kozak consensus sequences around Met-1 determines which initiation site is mainly used in RUNX1b cDNA. Selective disruption of either Met-1 or Met-25 abrogates expression of the corresponding protein while facilitating the production of another protein. The RUNX1b cDNA containing 65bp natural promoter sequences mainly produces full-length RUNX1b in human cord blood cells, but disruption of Met-1 in this cDNA also induced translation from Met-25. Consistent with these data, disruption of endogenous RUNX1b around Met-1 using CRISPR/Cas9 induced selective expression of RUNX1\u0394\u039d24 in several leukemia cell lines. RUNX1\u0394N24 protein is more stable than full-length RUNX1b and retains hematopoietic activity. We also found that FLAG-tagged full-length RUNX1 showed altered activity, indicating the influence of N-terminal FLAG-tag on RUNX1 function. The alternative translation initiation of RUNX1b may participate in fine tuning RUNX1 activity.",

However, common to all currently approved broad-acting HDACIs (panHDACIs) is dose-limiting thrombocytopenia, which has prevented wider use in cancer therapy. Using CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we show that megakaryocyte (MK) cell maturation and differentiation are impaired by panHDACIs, correlating to clinical thrombocytopenia. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibitors of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), including LMK235 and tubacin at clinically relevant concentrations, do not affect MK maturation. Furthermore, we show that HDACI-induced impairment of MK differentiation is associated with reduction of protein levels of the transcription factor GATA-1, but not tubulin hyperacetylation. Finally, we report that panHDACIs trigger a rapid loss of GATA-1 protein via a proteasome-dependent pathway. Our data support the notion that specifically targeting class II HDACs in cancer treatment is a potential strategy that would offer a safer alternative than current panHDACIs.",

     "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is a highly coordinated stepwise process involving the progressive clearance of mitochondria via mitophagy. Based on the expression of several macroautophagy and mitophagy specific genes, we identified a sequential change in the transcriptional pattern during terminal erythroid differentiation. Because erythroid cells are a major source of serum sphingosine-1-phosphate, we analyzed the role of sphingolipid signaling in erythropoiesis and demonstrate that sphingosine kinase activity promotes terminal erythroid differentiation by regulating the expression of key mitophagy genes Pink1 and Bnip3l/Nix. Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) inhibition also disrupted Pink1-p62 mediated mitochondria clearance in late erythroblasts. Notably, we show that supplementing sphingosine-1-phosphate in vitro can promote erythroid differentiation. Our study clarifies the role of sphingolipid signaling in regulating mitophagy during terminal erythroid differentiation and highlights the potential utility of modulating sphingolipid signaling to facilitate the large-scale production of transfusable red blood cells.",

     "abstract": "BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are driven by JAK-STAT pathway activation, but epigenetic alterations also play an important pathophysiological role. These can be pharmacologically manipulated with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), which have proven to be clinically effective in the treatment of MPNs but exhibit dose-limiting toxicity. The treatment of primary MPN cells with vorinostat modulates the expression of genes associated with apoptosis, cell cycle, inflammation, and signaling. The induction of this transcriptional program results in decreased cellular viability, paralleled by a decrease in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vitro manipulation of ROS levels revealed that the reduction of ROS levels promoted apoptosis. When vorinostat was combined with antioxidant agents, the apoptosis of MPN cells increased in a synergistic manner. The results described here suggest a novel and promising therapeutic strategy combining HDACIs with ROS-reducing agents to treat MPNs.",

     "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been suggested as a potential source for the de novo production of blood cells for transfusion, immunotherapies, and transplantation. However, even with advanced hematopoietic differentiation methods, the primitive and myeloid-restricted waves of hematopoiesis dominate in hPSC differentiation cultures, whereas cell surface markers to distinguish these waves of hematopoiesis from lympho-myeloid hematopoiesis remain unknown. In the embryo, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) arise from hemogenic endothelium (HE) lining arteries, but not veins. This observation led to a long-standing hypothesis that arterial specification is an essential prerequisite to initiate the HSC program. It has also been established that lymphoid potential in the yolk sac and extraembryonic vasculature is mostly confined to arteries, whereas myeloid-restricted hematopoiesis is not specific to arterial vessels. Here, we review how the link between arterialization and the subsequent definitive multilineage hematopoietic program can be exploited to identify HE enriched in lymphoid progenitors and aid in in vitro approaches to enhance the production of lymphoid cells and potentially HSCs from hPSCs. We also discuss alternative models of hematopoietic specification at arterial sites and recent advances in our understanding of hematopoietic development and the production of engraftable hematopoietic cells from hPSCs.",

Although not all cells can be derived with the same efficiency, immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages can be easily produced from PSCs to enable development of new cell-based therapies. NK cells and macrophages are part of the innate immune system, the first line of defense against malignancies and infectious disease. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cells can be produced at a clinical scale suitable for translation into clinical trials. Additionally, PSCs can be genetically modified to produce hESC/iPSC-derived human NK cells with enhanced antitumor activity. These engineered NK cells can express a stabilized version of the high-affinity Fc receptor CD16, chimeric antigen receptors, or other strategies to enable more potent and targeted cellular immunotherapies. Moreover, macrophages can also be routinely and efficiently produced from hESCs and iPSCs as a tool to expand our knowledge of the basic biology of these cells. hESC- and iPSC-derived macrophages can also be employed as a novel approach for cancer immunotherapy, as well as a strategy to repair or regenerate diseased and damaged tissues and organs.",

     "abstract": "The generation of T cells from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) opens a valuable experimental window into developmental hematopoiesis and raises the possibility of a new therapeutic approach for T-cell immunotherapy. After directing PSCs through mesoderm and early hematopoietic developmental stages, commitment to the T-cell lineage has been achieved by several groups using coculture with stromal cells that express a notch ligand, recapitulating the critical signals that initiate the first stages of normal T-cell differentiation in the thymus. However, positive selection and the production of mature T cells from human PSCs have been limited to date. Nonetheless, T-lineage cells have been generated from PSCs with tumor antigen specificity either through a prearranged clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) or lentiviral-mediated expression of chimeric antigen receptors. The recent development of a 3D artificial organoid model has demonstrated that PSCs can generate mature conventional T cells that are fully functional and express a diverse TCR repertoire. Introduction of a transgenic TCR at the PSC stage allows for the production of tumor-antigen-specific, mature conventional T cells. The tools of gene editing in PSCs are ideally suited to produce off-the-shelf universal products for T-cell immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the studies that have led to this exciting moment in PSC biology and discuss translation to clinical applications.",

     "abstract": "Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare immune disorders with genetic causes. Effective treatments using hematopoietic stem cells or pharmaceutical agents have been around for decades. However, for many patients, these treatment options are ineffective, partly because the rarity of these PIDs complicates the diagnosis and therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a potential solution to these problems. The proliferative capacity of iPSCs allows for the preparation of a large, stable supply of hematopoietic cells with the same genome as the patient, allowing for new human cell models that can trace cellular abnormalities during the pathogenesis and lead to new drug discovery. PID models using patient iPSCs have been instrumental in identifying deviations in the development or function of several types of immune cells, revealing new molecular targets for experimental therapies. These models are only in their early stages and for the most part have recapitulated results from existing models using animals or primary cells. However, iPSC-based models are being used to study complex diseases of other organs, including those with multigenic causes, suggesting that advances in differentiation processes will expand iPSC-based models to complex PIDs as well.",

Importantly, in vitro maturation arrest of granulopoiesis was associated with an elevated unfolded protein response (UPR) and enhanced expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Consistent with this, we found that CD34+ cells of CN patients were highly susceptible to DNA damage and showed diminished DNA repair.

     "abstract": "Over the last decade, the possibility of reprogramming malignant cells to a pluripotent state has been achieved in several hematological malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It has been shown that it is readily possible to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from several types of primary CML cells and to generate progenitors and differentiated cells with variable efficiency. Although these experiments have brought some new insights in the understanding of CML pathophysiology, the ultimate goal of generating induced leukemic stem cells (LSCs) with long-term multilineage potential has not yet been demonstrated. Experiments under way will determine whether additional signaling events are required to induce the emergence of bona fide LSCs. However, iPSC modeling offers the unique possibility to generate pluripotent cells harboring cancer-predisposing mutations using patient-derived noncancerous cells, as has been shown in Li\u2013Fraumeni syndrome, BRCA-1 associated breast carcinomas, or RET-mutated medullary thyroid carcinomas. In these conditions, mutated iPSCs can then be used to study the mutational history that precedes the appearance of the malignant transformation and to develop novel drug-screening strategies. The ability to induce a successful differentiation program toward the tissue in which a given cancer develops or to generate tissue-specific cancer organoids in which the full oncogenic potential can be revealed remains a major challenge in the field. Similarly, in hematological malignancies, a significant hurdle remains due to the lack of adequate technology to induce the emergence of leukemic cells that resemble LSCs, which hinders our ability to study the mechanisms of therapy resistance.",

Recently, iPSCs have been utilized to model human cancer, with a specific focus on modeling conditions of malignant hematopoiesis. In addition to serving as a genetic disease model in cancer, iPSCs can also be used as a tool to address a key question in interrogating the interaction between the cancer epigenome\u2013genome.

     "abstract": "Modeling human diseases with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers unique research opportunities and is particularly attractive for hematology research. Whereas monogenic inherited blood diseases featured prominently among the first proof-of-principle studies of iPSC modeling, malignant hematologic disorders have been off to a slower start. This has been due to challenges in the derivation of iPSCs from cancer cells and the need to establish robust differentiation protocols and to standardize phenotypic assays of iPSC-derived hematopoiesis. Recent studies of iPSC modeling of myeloid malignancies exploited the clonal heterogeneity of patient samples to derive genetically matched normal controls and recapitulate the clonal evolution of the disease. Comparisons of the malignant phenotypes and molecular signatures of primary leukemic cells, derived iPSCs, and their hematopoietic progeny stress the importance of the cell-of-origin in oncogenesis and enable investigation of the interplay between cell identity and the cancer genome. Larger collections of genetically diverse iPSC lines and more readily scalable hematopoietic differentiation protocols, ideally mimicking adult bone marrow-derived hematopoiesis, would further empower applications of iPSC modeling in myeloid malignancy in the future. Nevertheless, with recent progress in this field, the stage is set for the wider adoption of this model system by the hematology community.",

     "abstract": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated peripheral blood progenitor cells (G-PBs) from either a related or unrelated donor continue to be the preferred donor source for most allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Recently, the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation has recommended marrow instead of G-PBs as an unrelated graft source due to its lower rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). However, the use of marrow is limited by both clinical considerations (slower rate of engraftment and increased donor morbidity) and logistical considerations (use of operating room resources and increased physician utilization), so this recommendation has not been widely adopted. An optimal donor source would include the rapid engraftment characteristic and the low donor morbidity associated with G-PBs and a rate of cGVHD similar to or lower than that of marrow. Recent data suggest that plerixafor mobilized PBs (P-PBs) have the rapid engraftment characteristics of G-PBs in allogeneic HCT with less cGVHD. The biologic mechanism of the lower rate of cGVHD appears to be through mobilization of regulator natural killer cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors that are associated with lower acute and chronic GVHD compared with G-PBs and rapid engraftment characterized by rapid myeloid-repopulating capacity. We suggest that, based on the experience of the two Phase II clinical trials and the unique biology of plerixafor-mobilized donor product, it should be evaluated in Phase III trials as an approach to replacing G-CSF mobilization for allogeneic HCT.",

To better understand how spliceosomal mutations contribute to MDS pathogenesis in vivo, numerous groups have sought to establish conditional murine models of SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1 mutations. The high degree of conservation of hematopoiesis between mice and human and the well-established phenotyping and genetic modification approaches make murine models an effective tool with which to study how a gene mutation contributes to disease pathogenesis.

Reasons for the differences in phenotypes reported between alleles of the same mutation are varied, but the nature of the genetic modification itself and subsequent analysis methods are important to consider.

In this study, we established a doxorubicin (ADM)-resistant THP-1 AML cell line (THP-1/ADM). A high-throughput microarray was used to identify circRNA expression profiles of THP-1/ADM cells and naive THP-1 cells. The identified potential functional circRNA molecule was further validated in THP-1/ADM cells and bone marrow (BM) specimens from 42 AML patients. The interactions with target microRNAs (miRNAs) and downstream messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were also explored. As a result, 49 circRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between THP-1/ADM and THP-1 cells were identified. Of these circRNAs, downregulation of circPAN3 by small interfering RNA significantly restored ADM sensitivity of THP-1/ADM cells. Furthermore, BM samples from patients with refractory and recurrent AML showed increased expression of circPAN3. A detailed circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction network was predicated for this circRNA. Subsequent mechanistic experiments showed that downregulation of circPAN3 could decrease the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), but this effect was counteracted by miR-153-3p or miR-183-5p specific inhibitors. Luciferase experiments further demonstrated that these molecules are involved in the circPAN3 regulatory network. Our results revealed that circPAN3 may be a key mediator for chemoresistance of AML cells, which may depend on the circPAN3\u2013miR-153-5p/miR-183-5p\u2013XIAP axis. Our findings provide evidence that circPAN3 can be a valuable indicator for predicting clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in AML patients and also can serve as a potential target for reversing drug resistance in AML.",

     "abstract": "Despite a high remission rate after therapy, only 40\u201350% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients survive 5 years after diagnosis. The main cause of treatment failure is thought to be insufficient eradication of CD34+CD38\u2212 AML cells. In order to induce preferential cell death in CD34+CD38\u2212 AML cells, two separate events may be necessary: (1) inhibition of survival signals such as nuclear factor kappa-beta (NF-\u03baB) and (2) induction of stress responses such as the oxidative stress response. Therefore, regimens that mediate both effects may be favorable. Deferasirox is a rationally designed oral iron chelator mainly used to reduce chronic iron overload in patients who receive long-term blood transfusions. Our study revealed that clinically relevant concentrations of deferasirox are cytotoxic in vitro to AML progenitor cells, but even more potent against the more primitive CD34+CD38\u2212 cell population. In addition, we found that deferasirox exerts its effect, at least in part, by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB/hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha (HIF1\u03b1) pathway and by elevating reactive oxygen species levels. We believe that, pending further characterization, deferasirox can be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for eradicating CD34+CD38\u2212 AML cells.",

Recurrent heterozygous mutations in SMC3 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies. In this study, we investigated whether the missense mutations in SMC3 might have dominant-negative effects or phenocopy loss-of-function effects by comparing the consequences of Smc3-deficient and -haploinsufficient mouse models. We found that homozygous deletion of Smc3 during embryogenesis or in adult mice led to hematopoietic failure, suggesting that SMC3 missense mutations are unlikely to be associated with simple dominant-negative phenotypes. In contrast, haploinsufficiency was tolerated during embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. Under steady-state conditions, Smc3 haploinsufficiency did not alter colony forming in methylcellulose, only modestly decreased mature myeloid cell populations, and led to limited expression changes and chromatin alteration in Lin\u2013cKit+ bone marrow cells. However, following transplantation, engraftment, and subsequent deletion, we observed a hematopoietic competitive disadvantage across myeloid and lymphoid lineages and within the stem/progenitor compartments. This disadvantage was not affected by hematopoietic stresses, but was partially abrogated by concurrent Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency, suggesting that antecedent mutations may be required to optimize the leukemogenic potential of Smc3 mutations.",

Recent efforts to develop novel strategies of HbF induction include discovery of molecular targets that regulate \u03b3-globin gene transcription and translation. The purpose of this study was to perform genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) analysis to identify genes associated with HbF expression in patients with SCD. We isolated RNA from purified reticulocytes for microarray-based miRNA expression profiling. Using samples from patients with contrasting HbF levels, we observed an eightfold upregulation of miR-144-3p (miR-144) and miR-144-5p in the low-HbF group compared with those with high HbF. Additional analysis by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed individual miR-144 expression levels of subjects in the two groups. Subsequent functional studies in normal and sickle erythroid progenitors showed NRF2 gene silencing by miR-144 and concomitant repression of \u03b3-globin transcription; by contrast, treatment with miR-144 antagomir reversed its silencing effects in a dose-dependent manner. Because NRF2 regulates reactive oxygen species levels, additional studies investigated mechanisms of HbF regulation using a hemin-induced oxidative stress model. Treatment of KU812 cells with hemin produced an increase in NRF2 expression and HbF induction that reversed with miR-144 pretreatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed NRF2 binding to the \u03b3-globin antioxidant response element, which was inhibited by miR-144 mimic treatment.

MUC1 is a polymorphic glycoprotein, the cleavage of which yields two unequal chains: a large extracellular \u03b1 subunit containing a tandem repeat array bound in a strong noncovalent interaction to a smaller \u03b2 subunit containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Because the \u03b1-chain can be released from the cell-bound domains of MUC1, agents directed against the \u03b1-chain will not effectively target MUC1+ cells. The MUC1 SEA (a highly conserved protein module so called from its initial identification in a sea urchin sperm protein, in enterokinase, and in agrin) domain formed by the binding of the \u03b1 and\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0chains\u00a0 represents a stable structure fixed to the cell surface at all times. DMB-5F3, a partially humanized murine anti-MUC1 SEA domain monoclonal antibody, was used to examine MUC1 expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and was found to bind acute myelomonocytic and monocytic leukemia (AML-M4 and AML-M5) cell lines. We also examined monocytic neoplasms freshly obtained from patients including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, which were found to uniformly express MUC1.

Based on these studies, we generated an anti-MUC1 immunotoxin to directly gauge the cytotoxic efficacy of targeting AML-bound MUC1. Using single-chain DMB-5F3 fused to recombinant gelonin toxin, the degree of AML cytotoxicity was found to correlate with MUC1 expression.

In the present study, 37 cell lines were established from human bone marrow cells from a single donor. The time required for the establishment of each cell line varied greatly from 46 to 246 days. Of these lines, five were selected and their characteristics were analyzed. The cell lines established at the earliest time point showed better results in terms of both karyotype and differentiation potential than those established the latest. Moreover, obvious differences were noted even when cell lines were established at the earliest time point from the same source. These results suggest that it is important to select the best cell lines from ones established at the earliest time point for generating cell lines with low genomic abnormality and high differentiation ability.

Overexpression of TCF4 (TCF4OE) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells resulted in a twofold increase in erythroid colony forming units (CFU-Es), whereas knock-down (KD) of TCF4 (TCF4KD) caused a dramatic decrease in the number of erythroid colonies. In megakaryocyte CFUs (CFU-MKs), both TCF4KD and TCF4OE inhibited MK colony formation. TCF4 did not have an impact on granulocyte, macrophage, or granulocyte\u2013macrophage colonies or on the proportion of MK\u2013erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) in culture. Because TCF4 affects erythroid/MK development and these lineages are affected in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we studied the impact of TCF4 expression in this disease. MDS patients with high (\u2265median) TCF4 mRNA expression had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels than MDS patients with low TCF4 expression (mean 9.0 vs. 8.55 g/dL, p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Overall, TCF4 mRNA expression was lower in hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, and MEPs from MDS patients, but not in granulocyte\u2013macrophage progenitors, compared with healthy controls. Therefore, in cell fractions with erythroid lineage potential, TCF4 is expressed less in MDS patients than in healthy controls. This correlates with the low overall Hb levels seen in MDS patients compared with healthy individuals and is consistent with the positive impact of TCF4 on erythroid development while not having impact on white colonies. These results indicate a role for TCF4 as a novel factor in erythroid\u2013megakaryocytic differentiation.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether circadian variations of neutrophil counts would result in neutrophil values higher than neutropenia threshold in individuals with BCN. Absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) were evaluated in 102 patients with BCN (<1500 cells/\u03bcL) and 60 age- and sex-matched controls. Paired blood counts were performed in the early morning and in the early afternoon. We observed a significant difference between morning and afternoon ANC in BCN patients (879 cells/\u03bcL, 95% CI 745\u20131028, p < 0.001), as well as in the controls (619 cells/\u03bcL, 95% CI 443\u2013796, p < 0.001). The ANC increase between the two evaluations was significantly greater in BCN patients compared with controls: 83% and 27%, respectively (p < 0.001). The ANC increment was higher in the groups with a lower morning ANC: 105%, 63%, and 27% in the <1000, 1000\u20131500, and >1500 cells/\u03bcL groups, respectively (p < 0.001).

In conclusion, neutrophil circadian variation measurement allows many BCN patients to be excluded from the neutropenia threshold.

Compounds that disrupt the interaction between menin, a chromatin-binding protein, and oncogenic mixed lineage leukemia fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) have shown significant promise in preclinical models of leukemia and have a high degree of selectivity for leukemia versus normal hematopoietic cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that, in addition to disrupting the menin\u2013MLL-FP interaction, such compounds also inhibit menin\u2013MLL1, menin\u2013MLL2, and other menin-interacting proteins. Here, we address the degree to which disruption of menin\u2013MLL-FP interactions or menin\u2013MLL1/MLL2 interactions contribute to the antileukemia effect of menin inhibition. We show that Men1 deletion in MLL-AF9-transformed leukemia cells produces distinct cellular and molecular consequences compared with Mll1;Mll2 co-deletion and that compounds disrupting menin\u2013MLL N-terminal interactions largely phenocopy menin loss. Moreover, we show that Mll1;Mll2-deficient leukemia cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to menin interaction inhibitors, which is consistent with each regulating complementary genetic pathways. These data illustrate the heightened dependency of MLL-FPs on menin compared with wild-type MLL1/MLL2 for regulation of downstream target genes and argue that the predominant action of menin inhibitory compounds is through direct inhibition of MLL-FPs without significant contribution from MLL1/MLL2 inhibition.",

Mice with conditional deletion of EfnB1 in the osteogenic lineage (EfnB1OB\u2013/\u2013), driven by the Osterix promoter, exhibited a reduced prevalence of osteogenic progenitors and osteoblasts, correlating to lower numbers of HSPCs compared with Osx:Cre mice.

Human studies confirmed that activation of EPHB2 on CD34+ HSPCs via EFNB1-Fc stimulation enhanced myeloid/erythroid colony formation, whereas functional blocking of either EPHB1 or EPHB2 inhibited the maintenance of LTC-ICs. Moreover, EFNB1 reverse signaling in human and mouse stromal cells was found to be required for the activation of the HSPC-promoting factor CXCL12.

IL-18 protein levels were significantly elevated in sera of severe AA (SAA) patients, including both responders and nonresponders assayed before treatment, and decreased after treatment.

In a feasibility study, consecutive daily peripheral blood samples from day 7 to day 20 after transplantation were analyzed by ddPCR in 22 patients after allogeneic transplantation. Platelet engraftment according to ddPCR was defined as the third of at least 3 consecutive days of increasing levels exceeding 1000/\u00b5L endogenous platelets. Platelet counts were also assessed according to the engraftment cri`teria of the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).

In five patients, engraftment was detectable according to ddPCR and EBMT, whereas in three patients, platelet engraftment within 20 days was only confirmed by ddPCR. The detailed findings suggest that the day of platelet engraftment according to the EBMT criteria closely reflected the ddPCR detection of transplantation-derived platelets.

Therefore, mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8mt) must be considered in these measurements because a high \u0394\u03a8mt due to respiratory chain activity can enhance dye intake, leading to the overestimation of mitochondrial volume.

The aim of the present study was to identify new serum and plasma protein markers for diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia (AA) and response to immunosuppressive therapies (IST). SOMAscan was used to screen 1,141 serum proteins in 28 AA patients before and after therapy and 1,317 plasma proteins in seven SAA patients treated with standard IST and a thrombopoietin receptor agonist. From our analysis, 19 serum and 28 plasma proteins were identified as possible candidate diagnostic and prognostic markers. A custom immunobead-based multiplex assay with five selected serum proteins (BMP-10, CCL17, DKK1, HGF, and SELL) was used for validation in a verification set (n\u202f=\u202f65) of samples obtained before and after IST and in a blinded validation cohort at baseline (n\u202f=\u202f16). After technical validation, four biomarkers were employed to predict diagnosis (accuracy, 88%) and long-term response to IST (accuracy, 79%). In conclusion, SOMAscan is a powerful tool for the identification of new biomarkers. We propose further larger studies to validate new candidate serum and plasma diagnostic and prognostic markers of AA.",

The hematopoietic system includes dozens of distinct, transcriptionally coherent cell types, including intermediate transitional populations that have not been previously described at a molecular level. Using the first data release from the HCA bone marrow tissue project, we resolved common, rare, and potentially transitional cell populations from over 100,000 hematopoietic cells spanning 35 transcriptionally coherent groups across eight healthy donors using emerging new computational approaches. These data highlight novel mixed-lineage progenitor populations and putative trajectories governing granulocytic, monocytic, lymphoid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and eosinophil specification. Our analyses suggest significant variation in cell-type composition and gene expression among donors, including biological processes affected by donor age. To enable broad exploration of these findings, we provide an interactive website to probe intra-cell and extra-cell population differences within and between donors and reference markers for cellular classification and cellular trajectories through associated progenitor states.",

Driver mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), are generally considered mutually exclusive, but several reports have suggested that they coexist in a small subgroup of patients. In this study, we retrospectively searched for CALR mutations in 136 suspected MPN patients with low allelic burden (\u22645%) JAK2 V617F. Fifteen patients with concomitant JAK2 V617F and CALR mutations were identified, of whom 10 were diagnosed with essential thrombocytosis (ET). More than 50 different indel mutations in exon 9 of CALR have been reported, with type 1 (52 bp deletion) and type 2 (5 bp insertion) accounting for more than 80% of CALR-mutated MPN cases. Type 1 is generally considered the most common mutation, but, interestingly, our double-mutated ET patients seem to have an inversed ratio between type 1 and type 2 CALR mutations. Our findings support the possibility of coexisting JAK2 V617F and CALR mutations and stress the importance of further molecular screening in MPN patients with low allele frequencies of JAK2 V617F.",

     "abstract": "The selection of chemotherapy regimen for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging. Here, we report that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) upregulates the expression of microRNA (miR)-146a in a nuclear factor kappaB-dependent manner, leading to direct decreases in the expression of the target proteins CXCR4 and Smad4 in AML cells in vitro. The reduction in CXCR4 expression suppressed the migration abilities of leukemia cells. Downregulation of Smad4 promoted cell cycle entry in leukemia cells. Furthermore, an increase in apoptosis was observed when leukemia cells were treated sequentially with G-CSF and cytosine arabinoside in vitro. These findings suggest that G-CSF treatment may disrupt the protection of bone marrow niches from leukemia cells. In a review of data from 78 cases of primary AML, we found that a high miR-146a expression and/or upregulation of this miRNA during G-CSF priming chemotherapy was predictive of better clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that miR-146a may be a novel biomarker for evaluating the clinical prognosis and treatment effects of a G-CSF priming protocol in elderly patients with AML.",

     "abstract": "BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms had been thought to mediate drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The pro-oncogenic anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) mediates drug resistance of cancer cells. In this study, we observed an increased level of AGR2 in TKI-resistant CML cells. Silence of AGR2 in dasatinib-resistant K562 (K562DR) cells led to restored sensitivity to dasatinib both in vitro and in vivo. Exposure to dasatinib induced upregulation of AGR2 in K562 cells, which indicated a probable treatment-related drug resistance. We further investigated the potential interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and AGR2 in K562DR cells and found that downregulation of miR-217 was associated with overexpression of AGR2 in K562DR cells. Luciferase reporter assay identified that miR-217 negatively regulated expression of AGR2 through binding the 3\u2032-untranslated region of AGR2. Hypermethylation of the CpG island on the promoter region of the MIR217 gene is a probable reason for the downregulation of miR-217 in dasatinib-treated K562 cells. Forced expression of miR-217 led to decreased expression of AGR2 as well as compromised TKI-resistant potential of K562DR cells. Similarly, overexpression of miR-217 resensitized K562DR cells to dasatinib treatment in a murine xenograft transplantation model. TKI treatment-induced drug resistance is correlated with a decrease of miR-217 and upregulation of AGR2. The miR-217/AGR2 interaction might be a potential therapeutic target in treating CML patients with TKI resistance.",

Although each cell population within the hematopoietic hierarchy can be described by phenotypic markers, isolation of marker pure populations does not necessarily result in cells with homogeneous functionality. However, techniques that enable the efficient characterization of cell behavior with high resolution are limited. Although single-cell transplantation assays demand high mouse numbers and workload, sequencing-based fate tracking techniques require the destruction of the host cell, substantial financial resources, and bioinformatics expertise and suffer from a delay between sample acquisition and data interpretation. To make analyses more efficient, several laboratories recently developed flow cytometry-driven, fluorescence-based multiplexing approaches that enable parallel analysis of longitudinal behavior from multiple clonally derived cells or polyclonal populations. Although these fluorescent genetic barcoding systems are still in their infancy, their power lies in the use of retroviral vectors for gene marking of multiple populations with unique fluorescent color codes. Tracing of color-coded cells by flow cytometry guarantees the accessibility of information on population behavior in real time and at low cost, supports the prospective isolation of cells for downstream analyses, and can be applied to cell line models as well as to human- and animal-derived primary cells. Here, we discuss recent progress in the emerging field of fluorescent genetic barcoding for longitudinal multiplex cell tracking in biomedical research and how this technique will help to uncover mechanisms regulating cell behavior with clonal resolution in a reduced number of experimental samples.",

The most popular mouse strains used in research, the NOG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid\u00a0Il2r\u03b3tm1Sug/Jic) and the NSG (NOD/SCID-IL2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212, NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2r\u03b3tm1Wjl/SzJ) mouse, and their human-cytokine-producing (interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and stem cell factor) counterparts (huNOG and NSGS), rely partly on a mutation in the DNA repair protein PRKDC, causing a severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) phenotype and rendering the mice less tolerant to DNA-damaging therapeutics, thereby limiting their usefulness in the investigation of novel acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapeutics. NRG (NOD/RAG1/2\u2212/\u2212IL2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212) mice show equivalent immune ablation through a defective recombination activation gene (RAG), leaving DNA damage repair intact, and human-cytokine-producing NRGS (NRG-SGM3) mice were generated, improving myeloid engraftment. Our findings indicate that unconditioned NRG and NRGS mice can harbor established AML CDXs and can tolerate aggressive induction chemotherapy at higher doses than NSG mice without overt toxicity. However, unconditioned NRGS mice developed less clinically relevant disease, with CDXs forming solid tumors throughout the body, whereas unconditioned NRG mice were incapable of efficiently supporting PDX or human hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. These findings emphasize the contextually dependent utility of each of these powerful new strains in the study of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis. Therefore, the choice of mouse strain cannot be random, but must be based on the experimental outcomes and questions to be addressed.",

Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is abundantly expressed and plays oncogenic roles in solid cancer and AML. However, whether HOTAIR regulates the self-renewal of LSC is largely unknown. Here, we reported that the expression of HOTAIR was increased in LSC than in normal hematological stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). HOTAIR inhibition by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) decreased colony formation in leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. We then investigated the role of HOTAIR in leukemia in vivo. HOTAIR knockdown extends the survival time in U937-transplanted NSG mice. Furthermore, HOTAIR knockdown reduced infiltration of leukemic blasts, decreased frequency of LSC, and prolonged overall survival in MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia, suggesting that HOTAIR is required for the maintenance of AML. Mechanistically, HOTAIR inhibited p15 expression through zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-enrolled tri-methylation of Lys 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in p15 promoter. In addition, p15 partially reversed the decrease of colony and proliferation induced by HOTAIR knockdown, suggesting that p15 plays an important role in the leukemogenesis by HOTAIR. In conclusion, our study suggests that HOTAIR facilitates leukemogenesis by enhancing self-renewal of LSC. HOTAIR might be a potential target for anti-LSC therapy.",

With a median follow-up of 26.5 months since ponatinib initiation, the overall survival (OS) rates (80.5% at 3 years) and cumulative incidence of major molecular response (81.8% at 18 months) were similar to those of the phase II study, with no influence of BCR-ABL mutations nor the reason of ponatinib prescription. A specific subanalysis of the preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and events occurring on ponatinib is described. These events occurred after a median time on ponatinib of 5.8 months (excluding hypertension) and were observed in 29/48 patients (47%), even in those already on anti-aggregants/coagulants. The majority were not severe and resolved, but two cases were fatal. Other hematological or nonhematological nonvascular adverse events were similar to those previously described in trials.

We hypothesized that combining these two drugs with an epigenetic modifier would increase antileukemic efficacy without jeopardizing patient safety. A preclinical study was performed to determine the synergistic cytotoxicity of Bu, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and the hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Exposure of KBM3/Bu2506 (P53-null) and OCI-AML3 (P53-wild-type) cells to Bu+4HC inhibited cell proliferation by \u223c35\u201339%; addition of DAC increased the inhibition to \u223c60\u201362%. The observed synergistic interactions correlated with DNA damage response activation, increased the production of reactive oxygen species, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm, and induction of caspase-dependent programmed cell death. The Bu+4HC+DAC combination further caused chromatin trapping of DNMT1 with a concomitant increase in DNA damage. In contrast, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML cell lines were not sensitized to Bu+4HC by inclusion of DAC; addition of the FLT3 kinase inhibitor sorafenib sensitized the FLT3-ITD-positive MV4-11 and MOLM13 cell lines to the triple drug combination by inhibiting the FLT3 signal transduction pathway. Our results therefore provide a rationale for the development of personalized conditioning therapy for patients with P53-mutated and FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

More effective strategies to increase HbF are needed because the current standard of care, hydroxyurea, is not effective in a significant proportion of patients. Treatment of the millions of patients projected worldwide would best be accomplished with an orally administered drug therapy that increased HbF. LSD1 is a component of corepressor complexes that repress \u03b3-globin gene expression and are a therapeutic target for HbF reactivation. We have shown that subcutaneous administration of RN-1, a pharmacological LSD1 inhibitor, increased \u03b3-globin expression in SCD mice and baboons, which are widely acknowledged as the best animal model in which to test the activity of HbF-inducing drugs. The objective of this investigation was to test the effect of oral administration of a new LSD1 inhibitor, ORY-3001. Oral administration of ORY-3001 to SCD mice (n\u202f=\u202f3 groups) increased \u03b3-globin expression, Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF)-containing (F) cells, and F reticulocytes (retics).

     "abstract": "The relationship between the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population and its surrounding bone marrow microenvironment is a rapidly evolving area of research. Normal HSC processes rely heavily on a complex communication network involving various marrow niches. Although leukemogenesis largely results from abnormal genetic activity within the leukemia stem cell itself, mounting evidence indicates a significant contributory role played by marrow niche dysregulation. Furthermore, numerous instances of activating or inactivating germline mutations within marrow microenvironment cells have been shown to be sufficient for development of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, and acute myeloid leukemia, even in the context of wild-type HSCs. Recent evidence suggests that targeting aberrant chemokine production from germline-mutated marrow stromal cells can potentially reverse the process of leukemogenesis. This elaborate interplay between the HSC population and the marrow microenvironment allows for a number of unique clinical possibilities in efforts to induce remission, enhance chemosensitivity, manage relapsed disease, and prevent leukemia development, both in de novo and germline mutation-associated leukemias, including the use of targeted cytokine/chemokine inhibitors, immune checkpoint blockade, CXCR4/CXCL12 axis antagonists, and combined allogeneic HSC and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. In this review, we discuss the pathways underlying normal and abnormal bone marrow niche functioning, the relationship between germline mutations in the stem cell microenvironment and dysregulated hematopoiesis, and future clinical perspectives that may be particularly applicable to prevention and treatment of germline-associated leukemias.",

Here, we employed multiple genetic diagnostic tools (DNA sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and chromosome microarray) and a variant-based functional assay platform to investigate the genetic cause in 25 Chinese suspected FA patients. A total of 45 distinct candidate variants were detected in six FA genes (FA-A, FA-B, FA-C, FA-D2, FA-G, and FA-J), of which 36 were novel. Eight missense variants and one indel variant were unable to restore FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination and mitomycin C resistance in a panel of FA indicator cell lines, indicating that these mutations are deleterious. Three missense variants (FANCA-L424V, FANCC-E273K, and FANCG-A153G) were harmless. Finally, 23 patients were molecularly diagnosed with FA, consistent with their clinical phenotype. In the FA-A subgroup, large deletions accounted for 14% of the disease-causing variants.

Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is involved in tumor progression and angiogenesis. We have previously reported that PAR1 expression is elevated in human leukemias that display a more aggressive clinical behavior, including the blast crisis of CML. In this study, we analyzed the crosstalk between the oncoprotein BCR-ABL and PAR1 in CML. Leukemic cell lines transfected with the BCR-ABL1 oncogene showed significantly higher expression levels of PAR1 compared with that of wild-type counterparts. This phenomenon was reversed by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Conversely, treatment with the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 inhibited BCR-ABL expression. The PAR1 antagonist induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were observed in cells transfected with BCR-ABL1 than in their wild-type counterparts. VEGF expression was strongly inhibited after treatment with either TKIs or the PAR1 antagonist. Finally, we evaluated PAR1 expression in CML patients who were either in the blast or chronic phases and had either received TKI treatment or no treatment. A significant decrease in PAR1 expression was observed in treatment-responsive patients, as opposed to a significant increase in PAR1 expression levels in treatment-resistant patients. Patients classified as high risk according to the Sokal index showed higher PAR1 expression levels. Our results demonstrate the crosstalk between BCR-ABL and PAR1. These data may offer important insight into the development of new therapeutic strategies for CML.",

     "abstract": "TRIBBLES pseudokinases (TRIB1, TRIB2, and TRIB3) are important regulators of normal and malignant hemopoiesis. The relative abundance of each TRIBBLES family member may be important for distinct oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions. We map the expression profiles of TRIB1, TRIB2, and TRIB3 in human and murine hemopoietic stem, progenitor and mature cells, and in human leukemia datasets. Our data show that TRIB1-TRIB2 have an inverse expression relationship in normal hemopoiesis, whereas TRIB1-TRIB3 have a positive correlation. We reveal that TRIB3 expression is high in the dormant hemopoietic stem cell (HSC) population, implicating a novel role for TRIB3 in stem cell quiescence. These analyses support a non-redundant role for each TRIBBLES member during normal hemopoietic differentiation. We show that TRIB1-TRIB2 display a significant negative correlation in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes, but not in acute lymphoid leukemia. This inverse relationship is specific to certain subtypes of AML. A positive correlation exists in different leukemia subtypes between TRIB1-TRIB3. The TRIB1-TRIB2 and TRIB1-TRIB3 correlations are consistent with a correlative relationship with C/EBP transcription factor family members. Our results have implications for the development of strategies to therapeutically target these genes in different types of leukemia.",

Fortunately, these restrictions have been overcome by technological advancements allowing us to track both genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, or \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d from a blood sample, provides the opportunity to track the genetic landscape of cancerous lesions. This review focuses on ctDNA analysis as a noninvasive method and versatile biomarker for cancer treatment and technological advancements for ctDNA analysis. This method may able to cope with all the challenges associated with previous cancer therapies and has the potential to monitor minimal residual disease, tumor burden, and therapy response and provide rapid detection of relapse. However, there are many challenges that still need to be addressed. Future prognosis, diagnosis, and analysis of ctDNA require reproducibility and accuracy of results, which are not possible without the validation and optimization of procedures. Integrated digital error suppression has thus far shown promise in the detection of ctDNA in cancer.",

Currently, it is not clear whether, during human pluripotent stem cells hematopoietic differentiation in vitro, the maturation of definitive progenitors proceeds through a primitive progenitor (hemangioblast) intermediate or if it develops independently. The objective of this study was to investigate the early stages of hematopoietic specification of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. By implementing an adherent culture, serum-free differentiation system that utilizes a small molecule, CHIR99021, to induce human pluripotent stem cells toward various hematopoietic lineages, we established that, compared with the OP9 coculture hematopoietic induction system, the application of CHIR99021 alters the early steps of hematopoiesis such as hemangioblasts, angiogenic hematopoietic progenitors, and hemogenic endothelium. Importantly, it is associated with the loss of hemangioblast progenitors, loss of CD43+ (primitive hematopoietic marker) expression, and predominant development of blast-forming unit erythroid colonies in semisolid medium. These data support the hypothesis that the divergence of primitive and definitive programs during human pluripotent stem cells differentiation precedes the hemangioblast stage. Furthermore, we have shown that the inhibition of primitive hematopoiesis is associated with an increase in hematopoietic potential, which is a fruitful finding due to the growing need for lymphoid and myeloid cells in translational applications.",

High-throughput transcriptomic and bioinformatics analysis were performed to analyze gene expression modulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 21 patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies (lymphoma or multiple myeloma).

The presence of ring sideroblasts in a patient's bone marrow is the hallmark of sideroblastic anemia, but the precise mechanisms underlying sideroblast formation are largely unknown. Using a genome-editing system, a mutation was introduced in the erythroid-specific enhancer of the ALAS2 gene in HUDEP2 cells, which were derived from human umbilical stem cells and can produce erythrocytes. The established cell line, termed HA2low, expressed less ALAS2 mRNA than did wild-type cells, even after erythroid differentiation. Although the mRNA expression of \u03b1-globin, \u03b2-globin, and the mitochondrial iron importer mitoferrin-1 was induced similarly in wild-type and HA2low cells, hemoglobinization of differentiated cells was limited in HA2low cells compared with wild-type cells. Importantly, Prussian blue staining revealed that approximately one-third of differentiated HA2low cells exhibited intracellular iron deposition and these cells looked like ring sideroblasts. Electron microscopy confirmed that the mitochondria in HA2low cells contained high-density deposits that might contain iron. Ring sideroblastic cells appeared among HA2low cells only after differentiation, whereas the induced expression of mitochondrial ferritin was observed in both cell types during differentiation. These results suggest that the induction of mitochondrial ferritin expression might be essential for, but not the primary cause of, ring sideroblast formation. Our results also suggest that the insufficient supply of protoporphyrin IX due to ALAS2 deficiency in combination with increased iron import into mitochondria during erythroid differentiation results in the formation of ring sideroblasts.

Hematopoietic stem cell divisions result in either self-renewal or differentiation, with the balance between the two affecting hematopoietic homeostasis directly; however, the heterogeneity of available hematopoietic stem cell-enriched fractions, together with the technical challenges of observing hematopoietic stem cell behavior, has long hindered the analysis of individual hematopoietic stem cells and prevented the elucidation of this process. Recent advances in genetic models, metabolomics analyses, and single-cell approaches have revealed the contributions made to hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal by metabolic cues, mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy/mitophagy, which have highlighted mitochondrial quality control as a key factor in the equilibrium of hematopoietic stem cells. A deeper understanding of precisely how specific modes of metabolism control hematopoietic stem cells fate at the single-cell level is therefore not only of great biological interest, but will also have clear clinical implications for the development of therapies for hematological diseases.",

Many of these patients have a shortened life expectancy and suffer from severe morbidity despite supportive therapies, which impose an enormous financial burden to societies. The only available curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although most patients do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor, and those who do still risk life-threatening complications. Therefore, gene therapy by one-time ex vivo modification of hematopoietic stem cells followed by autologous engraftment is an attractive new therapeutic modality. The first proof-of-principle of conversion to transfusion independence by means of a lentiviral vector expressing a marked and anti-sickling \u03b2T87Q-globin gene variant was reported a decade ago in a patient with transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia.

In nine patients with \u03b20/\u03b20 transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia or equivalent severity (\u03b2IVS1-110), median annualized transfusion volume decreased by 73% and red blood cell transfusions were stopped in three patients.

Through interactions with the nuclear 5\u2032-7-methylguanosine cap-binding complex, Ars2 promotes cotranscriptional processing coupled with nuclear export or degradation of several classes of RNAPII transcripts, allowing for gene expression programs that facilitate rapid and sustained proliferation of immortalized cells in culture. However, rapidly dividing cells in culture do not represent the physiological condition of the vast majority of cells in an adult mammal. To examine functions of Ars2 in a physiological setting, we generated inducible Ars2 knockout mice and found that deletion of Ars2 from adult mice resulted in defective hematopoiesis in bone marrow and thymus. Importantly, only some of this defect could be explained by the requirement of Ars2 for rapid proliferation, which we found to be cell-type specific in vivo. Rather, Ars2 was required for survival of developing thymocytes and for limiting differentiation of bone marrow resident long-term hematopoietic stem cells. As a result, Ars2 knockout led to rapid thymic involution and loss of the ability of mice to regenerate peripheral blood after myeloablation. These in vivo data demonstrate that Ars2 expression is important at several steps of hematopoiesis, likely because Ars2 acts on gene expression programs underlying essential cell fate decisions such as the decision to die,proliferate, or differentiate.",

These data have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may affect the HSC niche, leading to changes in HSC retention and trafficking. We studied the effect of MSC administration on the HSC compartment in the bone marrow (BM) in mice. After injection of MSCs, HSC numbers in the BM were decreased coinciding with an increased cell cycle activity compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-injected controls. Furthermore, the frequency of macrophages was significantly reduced and niche factors including Cxcl12, Scf, and Vcam were downregulated in endosteal cells. These BM changes are reminiscent of events associated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization. Interestingly, coadministration of MSCs and G-CSF resulted in a twofold increase in peripheral blood HSPC release compared with injection of G-CSF alone, whereas injection of MSCs alone did not induce HSPC mobilization. After intravenous administration, MSCs were only observed in the lungs, suggesting that they exert their effect on the HSC niche through a soluble mediator. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are responsible for the observed changes in the HSC niche. Indeed, administration of EVs resulted in downregulation of Cxcl12, Scf, and Vcam and enhanced G-CSF-induced HSPC mobilization at similar levels as MSCs and G-CSF. Together, these data indicate that MSCs induce a permissive state in the BM, enhancing HSPC mobilization through the release of EVs.",

The natural history of this disease has been radically modified by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, resistance to several lines of TKI therapies and progression to blast crisis (BC) remain significant concerns. To identify novel signaling pathways induced by BCR-ABL, we performed a transcriptome analysis in a BCR-ABL-expressing UT-7 cell line. More than 2000 genes differentially expressed between BCR-ABL-expressing and parental UT-7 cells were identified and ETS1 was found to be the most upregulated. ETS1 protein expression was also shown to be highly increased in UT-7 cells expressing BCR-ABL either constitutively or under the control of TET-inducible promoters. ETS1 expression is tyrosine-kinase dependent because it was reduced by TKIs. A significant increase of ETS1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was observed in blood cells from CML patients at diagnosis compared with healthy controls. Integration of publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and transcriptomic data with our results allowed us to identify potential ETS1 targets, some of which are involved in the progression of CML. The messenger RNA expression of two of these genes (DNM3 and LIMS1) was found to be associated with the absence of major cytogenetic response after 1 year of imatinib therapy. The present work demonstrates for the first time the involvement of the ETS1 transcriptional program in the experimental UT-7 model and a large cohort of CML patients.",

Univariate analysis failed to detect any impact on survival of molecular response at 3 and 6 months. Sokal score had a significant impact on OS and PFS in a Cox model.

     "abstract": "Increased chemokine C-X-C receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression is related to unfavorable outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neuronal growth factor that has been shown previously to interact with CXCR4 in neuronal cells. Here, we studied the in vitro effect of BDNF on CXCR4 expression and chemotaxis toward stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in freshly isolated CLL cells. We also explored the correlations between serum BDNF levels in CLL patients and disease characteristics and clinical course. Incubation of CLL cells with recombinant BDNF (50 ng/mL) resulted in a downregulation of CXCR4 surface expression and atenuated chemotaxis toward SDF-1. Higher serum BDNF levels were associated with a mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene, an early clinical stage, and a stable clinical course. Our findings suggest that increased circulating blood BDNF may be associated with a favorable effect in CLL. However, the exact mechanism of this favorable effect should be investigated further.",

Therefore, we have investigated 15 cell surface markers that are relevant to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) on matched fresh and thawed samples to determine the effect of cryopreservation on their detection. We found that the number of CLL cells positive for the markers CD22, CD40, CD49d, CD54, CD69, and CXCR3 was decreased significantly after cryopreservation.

In this study, we used a combination of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to identify microRNAs (miRs) involved in EKLF regulation and to validate the role of miR-326 in HbF modification. We found that miR-326 suppresses EKLF expression directly by targeting its 3' untranslated region. miR-326 overexpression in K562 cells or CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in reduced EKLF protein levels and was associated with elevated expression of \u03b3-globin, whereas inhibition of physiological miR-326 levels increased EKLF and thus reduced \u03b3-globin expression. Moreover, miR-326 expression is positively correlated with HbF levels in \u03b2-thalassemia patients. Our results suggest that miR-326 plays a key role in regulating EKLF expression and in modifying the HbF level, which may provide a new strategy for activating HbF in individuals with \u03b2-thalassemia or sickle cell disease.",

These insults deplete, cause a functional decline in, and promote HSC aging and transformation. However, the impact of hematopoietic insults on niche cells remains largely unknown. We have reported previously that p53 is activated in blood vessels by various stresses, including hypoxia, inflammation, and aging, and contributes to tissue dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities. We hypothesized that hematopoietic insults also affect the bone marrow (BM) vascular niche. Here, we demonstrate that p53 becomes activated in BM endothelial cells upon hematopoietic stresses such as irradiation and chemotherapeutic treatments. The conditional activation of p53 in VE-cadherin+ vascular niche cells by deleting Mdm2 induces the expression of p53 target genes specifically in vascular endothelial cells, resulting in the dilation and collapse of vascular endothelial cells and reductions in perivascular mesenchymal stromal cell numbers. Consequently, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) fail to maintain dormancy, mobilize to the periphery, and are depleted significantly. Our results indicate that various hematopoietic insults affect HSCs, not only directly, but also indirectly by altering vascular integrity, which is critical for perivascular niche formation and maintenance of HSCs.",

This AG1024\u202f+\u202fU0126 combination also significantly potentiates the ability of the core chemotherapy compounds vincristine, dexamethasone, and daunorubicin to kill ALL cells in vitro. Evidence of the synergistic action of AG1024\u202f+\u202fU0126 in samples with variable basal levels of phosphorylated IGF1/R\u03b2 and ERK1/2 suggested additional targets of this drug combination. Consistent with this, gene expression profiling identified 32 \u201csynergy genes\u201d differentially targeted by IGF1/R\u202f+\u202fMEK inhibition and, among these, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and platelet-derived growth factor-associated protein 1 (PDAP1) were the most differentially downregulated cluster. Pearson correlation analysesrevealed that STAT6 and PDAP1 display significant expression codependency and a common expression pattern linked with other key \u201csynergy\u201d genes, supporting their predicted role in an STAT6\u2013ERK\u2013nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) network. Knockdown studies revealed that loss of STAT6, but not PDAP1, impinges on the cell cycle, causing reduced numbers of viable cells. In combination with daunorubicin, STAT6 loss has an additive effect on cell killing, whereas PDAP1 loss is synergistic, indicating an important role of PDAP1 in the cellular response to this anthracycline. Inhibition of STAT6 or PDAP1 may therefore represent a potential novel therapeutic strategy for resistant ALL by enhancing sensitivity to chemotherapy.",

Acute leukemia is the most common form of pediatric cancer, with AML accounting for ~20% of all leukemias in children. The genomic aberrations that drive AML inhibit myeloid differentiation and activate signal transduction pathways that drive proliferation. MicroRNAs, a class of small (~22 nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally suppress the expression of specifically targeted transcripts, are also frequently dysregulated in AML, which may prove useful for the purposes of disease classification, prognosis, and future therapeutic approaches. MicroRNA expression profiles are associated with patient prognosis and responses to standard chemotherapy, including predicting therapy resistance in AML. miR-155 is the primary focus of this review because it has been repeatedly associated with poorer survival across multiple cohorts of adult and pediatric AML. We discuss some novel features of miR-155 expression in AML, in particular how the levels of expression can critically influence function. Understanding the role of microRNAs in AML and the ways in which microRNA expression influences AML biology is one means to develop novel and more targeted therapies.",

Infusion of PD-1-deficient (PD-1 knockout [KO]) lymph node (LN) cells into minor-antigen mismatched mice resulted in early mortality, as well as more severe bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia, anemia, and BM microarchitecture disruption in PD-1 KO LN-infused mice relative to mice that received B6 LN cell infusion. Mice that received PD-1 KO LN cells had more CD8+ T-cell infiltration of the BM and greater expansion of H60-specific CD8+ T cells than did their B6 LN-infused counterparts. In the spleen, CD8+ T cells were skewed to an effector memory phenotype, suggesting accelerated differentiation of PD-1 KO T cells.

We compared outcomes of AL patients treated for relapse with DLI or second Allo-HCT after receiving debulking therapy. In total, 46 patients were included in the study; 30 (65%) had acute myeloid leukemia and 16 (35%) had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The median age was 38 years (range 4\u201366). Twenty-seven patients received a second Allo-HCT and 19 patients received DLI. The median follow-up of the cohort was 273 days (range 9\u20137013).

Expression of TEs is known to activate the double-stranded RNA recognition pathway (\u201cviral mimicry\u201d), leading to the activation of interferon-stimulated genes, inflammation, and immune-mediated cell death. Recently, we showed that the expression of TEs is suppressed along with immune pathways in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting a potential mechanism for immune escape of LSCs. This indicated that, during oncogenesis, where there is escape from senescence, expression of TEs is suppressed. Senescence is known to activate the interferon response and inflammatory cytokines, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We characterized the transcriptome of senescent and active human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo and showed co-occurrence of overexpression of TEs, SASP genes, and gene pathways of inflammation in senescence. The percentage of circulating senescent HSPCs (s-HSPCs) did not increase with age, indicating active clearance. Induction of senescence in human HSPCs in vitro showed increased expression of TE and SASP genes. SASP is known to mediate clearance of senescent cells and active clearance of senescent cells has been shown to increase organismal fitness. We speculate that the expression of TEs in s-HSPCs could contribute to orderly clearance of the cells via activation of immune pathways, warranting further mechanistic studies. This is the first study to characterize the transcriptome of human s-HSPCs in vivo, revealing activated expression of TEs and inflammatory genes.",

Herein, gene expression analysis identified a significant loss of the SWI/SNF core component SMARCC1, along with ARID1B, ACTL6A, and SMARCD1, in human AA BM CD34+ HSCs and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) compared with normal HSPCs. However, expression of SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SMARCD3, and DPF2 remained intact in our AA cohort. PBRM1, BRD7, and SMARCA2 expression were significantly upregulated in both untreated and follow-up AA patients. Clonal hematopoiesis in AA is associated with evolution to late clonal disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Apart from SMARCD1 loss, we did not observe significant alteration of SWI/SNF expression in MDS HSPCs, indicating SWI/SNF differential expression in AA and MDS. In addition, except for ACTL6A, SWI/SNF expression was unaltered in aged HSPCs. Importantly, our results provide evidence for loss of SWI/SNF in AA, and may implicate AA HSPC-autonomous defective SWI/SNF regulation as an integral component of BM failure, in addition to autoimmune destruction of AA HSCs. These findings illustrate for the first time SWI/SNF subunit expression heterogeneity in human AA HSPCs and require prognostic validation in a larger cohort.",

Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor niche plays an active role in cancer, but its important properties for tumor initiation progression and resistance remain to be identified. Clinical data show that leukemic stem cell (LSC) survival is responsible for disease persistence and drug resistance, probably due to their sustained interactions with the tumor niche. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is a key pathway controlling stem cells and their niche. BMP2 and BMP4 are important in both the normal and the cancer context. Several studies have revealed profound alterations of the BMP signaling in cancer SCs, with major deregulations of the BMP receptors and their downstream signaling elements. This was illustrated in the hematopoietic system by pioneer studies in chronic myelogenous leukemia that may now be expanded to acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoid leukemia, as reviewed here. At diagnosis, cells from the leukemic microenvironment are the major providers of soluble BMPs. Conversely, LSCs display altered receptors and downstream BMP signaling elements accompanied by altered functional responses to BMPs. These studies reveal the role of BMPs in tumor initiation, in addition to their known effects in later stages of transformation and progression. They also reveal the importance of BMPs in fueling cell transformation and expansion by overamplifying a natural SC response. This mechanism may explain the survival of LSCs independently of the initial oncogenic event and therefore may be involved in resistance processes.",

Furthermore, the expression of miR-193a and miR-600 was decreased in AML patients compared with normal controls. DNA hypermethylation in pre-miR-193a promoter, but not pre-miR-600 promoter, caused the downregulation of miR-193a. Most intriguingly, ectopic expression of WT1 inhibited miR-600 expression, in turn, by binding the putative pre-miR-600 promoter, leading to the downregulation of miR-600 in AML blasts. Ectopic expression of miR-193a and miR-600 synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased colony formation in leukemia cells. Finally, overexpression of miR-193a and miR-600 decreased the growth of K562-inoculated tumor xenografts and extended survival time in THP1-transplanted leukemia mice. In conclusion, these data reveal an important role of miRNAs-WT1 circuitry in leukemia cells and the therapeutic promise of restoring miR-193a and miR-600 expression in AML patients.",

During embryonic development, however, the initial waves of hematopoiesis provide the first functioning blood cells of the developing embryo, such as primitive erythrocytes arising in the yolk sac, independently of HSCs. In the field of developmental immunology, it has been recognized that some components of the immune system, such as B-1a lymphocytes, are uniquely produced during the embryonic and neonatal period, suggesting a \u201clayered\u201d development of immunity. Several recent studies have shed new light on the developmental origin of the layered immune system, suggesting complex and sometimes multiple contributions to unique populations of innate-like immune cells from both fetal HSCs and earlier HSC-independent progenitors. In this review, we will attempt to synthesize these studies to provide an integrated model of developmental hematopoiesis and layered immunity that may offer new insights into the origin of HSCs.",

Newer erythroid differentiation culture systems have overcome some of these limitations by using a fully defined, serum-free medium and initiating cultures using purified CD34+ cells. Although widely used in bulk cultures, these protocols have not been rigorously tested in high-throughput or single-cell assays. Here, we describe a serum-free erythroid differentiation system suitable for small-scale and single-cell experiments. This system generates large numbers of terminally differentiated erythroid cells of very high purity.

Survival rates of HFD or normal diet (ND) mice were monitored after 5-Fu injection. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the progenitor cells in bone marrow were detected at various time points after 5-Fu administration by flow cytometry. Genes expressed in stem cell and platelet proliferation was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The blood cell profile and coagulation function were determined with an ADVIA 120 hematology system and rotational thromboelastometry, respectively. None of HFD mice remained alive after 5-Fu injection, whereas 87.4% of ND mice survived. HFD accelerated 5-Fu-induced myelosuppression and cytopenia in the circulation, reflected by the worse recovery of HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells. In HFD mice, the number of platelets significantly decreased, and the Vcam-1/Vla-4 signal pathway was downregulated in bone marrow. Meanwhile, mice receiving HFD exhibited dysfunction of blood coagulation with increased clotting formation time. However, pretreatment of HFD mice with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), the PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist, reversed the acute lethal toxicity and bone marrow suppression of 5-Fu and accelerated the recovery of HSCs and platelets. In the light of these results, HFD could exacerbate 5-Fu-induced bone marrow toxicity and cytopenia.

In this study, we examined the expression of BTLA, PD-1, TIM-3, LIGHT, and LAG-3 in tumor microenvironmental T cells of DLBCL using flow cytometry and compared the cytotoxicity and differentiation status of BTLA+ and BTLA\u2013 T-cells. We further characterized the relationship of STAT3 phosphorylation (p-STAT3) with BTLA expression. Our results suggest that BTLA+ T cells highly express other checkpoint molecules, including PD-1, TIM-3, LIGHT, and LAG-3. Moreover, high expression of BTLA is correlated with advanced stage of DLBCL. BTLA+ T cells have a less-differentiated phenotype, lower cytolytic function, and higher potential to proliferate compared with BTLA\u2013 T cells.

Deletions affecting the transcriptional coregulator BTG1 are frequently observed in ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemia. Here we report that Btg1 deficiency enhances the self-renewal capacity of ETV6-RUNX1-positive mouse fetal liver-derived hematopoietic progenitors (FL-HPCs). Combined expression of the fusion protein and a loss of BTG1 drive upregulation of the proto-oncogene Bcl6 and downregulation of BCL6 target genes, such as p19Arf and Tp53. Similarly, ectopic expression of BCL6 promotes the self-renewal and clonogenic replating capacity of FL-HPCs, by suppressing the expression of p19Arf and Tp53.

Furthermore, anti-PlGF Ab significantly reduced vaso-occlusion events under hypoxic conditions in a modified dorsal skinfold chamber model in SCD mice. Therefore, elevated PlGF levels may contribute to recruitment and activation of leukocytes.

     "abstract": "Over the years, the etiology of cancer has been attributed alternatively to genetic and environmental insults. According to the genetic hypothesis, cancer cells arise from the acquisition of mutations that dysregulate the intrinsic mechanisms controlling normal cell growth and survival. In contrast, the environmental hypothesis holds that cancer can be caused by multiple extrinsic challenges that alter normal tissue homeostasis, but may not necessarily involve mutations. It is, however, quite possible that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. According to this third hypothesis, environmental challenges, by mechanisms still poorly understood, may act by imposing a selection pressure that confers a proliferative advantage on cells carrying specific driver mutations, leading to disease initiation. The authors of a brief report published in this journal (Exp Hematol. 2017;56:1\u20136) tested this third hypothesis experimentally and provide new evidence that chronic inflammation, by increasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, may positively select malignant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) carrying loss-of-function TET2 mutations that switch the TNF-\u03b1 signaling responses to activate proliferation rather than inducing quiescence. Furthermore, these mutations skew hematopoietic differentiation toward the myelomonocytic lineage and the output of macrophages producing TNF-\u03b1 constitutively, promoting further environment-independent expansion of the malignant HSCs. These findings support a model in which the formation of a malignant population is triggered by a vicious interplay between genetic (TET2 mutations) and environmental (inflammation) insults, suggesting the need for strategies that target both the malignant cells and their environment.",

To assess whether compound deletion of mirn23a and mirn23b exacerbates the hematopoietic phenotype observed in mirn23a\u2212/\u2212 mice, we generated a compound mirn23a\u2212/\u2212mirn23bfl/fl:Mx1-Cre conditional knockout mouse and assayed hematopoietic development after excision of mirn23b. Loss of both genes in adult bone marrow further skewed HSPC differentiation toward B cells at the expense of myeloid cells, demonstrating a dosage-dependent effect on regulating cell differentiation. Strikingly, double-knockout (DKO) mice had decreased bone marrow cellularity with significantly decreased hematopoietic stem cell and HSPC populations, a phenotype not observed in mice deficient for mirn23a alone. Competitive transplantation assays showed decreased contribution of mirn23a\u2212/\u2212mirn23b\u2212/\u2212 HSPCs to hematopoietic lineages at 6 and 12 weeks after transplantation.

To investigate the proliferative activity and efficacy of megakaryocytic colony formation via human TPOR, lusutrombopag was applied to cultured human c-Mpl-expressing Ba/F3 (Ba/F3-hMpl) cells and human bone marrow-derived CD34-positive cells, respectively. Lusutrombopag caused a robust increase in Ba/F3-hMpl cells by activating pathways in a manner similar to that of thrombopoietin and induced colony-forming units-megakaryocyte and polyploid megakaryocytes in human CD34-positive cells. Because lusutrombopag has high species specificity for human TPOR, there was no suitable experimental animal model for drug evaluation, except for immunodeficient mouse-based xenograft models. Therefore, a novel genetically modified knock-in mouse, TPOR-Ki/Shi, was developed by replacing mouse Mpl with human\u2013mouse chimera Mpl.

Therefore, we investigated the role of DEK in normal hematopoiesis and response to DNA damaging agents in vivo. Here, we report that hematopoiesis is largely unperturbed in DEK knockout mice compared with wild-type (WT) controls. However, DEK knockout mice have fewer radioprotective units, but increased capacity to survive repeated sublethal doses of radiation exposure compared with WT mice. Furthermore, this increased survival correlated with a sustained quiescent state in which DEK knockout restricted hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC-1) were nearly three times more likely to be quiescent following irradiation compared with WT cells and were significantly more radioresistant during the early phases of myeloid reconstitution.

In the present study, we established a novel monoclonal antibody against mouse GPR56 (57R2A) to examine the expression and distribution of GPR56 protein in HSCs. A flow cytometry analysis using 57R2A showed that GPR56 was highly expressed in the CD34\u2212, c-Kit+, Sca-1+, lineage-negative (Lin\u2212) fraction, which are highly enriched with HSCs. The competitive long-term repopulation (LTR) assay showed that LTR cells were included only within the GPR56+ fraction (\u226415%) of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs), but not within the remaining GPR56\u2212 fraction (85%), suggesting that all HSCs express GPR56 protein on their surface. Furthermore, we showed that double staining of BMMNCs with only 57R2A and AMM2 (monoclonal antibody against the HSC marker MPL) enabled enrichment of all LTR cells in the double-positive fraction (0.8% of BMMNCs), within which the LTR potency was consistent with the expression of both GPR56 and MPL.

CHIP is associated with increased risks of de novo and therapy-related hematological neoplasms and serves as a reservoir for leukemic relapse. CHIP is also associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardio-metabolic disease. The latter association may be explained, at least in part, by the effects of inactivating mutations in TET2 on progeny macrophages. We and others have shown recently that TET2-deficient macrophages are hyperinflammatory and this may exacerbate processes such as atherosclerosis. We postulated an inflammatory state associated with TET2 inactivation and/or unhealthy aging may also favor TET2-mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion. Herein, we demonstrate a clonogenic advantage for Tet2-knockout murine and TET2-mutant human HSPCs in an in vitro environment that contains the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1). This phenotype emerges on chronic TNF\u03b1 exposure and is associated with myeloid skewing and resistance to apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence to suggest that TET2 mutations promote clonal dominance with aging by conferring TNF\u03b1 resistance to sensitive bone marrow progenitors while also propagating such an inflammatory environment.

No differences in extracellular phenotype, apoptosis, or cell cycle profile could distinguish samples that engraft (engrafter [E]) from samples that do not engraft (nonengrafter [NE]) in NSG mice. In addition, ex vivo long-term culture assay revealed, after 5 weeks, a lower content of leukemic-LTC-initiating cells in the NE samples associated with a lower expansion rate capacity. One-week co-cultures with mesenchymal or osteoblastic or endothelial cells did not influence the proliferation rate, suggesting that E and NE samples are genuinely rapidly or slowly expanding independent of external cue. Engraftment success for some NE samples was consistently observed in recipient mice analyzed 6 months later than the conventional 3-month period. Eventually we implemented a flow cytometry-based assay, which allowed us to predict, in 1 week, the fast or delayed engraftment potential of a noncharacterized acute myeloid leukemia sample.

Blockade of PDPK1 activity by small-molecule inhibitors specific for PDPK1 (BX-912 and GSK2334470) or by RNA interference exerted antiproliferative effects in all four MCL-derived cell lines examined and these growth-inhibitory effects were mediated by both induction of apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle blockade. In addition, blockade of PDPK1 led to inactivation of its downstream effector kinase RSK2, but not AKT, suggesting the importance of the PDPK1/RSK2 signaling pathway in the proliferation and survival of MCL cells. Finally, when combined with anticancer agents, including genotoxic agents, a proteasome inhibitor, and a BH3 mimetic in vitro, the PDPK1 inhibitor BX-912 showed additive growth-inhibitory effects against MCL-derived cell lines in most settings. In particular, the combination of BX-912 and ABT-263, a BH3 mimetic, resulted in the enhancement of the induction of apoptosis.

In conclusion, T-cell-replete haploidentical transplantation represents a new frontier in the treatment landscape of AML, lessening problems linked to donor search and ensuring that a donor can be found for all patients in a timely manner.",

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorders in which recurrent chromosome abnormalities and gene mutations define a clonal hematopoiesis. The MDS-initiating cell is a rare HSC which transmits the genetic abnormalities to its myeloid and lymphoid progeny. The heterogeneity of MDS phenotypes could be linked to the diversity of genetic events involving epigenetic regulators, chromatin modifiers, splicing factors, transcription factors and signaling adaptors, the various combinations and order of mutations in cooperating genes, and the variegation of clonal hematopoietic hierarchy. Usually, epigenetic and splicing gene mutations occur first. A combination of one epigenetic event with a splicing gene alteration is frequent. The HSC compartment is invaded by a dominant and few minor clones organized linearly or with a branched architecture. The dominant clone containing the first initiating mutations produces myeloid and lymphoid lineages in transplanted immune-deficient mice. The mutations confer a selective advantage to myeloid progenitors at the expense of lymphoid progenitors. In the context of differentiation, one mutation may favor the amplification of granulo-monocytic progenitor, which drives the transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Understanding the hierarchy of mutations provides insights on the mechanism of transformation. Investigation of mutation pattern and distribution along the hematopoietic tree may influence the therapeutic decision for targeted therapy.",

In addition, patients with a high-risk Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) score, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 were more likely to have much lower miR-223 expression. Furthermore, low miR-223 expression predicted inferior overall survival regardless of treatment in our cohort of 21. To explore the role of miR-223 in MCL, we constructed an ectopic miR-223 MCL cell line and revealed that miR-223 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted G0/G1 accumulation and cell apoptosis. A database search showed that SOX11, a crucial transcription factor in MCL, is the putative target of miR-223. In support of this, we observed a much lower level of SOX11 protein in miR-223-overexpressing cells than in parental cells. Further, the luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-223 at the posttranscriptional level suppressed the wild-type 3\u2032-untranslated region of SOX11 but not the mutated one. Finally, miR-223 was found to be negatively correlated with the mRNA level of SOX11 in clinical samples. Our work demonstrates for the first time that miR-223 is repressed and correlated with high-risk clinical features in MCL, which provides a potential molecule to target to optimize MCL management.",

Here, we analyzed expression of histone-3-lysine (H3K) demethylases and their cognate substrates in a cohort of de novo AML patients, which demonstrated that the expression of H3K27Me3/2-demethylases and selected members of H3K9Me3/2/1-demethylases are significantly increased in AML. KDM6 upregulation is associated with a global decrease in H3K27Me3 level.

More effective and better-tolerated therapies for AML are desperately needed. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are one of the most frequently observed genetic defects in AML. FLT3 inhibitors have shown impressive anti-leukemic activity in clinical trials; however, sustained remissions using these inhibitors as monotherapy have not been achieved. Our previous studies have implicated impaired glutamine metabolism in response to FLT3 inhibitors as a dominant factor causing AML cell death. In this study, we have employed metabolic flux analysis to examine the effects of FLT3 inhibition on glutamine utilization in FLT3-mutated AML cells using stable isotope tracers. We found that the FLT3 inhibitor AC220 inhibited glutamine flux into the antioxidant factor glutathione profoundly due to defective glutamine import. We also found that the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 similarly impaired glutathione production by effectively blocking flux of glutamine into glutamate. Moreover, the combination of AC220 with CB-839 synergized to deplete glutathione, induce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and cause loss of viability through apoptotic cell death. In vivo, glutaminase inhibition with CB-839 facilitated leukemic cell elimination by AC220 and improved survival significantly in a patient-derived xenograft AML mouse model. Therefore, targeting glutaminase in combination with FLT3 may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for improving treatment of FLT3-mutated AML.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, platelets are produced in the blood by cytoplasmic fragmentation of megakaryocytes (MKs). Platelet production is thus dependent on both the MK number and size. During differentiation, MKs switch from a division by mitosis to polyploidization by endomitosis to increase their size. The endomitotic process includes several successive rounds of DNA replication with an entry in mitosis with a failure in late cytokinesis and a defect in karyokinesis. This leads to a giant cell with a modal ploidy at 16N and one multilobulated nucleus. The entire genome is duplicated several times and all alleles remain functional producing a hypermetabolic cell. A defect in abscission explains the cytokinesis failure and is related to an altered accumulation of actomyosin at the cleavage furrow as a consequence of both a low local RhoA activity and silencing of the MYH10 gene. This mechanism is regulated by transcription factors that govern differentiation explaining the intricacies of both processes. However, the endomitotic cell cycle regulation is still incompletely understood, particularly mitosis entry, escape to the tetraploid checkpoint, and defect in karyokinesis. Polyploidization is regulated during ontogeny, the first embryonic MKs being 2N. The molecular mechanism of this embryo\u2013fetal/adult transition is beginning to be understood. In physiological conditions, MK ploidy is increased by an enhanced platelet demand through the thrombopoietin/myeloproliferative leukemia axis. In numerous hematologic malignancies, MK ploidy decreases, but it is always associated with a defect in MK differentiation. It has been proposed that polyploidization induction could be a treatment for some malignant MK disorders.",

More recently, population studies have identified cancer-associated variants in the blood of otherwise healthy individuals as they age, a phenomenon termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). This suggests that these mutations may occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) long before any clinical presentation but are not necessarily harbingers of transformation because only a fraction of individuals with CHIP develop hematopoietic pathologies. Delineation between CHIP variants that predispose for disease versus those that are more benign could be used as a prognostic factor to identify individuals at greater risk for transformation. To achieve this, the biological impact of CHIP variants on HSC function must be validated. One variant that has been identified recurrently in CHIP is a gain-of-function missense mutation in the imprinted gene GNAS (Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein, Alpha Stimulating). In this study, we examined the effect of the GNASR201C variant on HSC function. Ectopic expression of GNASR201C supported transplantable HSC activity and improved lymphoid output in secondary recipients. Because declining lymphoid output is a hallmark of aging, GNASR201C mutations may sustain lymphoid-biased HSCs over time and maintain them in a developmental state favorable for transformation.",

Constitutive overexpression of either of these genes is likely to be undesirable, but the transient nature of IdLVs reduces this risk and those associated with unsolicited gene expression in daughter cells. Transient expression led to increased multilineage hematopoietic engraftment in in vivo competitive repopulation assays without the side effects reported in constitutive overexpression models. Adult stem cell fate has not been programmed previously using IdLVs, but we demonstrate that these transient gene expression tools can produce clinically relevant alterations or be applied to investigate basic biology.",

However, a proportion of patients or healthy donors fail to mobilize a sufficient number of cells. New mobilization agents are therefore needed. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipid mediators generated in the brain and peripheral tissues and activate the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. We suggest that eCBs may act as mobilizers of HSCs from the bone marrow (BM) under stress conditions as beta-adrenergic receptors (Adr\u03b2). This study demonstrates that BM mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and the peripheral blood (PB) and BM microenvironment contain AEA and 2-AG. 2-AG levels are significantly higher in PB of the G-CSF-treated group compared with BM plasma. BM mononuclear cells (MNCs) and CD34+ HSCs express CB1, CB2, and Adr\u03b2 subtypes. CD34+ HSCs had higher CB1 and CB2 receptor expression in G-CSF-untreated and G-CSF-treated groups compared with MSCs. MNCs but not MSCs expressed CB1 and CB2 receptors based on qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. AEA- and 2-AG-stimulated HSC migration was blocked by eCB receptor antagonists in an in vitro migration assay. In conclusion, components of the eCB system and their interaction with Adr\u03b2 subtypes were demonstrated on HSCs and MSCs of G-CSF-treated and G-CSF-untreated healthy donors in vitro, revealing that eCBs might be potential candidates to enhance or facilitate G-CSF-mediated HSC migration under stress conditions in a clinical setting.",

Although the disease can be kept under control using BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in most cases, some patients relapse or have resistant disease, so there is a need to identify new therapeutic targets in this malignancy. Recent data suggest that leukemic SCs (LSCs) in CML display the stem-cell (SC)-mobilizing cell surface enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPPIV\u2009=\u2009CD26) in an aberrant manner. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the DPPIV blocker vildagliptin as single agent or in combination with the BCR/ABL1 TKI imatinib or nilotinib on growth and survival of CML LSCs in vitro and on LSC engraftment in an in vivo xenotransplantation nonobese diabetic SCID-IL-2R\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mouse model.

     "abstract": "The late stages of life, in most species including humans, are associated with a decline in the overall maintenance and health of the organism. This applies also to the hematopoietic system, where aging is not only associated with an increased predisposition for hematological malignancies, but also identified as a strong comorbidity factor for other diseases. Research during the last two decades has proposed that alterations at the level of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) might be a root cause for the hematological changes observed with age. However, the recent realization that not all HSCs are alike with regard to fundamental stem cell properties such as self-renewal and lineage potential has several implications for HSC aging, including the synchrony and the stability of the aging HSC state. To approach HSC aging from a clonal perspective, we recently took advantage of technical developments in cellular barcoding and combined this with the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This allowed us to selectively approach HSCs functionally affected by age. The finding that such iPSCs were capable of fully regenerating multilineage hematopoiesis upon morula/blastocyst complementation provides compelling evidence that many aspects of HSC aging can be reversed, which indicates that a central mechanism underlying HSC aging is a failure to uphold the epigenomes associated with younger age.

In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), miR-22 has been reported to be involved in the regulation of key self-renewal factors, including Tet2. Recent work demonstrates that miR-22 also participates in regulation of the interferon (IFN) response, and expression profiling studies suggest that it is variably expressed at different stages in erythroid differentiation. We thus hypothesized that miR-22 regulates maturation of erythroid progenitors during stress hematopoiesis through its interaction with IFN. We compared the blood and bone marrow of wild-type (WT) and miR-22-deficient mice at baseline and upon infectious challenge with systemic lymphochoriomeningitis (LCMV) virus. miR-22-deficient mice maintained platelet counts better than WT mice during infection, but they showed significantly reduced red blood cells and hemoglobin. Analysis of bone marrow progenitors demonstrated better overall survival and improved HSC homeostasis in infected miR-22-null mice compared with WT, which was attributable to a blunted IFN response to LCMV challenge in the miR-22-null mice. We found that miR-22 was expressed exclusively in stage II erythroid precursors and downregulated upon infection in WT mice. Our results indicate that miR-22 promotes the IFN response to viral infection and that it functions at baseline as a brake to slow erythroid differentiation and maintain adequate erythroid potential. Impaired regulation of erythrogenesis in the absence of miR-22 can lead to anemia during infection.",

We have reported previously that the reduction of red blood cell mass in the bone marrow of a burn-injured ACI mouse model is granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) dependent. Given that elevated G-CSF levels also have been associated with lower hemoglobin levels and increased transfusion requirements in trauma victims, we postulated that G-CSF mediates postburn EPO resistance. In ACI mice, we found that bone marrow erythroid differentiation, viability, and proliferation are impaired after thermal injury of the skin. These changes in the marrow were associated with attenuated phosphorylation of known EPO-responsive signaling nodes, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) Y694 and STAT3 S727, in bone marrow erythroid cells and developed despite highly elevated levels of endogenous EPO. Severely blunted STAT5 Y694 phosphorylation in bone marrow erythroid cells after exogenous EPO supplementation confirmed that EPO signaling was impaired in ACI mice. Importantly, parenteral administration of anti-G-CSF largely rescued postburn bone marrow erythroid differentiation arrest and EPO signaling in erythroid cells. Together, these data provide strong evidence for a role for G-CSF in the development of ACI after burn injury through suppression of EPO signaling in bone marrow erythroid cells.",

In this study, we investigated whether the gene encoding the transcription factor SPI-B is a target of IKAROS. Using cultured ABC-DLBCL cell lines, we found that high levels of SPI-B expression conferred resistance to lenalidomide. Lenalidomide treatment of ABC-DLBCL cells resulted in downregulation of SPIB at the level of transcription. SPIB was regulated directly by IKAROS through a binding site located in the first intron of the gene. Inhibition of IKAROS binding using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transcriptional repression downregulated endogenous SPIB transcription. Finally, ectopic expression of IKAROS protected SPIB from downregulation. These results show that the mechanism of action of lenalidomide in ABC-DLBCL cells involves downregulation of SPIB transcription by cereblon-induced degradation of IKAROS.

Our results reveal long-lasting changes to progenitor cells of monocytes/macrophages by a 2-hour dmPGE2 pulse that, in turn, limits the migration of their daughter cells to chemoattractants and inflammatory mediators.",

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and represent the most common cause of acquired marrow failure. Hallmarked by ineffective hematopoiesis, dysplastic marrow, and risk of transformation to acute leukemia, MDS remains a poorly treated disease. Although identification of hematopoietic aberrations in human MDS has contributed significantly to our understanding of MDS pathogenesis, evidence now identify the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) as another key contributor to disease initiation and progression. With improved understanding of the BMME, we are beginning to refine the role of the hematopoietic niche in MDS. Despite genetic diversity in MDS, interaction between MDS and the BMME appears to be a common disease feature and therefore represents an appealing therapeutic target. Further understanding of the interdependent relationship between MDS and its niche is needed to delineate the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic failure and how the microenvironment can be targeted clinically. This review provides an overview of data from human MDS and murine models supporting a role for BMME dysfunction at several steps of disease pathogenesis. Although no models or human studies so far have combined all of these findings, we review current data identifying BMME involvement in each step of MDS pathogenesis organized to reflect the chronology of BMME contribution as the normal hematopoietic system becomes myelodysplastic and MDS progresses to marrow failure and transformation. Although microenvironmental heterogeneity and dysfunction certainly add complexity to this syndrome, data are already demonstrating that targeting microenvironmental signals may represent novel therapeutic strategies for MDS treatment.",

TGF\u03b2 signals mainly through the intracellular proteins Smad2 and Smad3, which are highly similar in amino acid sequence identity. A number of studies have shown that these proteins, dependent on context, have distinct roles in the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. TGF\u03b2 is one of the most potent inhibitors of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro, but its role in hematopoiesis in\u00a0vivo is still being determined. To circumvent possible redundancies at the receptor level and to address specifically the role of the Smad circuitry downstream of TGF\u03b2 and activin in hematopoiesis, we studied the effect of genetically deleting both Smad2 and Smad3 in adult murine hematopoietic cells. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 signaling is impaired in\u00a0vitro in primitive bone marrow (BM) cells of Smad2 and Smad3 single knockout models. However, blood parameters appear normal under steady state and in the transplantation setting. Interestingly, upon deletion of both Smad2 and Smad3 in\u00a0vivo, mice quickly develop a lethal inflammatory disease, suggesting that activin/TGF\u03b2 signaling is crucial for immune cell homeostasis in the adult context. Furthermore, concurrent deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 in BM cells in immune-deficient nude mice did not result in any significant alterations of the hematopoietic system. Our findings suggest that Smad2 and Smad3 function to mediate crucial aspects of the immunoregulatory properties of TGF\u03b2, but are dispensable for any effect that TGF\u03b2 has on primitive hematopoietic cells in\u00a0vivo.",

TET2 catalyzes the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, leading to DNA demethylation, and also affects transcription by recruiting histone modifiers. Inactivating TET2 mutations cause epigenetic dysregulation, clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dominance, and monocytic lineage skewing. Here, we found that Tet2 was the most highly expressed Tet enzyme in murine macrophage (M\u03a6) differentiation. Tet2 transcription was further induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not interleukin (IL)-4, stimulation, potentially in a nuclear factor \u03ba\u03b2-dependent manner. Tet2 loss did not affect early LPS gene responses in vitro, but increased Il-1b, Il-6, and Arginase 1 (Arg1) mRNA expression at later stages of stimulation in bone-marrow-derived M\u03a6s (BMM\u03a6s). Tet2-deficient peritoneal M\u03a6s, however, demonstrated profound, constitutive expression of LPS-induced genes associated with an inflammatory state in vivo. In contrast, Tet2 deficiency did not affect alternative M\u03a6 gene expression significantly in response to IL-4. These results suggested impaired resolution of inflammation in the absence of Tet2 both in vitro and in vivo. For the first time, we also detected TET2 mutations in BMM\u03a6s from MDS and CMML patients and assayed their effects on LPS responses, including their potential influence on human IL-6 expression. Our results show that Tet2 restrains inflammation in murine M\u03a6s and mice, raising the possibility that loss of TET2 function in M\u03a6s may alter the immune environment in the large elderly population with TET2-mutant CHIP and in TET2-mutant myeloid cancer patients.",

An unweighted genetic risk score (uGRS) for the prediction of insulin resistance, consisting of 10 multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms, has been proposed. We evaluated uGRS predictivity in 61 CML patients treated with nilotinib. Patients were genotyped for IRS1, GRB14, ARL15, PPARG, PEPD, ANKRD55/MAP3K1, PDGFC, LYPLAL1, RSPO3, and FAM13A1 genes. The uGRS was based on the sum of the risk alleles within the set of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Molecular response (MR)3.0 and MR4.0 were achieved in 90% and 79% of patients, respectively. Before treatment, none of the patients had abnormal blood glucose.

Oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) was reported to be differentially methylated and associated with prognosis in AML and, as reported for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and malignant glioma, may play a role in malignant transformation. We report that DNA methylation of OLIG2 is associated with decreased expression of mRNA in AML cell lines and patients. Moreover, in cell lines, decreased mRNA expression also translated into decreased OLIG2 protein expression. Treatment of non-expressing cell lines PL-21 and U-937 with the demethylating agent decitabine resulted in robust re-expression of OLIG2 on mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, stable overexpression of OLIG2 in non-expressing cell lines Kasumi-1 and U-937, using a lentiviral vector system, led to moderate growth inhibition after 4 days and resulted in signs of differentiation in U-937 cells. Interestingly, although CD34\u2009+\u2009cells from healthy donors and 10 of 12 AML patients exhibited no protein expression, OLIG2 was expressed in two patients, both bearing the translocation t(15;17), corresponding to OLIG2 expression in NB-4 cells, also harboring t(15;17). In conclusion, we provide first evidence that OLIG2 is epigenetically regulated via DNA methylation and expressed in a subset of AML patients. OLIG2 may exert antiproliferative activity in leukemia cell lines, and its potential leukemia-suppressing role in AML warrants further investigation.",

Despite these technological advances, the characterization of crucial genes for benign or malignant hematological disorders remains challenging, given the dynamic nature of the hematopoietic system and the genetic heterogeneity of these disorders. To overcome this limitation, genome-editing technologies have been developed to manipulate the genome specifically via deletion, insertion, or modification of targeted loci. These technologies have progressed swiftly, allowing their common use to investigate genetic function in experimental hematology. Among them, homologous-recombination\u2013mediated targeting technologies have facilitated the manipulation of specific loci by generating knock-out and knock-in models.

     "abstract": "The bone marrow niche is essential for hematopoietic stem cells to maintain lifelong blood production by balancing their self-renewal and differentiation. Hematologic malignancies have a similar hierarchical organization to their normal counterparts, with rare populations of cancer stem cells that rely on the microenvironment to survive and propagate their differentiated malignant progenitor cells. Cancer cells alter their microenvironment to create a supportive niche, where they endure chemotherapy, survive as minimal residual disease (MRD), and eventually prevail at relapse. Powerful morphogens, such as retinoids, Wnt/\u03b2catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog, control stem cell fates across tissues, including normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The molecular conversations between these pathways and the mechanisms that control their activity and create gradients at cellular scale remain a mystery. Here, we discuss accumulating evidence suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP26), the primary retinoid-inactivating enzyme, plays a critical role in the integration of two of these molecular programs: the retinoid and Hedgehog pathways. Induction of stromal CYP26 by either one of these pathways limits retinoic acid concentration in the stem cell niche, with profound effects on tissue homeostasis and drug resistance. Bypassing this gatekeeping mechanism holds promise for overcoming drug resistance and improving clinical outcomes in hematological malignancies and cancer in general.",

The B-lymphoid transcription factors IKZF1, EBF1, and PAX5 are essential for early B-cell development and commitment to B-cell identity.

In addition, this program sets the threshold for responses to glucocorticoids in pre\u2013B-ALL.

Disruption of the transcriptional program alters the cellular state and may predispose cells to the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. Early studies have shown that proteins that promote cell differentiation often serve as tumor suppressors, whereas inhibitors of those proteins act as oncogenes in the context of acute leukemia. A prime example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature stage thymocytes. Although a relatively small number of genetic abnormalities are observed in T-ALL, these abnormalities are crucial for leukemogenesis. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL are transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis. The transformation process in T-ALL is efficient and orchestrated; the oncogene disrupts the transcriptional program directing T-cell differentiation and also uses its native ability as a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis. This imbalance in the transcriptional program is a primary determinant underlying the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. In this review, we focus on the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and the tumor-suppressor E-proteins and discuss the malignant cell state, the transcriptional circuit, and the consequence of molecular abnormalities in T-ALL.",

Despite advances in the treatment of this disease, many children with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) die from disease relapse due to low responses to standard chemotherapy and the lack of a targeted therapy that selectively eradicates the chemoresistant leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) responsible for disease recurrence. We reported recently that the reprogramming factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) has a tumor-suppressive function in children with T-ALL. KLF4 silencing by promoter deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation in patients with T-ALL leads to aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MAP2K7 and the downstream c-Jun\u00a0NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway that controls the expansion of leukemia cells via c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2.

Although it is known that BTK is required for clonogenic growth and resistance, and microtubules are essential for cancer cell growth, dual targeting of these two components has not been explored previously. Through docking studies, we predicted that KS99 interacts directly with the catalytic domain of BTK and inhibits phosphorylation at the Y223 residue and kinase activities. Treatment of KS99 reduces the cell viability of multiple myeloma (MM) and CD138+ cells, with an IC50 of between 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/L.

PRKCH was most highly expressed in undifferentiated (FAB M0) subtype AML, and high expression correlated with TP53 and RUNX1 mutations, high-risk cytogenetic features, and poor overall survival. Prkch deletion in an Flt3-ITD/Runx1 mutant mouse AML model did not extend survival. Thus, PRKCH is necessary for normal HSC function; its expression predicts poor survival in AML patients, but it is not required for AML to develop.",

WGS revealed that the diagnostic cells also contained mutations in ASXL1, SEC23B, MAD1L1, and RREB1 as well as 12,000 additional uncommon DNA variants. WGS of endothelial cells generated from circulating precursors revealed many of these were shared with the CML clone. Surprisingly, WGS of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the AP cells revealed only six additional coding somatic mutations, despite retention by the hematopoietic progeny of the parental AP cell levels of BCR-ABL1 expression and sensitivity to imatinib and pimozide. Limited analysis of BP cells revealed independent subclonal progression to homozygosity of the MAD1L1 and RREB1 variants. MAD1L1 and SEC23B mutations were also identified in 2 of 101 cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but not in 42 healthy subjects.

The initial isolation of CSCs/LSCs was in adult myelogenous leukemia, although more recently, the existence of CSCs in a wide variety of other cancers has been reported. CSCs, in general, and LSCs, specifically with respect to this review, are responsible for initiation of disease, therapeutic resistance and ultimately disease relapse. One key focus in cancer research over the past decade has been the development of therapies that safely eliminate the LSC/CSC population. One major obstacle to this goal is the identification of key mechanisms that distinguish LSCs from normal endogenous hematopoietic stem cells. An additional daunting feature that has recently come to light with advances in next-generation sequencing and single-cell sequencing is the heterogeneity within leukemias/tumors, with multiple combinations of mutations, gain and loss of function of genes, and so on being capable of driving disease, even within the CSC/LSC population. The focus of this review/perspective is on our work in identifying and validating, in both chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a safe and efficacious mechanism to target an evolutionarily conserved signaling nexus, which constitutes a common \u201cAchilles heel\u201d for LSCs/CSCs, using small molecule-specific CBP/catenin antagonists.",

     "abstract": "The success of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) provides a rationale for using retinoic acid (RA)-based therapy for other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently, several studies showed that ATRA may drive leukemic cells efficiently into differentiation and/or apoptosis in a subset of AML patients with an NPM1 mutation, a FLT3-ITD, an IDH1 mutation, and patients overexpressing EVI-1. Because not all patients within these molecular subgroups respond to ATRA and clinical trials that tested ATRA response in non-APL AML patients have had disappointing results, the identification of additional biomarkers may help to identify patients who strongly respond to ATRA-based therapy. Searching for response biomarkers might also reveal novel RA-based combination therapies with an efficient differentiation/apoptosis-inducing effect in non-APL AML patients. Preliminary studies suggest that the epigenetic or transcriptional state of leukemia cells determines their susceptibility to ATRA. We hypothesize that reprogramming by inhibitors of epigenetic-modifying enzymes or by modulation of microRNA expression might sensitize non-APL AML cells for RA-based therapy. AML relapse is caused by a subpopulation of leukemia cells, named leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are in a different epigenetic state than the total bulk of the AML. The survival of LSCs after therapy is the main cause of\u00a0the poor prognosis of AML patients, and novel differentiation therapies should drive these LSCs into maturity. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the epigenetic aspects of susceptibility to RA-induced differentiation in APL and non-APL AML.",

Systemic iron homeostasis is mainly negatively regulated by the peptide hormone hepcidin, coded by the gene HAMP. Hepcidin excess may cause iron deficiency, iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and anemia. Conversely, hepcidin insufficiency leads to iron overload and oxidative damage in multiple tissues. During regulation of hepcidin synthesis, multiple promoter elements in the HAMP gene respond to variable signaling pathways corresponding to different extracellular situations. It has been reported that hepcidin expression can be suppressed by secreted erythroid factors, including GDF15, TWSG1, GDF11, and ERFE, thereby increasing iron availability for hemoglobin synthesis. These potential erythroid factors act via intricate mechanisms that remain controversial. However, it is clear that hepcidin affects erythropoiesis, and promising therapies targeting hepcidin have been developed to treat erythroid disorders. These therapeutic strategies include suppressing or activating HAMP gene expression, mimicking or activating hepcidin activity, and blocking the ability of hepcidin to bind to its target ferroportin.",

Mutations in SAMHD1 have been associated with the hyperinflammatory disease Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS). SAMHD1 also limits cells' permissiveness to infection with diverse viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and controls endogenous retroviruses. Increasing evidence supports the role of SAMHD1 as a tumor suppressor. However, SAMHD1 also can act as a resistance factor to nucleoside-based chemotherapies by hydrolyzing their active triphosphate metabolites, thereby reducing response of various malignancies to these anticancer drugs. Hence, informed cancer therapies must take into account the ambiguous properties of SAMHD1 as both an inhibitor of uncontrolled proliferation and a resistance factor limiting the efficacy of anticancer treatments. Here, we provide evidence that SAMHD1 is a double-edged sword for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Our time-dependent analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohort indicate that high expression of SAMHD1, even though it critically limits the efficacy of high-dose ara-C therapy, might be associated with more favorable disease progression.",

In murine models of aged and young hosts, we show that FLT3L enhances thymopoiesis in aged, Lupron-treated hosts through increased survival and export of LSK cells via CXCR4 regulation. In addition, we elucidate an underlying mechanism of FLT3L action on BM LSK cells\u2014FLT3L drives LSK cells into the stromal niche using Hoescht (Ho) dye perimortem. In summary, we show that FLT3L administration leads to: (1) increased LSK cells and early thymocyte progenitor precursors that can enhance thymopoiesis after transplantation and androgen withdrawal, (2) mobilization of LSK cells through downregulation of CXCR4, (3) enhanced BM stem cell survival associated with Bcl-2 upregulation, and (4) BM stem cell enrichment through increased trafficking to the BM niche. Therefore, we show a mechanism by which FLT3L activity on hematopoeitic and thymic progenitor cells may contribute to thymic recovery.

Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are exposed to various types of drugs, and understanding how these drugs interact is of the utmost importance. The pharmacokinetics of busulfan, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide, drugs commonly used for HSCT, are known to be affected by a variety of other drugs with differing molecular structures. We hypothesized that these structurally unrelated drugs affect the transport of DNA-alkylating agents. To test this hypothesis, we developed a flow cytometry assay that used 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester, which is cleaved by nonspecific intracellular esterases to 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF), a fluorescent ligand for the drug transporter MRP1. A decreased 5-CF efflux in the presence of a test compound suggests competitive inhibition. We demonstrated that chlorambucil, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, ketoconazole, ethacrynic acid, everolimus, and sirolimus strongly inhibited 5-CF efflux in lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. The efflux of these drugs partially depends on the glutathione (GSH) level, and their cytotoxicity is synergistic with inhibited GSH synthesis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that their GSH-conjugated products are ligands of a common cellular drug transporter. Our results may explain clinical observations on the effects of various drugs on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alkylating agents, and the assay may be used to deduce interaction mechanisms of drugs transported by a common system.",

Our findings define the repertoire of Epo-modulated enhancers, illuminating a new facet of Epo signaling. First, a large number of enhancers rapidly responded to Epo stimulation, revealing a cis-regulatory network of Epo-responsive enhancers. In contrast, most of the other identified enhancers remained in an active acetylated state during Epo signaling, suggesting that most erythroid enhancers are established at an earlier precursor stage. Second, we identified several hundred super-enhancers that were linked to key erythroid genes, such as Tal1, Bcl11a, and Mir144/451. Third, experimental and computational validation revealed that many predicted enhancer regions were occupied by TAL1 and enriched with DNA-binding motifs for GATA1, KLF1, TAL1/E-box, and STAT5. Additionally, many of these cis-regulatory regions were conserved evolutionarily and displayed correlated enhancer:promoter acetylation. Together, these findings define a cis-regulatory enhancer network for Epo signaling during erythropoiesis, and provide the framework for future studies involving the interplay of epigenetics and Epo signaling.",

To determine if LKB1 inactivation is a passenger or driver event in lymphoid cancers, we examined the effects of conditional inactivation of Lkb1 in murine lymphocytes. Consistent with prior reports, Lkb1 deletion in either T or B cells resulted in massive, lineage-specific apoptosis. Surprisingly, despite an 80% reduction of peripheral B-cell number, animals harboring somatic B-lineage Lkb1 deletion developed aggressive B-cell lymphoma with high penetrance and moderate latency.

A major challenge to interrogating these issues in human acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is the low proliferative activity of most of the cells, which may be further reduced in cryopreserved samples and difficult to overcome in\u00a0vitro. In contrast, the ability of many human ALL cell populations to expand when transplanted into highly immunodeficient mice is well documented. To examine the stability of DNA RT profiles of serially passaged xenografts of primary human B- and T-ALL cells, we first devised a method that circumvents the need for bromodeoxyuridine incorporation to distinguish early versus late S-phase cells. Using this and more standard protocols, we found consistently strong retention in xenografts of the original patient-specific RT features. Moreover, in a case in which genomic analyses indicated changing subclonal dynamics in serial passages, the RT profiles tracked concordantly. These results indicate that DNA RT is a relatively stable feature of human ALLs propagated in immunodeficient mice. In addition, they suggest the power of this approach for future interrogation of the origin and consequences of altered DNA RT in ALL.",

Both HSC and LSC functions require regulation of key cellular processes including proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy, which are regulated by mTORC1 pathway. Despite the mTORC1\u2013S6K1 pathway being a critical regulator of AML initiation and progression, inhibitors of this pathway alone have yielded mixed results in clinical studies. Recent studies have identified strategies to develop new mTORC1\u2013S6K1 inhibitors such as RapaLink-1, which could circumvent the drug resistance observed in AML cells and in LSCs. Here, we review recent advances made in identifying the role of different components of this pathway in the regulation of HSCs and LSCs and discuss possible therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in specialized microenvironments known as niches. The niche is essential to support HSC function and to maintain a correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Recent advances in defining different mesenchymal and endothelial bone marrow cell populations, as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, greatly enhanced our understanding of these niches and of the molecular mechanisms by which they regulate HSC function. In addition to the role in maintaining HSC homeostasis, the niche has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of blood disorders including hematological malignancies. Characterizing the extrinsic regulators and the cellular context in which the niches interact with HSCs will be crucial to define new strategies to enhance blood regeneration. Furthermore, a better understanding of the role of the niche in leukemia development will open new possibilities for the treatment of these disorders by using therapies aiming to target the leukemic niche specifically. To update on recent findings on this topic, the International Society for Experimental Hematology (ISEH) organized a webinar, presented by Prof. Sean J.

     "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited blood disorder that causes bone marrow failure and high predisposition to cancers. The FA pathway guards the cell's genome stability by orchestrating the repair of interstrand cross-linking during the S phase of the cell cycle, preventing the chromosomal instability that is a key event in bone marrow failure syndrome. Central to the FA pathway is loss of monoubiquitinated forms of the Fanconi proteins FANCI and FANCD2, a process that is normally mediated by a \u201ccore complex\u201d of seven other Fanconi proteins. Each protein, when mutated, can cause FA. The FA core-complex-catalyzed reaction is critical for signaling DNA cross-link damage such as that induced by chemotherapies. Here, we present a perspective on the current understanding of FANCI and FANCD2 monoubiquitination-mediated DNA repair. Our recent biochemical reconstitution of the monoubiquitination (and deubiquitination) reactions creates a paradigm for understanding FA. Further biochemical analysis will create new opportunities to address the leukemic phenotype of FA patients.",

     "abstract": "Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) remains a significant hurdle to successful treatment of many hematological disorders. The disease is caused by infiltration of alloactivated donor T cells primarily into the gastrointestinal tract and skin. Although cytotoxic T cells mediate direct cellular damage, T helper (Th) cells differentially secrete immunoregulatory cytokines. aGvHD is thought to be initiated primarily by Th1 cells but a consensus is still lacking regarding the role of Th2 and Th17\u00a0cells. The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of distinct T-cell subsets to aGvHD in the rat. aGvHD was induced by transplanting irradiated rats with T-cell-depleted major histocompatibility complex-mismatched bone marrow, followed 2\u00a0weeks later by donor lymphocyte infusion. Near complete donor T-cell chimerism was achieved in the blood and lymphatic tissues, in contrast to mixed chimerism in the skin and gut. Skin and gut donor T cells were predominantly CD4+, in contrast to T cells in the blood and lymphatic tissues. Genes associated with Th1 cells were upregulated in gut, liver, lung, and skin tissues affected by aGvHD. Increased serum levels of CXCL10 and IL-18 preceded symptoms of aGvHD, accompanied by increased responsiveness to CXCL10 by blood CD4+ T cells. No changes in the expression of Th2- or Th17-associated genes were observed, indicating that aGvHD in this rat model is mainly Th1 driven. The rat model of aGvHD could be instrumental for further investigations of donor T-cell subsets in the skin and gut and for exploring therapeutic options to ameliorate symptoms of aGvHD.",

     "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a point mutation that renders hemoglobin susceptible to polymerization when deoxygenated, affects millions of people worldwide. Manifestations of SCD include chronic hemolytic anemia, inflammation, painful vaso-occlusive crises, multisystem organ damage, and reduced life expectancy. Part of SCD pathophysiology is the excessive formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SCD red blood cells (RBCs), which accelerates their hemolysis. Normal RBC precursors eliminate their mitochondria during the terminal differentiation process. Strikingly, we observed an increased percentage of RBCs retaining mitochondria in SCD patient blood samples compared with healthy individuals. In addition, using an experimental SCD mouse model, we demonstrate that excessive levels of ROS in SCD are associated with this abnormal mitochondrial retention. Interestingly, the LSD1 inhibitor, RN-1, and the mitophagy-inducing agent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, sirolimus, increased RBC lifespan and reduced ROS accumulation in parallel with reducing mitochondria-retaining RBCs in the SCD mouse model. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of SCD mice treated with RN-1 showed increased expression of mitophagy genes. Our findings suggest that reduction of mitochondria-retaining RBCs may provide a new therapeutic approach to preventing excessive ROS in SCD.",

     "abstract": "Calreticulin (CALR) is a Ca2+-binding protein that shuttles among cellular compartments with proteins bound to its N/P domains. The knowledge that activation of the human erythropoietin receptor induces Ca2+ fluxes prompted us to investigate the role of CALR in human erythropoiesis. As shown by Western blot analysis, erythroblasts generated in\u00a0vitro from normal sources and JAK2V617F polycythemia vera (PV) patients expressed robust levels of CALR. However, Ca2+ regulated CALR conformation only in normal cells. Normal erythroblasts expressed mostly the N-terminal domain of CALR (N-CALR) on their cell surface (as shown by flow cytometry) and C-terminal domain (C-CALR) in their cytoplasm (as shown by confocal microscopy) and expression of both epitopes decreased with maturation. In the proerythroblast (proEry) cytoplasm, C-CALR was associated with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which initiated the stress response. In these cells, Ca2+ deprivation and inhibition of nuclear export increased GR nuclear localization while decreasing cytoplasmic detection of C-CALR and C-CALR/GR association and proliferation in response to the GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex). C-CALR/GR association and Dex responsiveness were instead increased by Ca2+ and erythropoietin. In contrast, JAK2V617F proErys expressed normal cell-surface levels of N-CALR but barely detectable cytoplasmic levels of C-CALR. These cells contained GR mainly in the nucleus and were Dex unresponsive. Ruxolitinib rescued cytoplasmic detection of C-CALR, C-CALR/GR association, and Dex responsiveness in JAK2V617F proErys and its effects were antagonized by nuclear export and Ca2+ flux inhibitors. These results indicates that Ca2+-induced conformational changes of CALR regulate nuclear export of GR in normal erythroblasts and that JAK2V617F deregulates this function in PV.",

Roles for Podxl during nonmalignant hematopoiesis, however, are largely undefined. We have developed a Vav\u2013Cre Podxl knockout (KO) mouse model, and report on novel roles for Podxl in governing stress myelopoiesis. At steady state, Podxl expression among hematopoietic progenitor cells was low level but was induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in myeloid progenitors and by thrombopoietin in human stem cells. In keeping with low-level Podxl expression at steady state, Vav\u2013Cre deletion of Podxl did not markedly alter peripheral blood cell levels. A G-CSF challenge in Podxl-KO mice, in contrast, hyperelevated peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte levels. Podxl-KO also substantially heightened neutrophil levels after 5-fluorouracil myeloablation. These loss-of-function phenotypes were selective, and Podxl-KO did not alter lymphocyte, basophil, or eosinophil levels. Within bone marrow (and after G-CSF challenge), Podxl deletion moderately decreased colony forming units\u2014granulocytes, eyrthrocytes, monocyte/macrophages, megakaryocytes and CD16/32posCD11bpos progenitors but did not affect Gr-1pos cell populations. Notably, Podxl-KO did significantly heighten peripheral blood neutrophil migration capacities. To interrogate Podxl's action mechanisms, a co-immunoprecipitation plus liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry approach was applied using hematopoietic progenitors from G-CSF-challenged mice. Rap1a, a Ras-related small GTPase, was a predominant co-retrieved Podxl partner. In bone marrow human progenitor cells, Podxl-KO led to heightened G-CSF activation of Rap1aGTP, and Rap1aGTP inhibition attenuated Podxl-KO neutrophil migration. Studies have revealed novel roles for Podxl as an important modulator of neutrophil and monocyte formation and of Rap1a activation during stress hematopoiesis.",

In the current study, we investigated the requirement of Hoxa genes at different stages of B-cell development. Using an MxCre-inducible conditional knock-out mouse model, we showed that immature B-cell fractions and early lymphoid progenitors were markedly reduced in the absence of Hoxa, whereas mature B-cell populations were found at levels comparable to controls. Deletion of Hoxa genes in B-cell lineage-committed cells, however, did not affect B-cell development despite sustained Hoxa gene expression in immature CD19+ B-cell subsets.

     "abstract": "The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a negative prognostic factor and, in these cases, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) can represent an important therapeutic option, especially if performed in complete remission (CR). However, it is increasingly clear that not all cytological CRs (cCRs) are the same and that minimal residual disease (MRD) before allo-SCT could have an impact on AML outcome. Unfortunately, FLT3, due its instability of expression, is still not considered a good molecular MRD marker. We analyzed the outcome of allo-SCT in a population of FLT3-positive AML patients according to molecular MRD at the pretransplantation workup, assessed by the quantitative expression evaluation of the panleukemic marker Wilms\u2019 tumor (WT1) gene. Sixty-two consecutive AML FLT3-positive patients received allo-SCT between 2005 and 2016 in our center. The median age at transplantation was 55\u00a0years. The quantitative analysis of the WT1 gene expression (bone marrow samples) was available in 54 out of 62 (87%) cases, both at diagnosis (100% overexpressing WT1 with a mean of 9747\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08064 copies) and before allo-SCT (33 WT1-negative and 21 WT1-positive cases at the pretransplantation workup). Of these cases, 33/54 (61%) were both in cCR and molecular remission (WT1-negative) at the time of transplantation, 13/54 (24%) were in cCR but not in molecular remission (WT1-positive), and 8/54 (15%) showed a cytological evidence of disease (relapsed or refractory). Both post-allo-SCT overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly better in patients who were WT1-negative (WT1 <250 copies) at the time of transplantation compared with those who were WT1-positive (WT1 >250 copies), with a median OS and DFS not reached in the WT1-negative group and 10.2 and 5.5\u00a0months, respectively, in the WT1-positive group (OS log\u2013rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005; hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a03.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.5\u20139; DFS log\u2013rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001; HR\u00a0=\u00a04.38, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u201310). Patients with cCR who were WT1-positive had the same negative outcome as those with a cytological evidence of disease. The relapse rate after allo-SCT was 9% (3/33) in pre-allo-SCT WT1-negative cases and 54% (7/13) in WT1-positive cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). At multivariate analysis, WT1 negativity before allo-SCT and grade <2 acute graft versus host disease were the only independent prognostic factors for improved OS and DFS. These data show that pre-allo-SCT molecular MRD evaluation through WT1 expression is a powerful predictor of posttransplantation outcomes (OS, DFS, relapse rate). Patients with both cCR and a WT1-negative marker before allo-SCT have a very good outcome with very low relapse rate; conversely, patients with positive molecular MRD and refractory/relapsed patients have a negative outcome. The WT1 MRD stratification in FLT3-positive AML is a valuable tool with which to identify patients who are at high risk of relapse and that could be considered from post-allo-SCT prophylaxis with FLT3 inhibitors or other strategies (donor lymphocyte infusion, tapering of immunosuppression, azacitidine).",

While the pathobiology underlying this ratio is unknown, the hematopoietic system is characterized by sex-related differences in androgen receptor (AR) expression, leading us to hypothesize that the male-biased incidence of MCL may reflect sex-related differences in AR signaling during MCL lymphomagenesis. To explore the AR axis in MCL, we evaluated AR expression in MCL cell lines and human tumors, and tested the impact of androgen pathway inhibition on MCL proliferation. AR transcript levels ranged up to ~26 fold higher in MCL lines vs non-MCL NHL lines (p = 0.006) and were correlated with expression of the canonical AR-regulated gene, prostate-specific antigen (PSA; r = 0.715, p = 0.001), consistent with functional AR activity. Patient-derived MCL samples demonstrated a range of AR expression. Treatment of four different MCL lines with the potent AR antagonist enzalutamide demonstrated suppression of proliferation across both male and female-derived cell lines. These data suggest androgen-axis blockade may represent a novel therapeutic modality in MCL. This novel treatment approach is currently under investigation in a phase II clinical trial of AR inhibition in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.",

In a knockout mouse model, Trib3 disruption modestly increased steady-state erythrocyte numbers and decreased mean corpuscular volume. Following 5-fluorouracil myeloablation, however, rebound red blood cell production and hemoglobin levels were substantially (and selectively) compromised in Trib3\u2212/\u2212 mice versus Trib3+/+ congenic controls. Erythrocytes from 5-fluorouracil-treated Trib3\u2212/\u2212 mice additionally were more prone to lysis and exhibited elevated peroxide-induced reactive oxygen species. Ex\u00a0vivo, the development of CD71posTer119pos erythroblasts from Trib3\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow progenitors was attenuated, and this was associated with heightened EPO-dependent Erk1/2 activation and moderately increased Akt activation. For developmentally staged EPCs, gene profiling provided further initial insight into candidate mediators of EPO-induced Trib3 gene expression, including Cebp-beta, Atf4, Egr-1, and Nab1.

Although typical RSs were not observed, increased mitochondrial ferritin (FTMT) amounts were observed in the erythroblasts of Tet2-knockdown mice.

Some of these pathway inhibitors selectively induce megakaryocyte differentiation, suppress malignant proliferation, and promote polyploidization and proplatelet formation. Moreover, combining sets of these inhibitors may be an effective approach to treat and potentially cure MPN patients. For example, preclinical studies reported significant synergistic effects of the combination of an Aurora A inhibitor and JAK1/2 inhibitor, in a murine model of the primary myelofibrosis. Future basic and clinical research into the contributions of these signaling pathways to aberrant megakaryopoiesis may lead to novel effective treatments for MPN patients.",

Interest in prevention of GvHD by dendritic cell (DC) suppression has re-emerged since the introduction of proteasome inhibitors into clinical practice. Ixazomib is an orally bioavailable proteasome inhibitor with a rapid proteasome dissociation rate. We studied the effects of ixazomib on human DC maturation, viability, and cytokine production in\u00a0vitro. We also determined the effects of ixazomib in a murine GvHD model. Although ixazomib suppressed na\u00efve human DC maturation, it had only a limited effect on cell viability. Ixazomib decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production of resting DCs. This effect was diminished or reversed when DCs were pre-stimulated. In\u00a0vivo, ixazomib administered post-transplantation on days +1 and\u00a0+4 or days \u22121, +2, and +5 ameliorated GvHD in comparison to the GvHD group. Although a fraction of mice treated according to the prolonged schedule died abruptly after the day +5 treatment, both schedules resulted in improved overall survival.

In this study, we found that human primitive HSPCs (CD34+CD38\u2212), but not lineage-committed hematopoietic cell populations, express the tyrosine kinase receptors EphA5 and EphA7. Moreover, we found that the ephrinA5 ligand, the high-affinity binding partner of EphA5 and EphA7, is highly expressed by primary human BMSCs. Previous studies have reported that interactions between EphA and ephrinA play important roles in hematopoietic cell trafficking; however, their role in BMSC support of hematopoiesis had not been described previously. Herein, we show that stimulating EphA5 and/or EphA7 forward signaling in HSPCs using soluble ephrinA5-Fc molecules promoted human HSPC-derived colony formation significantly and was associated with increased expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor on HSPCs. Studies using functional blocking peptides to EphA5/7 found that disruption of EphA5/ephrinA5 and/or EphA7/ephrinA5 interactions inhibited HSPC function in BMSC-dependent long-term culture-initiating cell assays. Furthermore, the adhesion and migration of HSPCs was increased significantly in the presence of ephrinA5-Fc molecules compared with human immunoglobulin G-treated controls. Conversely, blocking EphA5 activation led to a reduction of HSPC adhesion, whereas inhibiting EphA5 and/or EphA7 activation hindered HSPC migration. Analysis of HSPC cultured in the presence of ephrinA5-Fc showed that EphA forward signaling stimulated Rac1 gene and protein expression and the Rac1 target molecule WAVE1. Moreover, a significant reduction of ephrinA5-mediated HSPC adhesion and migration was observed in the presence of Rac1 inhibitor. These findings suggest that interactions between EphA and ephrinA5 are important in maintaining the HSPC niche mediated in part by activation of Rac1 signaling.",

Although the exhaustion of the bone marrow leads to cytopenias in FA patients as they age, evidence from human FA and mouse model fetal livers suggests that hematopoietic defects originate in utero, which may lead to deficient seeding of the bone marrow. To address this possibility, we examined the consequences of loss of Fancd2, a central component of the FA pathway. Examination of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) Fancd2 knockout (KO) fetal livers showed a decrease in total cellularity and specific declines in long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC and ST-HSC, respectively) numbers. Fancd2 KO fetal liver cells display similar functional defects to Fancd2 adult bone marrow cells, including reduced colony-forming units, increased mitomycin C sensitivity, increased LT-HSC apoptosis, and heavily impaired competitive repopulation, implying that these defects are intrinsic to the fetal liver and are not dependent on the accumulation of DNA damage during aging. Telomere shortening, an aging-related mechanism proposed to contribute to HSC apoptosis and bone marrow failure in FA, was not observed in Fancd2 KO fetal livers. In summary, loss of Fancd2 yields significant defects to fetal liver hematopoiesis, particularly the HSC population, which mimics key phenotypes from adult Fancd2 KO bone marrow independently of aging-accrued DNA damage.",

The most common MLL mutation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosome translocation that fuses MLL in-frame with the AF4 gene producing MLL-AF4 and AF4-MLL fusion proteins. Previously, we found that MLL-AF4 binds to the BCL-2 gene and directly activates it through DOT1L recruitment and increased H3K79me2/3 levels. In the study described here, we performed a detailed analysis of MLL-AF4 regulation of the entire BCL-2 family. By measuring nascent RNA production in MLL-AF4 knockdowns, we found that of all the BCL-2 family genes, MLL-AF4 directly controls the active transcription of both BCL-2 and MCL-1 and also represses BIM via binding of the polycomb group repressor 1 (PRC1) complex component CBX8. We further analyzed MLL-AF4 activation of the BCL-2 gene using Capture-C and identified a BCL-2-specific enhancer, consisting of two clusters of H3K27Ac at the 3\u2032 end of the gene. Loss of MLL-AF4 activity results in a reduction of H3K79me3 levels in the gene body and H3K27Ac levels at the 3\u2032 BCL-2 enhancer, revealing a novel regulatory link between these two histone marks and MLL-AF4-mediated activation of BCL-2.",

Although cell-intrinsic activities of MYSM1 within the hematopoietic cells are known to play an important role in hematopoietic homeostasis, Mysm1 expression is also widely observed in non-hematopoietic cells, and MYSM1 is implicated as an important regulator of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, osteoblast function, and adipogenesis within the bone marrow. In this work we for the first time test the roles of Mysm1 within the non-hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow niche in the maintenance of HSCs and hematopoietic homeostasis. For this purpose, wild-type mouse bone marrow was transplanted into Mysm1fl/flTg.CreERT2 recipient mice, followed by tamoxifen-induced ablation of Mysm1 specifically within the non-hematopoietic cells of the recipient. HSC functions and hematopoiesis in these chimeras, with wild-type HSCs and a Mysm1-deficient bone marrow environment, are characterized in the current work. We report that the selective deletion of Mysm1 in non-hematopoietic cells did not affect HSC maintenance and differentiation, with the mice maintaining the normal number and viability of HSCs, diverse hematopoietic progenitors, and mature hematopoietic and immune cell types. Overall we conclude that Mysm1 expression within the niche is not essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis.",

In contrast, the Polycomb group protein BMI1 (PCGF4) is part of the transcriptionally repressive PRC1 complex. Despite their opposing effects on transcription, MOZ and BMI1 regulate biological systems in a similar manner. MOZ and BMI1 are required for the development of transplantable HSCs, for restraining cellular senescence, for the proper patterning of the anterior\u2013posterior axis during development and for the specification and maintenance of the B-cell lineage. Thus, we set out to explore the relationship between MOZ and BMI1.

We report here the relationship between MOZ and BMI1 in hematopoiesis.

Recent experimental mouse modeling of B-progenitor ALL has shown that IKZF1 alterations have multiple effects, including arresting differentiation, skewing lineage of leukemia from myeloid to lymphoid, and, in Ph+\u00a0leukemia, conferring resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy without abrogating ABL1 inhibition. These effects are in part mediated by acquisition of an aberrant hematopoietic stem cell-like program accompanied by induction of cell surface expression of stem cell and adhesion molecules that mediate extravascular invasion and residence in the niche and activation of integrin signaling pathways. These effects can be exploited therapeutically using several approaches. IKZF1 alterations also result in upregulation of RXRA that encodes part of the heterodimeric retinoic acid X receptor. Rexinoids, a synthetic class of retinoids that bind specifically to retinoid \u201cX\u201d receptors such as bexarotene potently reverse aberrant adhesion and niche mislocalization in\u00a0vivo and induce differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Focal adhesion kinase inhibitors block the downstream integrin-mediated signaling, reverse adhesion, and niche mislocalization. Both agents act synergistically with TKIs to prolong survival of Ph+\u00a0ALL in mouse and human xenograft model, with long-term remission induced by focal adhesion kinase inhibitors. Therefore, these findings provide important new conceptual insights into the mechanisms by which IKZF1 alterations result in drug resistance and indicate that therapeutic strategies directed against the pathways deregulated by mutation, rather than attempting to restore IKZF1 expression directly, represent promising therapeutic approaches in this disease.",

Here, we use B-cell receptors (BCRs) as molecular barcodes to first show by single-cell BCR sequencing that the great majority of CD5low B\u00a0cells in the blood of CLL patients are clonally related to CD5high CLL B\u00a0cells.

Using statistical methods, we show that there is no parsimonious route from a single or low number of CD5low switch events to the CD5high population, but rather, large-scale and/or dynamic switching between these CD5 states is the most likely explanation. The overlapping BCR repertoires between CD5high and CD5low cells from CLL patient peripheral blood reveal that CLL exists in a continuum of CD5 expression.

In\u00a0vivo tumor growth in B-NHL-xenografted nonobese diabetic severe combined immune deficient (NOD-scid) gamma (NSG) mice was monitored by tumor volume, cell number, and survival. CB MNCs cultured with MODK562 compared with WTK562 demonstrated significantly increased NK expansion (thirty-fivefold, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); LAMP-1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), granzyme B, and perforin expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and in\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity against B-NHL (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Xenografted mice treated with MODK562 CB experienced significantly decreased B-NHL tumor volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0086) and B-NHL cell numbers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) at 5\u00a0weeks and significantly increased survival (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) at 10\u00a0weeks compared with WTK562. In summary, MODK562 significantly enhanced CB NK expansion and cytotoxicity, enhanced survival in a human Burkitt's lymphoma xenograft NSG model, and could be used in the future as adoptive cellular immunotherapy after umbilical CB transplantation. Future directions include expanding anti-CD20 chimeric receptor-modified CB NK cells to enhance B-NHL targeting in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.",

In this study, we evaluated the effect of LEN on the differentiation, maturation, and function of dendritic cells (DCs) in patients with multiple myeloma in\u00a0vitro. Various doses of LEN were added after the monocytes had differentiated into immature DCs and were activated into mature DCs. LEN (5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was the optimal concentration to promote differentiation and maturation of DCs. Immature DCs treated with LEN exhibited enhanced endocytic capacity. Mature DCs treated with LEN produced higher levels of interleukin-12p70, possessed stronger allogeneic T-cell stimulation capacity, reduced the number of suppressor cells, and generated antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes more potently compared with control DCs. These results suggest that LEN enhanced the function of DCs generated from patients with multiple myeloma by stimulating the capacity of allogeneic T cells, inhibiting the generation of immunosuppressive cells, inducing na\u00efve T cells toward Th1 polarization, and generating potent myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

The oncogenic microRNA miR-17-92 modulates multiple cellular processes such as survival, proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and BCR signaling. In the present study, we identified new targets of miR-17-92, PTPROt (protein phosphatase, receptor type O, truncated) and PP2A (protein phosphatase 2A) phosphatases, which regulate the activity of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and AKT, critical components of BCR signal transduction in DLBCL cells. Introduction of miR-17-92 into DLBCL cells dampened the expression of the PTPROt and PP2A regulatory subunits PPP2R2A (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, alpha) and PPP2R5E (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, epsilon isoform) and increased the magnitude of SYK and AKT phosphorylation upon BCR ligation. Finally, we found that miR-17-92 expression modulates response to inhibitors of BCR signaling because downregulation of miR-17-92 increased SYK inhibitor-mediated toxicity in DLBCL cells. Our study reveals novel posttranscriptional regulatory pathways that contribute to the deregulation of BCR signaling and modulate SYK inhibitor activity in DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is controlled principally through erythropoietin (Epo) receptor signaling, which involves Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and Lyn tyrosine kinase, both of which are important for regulating red blood cell (RBC) development. Negative regulation of Lyn involves C-Src kinase (Csk)-mediated phosphorylation of its C-terminal tyrosine, which is facilitated by the transmembrane adaptor Csk-binding protein (Cbp). Although Cbp has significant functions in controlling Lyn levels and activity in erythroid cells in\u00a0vitro, its importance to primary erythroid cell development and signaling has remained unclear. To address this, we assessed the consequence of loss of Cbp on the erythroid compartment in\u00a0vivo and whether Epo-responsive cells isolated from Cbp-knockout mice exhibited altered signaling. Our data show that male Cbp\u2212/\u2212 mice display a modest but significant alteration to late erythroid development in bone marrow with evidence of increased erythrocytes in the spleen, whereas female Cbp\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit a moderate elevation in early erythroid progenitors (not seen in male mice) that does not influence the later steps in RBC development. In isolated primary erythroid cells and cell lines generated from Cbp\u2212/\u2212 mice, survival signaling through Lyn/Akt/FoxO3 was elevated, resulting in sustained viability during differentiation. The high Akt activity disrupted GAB2/SHP-2 feedback inhibition of Lyn; however, the elevated Lyn activity also increased inhibitory signaling via SHP-1 to restrict the Erk1/2 pathway. Interestingly, whereas loss of Cbp led to mild changes to late RBC development in male mice, this was not apparent in female Cbp\u2212/\u2212 mice, possibly due to their elevated estrogen, which is known to facilitate early progenitor self-renewal.",

Therefore, HSCs are therapeutically valuable for treatment of hematological malignances and bone marrow failure. We showed recently that transient glucose elevation elicited dose-dependent effects on HSCs through elevated metabolic activity and subsequent reactive oxygen species-mediated induction of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1\u03b1 (Hif1\u03b1). Platelet-Derived Growth Factor B (pdgfb), a Hif1\u03b1-target, and its receptor, pdgfrb, were significantly upregulated in response to metabolic stimulation. Although the function of PDGF signaling is well established in vascular development, its role in hematopoiesis is less understood. Exposure to either a pan-PDGF inhibitor or a PDGFR\u03b2-selective antagonist in the context of Hif1\u03b1 stimulation blocked elevations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) formation as determined by runx1;cmyb whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and HSPC-reporter flow cytometry analysis. Similar results were observed for morpholino (MO) knockdown of pdgfrb or dominant-negative pdgfrb expression, indicating that PDGFR\u03b2 signaling is a key downstream mediator of Hif1\u03b1-mediated induction of HSPCs. Notably, overexpression of Pdgfb ligand enhanced HSPC numbers in the aorta-gonado-mesonephros (AGM) at 36\u00a0hours postfertilization (hpf) and in the caudal hematopoietic tissue\u00a0at 48 hpf. A survey of known PDGF-B/PDGFR\u03b2 regulatory targets by expression analysis revealed a significant increase in inflammatory intermediates, including Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and its receptor (IL-6R). MO-mediated knockdown of il6 or chemical inhibition of IL-6R antagonized the effect of Pdgfb overexpression. Furthermore, epistatic analysis of IL-6/IL-6R function confirmed activity downstream of Hif1\u03b1. Together, these findings define a Hif1\u03b1-regulated signaling axis mediated through PBFGB/PDGFR\u03b2 and IL-6/IL-6R that acts to control embryonic HSPC production.",

We compared different clinical-grade large-scale expansion protocols for repetitive transfer of large numbers of Tregs in clinical trials for the prevention of acute and/or chronic GvHD. Donor Tregs were isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) technology with good manufacturing practice-compliant devices. CD8 and CD19 depletion followed by CD25 enrichment resulted in the isolation of CD4+CD25+CD127\u2212 Tregs with a mean purity of 77%. Cell populations were expanded ex\u00a0vivo using X-Vivo 15 (\u00b1rapamycin), TexMACS (\u00b1rapamycin), and CellGro DC (\u00b1rapamycin) in the presence of interleukin-2.

The suppressive capacity of the expanded Treg population was maintained under all conditions investigated. Our data suggest that expansion with CellGro provides data comparable to those obtained with TexMACS or X-Vivo 15 with rapamycin, although all three conditions did not provide the same propagation rate as X-Vivo 15 alone.

The leukemic cells in the mice had myeloid morphology, phenotypes, and genotypes (including the internal tandem duplication of FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 gene [FLT3-ITD]) similar to those of the original patient. Autocrine mechanisms of human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-3 likely support AM7577 growth in mice. Treatment with FLT3 TKI (AC220) caused complete remission in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone, along with relief of symptoms and extended life, hinting that FLT3-ITD may be a key leukemogenic driver maintaining the disease. Interestingly, withdrawal of AC220 (high dose) did not result in relapse of disease, suggesting cure. These results, however, are in contrast to cytarabine (AraC) induction treatment: First, although AraC significantly suppresses the diseases in blood, and to a lesser degree in bone marrow and spleen, the suppression is temporary and does not prevent eventual onset of disease/death. Second, the withdrawal of AraC always resulted in rapid relapse in peripheral blood and eventually death.

The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT is expressed by hematopoietic stem and precursor cells. Gain-of-function mutations of KIT cause systemic mastocytosis, which is characterized by abnormal accumulations of mast cells. We previously reported a mouse model of mastocytosis based on conditional expression of a constitutively active Kit protein. Half of these animals developed leukemic disease of B-lineage origin. Herein, we report that this condition bears striking similarities to human B-ALL. The immuno-phenotype of the leukemic cells was compatible with a pro-B-cell origin, as was the finding of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements in all cases, whereas light-chain loci were mostly not rearranged. Leukemogenesis was independent of pre-B-cell receptor expression. Primary leukemic cells and permanent cell lines derived from these were serially transplantable and rapidly killed the recipients. In a few animals, the leukemia was of T-cell origin with abnormal CD4/8 double-positive T-cell precursors dominating in the circulation.

FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 with internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), an important oncoprotein in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias, causes activation of AKT and, subsequently, stabilization of p22phox, a regulatory subunit for NOX1-4. This process is linked to ROS formation and DNA damage. Moreover, FLT3-ITD signaling through STAT5 enhances expression of NOX4, ROS formation, and inactivation of the protein\u2013tyrosine phosphatase DEP-1/PTPRJ, a negative regulator of FLT3 signaling, by reversible oxidation of its catalytic cysteine residue. Genetic inactivation of NOX4 restores DEP-1 activity and attenuates cell transformation by FLT3-ITD in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.

For many years, only those rare AML cells characterized by a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) CD34+CD38\u2013 phenotype were believed capable of generating leukemia in immunocompromised mice. However, more recently, significant heterogeneity in the phenotypes of those AML cells that can engraft immunocompromised mice has been demonstrated.

A recent study found that the most immature phenotype present in an AML correlated with genetically defined risk groups and outcomes, but was heterogeneous. Patients with AML cells expressing a primitive HSC phenotype (CD34+CD38\u2013 with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity) manifested significantly lower complete remission rates, as well as poorer event-free and overall survivals. Leukemias in which the most primitive cells displayed more mature phenotypes were associated with better outcomes. The strong clinical correlations suggest that the most immature phenotype detectable within a patient's AML might serve as a biomarker for \u201cclinically relevant\u201d LSCs.",

In cultures of normal sources, SB431542 significantly increased by 2.5-fold the number of progenitor cells generated by days 1\u20132 (CD34+) and 6 (colony-forming cells) (CB) and that of precursor cells, mostly immature erythroblasts, by days 14\u201317 (AB and CB). In cultures of JAK2V617F+-PV, SB431542 increased by twofold the numbers of progenitor cells by day 10 and had no effect on that of precursors cells by days 12\u201317 (\u223cfourfold increase in all cases). In contrast, SB431542 had no effect on the number of either progenitor or precursor cells in cultures of JAK2V617F+ and CALR pQ365fs+ PMF. These ontogenetic- and disease-specific effects were associated with variegation in the ability of SB431542 to induce CD34+ cells from AB (increased), CB (decreased), or PV and PMF (unaffected) into cycle and erythroblasts in proliferation (increased for AB and PV and unaffected for CB and PMF). Differences in expansion of erythroblasts from AB, CB, and PV were associated with differences in activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling (SHCY317, SMAD2S245/250/255, and SMAD1S/S/SMAD5S/S/SMAD8S/S) detectable in these cells by phosphoproteomic profiling.

     "abstract": "Metformin suppresses the growth of a variety of malignant hematologic cells. It is widely accepted that metformin inhibits the growth of malignant cells primarily by suppressing the mTOR pathway or regulating autophagy. In contrast, we found another possible mechanism that inhibits the growth of malignant cells, suppression of the activity of the oncogenic kinase JAK2V617F. We identified at least two distinct mechanisms involved in metformin-induced JAK2V617F inhibition. First, metformin increases reactive oxygen species levels in these cells, leading to the inhibition of SHP-2, a positive regulator of JAK2V617F. These effects of metformin require AMPK. Second, metformin activates protein tyrosine phosphatase PP2A, a negative regulator of JAK2V617F. Furthermore, we determined that among the numerous PP2A subfamily members, the PP2A complex containing the B56\u03b1 subunit is responsible for the inhibition of JAK2V617F. In contrast, the B56\u03b1-containing PP2A complex functions as a positive regulator of JAK2V617F by inhibiting AMPK. Finally, we determined that metformin enhances the antileukemic action of ruxolitinib in HEL and SET-2\u00a0cells. Our present observations suggest that the combination of metformin with ruxolitinib might be a new therapeutic option for treating JAK2V617F-induced myeloproliferative neoplasms. In addition, activators specific for PP2A complexes containing the B56\u03b1 subunit may be useful\u00a0for the treatment of JAK2V617F-induced myeloproliferative neoplasms.",

To determine the role of ASXL1 loss in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, cord blood CD34+ cells were transduced with independent small hairpin interfering RNA lentiviral vectors against ASXL1 and cultured under myeloid and erythroid permissive conditions. Knockdown of ASXL1 led to a significant reduction in stem-cell frequency and a reduced cell expansion along the myeloid lineage. Cell expansion along the erythroid lineage was also reduced significantly and was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells throughout differentiation and by an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Bone marrow stromal cells supported the growth of immature erythroid cells, but did not alter the adverse phenotype of ASXL1 knockdown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed no loss of H3K27me3 in myeloid progenitor cells, but demonstrated a loss of H3K27me3 on the HOXA and the p21 locus in erythroid progenitors.

The protumorigenic effects of heparanase are enhanced by the release of heparan sulfate side chains, with subsequent increase in bioactive fragments and cytokine levels that promote tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Preclinical experiments have found heparanase inhibitors to substantially reduce tumor growth and metastasis, leading to clinical trials with heparan sulfate mimetics.

To demonstrate this, we analyzed the outcomes of 200 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HSCT after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). The analysis focused on T-cell content of peripheral blood stem-cell grafts. We found that higher graft CD8+ T-cell dose (CD8hi), a trait found only in grafts collected from young donors, was associated with improved survival due to a reduction in the risk for cancer relapse without a significant increase in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Though not all young donors mobilized CD8hi grafts, we found that a low CD4:CD8 ratio in the peripheral blood could identify these ideal donors prior to transplant. The likelihood of finding CD8hi donors correlated inversely with age, and elderly RIC transplant recipients had a low chance of receiving an ideal graft from their similarly aged siblings. Here, we examine these findings and their implications on choosing donors according to age and relatedness. We also explore biological mechanisms that determine the CD4:CD8 ratio in healthy donors.",

The population studied included 133 cases and 3,894 controls, and a total of 153,978 autosomal markers and 971 non-autosomal markers were genotyped. After association analysis, only one variant passed the genome-wide significance threshold: rs71325459 (p\u00a0=\u00a01.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212), which is situated on chromosome 20. The variant is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs35640778, an untested missense variant situated in the RTEL1\u00a0gene, an interesting candidate that encodes for an ATP-dependent DNA helicase implicated in telomere-length regulation, DNA repair, and maintenance of genomic stability. The second most associated signal is composed of five variants that fall slightly below the genome-wide significance threshold but point out another interesting gene candidate. These SNPs, with p values between 2.53\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 and 3.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, are situated in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. The most associated of these variants, rs1537514, presents an increased frequency of the derived C allele in cases, with 11.4% versus 4.4% in controls. MTHFR is the rate-limiting enzyme in the methyl cycle and genetic variations in this gene have been strongly associated with the risk of neoplastic diseases. The current understanding of the MDS biology, which is based on the hypothesis of the sequential development of multiple subclonal molecular lesions, fits very well with the demonstration of a possible role for RTEL1 and MTHFR gene polymorphisms, both of which are related to a variable risk of genomic instability.",

Here we report that expression of JAK2 V617F in murine fetal liver Epo-dependent progenitors allows them to divide approximately six rather than the normal approximately four times in the presence of Epo, delaying their exit from the cell cycle.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios and telomere length (TL) were measured in all individuals by polymerase chain reaction. Sequencing of epigenetic regulator genes (including TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, and WT1) was performed in the two older subcohorts. We found that global 5hmC levels declined with age in human blood cells (27.5% reduction from birth to old age, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). The levels of 5mC underwent a more modest reduction (2.4% drop) between newborns and the elderly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). Low 5hmC was associated with increased skewing of XCI (age-adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.0304) and reduced TL (age-adjusted p\u00a0=\u00a00.0354), both surrogate markers of clonal dominance.

Individuals with TET2 mutations had significantly lower 5hmC (relative to unmutated individuals), whereas DNMT3A-mutated subjects did not. However, mutations in TET2 cannot account solely for the decline in 5hmC levels observed with aging because unmutated older individuals also had lower 5hmC levels compared with younger individuals. This suggests that the age-associated decline in 5hmC is multifactorial. Larger prospective studies are needed to determine whether 5hmC reduction is a biomarker of hematological cancer development.",

Here, we investigated whether these cells can produce the thin F-actin-based plasma membrane protrusions referred to as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which are known to bridge cells over long distances without contact with the substratum and transfer cargo molecules along them in various biological processes. We found that human primary CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and leukemic KG1a cells develop such structures upon culture on primary mesenchymal stromal cells or specific extracellular-matrix-based substrata. Time-lapse video microscopy revealed that cell dislodgement is the primary mechanism responsible for TNT biogenesis. Surprisingly, we found that, among various cluster of differentiation (CD) markers, only the stem cell antigen CD133 is transferred between cells. It is selectively and directionally transported along the surface of TNTs in small clusters, such as cytoplasmic phospho-myosin light chain 2, suggesting that the latter actin motor protein might be implicated in this process. Our data provide new insights into the biology of hematopoietic progenitors that can contribute to our understanding of all facets of intercellular communication in the bone marrow microenvironment under healthy or cancerous conditions.",

     "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and blood cell transfusions are performed commonly in patients with a variety of blood disorders. Unfortunately, these donor-derived cell therapies are constrained due to limited supplies, infectious risk factors, a lack of appropriately matched donors, and the risk of immunologic complications from such products. The use of autologous cell therapies has been proposed to overcome these shortcomings. One can derive such therapies directly from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells of individuals, which can then be manipulated ex\u00a0vivo to produce the desired modifications or differentiated to produce a particular target population. Alternatively, pluripotent stem cells, which have a theoretically unlimited self-renewal capacity and an ability to differentiate into any desired cell type, can be used as an autologous starting source for such manipulation and differentiation approaches. Such cell products can also be used as a delivery vehicle for therapeutics. In this review, we highlight recent advances and discuss ongoing challenges for the in\u00a0vitro generation of autologous hematopoietic cells that can be used for cell therapy.",

Among others, the DNA damage theory of aging of HSCs is well established, based on the detection of a significantly larger amount of \u03b3H2AX foci and a higher tail moment in the comet assay, both initially thought to be associated with DNA damage in aged HSCs compared with young cells, and bone marrow failure in animals devoid of DNA repair factors. Novel data on the increase in and nature of DNA mutations in the hematopoietic system with age, the quality of the DNA damage response in aged HSCs, and the nature of \u03b3H2AX foci question a direct link between DNA damage and the DNA damage response and aging of HSCs, and rather favor changes in epigenetics, splicing-factors or three-dimensional architecture of the cell as major cell intrinsic factors of HSCs aging. Aging of HSCs is also driven by a strong contribution of aging of the niche. This review discusses the DNA damage theory of HSC aging in the light of these novel mechanisms of aging of HSCs.",

Although splenectomy may raise platelet counts, antibody-coated platelets and cytotoxic T lymphocytes appear to persist or can change over time. To better understand how the spleen may affect anti-platelet immune responses, we used a murine model of ITP demonstrating both antibody-mediated and T lymphocyte-mediated thrombocytopenia. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were either splenectomized or not and transfused with splenocytes from CD61 (GPIIIa) knockout mice immunized against CD61+ platelets. Platelet counts and anti-platelet antibody levels were performed weekly. After 4\u00a0weeks, the mice were sacrificed, and lymphoid organs were harvested and examined by flow cytometry to quantify CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs and conventional cross-presenting XCR1+ and tolerizing SIRP\u03b1+ dendritic cells. The results indicate that compared with control non-splenectomized mice, thrombocytopenia was improved and anti-platelet antibody production was significantly diminished in all splenectomized mice that received immune splenocytes. Splenectomized SCID mice also had a marked reduction in Tregs in the thymus together with an increased proportion of both thymic dendritic cell subsets that correlated with increased platelet counts. Of interest, although splenectomy diminished anti-platelet antibody production and raised platelet counts, marrow megakaryocyte densities were still significantly reduced in mice that received immune splenocytes. These results suggest that the spleen in murine ITP not only is the primary site responsible for platelet destruction, but it also controls, to a significant extent, the antibody response against platelets and the migration patterns of lymphocyte subsets.",

The impact of intracellular glycine restriction after GlyT1 inhibition on hematopoiesis and iron regulation is not well established. We investigated the effects of a potent and selective inhibitor of GlyT1, bitopertin, on erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis in rats. GlyT1 inhibition significantly affected erythroid heme biosynthesis, manifesting as microcytic hypochromic regenerative anemia with a 20% steady-state reduction in hemoglobin. Reduced erythropoietic iron utilization was characterized by down-regulation of the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) on reticulocytes and modest increased iron storage in the spleen. Hepatic hepcidin expression was not affected. However, under the condition of reduced heme biosynthesis with reduced iron reutilization and increased storage iron, hepcidin at the lower and higher range of normal showed a striking role in tissue distribution of iron. Rapid formation of iron-positive inclusion bodies (IBs) was observed in circulating reticulocytes, with an ultrastructure of iron-containing polymorphic mitochondrial remnants. IB or mitochondrial iron accumulation was absent in bone marrow erythroblasts. In conclusion, GlyT1 inhibition in rats induced a steady-state microcytic hypochromic regenerative anemia and a species-specific accumulation of uncommitted mitochondrial iron in reticulocytes. Importantly, this glycine-restricted anemia provides no feedback signal for increased systemic iron acquisition and the effects reported are pathogenetically distinct from systemic iron-overload anemias and erythropoietic disorders such as acquired sideroblastic anemia.",

Conversely, p53 mutations are rare in leukemias and are only observed in a small fraction of the patient population, predominately in patients with complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia or hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the loss of p53 function in leukemic cells is often caused by abnormalities in p53-regulatory proteins, including overexpression of MDM2/MDMX, deletion of CDKN2A/ARF, and alterations in ATM. For example, MDM2 inhibits p53-mediated transcription, promotes its nuclear export, and induces proteasome-dependent degradation. The MDM2 homolog MDMX is another direct regulator of p53 that inhibits p53-mediated transcription. Several small-molecule inhibitors and stapled peptides targeting MDM2 and MDMX have been developed and have recently entered clinical trials. The clinical trial results of the first clinically used MDM2 inhibitor, RG7112, illustrated promising p53 activation and apoptosis induction in leukemia cells as proof of concept. Side effects of RG7112 were most prominent in suppression of thrombopoiesis and gastrointestinal symptoms in leukemia patients.

Cell surface CALR is known to transduce prophagocytic \u201ceat me\u201d signals to macrophages and acts as one of the important regulators for macrophage engulfment. In this study, we attempted to clarify whether mutant CALR may affect the threshold for macrophage engulfment and play an integral role in the pathogenesis of CALR-mutated ET. First, we compared the surface expression levels of CALR on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mature blood cells in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and found that the surface expression of mutant CALR did not change. Next, we compared the threshold for macrophage phagocytosis of each HSPC fraction and mature blood cells and found no significant change in the efficiency of macrophage engulfment. Our data suggest that CALR mutation does not affect sensitivity to phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, we analyzed the phosphorylation statuses of molecules downstream of JAK2 at each HSPC level in patients with ET and found that CALR mutations activated the JAK-STAT pathway in a manner similar to that associated with JAK2 mutations.

     "abstract": "SF3B1 (Splicing factor 3b, subunit 1) is one of the most commonly mutated factors in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the genetic correlation between SF3B1 mutations and MDS etiology are quite strong, no in\u00a0vivo model currently exists to explore how SF3B1 loss alters blood cell development. Using zebrafish mutants, we show here that proper function of Sf3b1 is required for all hematopoietic lineages. As in MDS patients, zebrafish sf3b1 mutants develop a macrocytic-anemia\u2013like phenotype due to a block in maturation at a late progenitor stage. The mutant embryos also develop neutropenia, because their primitive myeloid cells fail to mature and turn on differentiation markers such as l-plastin and myeloperoxidase. In contrast, production of definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from hemogenic endothelial cells within the dorsal aorta is greatly diminished, whereas arterial endothelial cells are correctly fated. Notch signaling, imperative for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition, is also normal, indicating that HSPC induction is blocked in sf3b1 mutants downstream or independent of Notch signaling. The data demonstrate that Sf3b1 function is necessary during key differentiation fate decisions in multiple blood cell types. Zebrafish sf3b1 mutants offer a novel animal model with which to explore the role of splicing in hematopoietic development and provide an excellent in\u00a0vivo system with which to delve into the question of why and how Sf3b1 dysfunction is detrimental to hematopoietic differentiation, which could improve MDS diagnosis and treatment.",

LMO2-overexpressing transgenic mouse models suggest an accumulation of immature T-cell progenitors in the thymus as the main preleukemic event. The effects of LMO2 overexpression on human T-cell development in\u00a0vivo are unknown. Here, we report studies of a humanized mouse model transplanted with LMO2-transduced human hematopoietic\u00a0stem/progenitor cells. The effects of LMO2 overexpression were confined to the T-cell lineage; however, initially, multipotent cells were transduced. Three effects of LMO2 on human T-cell development were observed: (1) a block at the double-negative/immature single-positive stage, (2) an accumulation of CD4+CD8+ double-positive CD3\u2013 cells, and (3) an altered CD8/CD4 ratio with enhanced peripheral T lymphocytes. Microarray analysis of sorted double-positive cells overexpressing LMO2 led to the identification of an LMO2 gene set that clustered with human T-ALL patient samples of the described \u201cproliferative\u201d cluster. In this article, we demonstrate previously unrecognized mechanisms by which LMO2 alters human T-cell development in\u00a0vivo; these mechanisms correlate with human T-ALL leukemogenesis.",

The majority of these mutations are in chromatin and epigenetic regulatory genes (CERGs). CERGs play a key role in regulation of DNA methylation (DNMT3A and TET2) and histone function (ASXL1) and in clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. We hypothesize that older women manifesting clonal hematopoiesis, defined here as a functional phenomenon in which a hematopoietic stem cell has acquired a survival and proliferative advantage, harbor a higher frequency of somatic mutations in CERGs. The human androgen receptor gene (HUMARA) assay was used in our study to detect the presence of nonrandom X inactivation in women, a marker for clonal hematopoiesis. In our pilot study, we tested 127 blood samples from women \u226565\u00a0years old without a history of invasive cancer or hematologic malignancies. Applying stringent qualitative criteria, we found that 26% displayed clonal hematopoiesis; 52.8% displayed polyclonal hematopoiesis; and 21.3% had indeterminate patterns (too close to call by qualitative assessment). Using Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing, we identified somatic mutations in CERGs in 15.2% of subjects displaying clonal hematopoiesis (three ASXL1 and two DNMT3A mutations with an average variant allele frequency of 15.7%, range: 6.3%\u201323.3%). In a more limited sequencing analysis, we evaluated the frequency of ASXL1 mutations by Sanger sequencing and found mutations in 9.7% of the clonal samples and 0% of the polyclonal samples. By comparing several recent studies (with some caveats as described), we determined the fold enrichment of detecting CERG mutations by using the HUMARA assay as a functional screen for clonal hematopoiesis. We conclude that a functional assay of clonal hematopoiesis is enriching for older women with somatic mutations in CERGs, particularly for ASXL1 and TET2 mutations and less so for DNMT3A mutations.",

However, the mechanism by which p18 regulates differentiation from HSCs to lymphoid cells is poorly understood. In this study, we found that a progenitor population characterized by its expression of surface markers, Lin\u2212 Sca-1+ c-Kitlow (LSKlow), was markedly expanded in the bone marrow of p18 knock-out (p18\u2212/\u2212) mice. This novel population possessed lymphoid differentiation potential, but not myeloid differentiation potential, both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Whereas LSKlow cells and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) overlapped functionally in generating lymphoid cells, they were distinct cell populations, because they had different gene expression profiles. Unlike CLPs, LSKlow cells did not express the interleukin-7 receptor. LSKlow cells were derived from HSCs and were independent of the p18-deleted microenvironment. This cell population may represent a previously unappreciated transitional stage from HSCs to lymphoid progenitors that is strictly restricted by p18 under physiological conditions.

Because of the lack of copy number change, aUPD is undetectable by comparative genome hybridization, so the magnitude of this genetic change was underappreciated in the past. 9p aUPD was first described in 2002 in patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Since then, systematic application of genomewide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays has indicated that 9p aUPD is the most common chromosomal aberration in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), contributing to discovery of the PV-defining mutation JAK2V617F21. It was also found in other myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, though at a relatively lower frequency. By leading to JAK2V617F 23 homozygosity, 9p aUPD plays a causal role in the development of PV and is also associated with less favorable clinical outcomes. It is also possible that new targets other than JAK2V617F 25 are present within 9p aUPD that may contribute to diversity of PV outcome and phenotype. This review summarizes recent discoveries on 9p aUPD in hematologic malignancies and discusses possible underlying mechanisms and potential roles of 9p aUPD in the pathogenesis of PV, the relationship between 9p aUPD and JAK2V617F29, and possible new cancer-related targets within the 9p aUPD region.",

Furthermore, in addition to shared effects, erythropoietin and thrombopoietin have additional independent effects.

Initially the delayed deaths were said to be caused by \u201csecondary disease,\u201d which was later renamed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). GvHD is caused by donor T lymphocytes that destroy recipient cells in skin, intestinal mucosa, bile ducts, and lymph nodes.

GATA2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and early erythroid-megakaryocytic progenitors and activates a certain set of early-phase genes, including the GATA2 gene itself. GATA2 also initiates GATA1 gene expression. In contrast, GATA1 is expressed in relatively mature erythroid progenitors and facilitates the expression of genes associated with differentiation, including the GATA1 gene itself; however, GATA1 represses the expression of GATA2. Switching the GATA factors from GATA2 to GATA1 appears to be one of the key regulatory mechanisms underlying erythroid differentiation. Loss-of-function analyses using mice in\u00a0vivo have indicated that GATA2 and GATA1 are functionally nonredundant and that neither can compensate for the absence of the other. However, transgenic expression of GATA2 under the transcriptional regulation of the Gata1 gene rescues lethal dyserythropoiesis in GATA1-deficient mice, illustrating that the dynamic expression profiles of these GATA factors are critically important for the maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis. Analysis of naturally occurring leukemias in GATA1-knockdown mice revealed that leukemic stem cells undergo functional alterations in response to exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. This mechanism may also underlie the aggravating features of relapsing leukemias. Recent hematologic analyses have suggested that disturbances in the balance of the GATA factors are associated with specific types of hematopoietic disorders.

The acquired mutation in DDX41 is highly concentrated at c.G1574A (p.R525H) in the conserved motif VI located at the C-terminus of the helicase core domain where ATP interacts and is hydrolyzed. Therefore, it is likely that the p.R525H mutation perturbs ATPase activity in a dominant-negative manner. In this study, we screened for the DDX41 mutation of CD34-positive tumor cells based on mRNA sequencing and identified the p.R525H mutation in three cases among 23 patients. Intriguingly, these patients commonly exhibited acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with peripheral blood cytopenias and low blast counts, suggesting that the mutation inhibits the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Data from cord blood cells and leukemia cell lines suggest a role for DDX41 in preribosomal RNA processing, in which the expression of the p.R525H mutant causes a certain ribosomopathy phenotype in hematopoietic cells by suppressing MDM2-mediated RB degradation, thus triggering the inhibition of E2F activity.

Compared with recombinant human EPO and darbepoietin, peginesatide exhibited a slow on rate, but sustained EPOR residency and resistant displacement. In EPO-dependent human erythroid progenitor UT7epo cells, culture in peginesatide unexpectedly upmodulated endogenous cell surface EPOR levels with parallel increases in full-length EPOR-68K levels. These unique properties are suggested to contribute to the durable activity of this (and perhaps additional) dimeric peptide hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonist.",

The signaling pathway leading to NF-\u03baB activation and translocation to the nucleus to exert its function as a transcription factor is well conserved among Kingdom Animalia, which has helped to elucidate other roles that NF-\u03baB plays in other biological contexts such as developmental biology. The manipulation of NF-\u03baB members in a diverse range of animal models results in severe developmental defects during embryogenesis, very often leading to embryonic lethality. Defects include dorsal\u2013ventral patterning and limb, liver, skin, lung, neural, notochord, muscle, skeletal, and hematopoietic defects. Here, we recapitulate the research that has been done to address the role that NF-\u03baB plays during embryonic development, in particular to emphasize its recently discovered role in the specification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the foundation of the hematopoietic system in vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "Over the past decade, stem cell gene therapy has achieved unprecedented curative outcomes for several genetic disorders. Despite the unequivocal success, clinical gene therapy still faces challenges. Genetically engineered hematopoietic stem cells are particularly vulnerable to attenuation of their repopulating capacity once exposed to culture conditions, ultimately leading to low engraftment levels posttransplant. This becomes of particular importance when transduction rates are low or/and competitive transplant conditions are generated by reduced-intensity conditioning in the absence of a selective advantage of the transduced over the unmodified cells. These limitations could partially be overcome by introducing megadoses of genetically modified CD34+ cells into conditioned patients or by transplanting hematopoietic stem cells hematopoietic stem cells with high engrafting and repopulating potential. On the basis of the lessons gained from cord blood transplantation, we summarize the most promising approaches to date of increasing either the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation or/and their engraftability, as a platform toward the optimization of engineered stem cell grafts.",

     "abstract": "The main hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, self-renewal and differentiation, are finely regulated by both intrinsic mechanisms such as transcriptional and epigenetic regulators and extrinsic signals originating in the bone marrow microenvironment (HSC niche) or in the body (humoral mediators). The interaction between regulatory signals and cellular metabolism is an emerging area. Several metabolic pathways function differently in HSCs compared with progenitors and differentiated cells. Hypoxia, acting through hypoxia-inducing factors, has emerged as a key regulator of stem cell biology and acts by maintaining HSC quiescence and a condition of metabolic dormancy based on anaerobic glycolytic energetic metabolism, with consequent low production reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high antioxidant defense. Hematopoietic cell differentiation is accompanied by changes in oxidative metabolism (decrease of anaerobic glycolysis and increase of oxidative phosphorylation) and increased levels of ROS. Leukemic stem cells, defined as the cells that initiate and maintain the leukemic process, show peculiar metabolic properties in that they are more dependent on oxidative respiration than on glycolysis and are more sensitive to oxidative stress than normal HSCs. Several mitochondrial abnormalities have been described in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, explaining the shift to aerobic glycolysis observed in these cells and offering the unique opportunity for therapeutic metabolic targeting. Finally, frequent mutations of the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) enzyme are observed in AML cells, in which the mutated enzyme acts as an oncogenic driver and can be targeted using specific inhibitors under clinical evaluation with promising results.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain lifelong blood cell regeneration by balancing their ability for self-renewal with their ability to differentiate into all blood cell types. To prevent organ exhaustion and malignant transformation, long-lived HSCs, in particular, must be protected from exogenous and endogenous stress, which cause severe DNA damage. When DNA is damaged, distinct DNA repair mechanisms and cell fate controls occur in adult HSCs compared with committed cells. Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 alpha (GADD45A) is known to coordinate a variety of cellular stress responses, indicating the molecule is an important stress mediator. So far, the function of GADD45A in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is controversial and appears highly dependent on the cell type and stress stimulus. Recent studies have analyzed its role in cell fate decision control of prospectively isolated HSCs and have revealed unexpected functions of GADD45A, as discussed here. The upregulation of GADD45A by DNA damage-causing conditions results in enhanced HSC differentiation, probably to efficiently eliminate aberrant HSCs from the system. These findings, in concert with a few studies on other stem cell systems, have led us to propose DNA damage-induced differentiation as a novel DNA damage response mechanism in stem cells that circumvents the fatal consequences of cumulative DNA damage in the stem cell compartment.",

At the same time, increasing numbers of patients are receiving reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) prior to hematopoietic stem cell infusion. In prior work using smaller patient numbers and limited data, RIC peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation was shown to be noninferior to RIC bone marrow (BM) transplantation for acute leukemia. A recent, large registry analysis from the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation showed that peripheral blood grafts result in superior outcomes compared with BM after RIC regimens for acute leukemia. The T-cell-replete PBSC allografts are associated with significant graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) benefits that are important drivers of improved leukemia-free survival and overall survival. However, an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after peripheral blood grafts is concerning and long-term follow-up comparing peripheral versus BM grafts after RIC regimens is needed. Further assessment of the long-standing risks should be undertaken in an effort to better understand whether the risk of cGVHD among peripheral blood graft recipients translates into continued GVL effects and long-term remissions and cures or if it results in late morbidity and mortality.",

     "abstract": "Reduced oxygen partial pressure (pO2) has been recognized as being relevant in hematopoiesis and the pathophysiology of malignant diseases. Although hypoxic (meaning insufficient supply of oxygen) and anoxic areas are present and of pathophysiologic importance (by\u00a0hypoxia-induced pathways such as HiF1\u03b1) in solid tumors, this may not be true for (malignant) hematologic cells. Hematopoiesis occurs in the stem cell niche, which is characterized, among other things, by extremely low pO2. However, in contrast to solid tumors, in this context, the low pO2 is physiological and this feature, among others, is shared by the malignant stem cell niche harboring leukemia-initiating cells. Upon differentiation, hematopoietic cells are constantly exposed to changes in pO2 as they travel throughout the human body and encounter arterial and venous blood and migrate into oxygen-carrier-free tissue with low pO2. Hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) make little difference in this respect and, whereas low oxygen is the usual environment of AML cells, recent evidence suggests no role for real hypoxia. Although there is no evidence that AML pathophysiology is related to hypoxia, leukemic blasts still show several distinct biological features when exposed to reduced pO2: they down- or upregulate membrane receptors such as CXCR4 or FLT3, activate or inhibit intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K, and specifically secrete cytokines (IL-8). In summary, reduced pO2 should not be mistaken for hypoxia (nor should it be so called), and it does not automatically induce hypoxia-response mechanisms; therefore, a strict distinction should be made between physiologically low pO2 (physoxia) and hypoxia.",

The GFI136N allele frequency in the 723 MDS patients genotyped ranged between 9% and 12%. GFI136N was an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival, acute myeloid leukemia-free survival, and event-free survival in a univariate analysis. After adjustment for age, bone marrow blast percentage, IPSS score, mutational status, and cytogenetic findings, GFI136N remained an independent adverse prognostic marker. GFI136S homozygous patients exhibited a sustained response to treatment with hypomethylating agents, whereas GFI136N patients had a poor sustained response to this therapy. Because allele status of GFI136N is readily determined using basic molecular techniques, we propose inclusion of GFI136N status in future prospective studies for MDS patients to better predict prognosis and guide therapeutic decisions.",

This is of potential interest for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, as NF-\u03baB signaling is emerging as a key pathway, mediating drug resistance and leukemia-initiating cell survival in AML. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling has been found to be synergistic with chemotherapy. TRPM2 is overexpressed in AML compared with normal bone marrow, with the highest levels in the FAB M3-6 subtypes. To determine the effect of TRPM2 depletions in a defined genetic model, we established MLL-AF9-driven AML on a Trpm2\u2212/\u2212 genetic background. Trpm2\u2212/\u2212 MLL-AF9 leukemias displayed reduced NF-\u03baB phosphorylation as well as nuclear translocation. In\u00a0vivo, primary and secondary recipients of Trpm2\u2212/\u2212 MLL-AF9 leukemias exhibit increased latency compared with recipients of wild-type leukemia cells. However, the difference in latency was small and was lost in tertiary transplants. The effect of loss of Trpm2 in a BCR-ABL/NUP98-HOXA9 fusion model was even smaller. Given reports that loss or inhibition of TRPM2 enhanced killing by DNA-damaging agents in neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines, we exposed Trpm2\u2212/\u2212 and Trpm2wt primary MLL-AF9 leukemias to doxorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide, but found no difference in IC50 values. The in\u00a0vitro response to decitabine was also unaffected. In summary, Trpm2 does not seem to\u00a0play a major role in myeloid leukemogenesis.

Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4\u00a0years later.

We explored where the BM microenvironment changes by determining BM stromal cell chimerism and measuring the change in CXCL-12 expression and regulatory T\u00a0cells in recipient BM. We found that most stromal cells were replaced by allogeneic cells in the injected BM, with higher expression of immune regulatory cytokines (interleukin-10) compared with the contralateral BM and the intravenous group BM.

Surgical removal of the injected bone at 7\u00a0days rather than 21\u00a0days reduced the levels of allogeneic granulocytes and HSCs in the peripheral blood. In conclusion, IBBMT specially modifies stromal cells in the injected BM which provide immune protective cues that improve the engraftment of allogeneic HSCs in an early period.",

Circulating microRNAs exhibit marked stability and may serve as biomarkers in several clinical settings. Here, we evaluated the use of circulating microRNAs as predictive biomarkers of aGVHD in lymphoma patients after allo-HSCT from matched unrelated donors (MUDs). After receiving informed consent, we prospectively collected plasma samples from 24 lymphoma patients before and after unmanipulated MUD allo-HSCT; microRNAs were then isolated. Fourteen patients developed aGVHD symptoms at a median of 48\u00a0days (range: 32\u201390) post-transplantation. Two patients developed intestinal GVHD, eight cutaneous GVHD, and four multiorgan GVHD. The microRNA expression profile was examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MicroRNAs 194 and 518f were significantly upregulated in aGVHD samples compared with samples taken from non-aGVHD patients. Remarkably, these upregulated microRNAs could be detected before the onset of aGVHD. Pathway prediction analysis indicated that these microRNAs may regulate critical pathways involved in aGVHD pathogenesis. Considering the noninvasive characteristics of plasma sampling and the feasibility of detecting miRNAs after allo-HSCT using real-time polymerase chain reaction, our results indicate that circulating microRNAs have the potential to enable an earlier aGVHD diagnosis and might assist in individualizing therapeutic strategies after MUD allo-HSCT.

The PRMTs are capable of modifying diverse substrates, from histone components to specific nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Additionally, the PRMTs can orchestrate chromatin remodeling by blocking the docking of other epigenetic modifying enzymes or by recruiting them to specific gene loci. In the hematopoietic system, PRMTs can regulate cell behavior, including the critical balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, in at least two critical ways, via (i) the covalent modification of transcription factors and (ii) the regulation of histone modifications at promoters critical to cell fate determination.

Acanthopanax senticosus, a naturally occurring herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been found to be a multipotent bioflavonoid with great potential in the prevention and treatment of malignant diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the action of A. senticosus in epigenetic regulation is poorly understood. In the study described here, we focused on the efficacy of A.\u00a0senticosus in inducing apoptosis of leukemia cells and a possible mechanism. By evaluating the inhibition ratio and morphologic changes, we found that A. senticosus can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of human leukemia HL-60 and HL60/ADM cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, A. senticosus induced Fas ligand (FasL) expression and blocked the cell cycle in S phase. In addition, A. senticosus exhibited a potential for inhibition of histone deacetylase (HADC), which contributes to histone acetylation. It possibly resulted in the promotion of the expression of FasL. It is suggested that A. senticosus could be recognized as a new HDAC inhibitor which was able to reactivate aberrantly silenced genes. We discuss the clinical aspects of using A. senticosus for treatment of leukemia.",

We investigated whether spry2 could exert an antimyeloma effect and further studied the potential pathogenesis and progression of MM. To address the functional consequences of spry2, we assessed the expression levels of spry2 in several myeloma cell lines and detected low expression levels in MM\u00a0cells. Overexpression of spry2 suppressed growth and colony formation ability and decreased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2.

There are two sources of iron for erythropoiesis, dietary and stored iron; however, their relative contributions to erythropoiesis remain unknown. In this study, we used the stable iron isotope 57Fe to quantify synthesis of hemoglobin derived from dietary iron. Using this method, we investigated the activities of dietary iron absorption and the utilization of dietary iron for erythropoiesis in responses to stimulated erythropoiesis and to interventions to alter body iron status. Under iron-loaded conditions, the activity of dietary iron absorption was clearly lowered in response to up-regulation of hepcidin, although the estimated activity of iron release from stored iron was not compared with that under control conditions. This result was supported by the observation that two duodenal iron transporters, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin, were downregulated by iron loading, although the levels of expression of ferroportin in iron storage tissues were not changed by iron loading under erythropoietic stimulation by epoetin-\u03b2 pegol (C.E.R.A., a long-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agent). These results indicate that the dietary iron absorption system is more sensitive to body iron status than are reticuloendothelial iron- release mechanisms.

Because adult and fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) differ in their gene expression profile, differentiation capabilities, and cell surface marker expression, we were interested in whether the reported segregation of lineage potentials in adult human hematopoiesis would also apply to human fetal liver. CD133 expression was easily detected in human fetal liver cells, and the defined hematopoietic subpopulations were similar to those found for adult HSPCs. Fetal HSPCs were enriched for EMPs and HSCs/MPPs, which were primed toward erythromyeloid differentiation.

To test this, we used the B10.D2 \u2192 BALB/c model of CGVHD to address the therapeutic effect of roflumilast on the development of CGVHD. Lungs of animals treated with roflumilast exhibited less chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in the peribronchial and perivascular area versus allogeneic controls.

This study investigated the effects of high-dose treatment with autologous stem cell support on patients' innate immunity, with a focus on subpopulations and functioning of recently released polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and monocytes in peripheral blood. Flow cytometry-based analysis was used to measure the degree of PMN maturation and activation, before and after ASCT and compared with healthy controls. After high-dose treatment and ASCT, a smaller proportion of patients' PMNs had the capacity for oxidative burst. Moreover, patients' PMNs, both before and after ASCT, had a reduced capacity for phagocytosis. Eosinophils, which recently have been suggested to play a role in promoting malignant plasma cell proliferation, were markedly reduced after ASCT, with slow regeneration. HLA-DR expression by monocytes was significantly depressed after ASCT, a characteristic often attributed to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

This led us to a strategy of targeting BMECs with tubulin-binding combretastatins, causing BMECs to lose their flat phenotype, degrade their cytoskeleton, cease growth, and impair migration despite unchanged BMEC viability and metabolism. Combretastatins also caused downregulation of BMEC adhesion molecules known to tether AML cells, including vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. When AML\u2013BMEC co-cultures were treated with combretastatins, a significantly greater proportion of AML cells dislodged from BMECs and entered the G2/M cell cycle, suggesting enhanced susceptibility to cell cycle agents.

It is also in clinical trials for the treatment of other malignancies, including solid tumors. Despite its wide use, little is known of its effects on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Here, we study wild-type mice dosed with dasatinib and find that it causes the transient induction of proliferation of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This finding was unexpected given the ability of dasatinib to inhibit c-Kit signaling and promote cell cycle arrest in many cell types. The transient induction of HSC proliferation in dasatinib-dosed mice coincided with a marked induction in the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6. Also evident at this time was a rapid but transient loss of lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors that express high levels of c-Kit and the induction of stem cell factor in the serum. These findings suggest that activation of quiescent HSCs is part of a rapid rescue response that restores hematopoietic progenitors to pretreatment levels. This restoration coincides with HSCs returning to quiescence, and the expression of Sca-1 and phospho-S6 reverting to pre-treatment levels, even though dasatinib dosing is maintained. These data suggest that equilibrium is reached between the opposing forces of dasatinib and hematopoietic growth factors. The transient induction of HSC proliferation provided a window of opportunity whereby these cells became sensitive to killing by the cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil.",

The effects of IGF2 are mediated by direct upregulation of the CDKi p57, exclusively within long-term HSCs, via activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Increased expression of p57 resulted in a concomitant increase in HSCs in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle. Analysis of genomic DNA methylation revealed that HSCs exhibited a hypomethylated state within the promoter region of the CDKN1C (p57) gene, providing a potential mechanism for the exclusive effects of IGF2 within HSCs.

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function is required for balanced blood production throughout life; it is thus essential to understand the mechanisms regulating this highly dynamic process. Bone marrow-resident macrophages (M\u03d5s) have recently emerged as an important component of the HSC niche, where they contribute to regulating HSC and progenitor cell (HSPC) mobilization and function. Here we review the role of macrophages (M\u03d5s) on immune cell production, HSPC pool size, and mobilization at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. Inflammation induces marked changes in hematopoiesis to restrict or promote generation of specific cell lineages, and this often has a negative impact on HSC function. Cytokines and growth factors induced during inflammation influence hematopoiesis by acting directly on HSPCs and/or by modulating niche cell function. We focus particular attention on the opposing effects of two key inflammatory proteins, interferon-\u03b3 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, in regulating bone marrow-resident macrophages (M\u03d5s) and HSPCs. Macrophages (M\u03d5s) are essential for tissue homeostasis, and here we highlight their emerging role as a central regulator of both steady-state and demand-adapted hematopoiesis.",

We compared the anti-tumor effect of bortezomib alone and in combination with Treg expansion and statistically analyzed the measured differences with respect to the clinical parameters of the patients. Treg cells had varied effects on bortezomib, increasing, decreasing, or not changing its anti-tumor effect. The increased in\u00a0vitro anti-tumor effect of bortezomib after Treg cell expansion was correlated in patients who did not develop bortezomib resistance in\u00a0vivo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022).

     "abstract": "The MOZ-TIF2 translocation, which fuses monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) with the nuclear co-activator TIF2, is associated with the development of acute myeloid leukemia. We recently found that in the absence of MOZ HAT activity, p16INK4a transcriptional levels are significantly increased, triggering an early entrance into replicative senescence. Because oncogenic fusion proteins must bypass cellular safeguard mechanisms, such as senescence and apoptosis, to induce leukemia, we hypothesized that this repressive activity of MOZ over p16INK4a transcription could be preserved, or even reinforced, in MOZ leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as MOZ-TIF2. We describe here that, indeed, MOZ-TIF2 silences expression of the CDKN2A locus (p16INK4a and p19ARF), inhibits the triggering of senescence and enhances proliferation, providing conditions favorable to the development of leukemia. Furthermore, we describe that abolishing the MOZ HAT activity of the fusion protein leads to a significant increase in expression of the CDKN2A locus and the number of hematopoietic progenitors undergoing senescence. Finally, we report that inhibition of senescence by MOZ-TIF2 is associated with increased apoptosis, suggesting a role for the fusion protein in p53 apoptosis-versus-senescence balance. Our results underscore the importance of the HAT activity of MOZ, preserved in the fusion protein, for repression of the CDKN2A locus transcription and the subsequent block of senescence, a necessary step for the survival of leukemic cells.",

Resistance to treatment, intrinsic or acquired, is observed in approximately 40% of patients with DLBCL, who thus require novel interventions to survive. To identify biomarkers for cytotoxic response assessment, microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with doxorubicin sensitivity were determined by combining global miRNA expression profiling with systematic dose\u2013response screens in 15 human DLBCL cell lines. One candidate, miR-34a, was tested in functional in\u00a0vitro studies and in\u00a0vivo in a retrospective clinical cohort. High expression of miR-34a was observed in cell lines sensitive to doxorubicin, and upregulation of miR-34a is documented here to increase doxorubicin sensitivity in in\u00a0vitro lentiviral transduction assays. High expression of miR-34a had a prognostic impact using overall survival as outcome. With risk stratification of DLBCL samples based on resistance gene signatures (REGS), doxorubicin-responsive samples had statistically significant upregulated miR-34a expression. Classification of the DLBCL samples into subset-specific B\u00a0cell-associated gene signatures (BAGS) revealed differentiation-specific expression of miR-34a. Our data further support FOXP1 as a target of miR-34a, suggesting that downregulation of FOXP1 may sensitize DLBCL cells to doxorubicin. We conclude that miRNAs, in particular miR-34a, may have clinical utility in DLBCL patients as both predictive and prognostic biomarkers.",

Microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) mediate organization of the mitotic spindle apparatus that separates the chromosomes during mitosis and are known to be crucial for proper cytokinesis. However, the role of MTOCs in erythroblast enucleation remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effect of various MTOC inhibitors on cytokinesis and enucleation using human colony-forming units\u2013erythroid (CFU-Es) and mature erythroblasts generated from purified CD34+ cells. We found that erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenine (EHNA), a dynein inhibitor, and monastrol, a kinesin Eg5 inhibitor, as well as various inhibitors of MTOC regulators, including ON-01910 (Plk-1), MLN8237 (aurora A), hesperadin (aurora B), and LY294002 (PI3K), all inhibited CFU-E cytokinesis. Among these inhibitors, however, only EHNA blocked enucleation. Moreover, terminally differentiated erythroblasts expressed only dynein; little or none of the other tested proteins was detected. Over the course of the terminal differentiation of human erythroblasts, the fraction of cells with nuclei at the cell center declined, whereas the fraction of polarized cells, with nuclei shifted to a position near the plasma membrane, increased. Dynein inhibition impaired nuclear polarization, thereby blocking enucleation. These data indicate that dynein plays an essential role not only in cytokinesis but also in enucleation. We therefore conclude that human erythroblast enucleation is a process largely independent of MTOCs, but dependent on dynein.",

Although the distinct biological functions of most KRAB\u2013ZNF proteins remain unknown, recent publications indicate their implication in fundamental processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, development, and tumorigenesis. SZF1/ZNF589 was first identified as a gene with SZF1-1 isoform specifically expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic cells, strongly suggesting a role in epigenetic control of gene expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the function of SZF1/ZNF589 in hematopoiesis has not yet been elucidated. Our study reveals SZF1/ZNF589 as a gene with a human-specific nucleotide DNA-change, conferring potential species-specific functional properties. Through shRNA-mediated loss-of-function experiments, we found that changes in expression of fundamental apoptosis-controlling genes are induced on SZF1/ZNF589 knockdown, resulting in inhibited growth of hematopoietic cell lines and decreased progenitor potential of primary human bone marrow CD34+ cells. Moreover, we found that the SZF1/ZNF589 gene is differentially regulated during hypoxia in CD34+ HSPCs in a cytokine-dependent manner, implicating its possible involvement in the maintenance of the hypoxic physiologic status of hematopoietic stem cells. Our results establish the role of SZF1/ZNF589 as a new functional regulator of the hematopoietic system.",

Here, we found that ESAM can also be used to purify human hematopoietic stem cells from all the currently available sources (adult bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, and cord blood). Multipotent colony-forming units and long-term hematopoietic-reconstituting cells in immunodeficient mice were found exclusively in the ESAMHigh fraction of CD34+CD38\u2212 cells. The CD34+CD38\u2212 fraction of cord blood and collagenase-treated bone marrow contained cells exhibiting extremely high expression of ESAM; these cells are likely to be related to the endothelial lineage. Leukemia cell lines of erythroid and megakaryocyte origin, but not those of myeloid or lymphoid descent, were ESAM positive. However, high ESAM expression was observed in some primary acute myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, KG-1a myeloid leukemia cells switched from ESAM negative to ESAM positive with repeated leukemia reconstitution in\u00a0vivo.

The Lin28b/let-7 pathway determines developmentally timed changes in HSPC programs. Of note, many of the fetal-specific let-7 target genes, including Lin28, appear to be transcriptionally repressed by Ezh2-mediated H3K27me3 in BM HSPCs, and Ezh2 loss results in their ectopic expression, particularly in hematologic malignancies that develop in the absence of Ezh2.

This is based on surrogate markers for HSC mobilization, such as CD34+ cells and colony-forming activity in blood. However, CD34+ cells or colony-forming units in culture (CFU-C) are heterogeneous cell populations with hugely divergent long-term repopulation potential on transplantation. HSC behavior is influenced by the vascular bed in the vicinity of which they reside. We hypothesized that G-CSF may mobilize sequentially cells proximal and more distal to bone marrow venous sinuses where HSCs enter the blood. We addressed this question with functional serial transplantation assays using blood and bone marrow after specific time points of G-CSF treatment in mice. We found that in mice, blood collected after only 48\u00a0hours of G-CSF administration was as enriched in serially reconstituting HSCs as blood collected at 5\u00a0days of G-CSF treatment. Similarly, mobilized Lin\u2212CD34+ cells were relatively enriched in more primitive Lin\u2212CD34+CD38\u2212 cells at day 2 of G-CSF treatment compared with later points in half of human donors tested (n\u00a0=\u00a06).

To explore the role of Rb1 in MM, we examined the functional consequences of single- and double-copy Rb1 loss in germinal center B\u00a0cells, the cells of origin of MM. We generated mice without Rb1 function in germinal center B\u00a0cells by crossing Rb1Flox/Flox with C-\u03b3-1-Cre (C\u03b31) mice expressing the Cre recombinase in class-switched B\u00a0cells in a p107\u2212/\u2212 background to prevent p107 from compensating for Rb1 loss (C\u03b31-Rb1F/F-p107\u2212/\u2212). All mice developed normally, but B\u00a0cells with two copies of Rb1 deleted (C\u03b31-Rb1F/F-p107\u2212/\u2212) exhibited increased proliferation and cell death compared with C\u03b31-Rb1+/+-p107\u2212/\u2212 controls ex\u00a0vivo.

Our data indicate that Rb1 loss induces both cell proliferation and death in germinal center B\u00a0cells. Because no B-cell malignancies developed after 1\u00a0year of observation, our data also suggest that Rb1 loss is not sufficient to transform post-germinal center B\u00a0cells and that additional, specific mutations are likely required to cooperate with Rb1 loss to induce malignant transformation.",

We report here that in both genetically defined mouse models and human cell lines, CD44 expression is associated with chemoresistance, and that this effect is mediated in part through enhanced drug efflux. Interestingly, we also observed increased CD44 expression in residual blasts following standard induction chemotherapy, as compared with blasts from matched, pretherapy samples in a subset of pediatric patients undergoing minimal residual disease monitoring as part of a clinical trial.

Among the mutations, ASXL1 mutations attract much attention; the ASXL1 mutations are identified in a variety of hematologic malignancies and always predicts poor prognosis. It was found that the C-terminal truncating mutants of the ASXL1 or ASXL1 deletion induced MDS-like diseases in mouse. In addition, it has recently been reported that ASXL1 mutations are frequently found in clonal hematopoiesis in healthy elderly people, who frequently progress to hematologic malignancies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which ASXL1 mutations induce hematologic malignancies are not fully understood. Moreover, whether ASXL1 mutations are loss-of-function mutations or dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations remains a matter of controversy. We here present solid evidence indicating that the C-terminal truncating ASXL1 protein is indeed expressed in cells harboring homozygous mutations of ASXL1, indicating the ASXL1 mutations are dominant-negative or gain-of-function mutations; for the first time, we detected the truncated ASXL1 proteins in two cell lines lacking the intact ASXL1 gene by mass spectrometry and Western blot analyses.

When we introduced ATF7IP-PDGFRB, murine Ba/F3 cells acquired the ability to proliferate in an interleukin (IL)-3-independent manner. On the contrary, the expression of wild-type PDGFRB is not sufficient to acquire the ability for IL-3-independent proliferation in Ba/F3 cells. The introduction of ATF7IP-PDGFRB also induces a typical gene expression profile for Ph1-ALL in Ba/F3 cells. A series of biochemical and cell biological experiments revealed the constitutive activation of ATF7IP-PDGFRB as well as downstream signaling molecules, including AKT and MAPK. Although the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor led to cell death in both cells into which ATF7IP-PDGFRB had been introduced and IL-3-maintained Mock cells, MEK inhibitor selectively led to cell death into which ATF7IP-PDGFRB had been introduced. The introduction of tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations at binding sites of adaptor molecules important in the MAPK pathway located in the PDGFRB portion abolished ATF7IP\u2013PDGFRB-mediated cell transformation, suggesting that MAPK-mediated signals are critical in ATF7IP-PDGFRB-mediated cell transformation. On treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ATF7IP-PDGFRB-expressing, but not Mock, Ba/F3 cells underwent rapid apoptosis accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of MAPK. Importantly, the sensitivity of ATF7IP-PDGFRB-expressing Ba/F3 cells to imatinib is significantly higher than that of BCR\u2013ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells, as assessed by the IC50. Taken together, ATF7IP-PDGFRB has transforming potential via the constitutive activation of MAPK and participates in the pathogenesis of Ph-like ALL.

We report that inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), a key enzyme in the protein prenylation pathway, with the selective inhibitor cysmethynil enhances the effect of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in killing CML cells. Cysmethynil augments tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in both BCR-ABL1 wild type and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutant-expressing cell lines.

T-bet protein levels differed among HSPC subsets, with highest levels observed in megakaryo-erythroid progenitor cells (MEPs), the common precursor to megakaryocytes and erythrocytes.

Differences observed with respect to megakaryocyte number and maturity, as assessed by level of expression of CD41 and CD61, and megakaryocyte ploidy, in T-bet-deficient HSPCs were not associated with altered proliferation or survival in culture. Gene expression micro-array analysis of MEPs from T-bet-deficient mice exhibited diminished expression of multiple genes associated with the megakaryocyte lineage.

We recently reported that G-CSF administration causes a transient blockade of medullar erythropoiesis by suppressing erythroblastic island (EI) macrophages in the bone marrow. In the study described here, we investigated the effect of mobilizing doses of Flt3-L on erythropoiesis in mice in\u00a0vivo. Similar to G-CSF, Flt3-L caused whitening of the bone marrow with significant reduction in the numbers of EI macrophages and erythroblasts. This was compensated by an increase in the numbers of EI macrophages and erythroblasts in the spleen. However, unlike G-CSF, Flt3-L had an indirect effect on EI macrophages, as it was not detected at the surface of EI macrophages or erythroid progenitors.",

     "abstract": "Anemia is a significant co-morbidity of chronic infections, as well as other inflammatory diseases. Anemia of chronic infection results from defective bone marrow erythropoiesis. Although the limitation of iron availability has been considered a key factor, the exact mechanisms underlying blockade in erythroid generation during infection are not fully understood. Erythropoiesis is a tightly regulated process that is very sensitive to environmental changes. During the last decade, the importance of the bone marrow hematopoietic niche has been progressively acknowledged. Several bone marrow cell types (such as macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, and progenitor cells) and molecular mediators (such as CXCL12) have been identified as fundamental for both the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell pluripotency and their most adequate differentiation into each hematopoietic cell lineage. Importantly, both niche-supporting cells and hematopoietic progenitors were found to be able to sense local and systemic cues to adapt the hematopoietic output to needs of the organism. Here, we review how hematopoietic progenitors and niche-supporting cells sense and respond to stress cues and suggest a potential role for the hematopoietic niche in the development of anemia of chronic infection.",

To investigate which step (internalization, reverse transcription, nuclear transport, and integration) limits lentiviral transduction, we evaluated the kinetics of lentiviral transduction in human CD34+ cells. We transduced HeLa and CD34+ cells with self-inactivating HIV-1 vector at low and tenfold higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) and evaluated vector amounts at various time points based on the rationale that if a given step was not limiting, tenfold greater vector amounts would be obtained at the tenfold higher MOI. We observed slower internalization (>60\u00a0min), a peak in reverse transcription at 24\u00a0hours, and completion of integration at 3\u00a0days in CD34+ cells. In HeLa cells, there were approximately tenfold greater amounts at high MOI at all time points. When compared with HeLa cells, CD34+ cells exhibited larger differences in vector amounts between high and low MOIs at 2\u20136\u00a0hours and a smaller difference at 12\u00a0hours to 10\u00a0days, revealing a limitation in human CD34+ cell transduction around 12\u00a0hours, which corresponds to reverse transcription. In serial measurements of reverse transcription at 24\u00a0hours, vector amounts did not decrease once detected among CD34+ cells. When using an HSC expansion medium, we observed less limitation for starting reverse transcription and more efficient transduction among CD34+ cells in\u00a0vitro and in xenografted mice.

     "publication date": "02-2016",
     "abstract": "Cellular labile iron, which contains chelatable redox-active Fe2+, has been implicated in iron-mediated cellular toxicity leading to multiple organ dysfunction. Iron homeostasis is controlled by monocytes/macrophages through their iron recycling and storage capacities. Furthermore, iron sequestration by monocytes/macrophages is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, highlighting the importance of these cells in the crosstalk between inflammation and iron homeostasis. However, a role for cellular labile iron in monocyte/macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses has not been defined. Here we describe how cellular labile iron activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocytes. Stimulation of lipopolysaccharide-primed peripheral blood mononuclear cells with ferric ammonium citrate increases the level of cellular Fe2+ levels in monocytes and induces production of interleukin-1\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner. This ferric ammonium citrate-induced interleukin-1\u03b2 production is dependent on caspase-1 and is significantly inhibited by an Fe2+-specific chelator. Ferric ammonium citrate consistently induced interleukin-1\u03b2 secretion in THP1 cells, but not in NLRP3-deficient THP1 cells, indicating a requirement for the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, activation of the inflammasome is mediated by potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Thus, these results suggest that monocytes/macrophages not only sequestrate iron during inflammation, but also mediate inflammation in response to cellular labile iron, which provides novel insights into the role of iron in chronic inflammation.",

In this study, we report significant alterations in blood parameters, particularly of total white blood cells, specific populations of dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells, as a result of site and manner of sampling. Intriguingly, warming of mice prior to tail bleeding was found to significantly alter blood values.

Although bone marrow represents the main source of MSCs, there remains a need to identify a stem cell source that is safe and easily accessible and yields large numbers of cells without provoking debates over ethics. In this study, MSCs isolated from amniotic fluid and placenta were compared with bone marrow MSCs. Their immunomodulatory properties were studied in total activated T\u00a0cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA-PBMCs). In particular, an in\u00a0vitro co-culture system was established to study: (i) the effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation; (ii) the presence of T regulatory lymphocytes (Treg); (iii) the immunophenotype of various T subsets (Th1 and Th2 na\u00efve, memory, effector lymphocytes); (iv) cytokine release and master gene expression to verify Th1, Th2, and Th17 polarization; and (v) IDO production. Under all co-culture conditions with PHA-PBMCs and MSCs (independently of tissue origin), data revealed: (i) T proliferation inhibition; (ii) increase in na\u00efve T and decrease in memory T\u00a0cells; (iii) increase in T regulatory lymphocytes; (iv) strong Th2 polarization associated with increased interleukin-10 and interleukin-4 levels, Th1 inhibition (significant decreases in interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-12) and Th17 induction (production of high concentrations of interleukins-6 and -17); (v) indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase mRNA induction in MSCs co-cultured with PHA-PBMCs. AF-MSCs had a more potent immunomodulatory effect on T\u00a0cells than BM-MSCs, only slightly higher than that of placenta MSCs.

Data for 122 DLBCL patients who underwent ASCT as up-front or salvage treatment were analyzed. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate in DLBCL patients who underwent up-front ASCT was 76.6%, and the rate for those who underwent delayed ASCT was 60.9% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). In a subgroup analysis of patients with a high-intermediate/high-risk age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, achievement of complete remission translated into improved OS in the up-front ASCT group, whereas patients who achieved partial remission had similar OS rates in both groups. The up-front ASCT group had improved OS in patients aged <50\u00a0years or with good performance status, whereas the OS rates of both groups were similar in patients aged \u226560\u00a0years or with poor performance status. When the OS outcome is analyzed by the number of factors (no complete remission during R-CHOP induction chemotherapy, age \u226550\u00a0years, and performance status \u22652), the 3-year OS rates of patients with zero or one, two, and three clinical factors were 80.2%, 51.6%, and 0%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, in higher-risk DLBCL patients, induction chemotherapy followed by up-front ASCT may have a survival benefit compared with induction chemotherapy alone in highly selected patients who have achieved a complete remission, who are aged <50\u00a0years, and who have a good performance status at diagnosis.",

The tissue microenvironment, specifically the lymph nodes, influences the biological and clinical behavior of CLL cells. Gene expression profiling of CLL cells from peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes revealed Cav-1 as one of the genes that might be involved in the pathogenesis of CLL. We have previously reported that the knockdown of Cav-1 in primary CLL cells exhibits a significant decrease in cell migration and immune synapse formation. However, the precise role of Cav-1 in CLL initiation and progression in\u00a0vivo is not known. Therefore, we decreased the expression of Cav-1 in\u00a0vivo by breeding E\u03bc-TCL1 with cav-1 knockout mice. We observed a significant decrease in the number of CLL cells and rate of proliferation of CLL cells in spleen, liver, and bone marrow from E\u03bc-TCL1-Cav1\u2212/+ and E\u03bc-TCL1-Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared with E\u03bc-TCL1 mice.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) may compete with hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1), the master regulator of EPO production, for binding with HIF-1\u03b2. The effect of kynurenine, an endogenous AhR activator that increases in inflammation, on EPO and hepcidin production was evaluated. HepG2 cells were treated with the hypoxia mimetic CoCl2, kynurenine, the AhR inhibitor CH223191, and combinations of these. EPO and hepcidin production was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIF-2\u03b1 and CYP1A1 levels, a transcriptional target of AhR, were assessed by Western blotting. CoCl2 increased EPO production and decreased hepcidin and CYP1A1. Kynurenine exerted the opposite effects. Wherever CH223191 was added, the inhibitor overcorrected kynurenine-induced alterations in both the presence and the absence of CoCl2. Also, treatment with CH223191 alone increased EPO and decreased hepcidin, indicating that there is a degree of constitutive AhR activation, possibly by other endogenous AhR activators. In conclusion, kynurenine, by competing with HIF-2\u03b1, may contribute to anemia of inflammation by decreasing EPO and increasing hepcidin production.

Because hematopoietic and endothelial cells are derived from common progenitors (hemogenic endothelial progenitors [HEPs]), we examined the effect of transient GSKi treatment on hematopoietic cell differentiation from hiPSCs. We found that transient GSKi treatment at the start of hiPSC differentiation induction altered the gene expression profile of the cells. Multiple CDX/HOX genes, which are expressed in the posterior mesoderm of developing embryos, were significantly upregulated by GSKi treatment. Further, inclusion of the GSKi in a serum- and stroma-free culture with chemically defined medium efficiently induced HEPs, and the HEPs gave rise to various lineages of hematopoietic and endothelial cells. Therefore, transient WNT/\u03b2-CATENIN signaling triggers activation of the CDX/HOX pathway, which in turn confers hemogenic posterior mesoderm identity to differentiating hiPSCs.

Although numerous distinct cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities associated with AML were discovered prior to the turn of the millennium, recent advances in whole genome sequencing and global genomic approaches have resulted in an explosion of newly identified molecular abnormalities. However, even with these advances, our understanding of how these mutations contribute to the etiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic responses of AML remains largely unknown. Recently the International Society for Experimental Hematology (ISEH) hosted a webinar entitled \u201cClonal Evolution of Pre-Leukemic Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) in AML\u201d in which two AML mavens, Ross Levine, MD, and Ravindra Majeti, MD, PhD, discussed some of their recent, groundbreaking studies that have shed light on how many of these newly identified mutations contribute to leukemogenesis and therapy resistance in AML. Here, we provide a brief overview of this webinar and discuss the basic scientific and clinical implications of the data presented.",

We prospectively assessed the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial steroid infusions (IASIs) for steroid-resistant acute gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD and compared the outcomes with those of historical controls at our institution. Nineteen consecutive, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation subjects aged 31\u201367\u00a0years (median 52) were enrolled between October, 2008, and November, 2012. Acute GVHD was confirmed by biopsy in all cases. The enrolled patients were treated with infusions of methylprednisolone into the mesenteric arteries and/or gastroduodenal and left gastric arteries. Fourteen consecutive patients who developed steroid-resistant acute GI GVHD between 2001 and 2008 were used as controls. For the primary endpoint at day 28, the overall and complete responses in the IASI group trended higher (79% vs. 42%, p = 0.066) and were significantly higher (63% vs. 21%, p = 0.033) than those in the control group. Although not statistically significant, owing to the small population, the crude day-180-nonrelapse mortality rate was about 20% lower and the day-180-overall-survival rate tended to be higher than the control (11% vs. 29%, p\u00a0= 0.222; 79% vs. 50%, p = 0.109, respectively). There were no serious IASI-related complications. Our results suggest that IASI can safely provide excellent efficacy for refractory acute GI GVHD without increasing infection-related complications and may improve prognosis.",

We have examined the antileukemia potency of CART cells targeting CD19 antigen using second-generation CAR containing a CD28 co-stimulatory domain cloned into piggyBac-transposon vector and patient-derived chemoresistant pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. In the presence of large numbers of target cells characteristic of patients with high leukemia burden, excessive proliferation of CART cells leads to differentiation into short-lived effector cells. Transient leukemia growth delay was induced by CART-cell infusion in mice xenografted with rapidly growing CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and was followed by rapid CART-cell extinction. Conditioning with the hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-activating caspase 3 and promotion of apoptosis in leukemia cells maximized the effect of CART cells and improved CART-cell persistence. These data suggest that the clinical use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine before CART cells could be considered. Coculture of leukemia cells with bone marrow stroma cells reduced target cell loss, suggesting that leukemia cell mobilization into circulation may help to remove the protective effect of bone marrow stroma and increase the efficacy of CART-cell therapy.",

However, antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monotherapy had only a modest and transient effect in these individuals. Recently it was found that VEGF-induced proangiogenic intracellular Ca2+ oscillations could be impaired in endothelial progenitor cells of subjects with malignancies. Therefore, we employed Ca2+ imaging, wavelet analysis, and functional assays to assess whether and how VEGF-induced Ca2+ oscillations are altered in PMF-derived endothelial progenitor cells. We focused on endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), which are the only endothelial progenitor cell subtype capable of forming neovessels both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. VEGF triggers repetitive Ca2+ spikes in both normal ECFCs (N-ECFCs) and ECFCs obtained from PMF patients (PMF-ECFCs). However, the spiking response to VEGF is significantly weaker in PMF-ECFCs. VEGF-elicited Ca2+ oscillations are patterned by the interaction between inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and store-operated Ca2+ entry. However, in most PMF-ECFCs, Ca2+ oscillations are triggered by a store-independent Ca2+ entry pathway. We found that diacylglycerol gates transient receptor potential canonical 1 channel to trigger VEGF-dependent Ca2+ spikes by recruiting the phospholipase C/inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate signaling pathway, reflected as a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content. Finally, we found that, apart from being less robust and dysregulated as compared with N-ECFCs, VEGF-induced Ca2+ oscillations modestly stimulate PMF-ECFC growth and in\u00a0vitro angiogenesis. These results may explain the modest effect of anti-VEGF therapies in PMF.",

We found that both mitotic errors and interphase DNA damage significantly contribute to genomic instability during FA-deficient hematopoiesis and in nonhematopoietic human and murine FA primary cells. Super-resolution microscopy coupled with functional assays revealed that FANCA shuttles to the pericentriolar material to regulate spindle assembly at mitotic entry. Loss of FA signaling rendered cells hypersensitive to spindle chemotherapeutics and allowed escape from the chemotherapy-induced spindle assembly checkpoint. In support of these findings, direct comparison of DNA crosslinking and anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics in primary FANCA\u2212/\u2212 cells revealed genomic instability originating through divergent cell cycle checkpoint aberrations.

We previously described techniques used to test the developmental potential of HSPCs by culturing them on zebrafish kidney stromal (ZKS) cells, derived from the main site of hematopoiesis in the adult teleost. Here we describe an additional primary stromal cell line we refer to as zebrafish embryonic stromal trunk (ZEST) cells, derived from tissue surrounding the embryonic dorsal aorta, the site of HSC emergence in developing fish. ZEST cells encouraged HSPC differentiation toward the myeloid, lymphoid, and erythroid pathways when assessed by morphologic and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. Additionally, ZEST cells significantly expanded the number of cultured HSPCs in\u00a0vitro, indicating that these stromal cells are supportive of both HSPC proliferation and multilineage differentiation. Examination of ZEST cells indicates that they express numerous cytokines and Notch ligands and possess endothelial characteristics. Further characterization of ZEST cells should prove to be invaluable in understanding the complex signaling cascades instigated by the embryonic hematopoietic niche required to expand and differentiate HSPCs.

Therefore, disrupting the binding of the BCL11A transcriptional repressor complex to the \u03b3-globin gene promoter provides a novel approach for inducing expression of the \u03b3-globin genes. To develop a cellular screening system for the identification of BCL11A inhibitors, we produced K562 cell clones with integrated copies of a BCL11A-XL expressing vector. We characterized 12 K562 clones expressing different levels of BCL11A-XL and found that a clear inverse relationship does exist between the levels of BCL11A-XL and the extent of hemoglobinization induced by a panel of HbF inducers. Using mithramycin as an inducer, we found that this molecule was the only HbF inducer efficient in rescuing the ability to differentiate along the erythroid program, even in K562 cell clones expressing high levels of BCL11A-XL, suggesting that BCL11A-XL activity is counteracted by mithramycin.",

This transplantation milieu has resulted in favorable outcomes with low transplantation-related mortality, owing to a low incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), without increased infectious complications. However, the high relapse rate remains a major concern. We therefore performed a prospective pilot study of HLA haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) with intensified conditioning, followed by two lower doses of PT/Cy. A total of 20 patients with refractory or poor-prognosis myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and leukemia were enrolled in the study. A trend toward a lower incidence of grade III\u2013IV acute GVHD at day 100 in the group receiving 25\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 doses of PT/Cy, compared with the group receiving 25\u00a0mg/kg of PT/Cy (9.1% vs. 33%, p = 0.20), was noted. However, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was low, at 10% irrespective of PT/Cy dose. The number of infused CD34+ cells significantly correlated with the grade of acute GVHD (p = 0.004). In addition, the occurrence of BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis was significantly more common in the double-dose PT/Cy group (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.043), especially when combined with busulfan. The probability of overall survival at 1\u00a0year in the double-dose group tended to be better compared with that in the single-dose group (64% vs. 44%, respectively; p = 0.20). In conclusion, HLA haploidentical, T-cell-replete PBSCT with 25\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 doses of PT/Cy might be a feasible option for treating high-risk leukemia and MDS.",

The canonical function of PRC2 is the trimethylation of histone 3 on lysine residue 27. This epigenetic modification is associated with gene silencing. Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions have been reported for PRC2, depending on cellular context. In leukemia mediated by the leukemogenic fusion MLL-AF9, complete ablation of canonical PRC2 function by genetic inactivation of the core component embryonic ectoderm development (Eed) or by combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PRC2 methyltransferases EZH2 and EZH1 has a strong anti-leukemic effect, and this effect has been linked to de-repression of the PRC2 target locus Cdkn2a. We asked whether inactivation of Cdkn2a is sufficient to restore leukemic activity of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, using combined genetic inactivation of Cdkn2a and Eed. We found that Cdkn2a inactivation partially rescues in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo growth of Eed-inactivated MLL-AF9 cells. However, the growth of Eed-null Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9 cells in the absence of Cdkn2a remained severely compromised in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, compared with that of their Eed-floxed Cdkn2a-null counterparts. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that several genes previously implicated in inefficient growth of MLL-AF9-transformed cells, including Gata2, Egr1, and Cdkn2b were de-repressed as a consequence of Eed inactivation. Furthermore, we found that direct binding targets of MLL fusion proteins are negatively enriched in Eed-inactivated Cdkn2a-null MLL-AF9-transformed cells.

Blood samples were collected from healthy controls and patients with newly diagnosed AML at three time points: diagnosis, nadir, and remission. EV concentration, cell origin, and expression of coagulation proteins were characterized using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. EV cytokine contents were evaluated by protein array. Procoagulant activity was assessed using Factor Xa chromogenic assay. Forty-two AML patients were enrolled in the study. Total EV numbers were higher in patients in first remission compared with controls, whereas blast EV counts were higher in patients at diagnosis compared with controls and patients in remission. Blast EV levels were significantly lower in patients who achieved remission and were alive at 3-year follow up compared with their succumbed counterparts. At all three time points, percentage of endothelial EVs was higher in patients compared with controls. EV procoagulant activity was elevated at diagnosis and in remission, and, unlike controls' EVs, patients' EVs increased endothelial cell thrombogenicity. EVs of AML patients express membrane proteins of blast cells and might serve as biomarkers of leukemia dynamics and presence of minimal residual disease. Increased levels of endothelial EVs and their procoagulant activity may indicate a vascular injury associated with a hypercoagulable state in AML.",

PDTC administration inhibited the increase of soluble IL-2R and improved mouse survival, suggesting that this compound has potential as an anti-ATL agent.

We hypothesized that targeting this terminal step could overcome survival and drug-resistance signals in myeloma cells and induce programmed cell death. Myeloma cells expressed executioner caspases.

Here, we investigated the role of recombinant human TIMP-1 (rhTIMP-1) in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and elucidated the downstream pathway ignited by rhTIMP-1. We found that rhTIMP-1 affects in\u00a0vitro cell survival, proliferation, and particularly clonogenic expansion of CD34+ HSPCs without compromising their short-term engraftment potential after transplantation into immunodeficient mice. These effects are independent on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition and rely on TIMP-1's binding to the tetraspanin membrane receptor CD63. Further investigation indicated that rhTIMP-1 stimulation induces phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) recruitment and Akt phosphorylation, both presiding over survival/proliferation pathways in HSPCs. Downstream targets of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) are also modulated, including the proliferation marker cyclin D1 (CycD1), whose levels are increased upon exposure to rhTIMP-1. These findings indicate that rhTIMP-1 promotes clonogenic expansion and survival in human progenitors via the activation of the CD63/PI3K/pAkt signaling pathway, suggesting that TIMP-1 might be a key player in the network of proinflammatory factors modulating HSPC functions.",

It is caused by the lack of an antipathogen oxidative burst, normally performed by phagocytic cells to contain and clear bacterial and fungal growth. Restoration of immune function can be achieved with heterologous bone marrow transplantation; however, autologous bone marrow transplantation would be a preferable option. Thus, a method is required to recapitulate the function of the diseased gene within the patient's own cells. Gene therapy approaches for CGD have employed randomly integrating viruses with concomitant issues of insertional mutagenesis, inaccurate gene dosage, and gene silencing. Here, we explore the potential of the recently described clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 site-specific nuclease system to encourage repair of the endogenous gene by enhancing the levels of homologous recombination. Using induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a CGD patient containing a single intronic mutation in the CYBB gene, we show that footprintless gene editing is a viable option to correct disease mutations. Gene correction results in restoration of oxidative burst function in iPS-derived phagocytes by reintroduction of a previously skipped exon in the cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB) protein.

     "abstract": "Familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a germline mutation in the RUNX1 gene and is characterized by thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of developing myeloid malignancies. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from dermal fibroblasts of a patient with FPD/AML possessing a nonsense mutation R174X in the RUNX1 gene. Consistent with the clinical characteristics of the disease, FPD iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells were significantly impaired in undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation and subsequent maturation, as determined by colony-forming cell assay and surface marker analysis. Notably, when we corrected the RUNX1 mutation using transcription activator-like effector nucleases in conjunction with a donor plasmid containing normal RUNX1 cDNA sequences, megakaryopoiesis and subsequent maturation were restored in FPD iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells. These findings clearly indicate that the RUNX1 mutation is robustly associated with thrombocytopenia in patients with FPD/AML, and transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated gene correction in iPSCs generated from patient-derived cells could provide a promising clinical application for treatment of the disease.",

     "abstract": "A precise understanding of the role of miR-223 in human hematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still lacking. By measuring miR-223 expression in blasts from 115 AML patients, we found significantly higher miR-223 levels in patients with favorable prognosis, whereas patients with low miR-223 expression levels were associated with worse outcome. Furthermore, miR-223 was hierarchically expressed in AML subpopulations, with lower expression in leukemic stem cell\u2013containing fractions. Genetic depletion of miR-223 decreased the leukemia initiating cell (LIC) frequency in a myelomonocytic AML mouse model, but it was not mandatory for rapid-onset AML. To relate these observations to physiologic myeloid differentiation, we knocked down or ectopically expressed miR-223 in cord-blood CD34+ cells using lentiviral vectors. Although miR-223 knockdown delayed myeloerythroid precursor differentiation in\u00a0vitro, it increased myeloid progenitors in\u00a0vivo following serial xenotransplantation. Ectopic miR-223 expression increased erythropoiesis, T lymphopoiesis, and early B lymphopoiesis in\u00a0vivo. These findings broaden the role of miR-223 as a regulator of the expansion/differentiation equilibrium in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells where its impact is dose- and differentiation-stage-dependent. This also explains the complex yet minor role of miR-223 in AML, a heterogeneous disease with variable degree of myeloid differentiation.",

A major controversy concerns MLD's role in NPM1-mutated (NPM1+) AML, which correlates with good prognosis. We used flow cytometry (FC), an emerging technique for assessing dysplasia, to investigate MLD in NPM1+ AML by an immunophenotypic score (IPS), a technique previously adopted in myelodysplastic syndrome. Eighty-five intensively treated NPM1+ AML cases were studied. Patients were grouped according to the combination of data in maturing cell compartments. FC-assessed dysplasia showed a significant correlation with morphology-assessed dysplasia, showing the efficacy of this method in highlighting dysplasia in AML. Except for MLD, IPS did not influence any patient- or disease-related characteristics at diagnosis. Furthermore, IPS did not influence complete remission rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival. By investigating NPM1 status on separated cell compartments, we established a correlation between FC-assessed MLD and belonging to AML clone. This study shows that dysplasia evaluated by immunophenotype has no impact on clinical-biological characteristics or on outcome of NPM1+ AML. Dysplasia is part of the spectrum of NPM1+ AML, and the prognostic stratification of this category of patients should not be based upon it.",

In a cohort of 70 CML patients, we found that expression of the GABP \u03b1 subunit (GABP\u03b1) is positively correlated to the BCR\u2013ABL1/ABL1 ratio. Moreover, significantly higher GABP\u03b1 expression was detected in blast crisis than in chronic phase CML after performing data mining on 91 CML patients. In functional studies, imatinib sensitivity is enhanced after GABP\u03b1 knockdown in tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)\u2013sensitive K-562, as well as by overexpression of a deletion mutant in TKI-resistant NALM-1 cells. Moreover, in K-562 cells, GABP-dependent expression variations of PRKD2 and RAC2, relevant signaling mediators in CML, were observed. Notably, protein kinase D2 (Prkd2) was reported to be a GABP target gene in mice. In line with this, we detected a positive correlation between GABPA and PRKD2 expression in primary human CML, indicating that the effects of GABP are mediated by PRKD2.

The common marmoset (CM) was recently found to be a useful nonhuman primate animal model for drug development and safety assessment. However, a method for the efficient hematopoietic differentiation of CM ESCs has not been established. In this study, we developed a novel and efficient method for differentiating CM ESCs into hematopoietic cells by transiently inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013Protein kinase B (AKT)\u00a0pathway, a critical pathway that maintains the undifferentiated state of CM ESCs during embryoid body (EB) formation.

Although IFN\u03b1 has been found to transiently impair quiescence of murine hematopoietic stem cells, its effects on human HSPCs have not been studied in\u00a0vivo. Here, we compared bone marrow serially obtained from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms before and during pegylated IFN\u03b1 treatment against marrow serially obtained from patients on hydroxyurea. The percentage of HSPCs actively undergoing cell cycle was increased after pegylated IFN\u03b1 treatment in a majority of patients compared with hydroxyurea-treated controls, suggesting that IFN\u03b1 promotes cell division. Furthermore, transcriptional profiling revealed that cell cycle-associated genes were induced, whereas genes involved in HSPC quiescence were repressed during IFN\u03b1 treatment. Compared with hydroxyurea-treated controls, pegylated IFN\u03b1-treated patients had similar numbers of HSPCs, but increased numbers of hematopoietic progenitors as determined by colony formation assay, indicating an increase in myeloid proliferation/differentiation.

Despite its rarity, childhood AML is a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality. Treatment is in general extrapolated from adult AML on the assumption that adult AML and pediatric AML are similar biological entities.

Moreover, BAP1 protein levels are low or undetectable in CD34+ cells from CML patients at diagnosis as compared with CD34+ cells from normal donors.

Pharmacologically overcoming the differentiation block in this condition is an attractive therapeutic avenue, which has achieved success only in a subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Attempts to emulate this success in other AML subtypes have thus far been unsuccessful. Autophagy is a conserved protein degradation pathway with important roles in mammalian cell differentiation, particularly within the hematopoietic system. In the study described here, we investigated the functional importance of autophagy in APL cell differentiation. We found that autophagy is increased during all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of the APL cell line NB4 and that this is associated with increased expression of LC3II and GATE-16 proteins involved in autophagosome formation. Autophagy inhibition, using either drugs (chloroquine/3-methyladenine) or short-hairpin RNA targeting the essential autophagy gene ATG7, attenuates myeloid differentiation. Importantly, we found that enhancing autophagy promotes ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation of an ATRA-resistant derivative of the non-APL AML HL60 cell line (HL60-Diff-R).

This has prompted the development of approaches to study single cells in isolation, often performed using multiparameter flow cytometry. However, many stem cell populations are too rare to test all possible cell surface marker combinations, and virtually nothing is known about functional differences associated with varying intensities of such markers. Here we describe the use of index sorting for further resolution of the flow cytometric isolation of single murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Specifically, we associate single-cell functional assay outcomes with distinct cell surface marker expression intensities. High levels of both CD150 and EPCR associate with delayed kinetics of cell division and low levels of differentiation. Moreover, cells that do not form single HSC-derived clones appear in the 7AADdim fraction, suggesting that even low levels of 7AAD staining are indicative of less healthy cell populations. These data indicate that when used in combination with single-cell functional assays, index sorting is a powerful tool for refining cell isolation strategies. This approach can be broadly applied to other single-cell systems, both to improve isolation and to acquire additional cell surface marker information.",

It is considered as a paradigm for the multistep nature of cancer initiation and progression. Genetic and epigenetic reprogramming events, which transform T-cell precursors into malignant T-ALL lymphoblasts, have been extensively characterized over the past decade. Despite our comprehensive understanding of the genomic landscape of human T-ALL, leukemia patients are still treated by high-dose multiagent chemotherapy, potentially followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Even with such aggressive treatment regimens, which are often associated with considerable acute and long-term side effects, about 15% of pediatric and 40% of adult T-ALL patients still relapse, owing to acquired therapy resistance, and present with very dismal survival perspectives. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms by which residual T-ALL tumor cells survive chemotherapy and act as a reservoir for leukemic progression and hematologic relapse remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is expected that enhanced molecular understanding of T-ALL disease biology will ultimately facilitate a targeted therapy driven approach that can reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicities and improve survival of refractory T-ALL patients through personalized salvage therapy.

     "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from various types of cells with transduction of defined transcription factors. Patient-derived iPSCs are becoming commonly utilized for understanding the molecular pathways involved in disease and for the development of novel targeted therapies. With the use of patient-derived iPSCs differentiated to specific-lineage cells, the potency and toxicity of drug candidates can be evaluated. In the past, patient-derived iPSCs were mainly established from patients of inherited hematologic diseases, followed by the expansion of target to acquired diseases like myeloproliferative neoplasms. Thanks to the rapid development of novel genome editing technologies, we can now utilize genetically modified and unprocessed iPSCs more readily than before. These technologies, which enable us to modulate genetic status or even chromosome structure at the right time, could help the elucidation of pathogenesis of hematologic diseases. If iPSC-derived hematopoietic cells are to be robustly reconstituted in\u00a0vivo as a consequence of the development of reprogramming and conversion technology, research on leukemic stem cells must be widely promoted. Therefore, iPSC technology has great potential on oncology research using patient samples.",

     "abstract": "Leukemias harboring mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL1) abnormalities are associated with poor clinical outcomes, and new therapeutic approaches are desperately needed. Rearrangement of the MLL1 gene generates chimeric proteins that fuse the NH3 terminus of MLL1 to the COOH terminus of its translocation partners. These MLL1 fusion oncoproteins drive the expression of homeobox genes such as HOXA cluster genes and myeloid ecotropic viral integration site 1 homolog (MEIS1), which are known to induce leukemic transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. Genomewide histone methylation studies have revealed that the abnormal expression of MLL1 fusion target genes is associated with high levels of H3K79 methylation at these gene loci. The only known enzyme that catalyzes methylation of H3K79 is disruptor of telomeric-silencing 1-like (DOT1L). Loss-of-function mouse models, as well as small molecular inhibitors of DOT1L, illustrate that leukemias driven by MLL1 translocations are dependent on DOT1L enzymatic activity for proliferation and for the maintenance of HOXA gene expression. Furthermore, DOT1L also appears to be important for HOXA gene expression in other settings including leukemias with select genetic abnormalities. These discoveries have established a foundation for disease-specific therapies that target chromatin modifications in highly malignant leukemias harboring specific genetic abnormalities. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying MLL1 translocation-driven leukemogenesis and the latest progress on DOT1L-targeted epigenetic therapies for MLL1-rearranged and other leukemias.",

Why are 2-hydroxyglutarate-producing tumors specifically selected for the R-enantiomer and not for the S-enantiomer? Are the changes in 2-hydroxyglutarate-induced DNA methylation primary or secondary alterations in tumorigenesis?

     "abstract": "Distinctive patterns of chromatin modification control gene expression and define cellular\u00a0identity during development and cell differentiation. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the sole mammalian enzymatic complex capable of establishing gene-repressive high-degree methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), plays crucial roles in regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that recurrent gain-of-function mutation and overexpression of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, drive and promote malignant transformation such as B-cell lymphomagenesis, providing a rationale for PRC2 inhibition as a novel anticancer strategy. Here, we summarize the recently developed strategies for inhibition of PRC2, which include a series of highly specific, highly potent, small-molecule inhibitors of EZH2 and EZH1, an EZH2-related methyltransferase. PRC2 establishes functional crosstalk with numerous epigenetic machineries during dynamic regulation of gene transcription. Perturbation of such functional crosstalk caused by genetic events observed in various hematologic cancers, such as inactivation of SNF5 and somatic mutation of UTX, confers PRC2 dependence, thus rendering an increased sensitivity to PRC2 inhibition. We discuss our current understanding of EZH2 somatic mutations frequently found in B-cell lymphomas and recurrent mutations in various other epigenetic regulators as novel molecular predictors and determinants of PRC2 sensitivity. As recent advances have indicated a critical developmental or tumor-suppressive role for\u00a0PRC2 and EZH2 in various tissue types, we discuss concerns over potentially toxic or even adverse effects associated with EZH2/1 inhibition in certain biological contexts or on cancer genetic background. Collectively, inhibition of PRC2 catalytic activity has emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for the precise treatment of a range of genetically defined hematologic malignancies and can be potentially applied to a broader spectrum of\u00a0human cancers that bear similar genetic and epigenetic characteristics.",

This discovery is important in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of normal transcriptional control. Subsequent work has shed light on the multiple roles of BET proteins in various aberrant transcriptional pathways that have significant implications across many malignant cell types and other disease processes. Accordingly, considerable effort has been made to assess the utility of targeting BET proteins with specific small molecules in acute leukemia and across other types of cancer. In this review, we will discuss the most recent advances in our understanding of the mechanistic actions of BET proteins in normal transcriptional control, both at the gene body and cisregulatory elements; how this is subverted; and its aberrant downstream effects, specifically in the context of acute leukemia and other hematologic cancers. In particular, we will focus on altered epigenetic programs that have been shown to be central to the development and maintenance of acute myeloid leukemia in preclinical models. Finally, we will explore how the use of small-molecule BET inhibitors in leukemias has demonstrated significant promise in numerous single-agent and combination therapy preclinical models and will highlight efforts to translate this promise to the therapeutic arena through various clinical trials attempting to validate efficacy and safety. The considerable opportunities in epigenetically targeting leukemias through BET inhibition will undoubtedly play an important role in improving the management of these conditions in the future.",

However, the low numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in banked units remain a major limitation. Protocols developed for HSPC expansion ex\u00a0vivo or to improve HSPC homing to the marrow represent solutions to overcome this shortcoming. In recent decades, wide arrays of functionally divergent approaches were developed for the amplification of HSPCs. These include optimization of cytokine cocktails, coculture systems, small molecules, and delivery systems for HSPC-expansion genes. Herein, we review past and current strategies, focusing on studies that characterize the contribution of expanded CB HSPC to short- and long-term engraftment in transplantation models or in clinical trials. Also discussed are homing effectors used to promote engraftment. In summary, these studies underscore that early-acting cytokines alone can expand HSPC with short-term engraftment activity, but that robust expansion of HSPCs with long-term engraftment necessitates the synergistic action of multiple HSC-expansion agonists. In support of this, early clinical trials based on cytokine-driven HSPC-expansion protocols delivered disappointing results, whereas recent trials based on the synergistic action of cytokines and HSPC-expansion agonists reported significant improvements in engraftment and therapeutic outcomes. Conversely, molecules that enhance homing of HSPC may represent a complementary approach to improve and perhaps accelerate engraftment. Optimization of the next generation of HSPC-expansion and priming strategies should support a paradigm shift in CB transplantation in which smaller, better matched units may preferentially be used.",

However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which loss of IKAROS activity may co-operate with BCR-ABL1 to transform lymphoid cells. To investigate this question, we used expression of a dominant-negative isoform of IKAROS (IK6) to suppress endogenous IKAROS activity in the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse pro-B BA/F3 cell line and in an IL-3-independent BCR-ABL1+ derivative. We then used intracellular phospho-flow cytometry to assess the effects of BCR-ABL1 and IK6, alone and in combination, on the signaling state of the cells before and after their stimulation with IL-3. BCR-ABL1 and IK6 each produced a constitutively activated signaling phenotype and also enhanced the signaling responses of BA/F3 cells to IL-3. These effects, however, were neither equivalent nor additive, and IK6 alone was insufficient to confer the IL-3-independent growth characteristic of BCR-ABL1+ BA/F3 cells. In addition to its effects on lymphoid cells, IK6 also induced constitutively activated signaling in a subset of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Together, these studies indicate an ability of IK6 to enhance intracellular signaling in both lymphoid and myeloid cells, but not to synergize with BCR-ABL1 in this model system.",

     "abstract": "Adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor for cellular energy status. When the cellular energy level is decreased, AMPK is activated and functions to suppress energy-consuming processes, including protein synthesis. Recently, AMPK has received attention as an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy. Several studies have revealed that the activation of AMPK by chemical stimulators, such as metformin, induces apoptosis in a variety of hematologic malignant cells. From another perspective, these results suggest that the function of AMPK is impaired in hematologic tumor cells. However, the precise mechanisms by which this impairment occurs are not well understood. In melanoma cells, oncogenic BRAF constitutively activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and phosphorylates liver kinase B1, an upstream activator of 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK), resulting in the inactivation of liver kinase B1 and AMPK. In this study, we analyzed whether ERK is involved in the suppression of AMPK activity using established and primary human leukemia cells. We found an inverse correlation between the intensity of ERK activity and the degree of AMPK activation after stimulation with either glucose deprivation or metformin. We also found that the inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 restored AMPK activation after metformin treatment. Furthermore, a combined treatment with metformin and U0126 enhanced the antileukemic activity of metformin. Importantly, metformin induced ERK activation by suppressing the protein levels of dual specificity phosphatase 6, a negative regulator of ERK. This crosstalk between AMPK and ERK could diminish the antileukemic activity of metformin. Taken together, our present observations suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of metformin in treating leukemia.",

This was first described in patients with breast cancer and is currently being investigated in other malignant diseases. TOP-targeting drugs may induce TOP gene copy number changes at relapse, with possible implications for relapse therapy efficacy. TOP gene alterations in lymphoma are poorly investigated. In this study, TOP1 and TOP2A gene alterations were investigated in patients with de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and relapsed DLBCL treated with chemotherapy regimens including TOP2-targeting drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a016). No TOP1 or TOP2A copy number changes were found. Polysomy of chromosomes 20 and 17 was seen in 3 of 25 patients (12%) and 2 of 32 patients (6%) with de novo DLBCL. Among relapsed patients, chromosome polysomy was more frequently observed in 5 of 13 patients (38%) and 4 of 16 patients (25%) harboring chromosome 20 and 17 polysomy, respectively; however, these differences only tended to be significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.09, respectively). The results suggest that TOP gene copy number changes are very infrequent in DLBCL and not likely induced by TOP2-targeting drugs. Increased polyploidy of chromosomes 17 and 20 among patients with relapsed DLBCL may reflect genetic compensation in the tumor cells after TOP2 inhibition, but is more likely due to the increased genetic instability often seen in progressed cancers. Therefore, it is unlikely that TOP1 and TOP2A gene alterations can be used as predictive markers for response to treatment with TOP2-targeting drugs in patients with DLBCL.",

BMS-911543 is a JAK2-selective inhibitor that induces apoptosis in JAK2-dependent cell lines and inhibits the growth of CD34+ progenitor cells from patients with JAK2V617F-positive MPN. To explore the clinical potential of this inhibitor, we tested BMS-911543 in a murine retroviral transduction\u2013transplantation model of JAK2V617F MPN. Treatment was initiated at two dose levels (3\u00a0mg/kg and 10\u00a0mg/kg) when the hematocrit exceeded 70%. Following the first week, white blood cell counts were reduced to normal in the high-dose group and were maintained well below the levels in vehicle-treated mice throughout the study. However, BMS-911543 had no effect on red blood cell parameters. After 42\u00a0days of treatment, the proportion of JAK2V617F-positive cells in hematopoietic tissues was identical or slightly increased compared with controls. Plasma concentrations of interleukin 6, interleukin 15, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 were elevated in MPN mice and reduced in the high-dose treatment group, whereas other cytokines were unchanged. Inhibitor activity after dosing was confirmed in a cell culture assay using the plasma of dosed mice and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 flow cytometry. Collectively, these results show that BMS-911543 has limited activity in this murine model of JAK2V617F-driven MPN and suggest that targeting JAK2\u00a0alone may be insufficient to achieve effective disease control.",

In this article, we have compared the ability of tranylcypromine (TCP) and a more potent TCP derivative, RN-1, to increase \u03b3-globin expression in cultured baboon erythroid progenitor cells and in the SCD mouse model.

Increased AKT1 activity is frequently seen in AML patients, providing leukemic cells with growth and survival promoting signals. An important aspect of AKT1 function is its involvement in cellular metabolism and energy production. Under some circumstances, strong activation of AKT1 increases oxidative stress, which can cause apoptosis when cells progressively build up excess free radicals. This has been described in hematopoietic cells overexpressing activated AKT1; however, whether this is true in cells coexpressing other genetic events involved in leukemia is not known. This prompted us to investigate the effect of constitutively active AKT1 (myristoylated AKT1) in hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing constitutively active signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3\u2013internal tandem duplication, or antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2. Surprisingly, myristoylated AKT1 was incompatible with proliferation driven by both signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3\u2013internal tandem duplication, which triggered cell cycle block and apoptosis. Moreover, transplantable cells of B-cell lymphoma 2\u2013transgenic mice were impaired in their engraftment ability to recipient mice when expressing hyperactivated AKT1.

Gain of function mutations, loss of function mutations, and overexpression of GATA2 have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. In previous studies, we and others showed that GATA2 overexpression at high levels, similar to that seen in hematopoietic stem cells, blocked differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. To better understand the effects of GATA2, we designed a Tamoxifen-inducible GATA2-estrogen receptor (ERT) vector. In the absence of Tamoxifen, small amounts of GATA2-ERT were still able to enter the nucleus in mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, providing us with a tool to test the effects of low-level GATA2 overexpression. We observed that this low-level GATA2 overexpression enhanced self-renewal of myeloid progenitors in\u00a0vitro and resulted in immortalization of BM cells to myeloid cell lines. Continuous GATA2-ERT expression was required for the proliferation of these immortalized lines. Myeloid expansion and a block in T and B lineage differentiation were observed in mice transplanted with GATA2-ERT-expressing BM cells. Myeloid expansion occurred after the granulocyte monocyte progenitor stage, and lymphoid block was distal to the common lymphoid progenitor in transgenic mice. GATA2 appeared to induce growth via downstream activation of Nmyc and Hoxa9. Our results demonstrate that GATA2 overexpression at low level confers self-renewal capacity to myeloid progenitors and is relevant to myeloid leukemia development.",

CD201 is a marker that is highly restricted to HSCs and progenitors, and CD27 is expressed at moderate-to-high levels on HSCs. We show here that combining CD201 and CD27 enables highly efficient isolation of long-term HSCs in NOD mice as well as in other strains, including SJL, FVB, AKR, BALB/c, C3H, and CBA.

To investigate this, we examined the immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and IgA B-cell repertoire diversity in MGUS at baseline and after influenza vaccination (n\u00a0=\u00a016) in comparison with healthy controls (HCs; n\u00a0=\u00a016). The Complementary Determining Region 3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene was amplified and B-cell spectratypes analyzed by high-resolution electrophoresis. Spectratype Gaussian distribution, kurtosis, and skewness were quantified to measure repertoire shifts. Both HC and MGUS baseline spectratypes show interindividual variability that is more pronounced in the IGHG and IGHA repertoires. Overall, baseline B-cell repertoire is more altered in MGUS, with oligoclonality observed in 50% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Postvaccination, significant differences emerged in MGUS in relation to M-protein levels. High M-protein concentration is associated with a more oligoclonal IgG and IgA response at day 7 postvaccination, and, in contrast to HCs, vaccination also induced significant perturbations in the MGUS IgM repertoire at day 7 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Monoclonal expansion in MGUS thus has an effect on the baseline B-cell repertoire and influences the recruited repertoire upon vaccination.",

     "abstract": "Clofarabine (Clo), fludarabine (Flu), and busulfan (Bu) combinations are efficacious in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myeloid leukemia. We sought to determine whether the more affordable drug cladribine (Clad) can provide a viable alternative to Clo, with or without panobinostat (Pano) and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC). Both Clad+Flu+Bu and Clo+Flu+Bu\u00a0combinations showed synergistic cytotoxicity in KBM3/Bu2506, HL60, and OCI-AML3 cell lines. Cell exposure to these drug combinations resulted in 60%\u201380% inhibition of proliferation; activation of the ATM pathway; increase in histone modifications; decrease in HDAC3, HDAC4, HDAC5 and SirT7 proteins; decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential; activation of apoptosis and stress signaling pathways; and downregulation of the AKT pathway. These drug combinations activated DNA-damage response and apoptosis in primary cell samples from AML patients. At lower concentrations of Clad/Clo, Flu, and Bu, inclusion of Pano and DAC enhanced cell killing, increased histone modifications and DNA demethylation, and increased the levels of P16/INK4a, P15/INK4b and P21/Waf1/Cip1 proteins. The observed DNA demethylating activity of Clad and Clo may complement DAC activity; increase demethylation of the gene promoters for SFRP1, DKK3, and WIF1; and cause degradation of \u03b2-catenin in cells exposed to Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu+DAC+Pano. The overlapping activities of Clad/Clo+Flu+Bu, Pano, and DAC in DNA-damage formation and repair, histone modifications, DNA demethylation, and apoptosis may underlie their synergism. Our results provide a basis for supplanting Clo with Clad and for including epigenetic modifiers in the pre\u2013hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen for myeloid leukemia patients.",

     "abstract": "Analysis of hematopoietic chimerism after allogeneic stem cell transplantation represents a crucial method to evaluate donor-cell engraftment. Whereas sensitivity of classical approaches for chimerism monitoring is limited to \u22651%, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based techniques readily detect one patient cell in >1,000 donor cells, thus facilitating application of chimerism assessment as a surrogate for minimal residual disease. However, due to methodologic specificities, qPCR combines its high sensitivity with limited resolution power in the state of mixed chimerism (e.g., >10% patient cells). Our aim was to overcome this limitation by employing a further development of qPCR, namely digital PCR (dPCR), for chimerism analysis. For proof-of-principle, we established more than 10 dPCR assays detecting Indel polymorphisms or Y-chromosome sequences and tested them on artificial cell mixtures and patient samples. Employing artificial cell mixtures, we found that dPCR allows exact quantification of chimerism over several orders of magnitude. Digital PCR results proved to be highly reproducible (deviation\u00a0<5%), particularly in the \u201cdifficult\u201d range of mixed chimerism. Excellent performance of the new assays was confirmed by analysis of multiple retrospective blood samples from patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, in comparison with established qPCR (14 patients) and short-tandem repeat PCR (4 patients) techniques. Finally, dPCR is easy to perform, needs only small amounts of DNA for chimerism assessment (65\u00a0ng corresponds to a sensitivity of approximately 0.03%), and does not require the use of standard curves and replicate analysis. In conclusion, dPCR represents a very promising method for routine chimerism monitoring.",

     "abstract": "Hepcidin is the key regulator of iron absorption and recycling, and its expression is suppressed by red blood cell production. When erythropoiesis is expanded, hepcidin expression decreases. To gain insight into the stage of erythroid differentiation at which the regulation might originate, we measured serum hepcidin levels in archived pure red cell aplasia samples from patients whose block in erythroid differentiation was well defined by hematopoietic colony assays and marrow morphologic review. Hepcidin values are high or high normal in pure red cell aplasia patients in whom erythropoiesis is inhibited prior to the proerythroblast stage, but are suppressed in patients with excess proerythroblasts and few later erythroid cells. These data suggest that the suppressive effect of erythropoietic activity on hepcidin expression can arise from proerythroblasts, the stage at which transferrin receptor 1 expression peaks, prompting the hypothesis that transferrin receptor 1 expression on erythroid precursors is a proximal mediator of the erythroid regulator of hepcidin expression. Our characterization of erythropoiesis, iron status, and hepcidin expression in mice with global or hematopoietic cell-specific haploinsufficiency of transferrin receptor 1 provides initial supporting data for this model. The regulation appears independent of erythroferrone and growth differentiation factor 15, supporting the concept that several mechanisms signal iron need in response to an expanded erythron.",

In humans, an inverse relationship between platelet counts and endogenous TPO (eTPO) concentration exists. In a CRT mouse model, eTPO was not elevated during the first 5\u00a0days after CRT treatment (the \u201ceTPO gap\u201d), then increased to a peak 10\u00a0days after each CRT treatment in an inverse relationship to platelet counts seen in humans.

Using an Atg7 hematopoietic conditional knockout mouse model, we found that loss of autophagy, a metabolic process essential in homeostasis and cellular remodeling, caused mitochondrial and cell cycle dysfunction, impeding megakaryopoiesis and megakaryocyte differentiation, as well as thrombopoiesis and subsequently produced abnormal platelets, larger in size and fewer in number, ultimately leading to severely impaired platelet production and failed hemostasis.",

However, this is only possible when a matched donor is available, making the development of gene therapy using autologous hematopoietic stem cells a highly desirable alternative. We used a culture model of human erythropoiesis to directly compare two insulated, self-inactivating, and erythroid-specific lentiviral vectors, encoding for \u03b3-globin (V5m3-400) or a modified \u03b2-globin (\u03b2AS3-FB) for production of antisickling hemoglobin (Hb) and correction of red cell deformability after deoxygenation. Bone marrow CD34+ cells from three SCD patients were transduced using V5m3-400 or \u03b2AS3-FB and compared with mock-transduced SCD or healthy donor CD34+ cells. Lentiviral transduction did not impair cell growth or differentiation, as gauged by proliferation and acquisition of erythroid markers. Vector copy number averaged approximately one copy per cell, and corrective globin mRNA levels were increased more than sevenfold over mock-transduced controls. Erythroblasts derived from healthy donor and mock-transduced SCD cells produced a low level of fetal Hb that was increased to 23.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1% per vector copy for cells transduced with V5m3-400. Equivalent levels of modified normal adult Hb of 17.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8% per vector copy were detected for SCD cells transduced with \u03b2AS3-FB. These levels of antisickling Hb production were sufficient to reduce sickling of terminal-stage red blood cells upon deoxygenation.

Here we show that dasatinib leads to a reduced number of human CD19+ peripheral B cells owing to a strong induction of apoptosis. In contrast, no similar effect on T-cell viability was observed. However, dasatinib induced a comparable broad inhibition of the early events of B- and T-cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, dasatinib was shown to be a more pronounced inhibitor of both basal and B-cell receptor\u2013induced activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and PLC\u03b32 compared with the more specific Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Human progenitor B cells from the pre-B stage were sensitive to dasatinib. In an in\u00a0vivo murine model, dasatinib reduced B-lineage cells in the bone marrow with a marked effect on the pre-B subpopulation. Dasatinib led to a reduced spleen size, with a loss of large immature transitional immunoglobulin M+/immunoglobulin D\u2212 B cells and a reduction in germinal center B cells. Dasatinib caused a marked loss of thymocytes without affecting myeloid lineage cells or hematopoietic progenitors.

The antiplatelet antibody was derived from the sera of guinea pigs immunized with the platelets of BALB/c mice. Mice with ITP were treated with PDS-C at a low, a moderate, or a high dose for 10 consecutive days. We observed that the peripheral blood platelet counts of ITP mice were significantly higher than that of ITP controls (untreated) after treatment of PDS-C in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with PDS-C also increased the mature megakaryocytes in the bone marrow of treated ITP animals with a concomitant decease of immature megakaryocyte precursors. Furthermore, macrophage phagocytosis of exogenous erythrocytes in the intra-abdominal cavity of ITP mice was inhibited by PDS-C treatment, indicating that PDS-C also could modulate immune function and may possibly prevent phagocytosis of antibody-coated platelets. Altogether, our findings suggest that PDS-C may have a dual role, promoting proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, as well as modulating immune function, and it may therefore be very helpful in the treatment of ITP.",

We designed the ASO primers and produced sufficient PCR fragments to evaluate tumor burden in 20 of 30 bone marrow samples at diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction amplification efficiency depended on primer sequences because the production of ASO-PCR fragments did not correlate with serum M-protein levels. However, the ASO-PCR levels in BMMNCs showed statistically significant correlations with those in PBMNCs and CD20+CD38\u2212 B-cells. The good association between the BMMNC and PBMNC data indicated that PBMNCs could be a suitable source for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD). In the case of cell-free DNA, ASO-PCR levels showed a unique pattern and remained high even after treatment. Because the sequence information for each ASO-PCR product was\u00a0identical to the original, the cell-free DNA might also be useful for evaluating MRD. Moreover, the ASO-PCR products were clearly detected in 17 of 22 mRNA samples from CD20+CD38\u2212 populations, suggesting that MM clones might exist in relatively earlier stages of B cells than in plasma cells. Thus, ASO-PCR analysis using various clinical materials is useful for detecting MRD in MM patients as well as for clarifying MM pathogenesis.",

We observed a rapid and significant increase of TXNIP transcript and protein levels in mouse erythroleukemia cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylene bisacetamide, inducers of erythroid differentiation. The upregulation of TXNIP was not abrogated by addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. The increase of TXNIP expression was confirmed in another model of erythroid differentiation, G1E-ER cells, which undergo differentiation upon activation of the GATA1 transcription factor. In addition, we showed that TXNIP levels are induced following inhibition of p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)\u00a0mitogen-activated protein kinases.

To identify molecules that modulate hepcidin expression, we developed a bioassay system for hepcidin gene (HAMP) promoter activity by stable transfection of Hep3B hepatoma cells with an expression plasmid in which EGFP was linked to a 2.5-kb human HAMP promoter. Interleukin 6, bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6), and oncostatin M, well-characterized stimulators of the HAMP promoter, strongly enhanced the green fluorescence intensity of these cells. Dorsomorphin, heparin, and cobalt chloride, known inhibitors of hepcidin expression, significantly suppressed green fluorescence intensity, and these inhibitory effects were more prominent when the cells were stimulated with BMP-6. Employing this system, we screened 1,280 biologically active small molecules and found several candidate inhibitors of hepcidin expression. Apomorphine, benzamil, etoposide, CGS-15943, kenpaullone, and rutaecarpine (all at 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) significantly inhibited hepcidin mRNA expression by Hep3B cells without affecting cell viability.

We have shown that hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) promote the development of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The HSC-induced MDSCs are potent regulators of T-cell and B-cell responses. Here we show that MDSCs can be propagated from hemophilia A mouse bone marrow cells in coculture with HSCs. These cells exhibit a suppressive phenotype and display a marked ability to inhibit T-cell proliferation induced by dendritic cells in response to F.VIII. MDSCs can also inhibit proliferation and activation of B cells stimulated by immunoglobulin M and interleukin 4. Administration of HSC-induced MDSCs induces CD4+ T cell and B220+ B-cell hyporesponsiveness to F.VIII and reduces inhibitor formation in hemophilia A mice.

In cell lines and murine models p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) overexpression can be induced by the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 4 and 7/8 ligands Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and R848. Ex\u00a0vivo exposure of FA stem cells to TNF-\u03b1 suppresses their replication and selects preleukemic clones. Here we show that inhibition of p38 MAPK also reduces TLR4 and 7/8-mediated TNF-\u03b1 production in primary human FA complementation group A (FANCA)-deficient monocytes from nine patients and demonstrate that, while p38 MAPK inhibition also enhances clonal growth of FANCA-deficient erythroid progenitors, the effect was mediated indirectly by the influence of the inhibitor on auxiliary cells, not erythroid colony-forming units themselves.

We have previously shown that C/EBP\u03b1-K304_R323dup belonging to C/EBP\u03b1-Cm, but not C/EBP\u03b1-T60fsX159 belonging to C/EBP\u03b1-Nm, alone induced AML in mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models. Here we show that various C/EBP\u03b1-Cm mutations have a similar, but not identical, potential in myeloid leukemogenesis. Notably, like C/EBP\u03b1-K304_R323dup, any type of C/EBP\u03b1-Cm tested (C/EBP\u03b1-S299_K304dup, K313dup, or N321D) by itself induced AML, albeit with different latencies after BMT; C/EBP\u03b1-N321D induced AML with the shortest latency. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of C/EBP\u03b1-N321D- and mock-transduced c-kit+Sca-1+Lin\u2212 cells, we identified Csf1r as a gene downregulated by C/EBP\u03b1-N321D. In addition, leukemic cells expressing C/EBP\u03b1-Cm exhibited low levels of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor in mice. On the other hand, transduction with C/EBP\u03b1-Nm did not influence Csf1r expression in c-kit+Sca-1+Lin\u2212 cells, implying a unique role for C/EBP\u03b1-Cm in downregulating Csf1r. Importantly, Csf1r overexpression collaborated with C/EBP\u03b1-N321D to induce fulminant AML with leukocytosis in mouse BMT models to a greater extent than did C/EBP\u03b1-N321D alone. Collectively, these results suggest that C/EBP\u03b1-Cm-mediated downregulation of Csf1r has a negative, rather than a positive, impact on the progression of AML involving C/EBP\u03b1-Cm, which might possibly be accelerated by additional genetic and/or epigenetic alterations inducing Csf1r upregulation.",

To study the role of LARP4B in AML, we established a LARP4B-knockdown MLL-AF9 AML mouse model. Using this mouse model, we found that LARP4B knockdown significantly decreased leukemia cells in the peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow and prolonged the survival of AML recipient mice. Additional studies showed that LARP4B knockdown reduced leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and impaired the self-renew capacity of LSCs. Cell cycle analysis revealed that LARP4B knockdown arrested more LSCs in the G0 phase. The transcription of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p19, and p21 and of the lineage-specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 was increased in the LARP4B-knockdown LSCs. Thus, our results demonstrate that LARP4B plays an important role in the maintenance of LSCs and suggest that LARP4B may regulate the cell cycle of LSCs via suppressing the expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p16, p19, and p21 and the myeloid specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein \u03b1.",

Zebrafish mutants and knockdown studies in human and mouse cells have implicated a role for HSPA9 in hematopoiesis. To comprehensively evaluate the effects of Hspa9 haploinsufficiency on hematopoiesis, we generated an Hspa9 knockout mouse model. Although homozygous knockout of Hspa9 is embryonically lethal, mice with heterozygous deletion of Hspa9 (Hspa9+/\u2212) are viable and have a 50% reduction in Hspa9 expression. Hspa9+/\u2212 mice have normal basal hematopoiesis and do not develop MDS.

Here, we report the effects of artemisinin on erythroid development and apoptosis in zebrafish and human cells. By performing a small-molecule screen with zebrafish embryos, we found that artemisinin treatment depleted red blood cells and slightly decreased definitive hematopoietic stem cells, but had no effect on primitive hematopoietic progenitors. RNA-Seq revealed that artemisinin suppressed a cluster of genes in the heme biosynthesis and globin synthesis pathways. Furthermore, artemisinin induced apoptosis in erythrocytes in zebrafish embryos, as assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, and preferentially acted on differentiated erythrocytes by elevating caspase 8 and caspase 9 activity in differentiated human K562 cells. Consistently, artemisinin suppressed the ectopic expression of erythroid genes in jak2aV581F-injected embryos, a zebrafish model for human polycythemia vera in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.

The severity of these common adverse effects is directly related to the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatibility. In addition to the key role of classic HLA matching in influencing HSCT outcome, several lines of evidence suggest an important role for nonclassic major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, HLA-E. The interaction of HLA-E with NKG2A, its main receptor on natural killer cells, modulates cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production, an important role in innate immune responses. In addition, the HLA-E molecule can present peptides to different subtypes of T cells that may either support graft-versus-leukemia effects or be involved in bridging innate and acquired immunity. To date, the role of HLA-E and its polymorphisms in HSCT outcomes such as graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related mortality, and improved survival has been published by a number of groups. In addition, these data suggest an association between HLA-E polymorphisms and relapse.

Toll-like receptors (\u0422LRs) connect the innate and adaptive immune responses and represent a significant and potentially linking element between inflammation and cancer. When TLRs bind to their ligands, they trigger two major signaling pathways such that both share overlapping downstream signals: one is a myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-dependent production and activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB, whereas the other is a MyD88-independent production of type-I interferon. Whereas the MyD88 pathway results in proinflammatory cytokine production, the other pathway stimulates cell proliferation. Dysregulations of these pathways may eventually lead to abnormal cell proliferation and MM. Despite recent biomedical advances, MM continues to be an incurable disease. There are an increasing number of TLR-based therapeutic approaches currently being tested in a number of preclinical and clinical studies.

We compared the effect of a bortezomib-based treatment (arm B) with that of a treatment without bortezomib (arm A) on different genetic patient subgroups in a series of 273 cases of newly diagnosed MM. These patients were enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial (BDH 2008/02). A subgroup of patients exhibiting little benefit from bortezomib treatment was identified. These patients had at least one of the following characteristics: del(17p13), 1q21 gain, or high lactate dehydrogenase levels. In this subgroup, survival of patients treated with bortezomib was comparable (progression-free survival: 14.0 vs. 15.0\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.992; overall survival: 21.0 vs. 14.0\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.472) to that of patients undergoing thalidomide-based treatment.

Here we reported BAG-1 upregulation in 87 of 99 analyzed AML patients with respect to healthy control samples applying reverse phase protein assay. Silencing of BAG-1 expression confirmed a decreased BCL-2 protein level but, in addition, provoked the increased transcription of GADD34 stress sensor. Furthermore, a dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, as well as alteration of expression of IRE-1 and CHOP proteins, were documented, suggesting that a disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response was provoked by downregulation of BAG-1. A similar phenomenon was triggered after addition of Thioflavin S, which was shown to block BAG-1/BCL-2 interaction and to increase cell death, enforcing a prosurvival role of the BAG-1 protein in AML. Interestingly, synergic cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin, VP16 drugs, and ABT-737 compound were observed when Thioflavin S was coupled with these drugs.

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3\u2013ITD mutations result in a mislocalized and constitutively activated receptor, which aberrantly phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and upregulates the expression of its target genes. c-Cbl is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates RTKs, including FLT3, but whether it can downregulate mislocalized FLT3-ITD remains to be resolved. To help clarify this, we combined a FLT3-ITD mutation with a loss-of-function mutation in the RING finger domain of c-Cbl that abolishes its E3 ligase activity. Mice transplanted with hematopoietic stem cells expressing both mutations rapidly develop myeloid leukemia, indicating strong cooperation between the two. Although the c-Cbl mutation was shown to cause hyperactivation of another RTK, c-Kit, it had no effect on enhancing FLT3-ITD protein levels or STAT5 activation. This indicates that c-Cbl does not downregulate FLT3-ITD and that the leukemia is driven by independent pathways involving FLT3-ITD's activation of STAT5 and mutant c-Cbl's activation of other RTKs, such as c-Kit. This study highlights the importance of c-Cbl's negative regulation of wild-type RTKs in suppressing FLT3-ITD\u2013driven myeloid leukemia.",

Next, we determined expression of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), which phosphorylates clofarabine to exert cytotoxicity, in clofarabine-sensitive and -resistant cells. Clofarabine-resistant cells showed significantly decreased expression of dCK RNA when compared with sensitive cells. To elucidate the mechanisms of decreased dCK expression in clofarabine-resistant cells, we analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands of the dCK promoter and found no differences in methylation status between clofarabine-sensitive and -resistant cells.

In directly fixed materials, erythroblasts exhibited signs of autophagy with limited apoptosis (<3%) based on ultrastructural characteristics and immunogold labeling for activated caspase-3.

Here, we show that autophagy is essential to maintain and regulate the cell cycle of HSPCs in a nutrient-dependent manner. The loss of autophagy via conditional deletion of its essential gene atg7 ablated the cell cycle of HSPCs. Under physiologic or nutrient-rich conditions, the in\u00a0vivo activation of autophagy promoted the cell cycle entry of hematopoietic stem cells and upregulated cyclin D3 expression in HSPCs. In contrast, under poor nutrient conditions, the ex\u00a0vivo inhibition of early, but not late, autophagy signaling events enhanced the G1/S transition of HSPCs. Cyclin D3 was downregulated in HSPCs in response to nutrient stress. A knockdown of cyclin D3 blocked the G1/S transition in HSPCs. Surprisingly, the ex\u00a0vivo inhibition of starvation-induced early, but not late, autophagy signaling inhibited the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of cyclin D3 in HSPCs. Furthermore, a conditional autophagy defect also had this effect, leading to an elevated cyclin D3 level in these cells. This suggested a dependency of the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D3 on early, but not late, events in autophagy signaling under nutrient stress in HSPCs. Our results thus indicate a dual role of autophagy in the nutrient-dependent modulation of the cell cycle entry of hematopoietic stem cells and G1/S transition of HSPCs via the regulation of cyclin D3 to maintain a proper cell cycle in HSPCs and normal hematopoiesis during adult life.",

Its therapy is not well-defined. We established allele-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) monoclonal antibodies (ASHmAbs) that specifically target HLA molecules, with steady death of target-expressing cells. One such ASHmAb, against HLA-A*02:01 (A2-kASHmAb), was examined in a xenogeneic GVHD mouse model. To induce fatal GVHD, non-irradiated NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R\u03b3null mice were injected with healthy donor human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, some expressing HLA-A*02:01, some not. Administration of A2-kASHmAb promoted the survival of mice injected with HLA-A*02:01-expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and, in humanized NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R\u03b3null mice, immediately cleared HLA-A*02:01-expressing human blood cells from mouse peripheral blood. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were again detectable in mouse blood 2 to 4\u00a0weeks after A2-kASHmAb administration, suggesting that kASHmAb may be safely administered to GVHD patients without permanently ablating the graft. This approach, different from those in existing GVHD pharmacotherapy, may open a new door for treatment of GVHD in HLA-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

     "abstract": "B-cell malignancies are a common type of cancer. One approach to cancer therapy is to either increase oxidative stress or inhibit the stress response systems on which cancer cells rely. In this study, we combined nontoxic concentrations of Auranofin (AUR), an inhibitor of the thioredoxin system, with nontoxic concentrations of buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), a compound that reduces intracellular glutathione levels, and investigated the effect of this drug combination on multiple pathways critical for malignant B-cell survival. Auranofin interacted synergistically with BSO at low concentrations to trigger death in multiple malignant B-cell lines and primary mantle-cell lymphoma cells. Additionally, there was less toxicity toward normal B cells. Low AUR concentrations inhibited thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity, an effect significantly increased by BSO cotreatment. Overexpression of TrxR partially reversed AUR+BSO toxicity. Interestingly, the combination of AUR+BSO inhibited nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling. Moreover, synergistic cell death induced by this regimen was attenuated in cells overexpressing NF-\u03baB proteins, arguing for a functional role for NF-\u03baB inhibition in AUR+BSO-mediated cell death. Together, these findings suggest that AUR+BSO synergistically induces malignant B-cell death, a process mediated by dual inhibition of TrxR and NF-\u03baB, and such an approach warrants further investigation in B-cell malignancies.",

We demonstrated that both splenic and peripheral blood (PB) MF CD34+ cells equally share a defective ability to home to the marrow, but not to the spleens, of NOD/LtSz-Prkdcscid mice. This trafficking pattern could not be attributed to discordant expression of integrins or chemokine receptors other than the downregulation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 by both PB and splenic MF CD34+ cells. The number of both splenic MF CD34+ cells and HPCs that migrated toward splenic MF plasma was, however, significantly greater than the number that migrated toward PB\u00a0MF plasma. The concentration of the intact HSC/HPC chemoattractant C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) was greater in splenic MF plasma than PB\u00a0MF plasma, as quantified using mass spectrometry. Functionally inactive truncated products of CXCL12, which are the product of proteolytic degradation by serine proteases, were detected at similar levels in both splenic and PB\u00a0MF plasma. Treatment with an anti-CXCL12 neutralizing antibody resulted in a reduction in the degree of migration of splenic MF CD34+ cells toward both PB and splenic MF plasma, validating the role of CXCL12 as a functional chemoattractant. Our data indicate that the MF splenic microenvironment is characterized by increased levels of intact, functional CXCL12, which contributes to the localization of MF CD34+ cells to the spleen and the establishment of extramedullary hematopoiesis.",

Hematopoietic cells derived from mouse fetal livers were expanded by two successive cultures without the use of exogenous cytokines, namely, 3D cultures of stromal cells (DAS 104-8 cell line) to form stromal layers within the scaffolds, and, subsequently, by cocultures of the HCs on the stromal cell layers for 2\u00a0weeks. To expand the HCs more conveniently, in some experiments the stromal layers formed within the scaffolds were frozen (3D freezing) before the cocultures, then stored and applied to the cocultures after thawing. When the HCs were cocultured on the stromal layers of the DAS 104-8 cells, primitive HCs (c-kit+ and CD34+ cells) were expanded several fold during the cocultures. In contrast, the expansion of these primitive HCs was remarkably enhanced in the cocultures using the 3D frozen-thawed DAS 104-8 stromal layers (c-kit+ cells > fifteenfold and CD34+ cells > thirtyfold), and these expansions were significantly higher than those without the 3D freezing. The expansions enhanced by cocultures on the 3D frozen-thawed stromal layers were also observed in the cocultures with another stromal cell line (DAS 104-4). Because 3D frozen-thawed stromal cell lines are easy to handle, 3D coculture of HCs on frozen-thawed stromal cell lines may be an effective and convenient method for expanding primitive HCs.",

In developing a new animal model in adult African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), we needed to distinguish nucleated thrombocytes and their progenitors from other blood cells, because the cellular morphology of activated thrombocytes resembles lymphocytes and other cells. We initially generated two monoclonal antibodies, T5 and T12, to X. laevis thrombocytes. Whereas T5 recognized both thrombocytes and leukocytes, T12 specifically reacted to spindle-shaped thrombocytes. The T12+ thrombocytes displayed much higher DNA ploidy than nucleated erythrocytes, and they expressed CD41 and Fli-1. In the presence of CaCl2, adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, or various collagens, T12+ thrombocytes exhibited aggregation. These thrombocytes were located predominantly in the hepatic sinusoids and the splenic red pulp, suggesting that both organs are the sites of thrombopoiesis. Notably, circulating thrombocytes exhibited lower DNA ploidy than hepatic thrombocytes. Intraperitoneal administration of T12 produced immune thrombocytopenia in frogs, which reached a nadir 4 days postinjection, followed by recovery, suggesting that humoral regulation maintained the number of circulating thrombocytes. Although differences between MKs and thrombocytes in X. laevis remain to be defined, our results provide further insight into MK development and thrombopoiesis in vertebrates.",

Mature adipocytes were isolated from human omental and subcutaneous fat and were dedifferentiated in\u00a0vitro. The resulting cells were subcultivated for endothelial differentiation and were analyzed for their expression of specific genes and proteins. Endothelial-like cells were harvested from the differentiation medium and were traditionally cultured to evaluate the endothelial markers and the karyotype. Cells cultured in specific medium formed tube-like structures and expressed several endothelial marker genes and proteins. The endothelial-like cells expressed significantly higher levels of vascular endothelium growth factor receptor 2, vascular endothelial cadherin, Von Willebrand factor, and CD133 than the untreated cells. These cells were positively stained for CD31 and vascular endothelial cadherin, markers of mature endothelial cells. Moreover, the low-density lipoprotein\u2013uptake assay demonstrated a functionally endothelial differentiation of these cells. When these cells were harvested and reseeded in basal medium, they lost the endothelial markers and reacquired the typical mesenchymal stem cell markers and the ability to expand in a short time period. Moreover, karyotype analysis showed that these cells reverted into an immature phase without any karyotype alterations. In conclusion, the results showed that adipocytes exhibited a great plasticity toward the endothelial lineage, suggesting their possible use in cell therapy applications for vascular disease.",

In AL, we observed a slower dynamics toward complete chimerism (CC) than in PB (p = 0.042), while no significant differences were found between TL and PB (p = 0.12). Complete chimerism achievement in AL at day +30 has shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of grade II\u2013IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 11.9 [1.5\u201391.7]; p = 0.017).

Interleukin 21 blockade enhanced regulatory T and T helper (Th) 2 cell differentiation and inhibited Th1-\u00a0and Th17-derived transcription factors and cytokines as a modulator of activated T-cells. Interleukin 21-/- cell recipients showed increased mature B- and marginal-zone B-cells, but decreased memory B-cells, germinal center formation, and plasma cells that did not lead to immunoglobulin production. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are involved in the induction and maintenance of T- and B-cell responses. We observed decreased levels of only BAFF during acute GVHD and confirmed that mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 was reduced by the BAFF/BAFF-receptor pathway.

Consistent with such a mechanism, ALPs express higher levels of CSF1R transcripts than their upstream precursors, yet show limited cell-surface protein expression of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). All-lymphoid progenitors and other hematopoietic progenitors deficient in A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17), display elevated cell surface CSF1R expression. ADAM17--/-- ALPs, however, fail to yield myeloid cells upon transplantation into irradiated recipients. Moreover, ADAM17--/-- ALPs yield fewer macrophages in\u00a0vitro than control ALPs at high concentrations of macrophage colony stimulating factor. Mice with hematopoietic-specific deletion of ADAM17 have normal numbers of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and mature cells in\u00a0vivo.

Interestingly, a potential benefit of using SALL4 to facilitate ex\u00a0vivo hematopoietic stem cell expansion has been proposed. However, distinct roles for how SALL4 contributes to normal versus malignant processes remain undefined. Here we show that SALL4b is the predominant isoform in murine hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. Overexpression of either SALL4 isoform in hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors impairs hematopoietic colony formation and expansion in\u00a0vitro. Lineage-negative bone marrow overexpressing SALL4b fails to engraft and reconstitute hematopoiesis when transplanted. We found that both SALL4a and SALL4b overexpression impair hematopoiesis, in part through dose-dependent repression of BMI1. Additionally, we have identified the following potential novel SALL4 target genes in hematopoiesis: ARID5B (SALL4a and SALL4b), EZH2, and KLF2 (SALL4a). Lastly, we found that SALL4 expression is variable in acute myeloid leukemia, ranging from no expression to levels comparable to embryonic stem cells. These results show that SALL4 isoforms contribute to only a subset of acute myeloid leukemia and that overexpression of SALL4 isoforms impairs hematopoiesis through repression of BMI1.

CALMHET hematopoietic cells are more sensitive in\u00a0vitro to iron chelators than their wild type counterparts. Iron chelation also displayed toxicity toward cultured CALMHETCALM-AF10 leukemia cells, and this effect was additive to that of chemotherapy.

In response to nutrients and growth factors, mTORC1 is known to control cellular growth by regulating the translational regulators S6 kinase 1 and 4E binding protein 1, whereas mTORC2 mediates cell proliferation and survival by activating Akt through phosphorylation at Ser473. Studies have shown that the deregulation of mTORC2 leads to the development of myeloproliferative disorder and leukemia in the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)-deleted mouse model. However, the mechanism by which mTORC2 specifically affects leukemogenesis is still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of mTORC2 in NOTCH1-driven T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in a Rictor-deficient mouse model. We found that, by deleting Rictor, an essential component of mTORC2, leukemia progression was significantly suppressed by arresting a greater proportion of Rictor\u25b3/\u25b3 leukemic cells at the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, the absence of Rictor led to the overexpression of chemotaxis-related genes, such as CCR2, CCR4 and CXCR4, which contributed to the homing and migration of Rictor-deficient T-ALL cells to the spleen but not the bone marrow. In addition, we demonstrated that inactivation of mTORC2 caused the overexpression of forkhead box O3 and its downstream effectors and eased the progression of leukemia in T-ALL mice. Our study thus indicates that forkhead box O3 could be a potential drug target for the treatment of T-ALL leukemia.",

     "abstract": "Overexpression of protein-tyrosine phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) has been identified in about 50% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mechanism of regulation of PRL-3 remains obscure. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a latent transcriptional factor, has also been often found to be activated in AML. We first identified STAT3-consensus-binding sites in the promoter of PRL-3 genes. Then we experimentally validated the direct binding and transcriptional activation. We applied shRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression approaches in STAT3\u2212/\u2212 liver cells and leukemic cells to validate the functional regulation of PRL-3 by STAT3. A STAT3 core signature, derived through data mining from publicly available gene expression data, was employed to correlate PRL-3 expression in large AML patient samples. We discovered that STAT3 binds to the \u2212201 to \u2212210 region of PRL-3, which was conserved between human and mouse. Importantly, PRL-3 protein was significantly reduced in mouse STAT3-knockout liver cells compared with STAT3\u2013wild type counterparts, and ectopic expression of STAT3 in these cells led to a pronounced increase in PRL-3 protein. We demonstrated that STAT3 functionally regulated PRL-3, and STAT3 core signature was enriched in AML with high PRL-3 expression. Targeting either STAT3 or PRL-3 reduced leukemic cell viability. Silencing PRL-3 impaired invasiveness and induced leukemic cell differentiation. In conclusion, PRL-3 was transcriptionally regulated by STAT3. The STAT3/PRL-3 regulatory loop contributes to the pathogenesis of AML, and it might represent an attractive therapeutic target for antileukemic therapy.",

     "abstract": "Iron homeostasis is a dynamic process that is tightly controlled to balance iron uptake, storage, and export. Reduction of dietary iron from the ferric to the ferrous form is required for uptake by solute carrier family 11 (proton-coupled divalent metal ion transporters), member 2 (Slc11a2) into the enterocytes. Both processes are proton dependent and have led to the suggestion of the importance of acidic gastric pH for the absorption of dietary iron. Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E, member 2 (KCNE2), in combination with potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ1), form a gastric potassium channel essential for gastric acidification. Deficiency of either Kcne2 or Kcnq1 results in achlorhydia, gastric hyperplasia, and neoplasia, but the impact on iron absorption has not, to our knowledge, been investigated. Here we report that Kcne2-deficient mice, in addition to the previously reported phenotypes, also present with iron-deficient anemia. Interestingly, impaired function of KCNQ1 results in iron-deficient anemia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome patients.

     "abstract": "Iron cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in iron overload. Men have twice the mortality rate of women, though the cause is unknown. In hemojuvelin-knockout mice, a model of the disease, males load more cardiac iron than females. We postulated that sex differences in cardiac iron import cause differences in cardiac iron concentration. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA of cardiac iron transporters in hemojuvelin-knockout mice. No sex differences were discovered among putative importers of nontransferrin-bound iron (L-type and T-type calcium channels, ZRT/IRT-like protein 14 zinc channels). Transferrin-bound iron transporters were also analyzed; these are controlled by the iron regulatory element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) system. There was a positive relationship between cardiac iron and ferroportin mRNA in both sexes, but it was significantly steeper in females (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Transferrin receptor 1 and divalent metal\u00a0transporter 1 were more highly expressed in females than males (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively), consistent with their lower cardiac iron levels, as predicted by IRE/IRP regulatory pathways. Light-chain ferritin showed a positive correlation with cardiac iron that was nearly identical in males and females (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; R2\u00a0=\u00a00.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively), whereas heavy-chain ferritin was constitutively expressed in both sexes. This represents the first report of IRE/IRP regulatory pathways in the heart. Transcriptional regulation of ferroportin was suggested in both sexes, creating a potential mechanism for differential set points for iron export. Constitutive heavy-chain\u2013ferritin expression suggests a logical limit to cardiac iron buffering capacity at levels known to produce heart failure in humans.",

These cells had wild-type c-KIT, which expressed AML1/ETO at a low level, and could differentiate into mature blood cells, suggesting that they may be the persistent preleukemic stem cells. Microarray analysis suggested that mutated c-KIT signaling provides LSCs with enhanced survival and proliferation. Thus, in t(8;21) AML, the acquisition of AML1/ETO is not sufficient, and the subsequent upregulation of AML1/ETO and the additional c-KIT mutant signaling are critical steps for transformation into LSCs.",

Hematopoietic stem cells are the suspected disease-initiating cells, and these cells must acquire a clonal advantage relative to nonmutant hematopoietic stem cells to perpetuate disease. In 2005, several groups identified a single gain-of-function point mutation in JAK2 that associated with the majority of MPNs, and subsequent studies have led to a comprehensive understanding of the mutational landscape in MPNs. However, confusion still exists as to how a single genetic aberration can be associated with multiple distinct disease entities. Many explanations have been proposed, including JAK2V617F homozygosity, individual patient heterogeneity, and the differential regulation of downstream JAK2 signaling pathways. Several groups have made knock-in mouse models expressing JAK2V617F and have observed divergent phenotypes, each recapitulating some aspects of disease. Intriguingly, most of these models do not observe a strong hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal advantage compared with wild-type littermate controls, raising the question of how a clonal advantage is established in patients with MPNs. This review summarizes the current molecular understanding of MPNs and the diversity of disease phenotypes and proposes that the increased proliferation induced by JAK2V617F applies a selection pressure on the mutant clone that results in highly diverse clonal evolution in individuals.",

This results in significant depletion of all miRNAs from the proerythroblast stage onwards, with one exception, miR-451, which is processed by Ago2 in a Dicer-independent manner. We observed that mature Dicer-dependent miRNAs, like miR-451, are dispensable under steady-state conditions, but these mutants have an impaired response to stress erythropoiesis, as demonstrated by a delay in recovery from anemia. This defect was specific to later maturing erythroid cells, as progenitor numbers were unaffected.

     "abstract": "Bone disease, characterized by the presence of lytic lesions and osteoporosis is the hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM). Stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) and its receptor, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), has been implicated as a regulator of bone resorption, suggesting that agents that can suppress SDF1\u03b1/CXCR4 signaling might inhibit osteoclastogenesis, a process closely linked to bone resorption. We, therefore, investigated whether gambogic acid (GA), a xanthone, could inhibit CXCR4 signaling and suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by MM cells. Through docking studies we predicted that GA directly interacts with CXCR4. This xanthone down-regulates the expression of CXCR4 on MM\u00a0cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The down-regulation of CXCR4 was not due to proteolytic degradation, but rather GA suppresses CXCR4 mRNA expression by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) DNA binding. This was further confirmed by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, as GA inhibits p65 binding at the CXCR4 promoter. GA suppressed SDF-1\u03b1-induced chemotaxis of MM\u00a0cells and downstream signaling of CXCR4 by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt, p38, and Erk1/2 in MM\u00a0cells. GA abrogated the RANKL-induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, we found that MM\u00a0cells induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts, and that GA suppressed this process. Importantly, suppression of osteoclastogenesis by GA was mediated through IL-6 inhibition. Overall, our results show that GA is a novel inhibitor of CXCR4 expression and has a strong potential to suppress osteoclastogenesis mediated by MM\u00a0cells.",

We investigated the pro-apoptotic effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on MM\u00a0cell lines (U266, INA-6, LR5-8226, LIG, and MCC2) and primary malignant plasma cells from na\u00efve and refractory/relapsed patients. We evaluated the transcriptional and ultrastructural events leading to autophagy by measuring Beclin-1 and p62 levels and transmission electronic microscopy. Autophagy was inhibited by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), whereas the ability of Dex-resistant MM\u00a0cells to recover the susceptibility to apoptosis was measured. A direct relationship between autophagy and Beclin-1 or LC3/Atg8 levels was observed, whereas their mRNAs were inversely correlated to p62 expression. Starvation strongly activated autophagy by inducing cellular, transcriptional, and ultrastructural modifications that were reversed by HCQ. Taken together, these data suggest that autophagy is a potential mechanism leading to drug resistance in MM, and suggest Beclin-1 and p62 as early markers of cell susceptibility to apoptosis. The combination of HCQ with novel agents may thus be considered to improve the therapeutic response in relapsed/resistant MM patients.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for proper functioning of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Members of the miRNA-125 family (consisting of miR-125a, miR-125b1, and miR-125b2) are known to confer a proliferative advantage on cells upon overexpression, to decrease the rate of apoptosis by targeting proapoptotic genes, and to promote differentiation toward the myeloid lineage in mice. However, many distinct biological effects of the three miR-125 species have been reported as well. In the current study, we set out to assess whether the three miRNA-125s that carry identical seed sequences could be functionally different. Our data show that overexpression of each of the three miR-125 family members preserves HSPCs in a primitive state in\u00a0vitro, results in a competitive advantage upon serial transplantation, and promotes skewing toward the myeloid lineage. All miR-125 family members decreased the pool of phenotypically defined Lin\u2212Sca+Kit+CD48\u2212CD150+ long-term hematopoietic stem cells, simultaneously increasing the self-renewal activity upon secondary transplantation. The downregulation of miR-125s in hematopoietic stem cells abolishes these effects and impairs long-term contribution to blood cell production. The introduction of a point mutation within the miRNA-125 seed sequence abolishes all abovementioned effects and leads to the restoration of normal hematopoiesis. Our results show that all miR-125 family members are similar in function, they likely operate in a seed-sequence-dependent manner, and they induce a highly comparable hematopoietic phenotype.",

By in situ immunohistochemical analyses, IDO expression was measured in colon mucosal mononuclear cells (MNCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in GVHD areas.

Osteoblasts regulate HSPCs under steady-state and also under stress conditions, when HSPCs undergo numerous cycles of expansion. We hypothesized that osteoblasts could provide better stimulation for the expansion of multipotent HSPCs and subsequent hematopoietic recovery than mesenchymal stromal cells. Hence, we assessed the growth and engraftment modulatory activities of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived osteoblasts (M-OSTs) on hematopoietic progenitors. Mesenchymal stromal cells and M-OSTs favored the maintenance of CD34+ cells. The expansion of cord blood CD34+ cells and myeloid progenitors was highest in cultures supplemented with unfiltered M-OST-conditioned medium (M-OST CM). In addition, increased expression of cell surface receptors important for the homing of progenitors to the bone marrow, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1, was observed in CM-based cultures. Additionally, M-OST CM positively modulated the engraftment properties of expanded progenitors. Most notably, although human platelet levels remained steady in the first 2\u00a0weeks in mice transplanted with HSPCs expanded in standard medium, levels in mice transplanted with M-OST CM HSPCs rose continuously. Consistent with this, short-term human progenitor reconstitution was consistently greater in M-OST recipients. Finally, cytokine array-based profiling revealed increases in insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, chemokines, and myeloid stimulating cytokines in M-OST CM. In conclusion, this study suggests that M-OSTs represent a new underappreciated source of feeder cells for the expansion of HSPCs with enhanced thrombopoietic activity.",

In contrast to specific pathogen-free bred laboratory mice, the immune system of humans has been in repeated contact with numerous pathogens, resulting in a broad memory-T-cell repertoire. Crossreactivity of the virus-specific memory-T-cell pool against alloantigens has been described in a phenomenon called heterologous immunity. In this study, we demonstrate, in a murine stem cell transplantation model, that heterologous immunity is likely to be an important barrier for the induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism after immunologic conditioning in the absence of cytoreduction.

Here we report that the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is an ideal candidate gene on which to base a hematopoietic reporter. CD45 regulatory elements were discovered by analyzing transcription factor chromatin occupancy (ChIP-seq) and promoter nuclease sensitivity (DNase-seq) to identify minimally sufficient sequences required for expression. After cloning the CD45 regulatory elements into an attenuated lentiviral backbone, we found that two transcriptional initiation regions were essential for high-level expression. Expressing CD45 promoters containing these regions and tethered to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a primary B-cell differentiation assay and a transplantation model resulted in high levels of GFP in lymphoid, myeloid, and nucleated erythroid cells in mouse and human blood cell lineages. Moreover, GFP levels remained high 5\u00a0months after secondary transplantation, indicating persistence of the reporter. No CD45-driven GFP expression is observed after fibroblast or embryonic stem cell transduction.

These specialized antigen-presenting cells are essential for inducing and boosting specific T-cell responses against pathogens and malignancies. Targeted therapy with SFK inhibitors holds great promise as a direct anti-cancer treatment, but potentially also as an indirect treatment via immunomodulation. Here, we investigated whether the BCR\u2013ABL/SRC inhibitor dasatinib would modulate the major effector functions of DCs, especially their migration, a prerequisite to interaction with lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs. We report for the first time that dasatinib more than doubled the number of mature human monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) migrating toward a CCL19 gradient despite unchanged CCR7 expression when used for pretreatment. These effects were caused by dephosphorylation of SFKs, as confirmed by the specific SFK inhibitor SRC inhibitor 1, leading to dephosphorylation of the inhibitory immunoreceptors Siglec-9 and Siglec-3. The specific blocking of the latter also enhanced migration and underlined the importance of these SFK-dependent receptor systems for migration of moDCs. Dasatinib hampered the secretion of interleukin-12 by moDCs at clinically relevant concentrations. In contrast, endocytosis or boosting of cytomegalovirus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses remained unaltered when applying dasatinib-pretreated moDCs, in line with minor effects on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules essential for DC\u2013T cell interaction. The induction of enhanced migration of moDCs may potentially be useful in chemo-immunotherapeutic applications. Thus, the use of dasatinib or blocking Siglec antibodies as adjuvants in this setting to induce stronger immune responses is worthy of further study.",

Hypoxia also affects the expansion of progenitor cells and enhances erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In contrast to the known effects of hypoxia on normal hematopoiesis, the effects of the hypoxic environment of the bone marrow on the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) have not been well studied. In the present study, we investigated the role of the hypoxic environment in the pathophysiology of MPNs, focusing on JAK2V617F, a major driver of mutation in Philadelphia-negative MPNs. We found that the activity of JAK2V617F was suppressed in hypoxic conditions not only in JAK2V617F-positive leukemia cells, but also in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with polycythemia vera. Concomitant with the inhibition of JAK2V617F activity, hypoxia increased the expression of p27/KIP1, the primary negative regulator of the cell cycle, and inhibited cell cycle progression in JAK2V617F-positive leukemia cell lines. The spontaneous erythroid colony formation of primary cells from polycythemia vera patients was also suppressed under hypoxic conditions. We also revealed that the hypoxia-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species played a crucial role in the inhibition of JAK2V617F through the oxidation and inhibition of SHP-2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that contains SH-2, which is required for JAK2 activation. In conclusion, a hypoxic environment may modulate JAK2-positive MPN cell fate and disease progression through the suppression\u00a0of\u00a0SHP-2 function and the subsequent suppression of JAK2V617F activity.",

We compared MSCs transduced with firefly luciferase (Fluc) and transmembrane-bound Gaussia luciferase driven by the human cytomegalovirus, spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), and elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (EF1\u03b1) promoters. Although cytomegalovirus\u2013transmembrane-bound Gaussia luciferase\u2013transduced MSCs showed the highest light intensity in\u00a0vitro, the signal was almost undetectable in\u00a0vivo. Spleen focus-forming virus\u2013Fluc\u2013transduced MSCs revealed a bright signal in\u00a0vivo, but transgene expression was silenced upon in\u00a0vitro stimulation with interferon (IFN)-\u03b3. Therefore, the SFFV promoter was replaced by the EF1\u03b1 promoter. Light emission of Fluc under the control of EF1\u03b1 was similar to SFFV-Fluc. Although EF1\u03b1-Fluc light emission was decreased tenfold in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 when compared with unstimulated MSCs, the bioluminescent signal could still be detected and was clearly distinguishable from untransduced MSCs. Furthermore, stimulation of MSCs with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 hardly affected transgene expression in EF1\u03b1-Fluc-transduced MSCs. Thus, the use of the EF1\u03b1 promoter partially overcomes silencing and allows in\u00a0vivo bioluminescence imaging of IFN-\u03b3-stimulated MSCs.",

It was further demonstrated that elevated secretion of activin A and interleukin-9 by BM Th2 cells of hypoxic mice promoted erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and the growth of erythroblasts, respectively. Our study also provided evidence that the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 interaction played an important role in Th2 cell trafficking to the BM under HA conditions.

Because the immune system develops relatively late in aves, the avian embryo is used to probe the tissue-forming potential of mouse tissues through mouse-into-chicken chimeras, providing insights into early mouse development by circumventing the lethality associated with some genetic strains. Finally, the avian embryo can be used to investigate the differentiation potential of human ES cells in the context of a whole organism. The combinations of classic approaches with the development of powerful genetic tools make the avian embryo a great and versatile model.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain blood production throughout life and are of pivotal importance in regenerative medicine. Although HSC generation from pluripotent stem cells would resolve their shortage for clinical applications, this has not yet been achieved mainly because of the poor mechanistic understanding of their programming. Bone marrow HSCs are first created during embryogenesis in the dorsal aorta (DA) of the midgestation conceptus, from where they migrate to the fetal liver and, eventually, the bone marrow. It is currently accepted that HSCs emerge from specialized endothelium, the hemogenic endothelium, localized in the ventral wall of the DA through an evolutionarily conserved process called the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. However, the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition represents one of the last steps in HSC creation, and an understanding of earlier events in the specification of their progenitors is required if we are to create them from na\u00efve pluripotent cells. Because of their ready availability and external development, zebrafish and Xenopus embryos have enormously facilitated our understanding of the early developmental processes leading to the programming of HSCs from nascent lateral plate mesoderm to hemogenic endothelium in the DA. The amenity of the Xenopus model to lineage tracing experiments has also contributed to the establishment of the distinct origins of embryonic (yolk sac) and adult (HSC) hematopoiesis, whereas the transparency of the zebrafish has allowed in\u00a0vivo imaging of developing blood cells, particularly during and after the emergence of HSCs in the DA. Here, we discuss the key contributions of these model organisms to our understanding of developmental hematopoiesis.",

     "abstract": "Exploitation of the zebrafish model in hematology research has surged in recent years, becoming one of the most useful and tractable systems for understanding regulation of hematopoietic development, homeostasis, and malignancy. Despite the evolutionary distance between zebrafish and humans, remarkable genetic and phenotypic conservation in the hematopoietic system has enabled significant advancements in our understanding of blood stem and progenitor cell biology. The strengths of zebrafish in hematology research lie in the ability to perform real-time in\u00a0vivo observations of hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and effector cell emergence, expansion, and function, as well as the ease with which novel genetic and chemical modifiers of specific hematopoietic processes or cell types can be identified and characterized. Further, myriad transgenic lines have been developed including fluorescent reporter systems to aid in the visualization and quantification of specified cell types of interest and cell-lineage relationships, as well as effector lines that can be used to implement a wide range of experimental manipulations. As our understanding of the complex nature of blood stem and progenitor cell biology during development, in response to infection or injury, or in the setting of hematologic malignancy continues to deepen, zebrafish will remain essential for exploring the spatiotemporal organization and integration of these fundamental processes, as well as the identification of efficacious small molecule modifiers of hematopoietic activity. In this review, we discuss the biology of the zebrafish hematopoietic system, including similarities and differences from mammals, and highlight important tools currently utilized in zebrafish embryos and adults to enhance our understanding of vertebrate hematology, with emphasis on findings that have impacted our understanding of the onset or treatment of human hematologic disorders and disease.",

Here, I discuss recent work focusing on the genetic underpinnings of the development and function of lymphocytes in fish. Lymphocytes play critical roles in vertebrate-specific acquired immune systems of jawless and jawed fish. The unique opportunities afforded by the ability to carry out forward genetic screens and the rapidly evolving armamentarium of reverse genetics in fish usher in a new immunologic research that complements the traditional models of chicken and mouse. Recent work has greatly increased our understanding of the molecular components of the zebrafish immune system, identifying evolutionarily conserved and fish-specific functions of immune-related genes. Interestingly, some of the genes whose mutations underlie the phenotypes in immunodeficient zebrafish were also identified in immunodeficient human patients. In addition, because of the generally conserved structure and function of immune facilities, the zebrafish also provides a versatile model to examine the functional consequences of genetic variants in immune-relevant genes in the human population. Thus, I propose that genetic approaches using the zebrafish hold great potential for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of human primary immunodeficiencies and the evolution of vertebrate immune systems.",

The advent of genetic technology has strengthened the use of mouse models for identifying critical pathways in hematopoiesis. Full genetic knockout models, tissue-specific gene deletion, and genetic overexpression models create a system for the dissection and identification of critical cellular and genetic processes underlying hematopoiesis.

     "abstract": "Fish, mice, and humans rely on two coexisting myeloid blood cell systems. One is sustained by hematopoietic progenitor cells, which reside in specialized microenvironments (niches) in hematopoietic organs and give rise to cells of the monocyte lineage. The other system corresponds to the independent lineage of self-renewing tissue macrophages, which colonize organs during embryonic development and are maintained during later life by proliferation in local tissue microenvironments. However, little is known about the nature of these microenvironments and their regulation. Moreover, many vertebrate tissues contain a mix of both tissue-resident and monocyte-derived macrophages, posing a challenge to the study of lineage-specific regulatory mechanisms and function. This review highlights how research in the simple model organism Drosophila melanogaster can address many of these outstanding questions in the field. Drawing parallels between hematopoiesis in Drosophila and vertebrates, we illustrate the evolutionary conservation of the two myeloid systems across animal phyla. Much like vertebrates, Drosophila possesses a lineage of self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages, which we refer to as tissue hemocytes, as well as a \u201cdefinitive\u201d lineage of macrophages that derive from hematopoiesis in the progenitor-based lymph gland. We summarize key findings from Drosophila hematopoiesis that illustrate how local microenvironments, systemic signals, immune challenges, and nervous inputs regulate adaptive responses of tissue-resident macrophages and progenitor-based hematopoiesis to maximize fitness of the animal.",

We have previously reported the development of leukemia in several nonhuman primate (NHP) subjects transplanted with HOXB4-expanded bone marrow cells at approximately 2 years posttransplant. Here, we provide long-term data for a NHP receiving a HOXB4-expanded cord blood graft. Longitudinal follow-up included gene marking analysis, complete blood counts, morphologic/pathologic assessment, phenotypic analysis of subsets, and retroviral integration site analysis. In each of these independent assays, we saw no indication of clonal dominance, and all signs pointed toward normal, healthy hematopoiesis. Furthermore, in-depth clonal analysis of an animal that developed leukemia after transplantation of HOXB4-modified bone marrow cells showed that dominant clones could be detected as early as 6 months posttransplant using the genomic analysis technique detailed here. Parallel analysis of the cord blood transplant macaque showed no such sites. These findings demonstrate the ability to study the use of gene-modified and expanded cord blood cells in a NHP model.",

Here we investigated the effect of lentiviral transduction rate on tetP background activity, vector copy number (VCN), and clonal variability as a consequence of vector integration. We found an exponential relationship between VCN and gene transfer/expression level, accompanied by a linear relationship between VCN and tetP background activity. Long-term murine transplantation studies demonstrated stable and reversible transgene expression in serial recipients. Although analysis of associated clonal composition revealed development of clonal dominance in the presence and absence of induction, no indications of disease presented during the observation period. The majority of tetracycline-regulated vector integration sites were identified in intron/exons of metabolic/housekeeping and signaling genes or in noncoding/repeat regions of the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the nature of the selected transgene might affect tetP background activity and inducibility in\u00a0vivo. Limiting tetP-regulated gene transfer may avoid generation of clones with high VCN and enhanced tetP background activity.

Although several drugs reducing osteoclast-mediated bone degradation are in clinical use, approaches to specifically augment bone formation are at an early stage of development. Novel antimyeloma drugs not only directly act on myeloma cells, but impact on the microenvironment as well. Proteasome inhibitors were previously shown to have bone anabolic properties. Here we investigated the impact of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) on bone formation. Treatment with thalidomide and lenalidomide significantly inhibited osteoblast development in\u00a0vitro, as reflected by a reduction of alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization. The effects were upheld in combination with bortezomib. The IMiDs upregulated Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and inhibin beta A, but blocking these molecules was not able to restore regular osteoblast development. We therefore performed gene expression profiling to reveal other osteoblast regulatory factors that might be involved in the IMiD-mediated effect on osteoblast development. Our data indicate that osteoblast inhibition is possibly an IMiD-class effect mediated by downregulation of major osteoblast regulators (e.g., runt-related transcription factor 2, distal-less homeobox 5, pleiotrophin) and concurrent induction of secreted inhibitors of osteoblast formation (e.g. DKK1, activin A, gremlin 1).

The transcription factor homeobox B4 (HOXB4) is known to induce expansion of mouse hematopoietic stem cells. The recombinant TAT-HOXB4 protein also expands human CD34+ cells. In this study we investigated whether overexpression of HOXB4 could increase leukemic initiating cell numbers, an issue that is crucial to its clinical usage. A transgenic mouse model for E2A-PBX1 induced pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia was used in combination with HOXB4 transgenic mice to test oncogenic interactions between HOXB4 and E2A-PBX1. The frequency of leukemic initiating cells retrovirally overexpressing HOXB4 was measured by transplantation at limiting dilution and evaluation of leukemia development in recipient mice. Moreover, human B cell lines were evaluated for their colony forming cell potential upon exposure to TAT-HOXB4 protein. Our data with the mouse models show that HOXB4 neither accelerates the generation of E2A-PBX1 B cell leukemia nor expands the number of leukemia initiating cells. Additionally, the growth or colony forming cell proportions of human B cell lines was not changed by HOXB4, suggesting that human B\u00a0leukemic initiating cells\u00a0are\u00a0not affected by HOXB4.",

There are few model systems available that facilitate studies of globin gene regulation in the context of erythroid maturation. Extensively self-renewing erythroblasts (ESREs) are a nontransformed model of erythroid maturation derived from murine fetal liver or yolk sac. Imaging flow cytometry and RNA-seq studies demonstrate that ESREs functionally and molecularly model erythroid maturation. To address the need for a model system that also recapitulates human globin switching, ESREs were derived from mice transgenic for the complete human \u03b2-globin locus (\u03b2-yac ESREs). \u03b2-yac ESREs express \u03b2-globin from the transgenic human locus, with minimal \u03b3-globin expression. When treated with hydroxyurea or inhibitors to histone deacetylases, DNA methyltransferases, or the histone demethylase lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), \u03b2-Yac ESREs significantly increase their \u03b3-globin expression, demonstrating their utility for studying agents that influence maturational globin switching. \u03b2-yac ESREs were further used to characterize the secondary effects of LSD1 inhibition on erythroid maturation, with inhibition of LSD1 resulting in altered cell and nuclear size, prolonged Kit expression, and decreased rates of enucleation consistent with impaired maturation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that \u03b2-yac ESREs have significant utility for identifying modulators of maturational globin switching as well as for studying the broader role of those modulators in erythroid maturation.",

Pharmacologic doses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilize HSC in part by interfering with the HSC niche-supportive function of BM resident macrophages. Because bone marrow macrophages are key to both maintenance of HSC within their niche and erythropoiesis, we investigated the effect of mobilizing doses of G-CSF on erythropoiesis in mice. We now report that G-CSF blocks medullar erythropoiesis by depleting the erythroid island macrophages we identified as co-expressing F4/80, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, CD169, Ly-6G, and the ER-HR3 erythroid island macrophage antigen. Both broad macrophage depletion, achieved by injecting clodronate-loaded liposomes, and selective depletion of CD169+ macrophages, also concomitantly depleted F4/80+VCAM-1+CD169+ER-HR3+Ly-6G+ erythroid island macrophages and blocked erythropoiesis. This more precise phenotypic definition of erythroid island macrophages will enable studies on their biology and function in normal settings and on diseases associated with anemia. Finally, this study further illustrates that macrophages are a potent relay of innate immunity and inflammation on bone, hematopoietic, and erythropoietic maintenance. Agents that affect these macrophages, such as G-CSF, are likely to affect these three processes concomitantly.",

Furthermore, they respond to its ligation by upregulating the expression of IL-15R\u03b2 (CD122) and accelerating the production of functional natural killer (NK)-like cells. Proliferation of the presumed equivalent progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood was stimulated by CpG-containing oligonucleotides or herpes simplex virus, but the already robust NK-cell formation was unchanged.

In this study, the polyamine metabolism and function of SSAT were characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute lymphoid leukemia patient samples. Also, mice overexpressing SSAT and having a myeloproliferative phenotype were analyzed for their response to decitabine and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. The presence of epigenetic factors in the bone marrow cells of SSAT mice was analyzed. Elevated levels of spermidine and spermine, as well as increased activity of SSAT, were detected in AML, CML, and acute lymphoid leukemia patients compared with the controls. However, we found SSAT activity to be associated with white blood cell count only in AML and CML patients. Decitabine treatment brought the peripheral blood and bone marrow cell counts of SSAT mice to the level of wild-type mice. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase mice had increased histone methylation and an increased level of histone deacetylase 1 in their bone marrow cells.

We have previously shown that statins are able to modulate activity of chemotherapeutics or antibodies used in oncology. Therefore, we decided to verify that statins are able to potentiate antileukemic activity of imatinib, still a frontline treatment of CML. Lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug, synergistically potentiates antileukemic activity of imatinib in cell lines and in primary CD34+\u00a0CML cells from patients in different phases of the disease, including patients resistant to imatinib with no detectable mutations. This effect is related to increased intracellular concentration of imatinib in CD34+\u00a0CML cells and cell lines measured using uptake of 14C-labeled imatinib. Lovastatin does not influence influx but significantly inhibits efflux of imatinib mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: ABCB1 and ABCG2. The addition of cholesterol completely reverses these effects. Statins do not affect expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. The effects are drug-class specific, as observed with other statins.

When comparing the expression in AMLTNeg and AMLTPos, we found a significantly increased expression of the full length SETMAR in AMLTNeg (var1: p = 0.047), suggesting a protective effect of high SETMAR expression on formation of chromosomal translocations. In conclusion, we have found known and novel SETMAR splice variants to be significantly increased in AML. To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes an expression profile of SETMAR in subgroups of hematologic malignancies, which can be linked to the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements.",

Acute leukemia has poor prognosis, mainly due to relapse. Standard FLT3-ITD diagnostic techniques are based on genomic polymerase chain reaction and have recently incorporated GeneScan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to identify variations of the FLT3 gene. As this is an average-based assay utilized in a heterogeneous leukemic cell population, we hypothesized that cells of acute leukemia, considered FLT3-ITD-negative by standard methods, could possess a fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The present study employed single cell mutation analysis to evaluate the FLT3-ITD status in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3) patients. A total of 541 single leukemic cells and 36\u00a0mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were analyzed. Seven patients, considered FLT3-ITD-negative according to bulk DNA analysis, appeared to possess a small fraction of FLT3-ITD-positive cells based on single cell analysis. Moreover, this approach revealed the heterogeneity of the tumor as evident by different FLT3-ITD mutations present in the same patient. The presence of a minor clone carrying FLT3-ITD in almost all patients tested provides evidence that this lesion is a common late event in leukemogenesis. Additionally, 3\u00a0relapsed patients demonstrated loss of heterozygosity of the normal allele, affecting 25%\u2013100% of the cells found to be FLT3-ITD-positive. Though further clinical testing is warranted, these findings may have implications on the prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD and the use of targeted therapy.",

Here, we use global gene expression analysis to identify 28 transcription factors and 19 transcriptional cofactors induced during terminal erythroid differentiation whose promoters are enriched for binding by GATA1 and TAL1. Utilizing protein\u2013protein interaction databases to identify cofactors for each transcription factor, we pinpoint several co-induced pairs, of which E2f2 and its cofactor transcription factor Dp-2 (Tfdp2) were the most highly induced. TFDP2 is a critical cofactor required for proper cell cycle control and gene expression. GATA1 and TAL1 are bound to the regulatory regions of Tfdp2 and upregulate its expression and knockdown of Tfdp2 results in significantly reduced rates of proliferation as well as reduced upregulation of many erythroid-important genes. Loss of Tfdp2 also globally inhibits the normal downregulation of many E2F2 target genes, including those that regulate the cell cycle, causing cells to accumulate in S phase and resulting in increased erythrocyte size. Our findings highlight the importance of TFDP2 in coupling the erythroid cell cycle with terminal differentiation and\u00a0validate this study as a resource for future work on elucidating the role of diverse transcription factors and coregulators in erythropoiesis.",

Activating mutations in c-Mpl constitutively stimulate downstream signaling pathways, leading to aberrant hematopoiesis, and contribute to development of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Several studies have mapped the tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl that mediate these cellular signals; however, secondary signaling pathways are incompletely understood. In this study, we focused on c-Mpl tyrosine 591 (Y591). We found Y591 of wild-type c-Mpl to be phosphorylated in the presence of TPO. Additionally, eliminating Y591\u00a0phosphorylation by mutation to Phe resulted in decreased total receptor phosphorylation. Using a Src homology 2/phosphotyrosine-binding (SH2/PTB) domain binding microarray, we identified novel c-Mpl binding partners for phosphorylated Y591, including Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The functional significance of binding partners was determined through small interfering RNA treatment of Ba/F3-Mpl cells, confirming that the increase in pERK1/2 resulting from removal of Y591 may be mediated by spleen tyrosine kinase. These findings identify a novel negative regulatory pathway that controls TPO-mediated signaling, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms required for successful maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte development.",

To prepare the relatively human bone marrow environment in mice, we generated nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (NOG) mice expressing human Jagged1 (hJ1) in an osteoblast-specific manner (hJ1-NOG mice) to examine whether Notch signaling induced by hJ1 mediates hHSC proliferation and/or maintenance in mice. The established hJ1-NOG mice possess relatively larger bone marrow space and thinner cortical bone compared with nontransgenic littermates, but the number of c-kit+ Sca-1+ lineage- cells was not significantly different between hJ1-NOG and nontransgenic littermates. In the transplantation experiments of CD34+ cells obtained from human cord blood, CD34+CD38- cells (hHSCs) were more increased in hJ1-NOG recipient mice than in nontransgenic littermates in mouse bone marrow environment. In contrast, the transplanted mouse c-kit+ Sca-1+ lineage- cells did not show significant increase in the same hJ1-NOG mice. These results suggest that hJ1-NOG mice could contribute to the growth of transplanted human CD34+\u00a0cells in a human-specific manner and be useful to study the in\u00a0vivo behavior and/or development of human stem cells, including cancer stem cells and immune cells.",

ESHPs derived from EBs displayed an immature hematopoietic phenotype and were devoid of immunogenicity marker expression. In contrast, ESHPs derived via ESC-OP9 displayed a mature phenotype and expressed high levels of some immunostimulatory molecules. ESHPs alone could not stimulate CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation directly. However, preferential phagocytosis of ESHPs and T cell proliferation were observed in the presence of antigen-presenting cells, consistent with a model of indirect immune recognition of ESHPs.

Using a multiplex cytokine assay, cytokine measurements were taken of the plasma of 17 PV patients and 21 ET patients.

We showed that cytokine levels were significantly increased in\u00a0PV and ET patients compared with normal values and that several positive correlations existed between the cytokine concentrations and the biological parameters in each MPN.

Interestingly, elevated expression of Hes1 was found in two of five samples of Fip1-like1 platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (FIP1L1-PDGFA)-positive myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Whereas FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 alone induced acute T-cell leukemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms in mouse bone marrow transplantation models, mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing both Hes1 and FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 developed acute\u00a0leukemia characterized by an expansion of myeloid blasts and\u00a0leukemic cells without eosinophilic granules.

To define further the role of Flt3 signaling in lymphoid progenitor survival, mice deficient in Flt3 ligand that also expressed a Bcl2 transgene (E\u03bc-bcl2tg flt3l\u2212/\u2212) were generated. Intracellular flow cytometry established transgene expression in primitive hematopoietic progenitors, including lineage-negative Sca-1+ c-kit+ (LSK+) CD27\u2212 cells enriched for functional hematopoietic stem cells. Compared with flt3l\u2212/\u2212 mice, E\u03bc-bcl2tg flt3l\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly increased multipotential progenitors (MPPs), IL-7R+ common lymphoid progenitors, and B cell precursors. To determine whether forced expression of Bcl2 was sufficient to restore lymphoid priming in the absence of Flt3 signaling E\u03bc-bcl2tg flt3l\u2212/\u2212rag1-gfp+ mice were generated. Analysis of E\u03bc-bcl2tg flt3l\u2212/\u2212rag1-gfp+ mice revealed that the Bcl2 transgene had no effect on lymphoid priming before CD19 expression. Thus, forced expression of a survival gene can bypass the requirement for threshold levels of Flt3 signaling requisite for lymphoid priming. Temporal Flt3 ligand (FL) replacement therapy in flt3l\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed specific requirements for Flt3 signaling in the expansion and maintenance of Flt3+hi MPP and Flt3+ all lymphoid progenitors, but not Flt3+ B lymphoid progenitors (BLPs), the immediate precursors of BCPs.

The etiology of DBA is not completely understood; however, the ribosomal nature of the genes involved has led to speculation that these mutations may alter the landscape of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. Here, we performed comparative microarray analysis of polysomal mRNA transcripts isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from DBA patients carrying various haploinsufficient mutations in either RPS19 or RPL11. Different spectrums of changes were observed depending on the mutant gene, with large differences found in RPS19 cells and very few in RPL11 cells. However, we find that the small number of altered transcripts in RPL11 overlap for the most part with those altered in\u00a0RPS19 cells. We show specifically that levels of branched-chain aminotransferase-1 (BCAT1) transcripts are significantly decreased on the polysomes of both RPS19 and RPL11 cells and that translation of BCAT1 protein is especially impaired in cells with small RP gene mutations, and we provide evidence that this effect may be due in part to the unusually long 5'UTR of the BCAT1 transcript. The BCAT1 enzyme carries out the final step in the biosynthesis and the first step of degradation of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Interestingly, several animal models of DBA have reported that leucine ameliorates the anemia phenotypes generated by RPS19 loss.

After fasting, concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were determined. Significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) median values of VF concentrations at all time points in the OGTT were found in pre- HSCT children compared with control subjects. The median VF concentration was significantly higher after HSCT compared with before HSCT. The decrease in VF in leukemic children in complete remission may be caused by myelosuppression and immunosuppression after prolong chemotherapy and is beneficial because of the decrease in its antiapoptotic activity. VF can serve as an additional biochemical marker for remission in patients with leukemia. Normalization of plasma VF concentration after HSCT might be caused by a process of immune reconstitution and prolonged inflammation (e.g., infections, graft-versus-host disease), injury to organs (e.g., lungs, gut, liver), and endocrinology deficiencies.",

Major growth-inhibitory effects were seen with all PDGFR-blocking agents, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range: ponatinib, 0.1\u20130.2 nmol/L; sorafenib, 0.1\u20130.2 nmol/L; masitinib, 0.2\u20130.5 nmol/L; nilotinib, 0.2\u20131.0 nmol/L; dasatinib, 0.5\u20132.0 nmol/L; sunitinib, 1\u20132 nmol/L; midostaurin, 5\u201310 nmol/L. These drugs were also found to block activation of PDGFR-downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, S6, and STAT5 in EOL-1 cells. All effective TKIs produced apoptosis in EOL-1 cells as determined by microscopy, Annexin-V/PI, and caspase-3 staining. In addition, PDGFR-targeting TKIs were found to inhibit cytokine-induced migration of EOL-1 cells. In all bioassays used, ponatinib was found to be the most potent compound in EOL-1 cells. In addition, ponatinib was found to downregulate expression of the activation-linked surface antigen CD63 on EOL-1 cells and to suppress the growth of primary neoplastic eosinophils. We also examined drug effects on\u00a0Ba/F3 cells expressing two clinically relevant, imatinib-resistant, mutant forms of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, namely T674I and D842V. Strong inhibitory effects on both mutants were seen only with ponatinib. In summary, novel PDGFR-targeting TKIs may be alternative agents for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Although several different PDGFR-targeting agents are effective, the most potent drug appears to be ponatinib.",

     "abstract": "The DNA methylation inhibitor azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is used against myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, but drug resistance is an ongoing, intractable problem. To investigate resistance mechanisms, we generated two azacitidine-resistant cell lines, THP-1/AR and HL60/AR, and studied genetic disparities between them and their corresponding parental lines. In cells treated with azacitidine, significant mitotic variations were noted in parental cells which were absent in resistant cells, suggesting that resistance arises from negating azacitidine-mediated activation of apoptosis signaling and reestablishing G2/M checkpoint. Importantly, both resistant cell lines have common point mutations in the uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the azacitidine activation pathway. Forced expression of mutated UCK2 in parental THP-1 cells abrogated azacitidine-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of wild type UCK2 in resistant THP-1/AR cells restored sensitivity to azacitidine, implying that UCK2 gene mutations perturb azacitidine activation and advance azacitidine resistance. Our study provides new insights into azacitidine resistance and establishes models useful in developing effective strategies to overcome it.",

     "abstract": "Treatment for high-risk pediatric and adult acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains challenging. Exploring novel pathways in B-ALL could lead to new therapy. Our previous study has shown that stem cell factor SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in B-ALL, but its functional roles and the mechanism that accounts for its upregulation in B-ALL remain unexplored. To address this question, we first surveyed the existing B-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples for SALL4 expression. We then selected the B-ALL cell lines with the highest SALL4 expression for functional studies. RNA interference was used to downregulate SALL4 expression in these cell lines. When compared with control cells, SALL4 knockdown cells exhibited decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis in\u00a0vitro, and decreased engraftment in a xenotransplant model in\u00a0vivo. Gene expression analysis showed that in SALL4 knockdown B-ALL cells, multiple caspase members involved in cell apoptosis pathway were upregulated. Next, we explored the mechanisms of aberrant SALL4 expression in B-ALL. We found that hypomethylation of the SALL4 CpG islands was correlated with its high expression. Furthermore, treatment of low SALL4-expressing B-ALL cell lines with DNA methylation inhibitor led to demethylation of the SALL4 CpG and increased SALL4 expression. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to show that the aberrant expression of SALL4 in B-ALL is associated with hypomethylation, and that SALL4 plays a key role in B-ALL cell survival and could be a potential novel target in B-ALL treatment.",

In the present study, we used differential Hoechst efflux to enrich lineage-biased HSC subtypes and analyzed their functional potentials. Despite similar outputs in\u00a0vitro, bone marrow transplantation assays revealed contrasting lineage differentiation in\u00a0vivo. To stratify the molecular differences underlying these contrasting functional potentials at the clonal level, single-cell gene expression analysis was performed using the Fluidigm BioMark system and revealed dynamic expression of genes including Meis1, CEBP/\u03b1, Sfpi1, and Dnmt3a. Finally, single-cell gene expression analysis was used to unravel the opposing proliferative responses of lineage-biased HSCs to the growth factor TGF-\u03b21, revealing a potential role for the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1c as molecular mediator. This work lends further credence to the concept of HSC heterogeneity, and it presents unprecedented molecular resolution of the HSC response to trophic factors using single-cell gene expression analysis.",

For example, the nonobese diabetic (NOD) strain is most efficient, the BALB/c is moderate, and the C57BL/6 is inefficient for human cell engraftment. We have shown that the NOD-specific polymorphism of the signal regulatory protein-alpha (Sirpa) allows NOD SIRPA to bind human CD47, and the resultant \u201cdon't eat me\u201d signaling by this binding prevents host macrophages to engulf human grafts, thereby inhibiting rejection. Here we tested whether the efficient xenotransplantation capability of the BALB/c strain is also mediated by the SIRPA-CD47 self-recognition system. BALB/c SIRPA was capable of binding to human CD47 at an intermediate level between those of C57BL/6 SIRPA and NOD SIRPA. Consistent with its binding activity, BALB/c-derived macrophages exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on human long-term culture-initiating cells in in\u00a0vitro cultures, and showed moderate phagocytic activity against human hematopoietic stem cells. The increased affinity of BALB/c SIRPA for human CD47 was mounted at least through the BALB/c-specific L29V SNP within the IgV domain. Thus, the mouse strain effect on xenogeneic engraftment might be ascribed mainly to the binding affinity of strain-specific polymorphic SIRPA with human CD47. This information should be useful for developing a novel immunodeficient strain with superior efficiency for xenogeneic transplantation of human cells.",

Apoptosis was dependent on caspase activation and was partially dependent on cathepsin D. Furthermore, b-AP15 triggered processing of pro-caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in MM cells. b-AP15 also induced caspase-independent apoptosis in primary human natural killer cells. We also demonstrate that b-AP15 induces activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in MM cells, with activation of the proapoptotic protein Bax and a pronounced loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The latter events, however, appeared largely independent of caspase activation.

BCR-ABL mRNA was upregulated in K562/Adh compared with K562/NonAdh cells in both single cell and bulk population analyses (p < 0.0001).

Flt3 acts at the level of leukemic stem cells (LSCs), as a fraction of LSCs in MLL-ENL, but not in MLL-AF9-induced leukemia, expressed Flt3 in\u00a0vivo, and Flt3 expression on LSCs was associated with leukemia development in this model. Furthermore, efficiency of MLL-ENL, but not of MLL-AF9\u2013induced leukemia induction was significantly enhanced after transduction of Flt3+ compared to Flt3\u2212 wt myeloid progenitors. However, Flt3 is not required for immortalization of bone marrow cells in\u00a0vitro by MLL-ENL and does not affect colony formation by MLL-ENL LSCs in\u00a0vitro, suggesting that in\u00a0vitro models do not reflect the in\u00a0vivo biology of MLL-ENL leukemia with respect to Flt3 requirement.

Reduced PU.1 levels, caused by either mutation or repression, are associated with human AML and are sufficient to cause AML in mice. The objective of this study was to determine whether reduced PU.1 expression induces deregulation of the cell cycle in the myeloid lineage. Our results showed that immature myeloid cells expressing reduced PU.1 levels (Sfpi1BN/BN myeloid cells) proliferated indefinitely in cell culture and expanded in\u00a0vivo. Transplantation of Sfpi1BN/BN cells induced AML in recipient mice. Cultured Sfpi1BN/BN cells expressed elevated messenger RNA transcript and protein levels of E2F1, an important regulator of cell cycle entry.

The function of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flk2 (Flt3) in promoting myeloid development remains poorly defined, despite being commonly mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We investigated the effect of Flk2 deficiency on myelopoiesis, focusing on specification of progenitors between HSC and mature cells. We provide evidence that Flk2 is critical for proliferative expansion of multipotent progenitors that are common precursors for all lymphoid and myeloid lineages, including megakaryocyte/erythroid (MegE) cells. Flk2 deficiency impaired the generation of both lymphoid and myeloid progenitors by abrogating propagation of their common upstream precursor. At steady state, downstream compensatory mechanisms masked the effect of Flk2 deficiency on mature myeloid output, whereas transplantation of purified progenitors revealed impaired generation of all mature lineages. Flk2 deficiency did not affect lineage choice, thus dissociating the role of Flk2 in promoting cell expansion and regulating cell fate. Surprisingly, despite impairing myeloid development, Flk2 deficiency afforded protection against myeloablative insult. This survival advantage was attributed to reduced cell cycling and proliferation of progenitors in Flk2-deficient mice. Our data support the existence of a common Flk2+ intermediate for all hematopoietic lineages and provide insight into how activating Flk2 mutations promote hematopoietic malignancy by non\u2013Flk2-expressing myeloid cells.",

Because the para-aortic region is a known site for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) differentiation and expansion, we hypothesize that TIM molecules have a role in hematopoiesis. To study this role further, we analyzed TIM expression more precisely in chicken para-aortic region and mouse fetal liver hematopoietic cells. Additionally, we examined the hematopoietic potential of TIM-4+ mouse fetal liver cells with a colony-forming assay. tim-1 gene expression was detected in chicken and mouse embryos in the aorta-gonads-mesonephros-region at the time of HSC emergence, whereas tim-3 mRNA was widely expressed in different tissues. tim-4 expression was restricted to fetal liver CD45+F4/80+ cells. Moreover, two TIM-4+ populations were distinguished: F4/80hiTIM-4hi and F4/80loTIM-4lo. F4/80hiTIM-4hi cells had no hematopoietic potential and were morphologically similar to mature macrophages, suggesting that they are yolk sac\u2013derived macrophages. Instead, many of the F4/80loTIM-4lo cells were c-kit+ and Sca-1+ and had primitive morphology and multilineage colony-forming ability.

In this study, we used the dasatinib-sensitive KITmut t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1 to model, in a confined and controllable way, molecular effects upon continuous dasatinib treatment. Long-term dasatinib exposure at clinically relevant levels resulted in markedly decreased drug-sensitivity of KITmut t(8;21) AML cells. Notably, all dasatinib-resistant clones lacked secondary KIT-mutations. Instead, persistent growth correlated with alterations in KIT expression levels\u2014that is, either KIT overexpression with maintained downstream signaling or KIT downregulation with concomitant activation of alternate pathways. Although KIT overexpression was associated with retained receptor activity and STAT3 activation, KIT downregulation correlated with decreased STAT3 levels and increased ERK-signaling. Importantly, brief discontinuation of dasatinib restored dasatinib-sensitivity associated with reversal of signaling signatures similar to treatment-naive, dasatinib-sensitive cells. The observed desensitization of KITmut t(8;21) AML cells upon continuous dasatinib exposure suggests that therapy-related acquisition of resistance could pose significant limitations on therapeutic efficiency. Notably, we identified TKI-resistant states of transient nature that correlate with alterations in KIT expression and can be reversed upon brief inhibitor withdrawal.

Moreover, the marked increase of in\u00a0vitro angiogenesis determined by CLL-derived conditioned media was reduced by lenalidomide. We also analyzed peripheral blood collected from 27 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL being treated with lenalidomide within a phase II trial.

Patients who respond to lenalidomide showed a more pronounced decrease of VEGF and bFGF than did patients with stable or progressive disease (p = 0.007 and p = 0.005). Furthermore, lenalidomide reduced circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors by increasing the percentage of apoptotic cells. Conversely, for six matched bone marrow biopsies available before and after treatment, we did not detect any modification in vessel density, suggesting a possible mechanism of vessel normalization rather than regression.

     "abstract": "This study enumerated CD45hi/CD34+ and CD45hi/CD133+ human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFCs) in blood and trochanteric and femoral bone marrow in 233 individuals. Stem cell frequencies were determined with multiparameter flow cytometry and using an internal control to determine the intrinsic variance of the assays. Progenitor cell frequency was determined using a standard colony assay technique. The frequency of outliers from undetermined methodological causes was highest for blood, but less than 5% for all values. The frequency of CD45hi/CD133+ cells correlated highly with the frequency of CD45hi/CD34+ cells in trochanteric and femoral bone marrow. The frequency of these HSC populations in trochanteric and femoral bone marrow rose significantly with age. In contrast, there was no significant trend of either of these cell populations with age in the blood. Trochanteric marrow progenitor GM-CFCs showed no significant trends with age, but femoral marrow GM-CFCs trended downward with age, potentially because of the reported conversion of red marrow at this site to fat with age. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells exhibited changes in frequencies with age that differed between blood and bone marrow. We previously reported that side population (SP) multipotential HSC, which includes the precursors of CD45hi/CD133+ and CD45hi/CD34+, decline with age. Potentially the increases in stem cell frequencies in the intermediate compartment between SP and GM progenitor cells observed in this study represent a compensatory increase for the loss of more potent members of the HSC hierarchy.",

     "abstract": "The objective of is this article is to review murine xenotransplantation models for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The difficulties in achieving sustained engraftment of MDS cells in immunodeficient mice may lie in innate characteristics of the MDS clones and microenvironmental factors. Engraftment of very low numbers of CD45+ clonal MDS cells has been achieved with intravenous injection; higher rates of engraftment are obtained via the intramedullary route. Coinjection of certain stroma components with hematopoietic cells overcomes limitations of intravenous (IV) administration, allowing for engraftment of high proportions of human CD45+ cells in mouse spleen and marrow. Expression of CD146 on stroma cells conveys an engraftment-facilitating effect. Clonal MDS cells have been propagated for periods beyond 6 months and have been transplanted successfully into secondary recipients. Engraftment of human clonal MDS cells with stem cell characteristics in immunodeficient mice is greatly facilitated by coinjection of stroma/mesenchymal cells, particularly with IV administration. CD146 expression on stroma is an essential factor; however, no model develops the laboratory and clinical features of human MDS. Additional work is needed to determine cellular and noncellular factors required for the full evolution of MDS.",

Given the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in development and differentiation, we examined the global expression of miRNA in CD34+ cells during lineage specific hematopoiesis and found 49 miRNAs to be differentially expressed, with functional roles in cellular growth and proliferation, and apoptosis. miR-18a was upregulated during erythropoiesis and downregulated during megakaryopoiesis. miR-145 was upregulated during granulopoiesis and down regulated during erythropoiesis. Megakaryopoitic differentiation resulted in significant alteration in the expression of many miRNAs that are believed to play critical roles in the regulation of B and T cell differentiation. Target prediction analyses on three different miRNA databases indicated that TargetScan outperformed microCosm and miRDB in identifying potential miRNA targets associated with hematopoietic differentiation process. An integrated analysis of the observed miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) resulted in 87 highly correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs that have major functional roles in cellular growth and proliferation, hematopoietic system development, and Wnt/B-catenin and Flt 3 signaling pathways. We believe that this study will enhance our understanding on the regulatory roles of miRNA in hematopoiesis by providing a library of mRNA-miRNA networks.",

We investigated naive-derived (TN), memory-derived (TM), and Epstein Barr virus-specific (TEBV) CD8+ T cell subsets for alloreactivity upon redirection with RNA encoding a cytomegalovirus-specific model TCR. We observed that alloreactivity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched hematopoietic cells developed at much stronger levels in TN compared with TM or\u00a0TEBV populations in cytokine-release and cytotoxicity assays. Cytomegalovirus-specific effector function was higher in TCR-transfected TEBV and TM over TN cells. To measure alloreactivity in\u00a0vivo, we reconstituted NOD/SCID/IL-2R\u03b3cnull mice with human CD34+ stem cells and adoptively transferred them with CD8+ T cell subsets previously stimulated against cells of the HLA-mismatched stem-cell donor. TN cells showed a significant ability to eliminate CD34-derived hematopoietic cells, which was not found with TM and TEBV cells.

Ear-2\u2013transduced murine BM hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in OP9-DL1 cultures showed a proliferation deficit during days 1\u20135 after induction of differentiation, which corresponded to increased expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 (cdkn1a) and p27 (cdkn1b), as well as increased expression of Hes1, Notch3, Egr1, and Scl (Tal1) and decreased expression of Gli1, Gfi-1, HoxA9, PU.1, Nrarp, and Tcf1. In addition, there was a block in differentiation at the DN4 to double-positive (DP) transition accompanied by an increase in apoptosis, similar to the deficit seen in the ROR\u03b3t null mouse. Gene expression profiling revealed that, like the ROR\u03b3t-deficient mouse, EAR-2++ DP cells had decreased expression of BclXL and increased expression of the proapoptosis gene Bad. In addition, EAR-2++ DP cells had decreased expression of Bcl11b, PU.1, and HoxA9, and increased expression of Id2. Based on these findings, we conclude that EAR-2++ cells were able to migrate to, but not fully repopulate, the thymus because of a cell-intrinsic defect in the proliferation of DN1 cells followed by a block in differentiation from the DN4 to DP stage of T cell development. We conclude that Ear-2 is a novel negative regulator of T-cell development and that downregulation of Ear-2 is indispensable for the proliferation of DN1 cells and the survival of DN4-DP cells.",

The rate of 59Fe release after ferritin-H deletion supports earlier data on ferritin turnover in mammals; released 59Fe is not excreted from the body. Instead, 59Fe is channeled into erythropoiesis and circulating erythrocytes significantly more extensively and faster.

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is used in the treatment of hematologic and nonhematologic disorders. PostHSCT immunologic reconstitution is a critical component for successful outcome. Pretransplant conditioning impairs thymic function, leading to delayed T\u00a0cell regeneration. Thymus-independent T cell expansion is associated with defective generation of naive T cells and memory T cell skewing, resulting in decreased diversity in the T cell repertoire, thus attenuating the immune responses and increasing the risk of opportunistic infections and leukemia relapse. Wingless (Wnt) signaling has been identified as an important regulator of T cell development and function. Activated Wnt signaling inhibited differentiation of mature T cells in transgenic mouse models. The effect of Wnt activation on T cell regeneration following HSCT was not investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that the GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin 3\u2019-oxime (BIO) activates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, elevates the proportion of naive T cells, and delays T cell differentiation during homeostatic T cell expansion in lymphodepleted mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells. In\u00a0vitro BIO-treatment promoted naive T cell expansion following mitogenic stimulation and improved proliferative responses of T cells to allogeneic stimuli. Treatment with BIO acts to expand the IL7R\u03b1+ subset of naive T cells, suggesting the potential mechanism driving T cell expansion during IL-7\u2013dependent T cell proliferation. BIO downregulated expression of genes activated during effector cell differentiation and preserved naive T cell gene expression. We propose that administration of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor increases the potency of T cells in recipients of HSCT by expansion of naive T cell subsets with a diverse T cell receptor repertoire.",

Myeloma cells are also exquisitely sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of the clinically approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the combination of VSV and bortezomib would enhance tumor cell killing. However, as shown here, combining these two agents in\u00a0vitro results in antagonism. We show that bortezomib inhibits VSV replication and spread. We found that bortezomib inhibits VSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation and, using the NF-\u03baB\u2013specific inhibitor BMS-345541, that VSV requires NF-\u03baB activity to spread efficiently in myeloma cells. In contrast to other cancer cell lines, viral titer is not recovered by BMS-345541 when myeloma cells are pretreated with interferon \u03b2. Thus, inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity, either with bortezomib or BMS-345541, results in reduced VSV titers in myeloma cells in\u00a0vitro. However, when VSV and bortezomib are combined in\u00a0vivo in two syngeneic, immunocompetent myeloma models, the combination reduces tumor burden to a greater degree than VSV does as a single agent. Intratumoral VSV viral load is unchanged when mice are treated concomitantly with bortezomib compared to VSV treatment alone. To our knowledge, this report is the first to analyze the combination of VSV and bortezomib in\u00a0vivo. Although antagonism between VSV and bortezomib is seen in\u00a0vitro, analyzing these cells in the context of their host environment shows that bortezomib enhances VSV response, suggesting that this combination will also enhance response in myeloma patients.",

Although the absence of TNC did not alter the size of the BM stem cell pool, we report decreased thymic T cell progenitors with redistribution to other lymphoid organs, suggesting an anchoring role for TNC. TNC did not play an essential role in stem and progenitor cell homing to BM, but significantly altered lymphoid primed progenitor cell homing. These cells express the TNC receptor, integrin \u03b19\u03b21, with the same reduced homing evident in the absence of this integrin. The absence of TNC also resulted in an increased proportion and number of mature circulating T cells. In addition, the absence of TNC significantly impaired hemopoietic reconstitution after transplant and increased stem and progenitor cell mobilization.

However, the role of LMO2 in human erythroid differentiation is unclear. LMO2 knockdown in hemin-treated K562 cells reduced the benzidine-positive cell ratio, suggesting that LMO2 retards hemin-mediated K562 cell differentiation. Microarray analysis using K562 cells after siRNA-mediated LMO2 knockdown indicated that 177 and 78 genes were upregulated and downregulated (>1.5-fold), respectively. The downregulated gene ensemble contained prototypical erythroid genes (HBB, SLC4A1). Whereas LMO2 knockdown did not affect GATA-1 or SCL/TAL1 expression, it resulted in significantly reduced chromatin occupancy of GATA-1, SCL/TAL1, and LDB1 at the \u03b2-globin locus control region and SLC4A1 locus in both K562 cells and human induced pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived erythroid cells. Introduction of GATA-1 mutations, shown to impair direct interaction with LMO2, significantly diminished chromatin occupancy. On the other hand, knockdown of either SCL/TAL1 or LDB1 also resulted in significantly reduced chromatin occupancy of GATA-1 at endogenous loci, suggesting that impaired assembly of these components also affects GATA-1 chromatin occupancy. In an ex\u00a0vivo model of erythroid differentiation from CD34+ cells, LMO2 protein level peaked on day 5 and decreased at later stages of differentiation. The LMO2 expression pattern was similar to those of GATA-1 and SCL/TAL1. Furthermore, shRNA-mediated LMO2 knockdown in primary erythroblasts suggested that LMO2 regulates HBB, HBA, and SLC4A1 expression. LMO2 contributes to GATA-1 target gene expression by affecting assembly of the GATA-SCL/TAL1 complex components at endogenous loci.",

HSCs are also one of the few blood cells that truly age and exhibit severe functional decline in old organisms, resulting in impaired blood homeostasis and increased risk for hematologic malignancies. In this review, we present the strategies used by HSCs to cope with the many genotoxic insults that they commonly encounter. We briefly describe the DNA-damaging insults that can affect HSC function and the mechanisms that are used by HSCs to prevent, survive, and repair DNA lesions.

All vectors except the Fusion vector drove expression of functional Ii, based on the enhancement of MHC class II level, which is a known consequence of Ii expression. Comparing the vectors after they were packaged into lentiviruses and used to transduce 293T, we found that MSCV and EF1a vectors mediated higher Ii and GFP expression. In ckit+ bone marrow (BM) cells, MSCV still induced the highest Ii and GFP expression, whereas EF1a induced only robust Ii expression. Regardless of the vector, both Ii and GFP levels were significantly reduced in BM cells compared to 293T cells. When in\u00a0vivo expression was assessed in cells derived from MSCV-transduced BM-HSCs, up to 80% of myeloid cells were GFP+, but no Ii expression was observed. In contrast, transplantation of EF1a-transduced BM-HSCs led to much higher in\u00a0vivo Ii expression. Thus, among those compared, dual-promoter vector-based lentivirus with the EF1a promoter driving the gene of interest is optimal for murine BM-HSC transduction.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoiesis is regulated by the bone marrow (BM) niche microenvironment. We recently found that posttransplant administration of AMD3100 (a specific and reversible CXCR4 antagonist) enhanced donor cell engraftment and promoted recovery of all donor cell lineages in a congeneic mouse transplant model. We hypothesized that AMD3100 enhances donor cell reconstitution in part by modulating the levels and constitution of soluble factors in the niche microenvironment. In the current study, the effects of the BM extracellular fluid (supernatant) from AMD3100-treated transplant recipient mice on colony-forming units (CFUs) were examined. A semiquantitative, mass spectrometry\u2013based proteomics approach was used to screen for differentially expressed proteins between the BM supernatants of PBS-treated transplant mice and AMD3100-treated transplant mice. A total of 178 proteins were identified in the BM supernatants. Thioredoxin was among the 32 proteins that displayed greater than a twofold increase in spectral counts in the BM supernatant of AMD3100-treated transplant mice. We found that thioredoxin increased CFUs in a dose-dependent manner. Thioredoxin improved hematopoiesis in irradiated mice and protected mice from radiation-related death. Furthermore, ex\u00a0vivo exposure to thioredoxin for 24 hours enhanced the long-term repopulation of hematopoietic stem cells. Additionally, combined posttransplant administration of thioredoxin and AMD3100 improved hematologic recovery in primary and secondary transplant recipient mice. Our studies demonstrated that factors in the BM niche microenvironment play a critical role in hematopoiesis. Identifying these factors provides clues on potential novel targets that can be used to enhance hematologic recovery in hematopoietic stem cell transplan`tation.",

Distinct globin expression patterns were observed. In hESC-derived erythroblasts where both \u03b5 and \u03b3 globin were active and marked by similar chromatin modifications, \u03b5 globin was immediately silenced upon transfer, whereas \u03b3 globin continued to be expressed for months, implying that different transcriptional environments were required for their continuing expression. Whereas \u03b2 globin was silent both in hESCs and in hESC-derived erythroblasts, \u03b2 globin was only activated upon transfer from hESCs, but not in the presence of dominant \u03b3 globin transferred from hESC-derived erythroblasts, confirming the competing nature of \u03b3 versus \u03b2 globin expression. With time, however, silencing of \u03b3 globin occurred in the adult transcriptional environment with concurrent activation of \u03b2-globin, accompanied by a drastic change in the epigenetic landscape of \u03b3 and \u03b2 globin gene regions without apparent changes in the transcriptional environment. This switching process could be manipulated by overexpression or downregulation of certain transcription factors. Our studies provide important insights into the interplay between the transcription environment and existing chromatin domains, and we offer an experimental system to study the time-dependent human globin switching.",

We developed a knock-in mouse that expresses full-length Runx1 with a mutation in the subnuclear targeting cofactor interaction domain, Runx1HTY350-352AAA.

However, defects are observed in multiple differentiated hematopoietic lineages at stages where Runx1 is known to play key roles. Thus,\u00a0a germline mutation in Runx1 reveals uncoupling of its functions during developmental hematopoiesis from subsequent differentiation across multiple hematopoietic lineages in the adult.

We report the results of comparing three methods to enumerate primitive CP-CML cells in the same samples: genotyping CD34+38\u2212 cells directly by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and measuring BCR-ABL1 transcript-genotyped colony-forming cell outputs in either 5-week long-term cultures (LTCs) containing non-engineered mouse fibroblasts or in 6-week LTCs containing mouse fibroblasts engineered to produce human Steel factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IL-3. The results demonstrate that the first two methods significantly overestimate the prevalence of primitive CP-CML cells by comparison to the third. In additional studies, we found that CML-CD34+ cells can repopulate the marrow and spleen of serially transplanted adult NOD/SCID-IL-2R\u03b3 chain-null mice for more than 1 year with an almost exclusive myeloid differentiation in primary and secondary recipients and without evidence of disease progression.

In this study, we aimed to better understand Hh signaling in normal hematopoiesis and AML by molecularly and functionally analyzing more than 200 primary human AML patient samples compared with nonleukemic controls. Gene expression analysis indicated that Hh pathway transcripts were similarly regulated in AML and nonleukemic controls, regardless of whether samples were purified based on primitive phenotypes. Consistent with these results, pharmacologic inhibition of Smoothened (SMO) did not preferentially reduce in\u00a0vitro colony formation of AML versus normal progenitors. Using a unique analytic approach, messenger RNA expression of membrane receptor SMO was found to be unexpectedly rare within all hematopoietic samples analyzed, which is indicative of heterogeneity at the level of Hh signaling machinery. In contrast, abundant SMO expression could be readily detected in the nonhematopoietic fraction of human and murine bone marrow (BM) cells. Our predictions of increased SMO+ cell frequencies within nonhematopoietic BM fractions were further supported by single-cell protein analyses. Although we did not find support for cell-autonomous sensitivity of AML cells to Hh pathway inhibition, we alternatively suggest that nonhematopoietic BM cells represent an indirect target through which primitive normal and leukemic cells can be modulated. These findings suggest current approaches to applying Hh inhibition should be carefully reevaluated to account for BM niche cell regulation that might be selectively Hh responsive.",

The two major splice variants of KIT differ by the presence or absence of four amino acids (GNNK) at the juxta-membrane region of the extracellular domain.

A quantitative real-time PCR assay to assess GNNK\u2013 and GNNK+ transcripts from bone marrow mononuclear cells was developed. The GNNK\u2212/GNNK+ copy number ratio showed a trend toward a positive correlation with the percentage of neoplastic mast cell involvement, and KIT D816V containing transcripts displayed a significantly elevated GNNK\u2212/GNNK+ copy number ratio. Relative expression of only the GNNK\u2212 variant correlated with increasing percentage of neoplastic mast cell involvement. A mast cell transfection system revealed that the GNNK\u2212 isoform of wild type KIT was associated with increased granule formation, histamine content, and growth. When accompanying the KIT D816V mutation, the GNNK\u2013\u00a0isoform enhanced cytokine-free metabolism and moderately reduced sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412. These data suggest that neoplastic mast cells favor a GNNK\u2212 variant predominance, which in turn enhances the activating potential of the KIT D816V mutation and thus could influence therapeutic sensitivity in systemic mastocytosis.",

In this study, we used DNA extracted from archival bone marrow (BM) slides for PCR to detect MRD in 50 patients with MM who received various induction therapies and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Clonotype-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) H PCR primers were prepared for 32 of 50 cases (64%) using BM slides, and for 9 of 14 cases (64%) using fresh BM cells. DNA in peripheral blood stem cell autografts of the 22 patients who achieved at least a partial response after ASCT was subjected to PCR to amplify clonotype-specific rearranged IgH gene sequences. The median PFS of the eight patients with MRD-positive autografts was 18 months, whereas that of 14 patients with MRD-negative autografts was not reached at a median follow-up of 27 months (p = 0.012). Post-ASCT PFS of the four patients who achieved mCR was 100% at a median follow-up of 47 months. These results indicate that archival BM slides can serve as a source of DNA for preparing clonotype-specific primers for MRD monitoring in patients with MM whose cryopreserved myeloma cells are not available for DNA preparation.

In a model in which disease-associated mortality was not prevented by infusion of naive donor Tregs (3 days after transplant) at an effector:suppressor ratio of 10:1, killer Tregs rescued 70% of the mice and improved the clinical and histologic scores. We found that both effector lymphocytes and therapeutic Tregs migrate to and proliferate in the mesenteric lymph nodes of irradiated recipients; however, only killer Tregs increased fractional apoptosis of effector lymphocytes. Although the lymphoid organs were primarily reconstituted from the bone marrow with little contribution of the infused effector and suppressor subsets, immunomodulation with FasL caused a durable rise in fractions of CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs.

However, in rhesus cells, the mismatch between HIV1 capsid and rhesus CypA is recognized by rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 to reduce HIV1 infectivity through proteasomal degradation. To circumvent this block, we previously developed a chimeric HIV1 vector (\u03c7HIV) that substituted HIV1 capsid with SIV capsid, and it significantly increased transduction efficiency for nonhuman primate cells. In this study, we evaluated whether the \u03c7HIV vector efficiently transduces human cells, and the transduction efficiency might increase by a CypA inhibitor (cyclosporine) and a proteasome inhibitor (MG132). The \u03c7HIV vector could transduce human CD34+ cells, as efficiently as the HIV1 vector, in\u00a0vitro and in xenograft mice, even in the mismatch between SIV capsid and human CypA. Cyclosporine decreased transduction efficiency with the HIV1 vector, whereas it slightly increased transduction efficiency with the \u03c7HIV vector in human CD34+ cells. MG132 increased transduction efficiency with both \u03c7HIV and HIV1 vectors in the same manner. However, MG132 was toxic to human CD34+ cells at high concentrations, and both drugs had a small range of effective dosage.

As with other mTOR inhibitors, we show that ciclopirox significantly enhances the ability of the established preclinical antileukemia compound, parthenolide, to target acute myeloid leukemia. The combination of parthenolide and ciclopirox demonstrates greater toxicity against acute myeloid leukemia than treatment with either compound alone. We also demonstrate that the ability of ciclopirox to inhibit mTOR is specific to ciclopirox because neither iron chelators nor other eIF5A inhibitors affect mTOR activity, even at high doses.

We report the results of Burst-forming unit\u2013erythroid (BFU-E) assays in 48 consultative cases of single or multilineage cytopenias with cellular marrows. The final diagnoses included 17 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 9 patients with pure red cell aplasia (non\u2013large granular lymphocytosis [LGL] in etiology], 15 patients with LGL (eight of whom had a single-lineage cytopenia only, whereas the other seven had multilineage cytopenias), and 7 patients with cytopenias associated with systemic inflammation from autoimmune conditions. In this cohort, nonmalignant diseases were well-distinguished from myelodysplastic syndrome by BFU-E growth. Our data suggest that low BFU-E growth (less than 10 BFU-E per 105 marrow mononuclear cells) helps to exclude LGL, pure red cell aplasia, or cytopenias associated with systemic inflammation as a cause of pancytopenia with a sensitivity of 96.8%, specificity of 76.5%, and a predictive value of 88.2% (p = 0.0001).

Our results suggest that BFU-E assays are a useful adjunct in the diagnosis and management of cytopenias in the setting of a normocellular or hypercellular marrows.",

     "abstract": "We introduce a new, minimally invasive laboratory technique called reticulocyte-based estimation of lifespan (REBEL) of erythrocytes in humans. Its major advantage over existing techniques is its applicability to patients with both changing and steady-state erythropoiesis status. The feasibility of REBEL was tested in five patients with hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease. The RNA degradation half-life was first determined for each subject on day 1 by flow cytometry measurement of the decay rate of thiazole orange stain. Reticulocyte age distribution was then measured from residual RNA content weekly for 2 months to estimate the RBC production rate time course. Mean RBC lifespan per subject was estimated by fitting the integrated RBC production rate over time to the measured RBC count and optimizing the integration limits. The mean reticulocyte RNA half-life was 0.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 days. The small coefficient of variation (15.6%) indicated that the degradation rate of RNA did not vary substantially between subjects. The mean RBC lifespan (TRBC\u00a0=\u00a076.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.8 days) was comparable to the reported values for this patient population.",

Through binding to this receptor complex, TIMP-1 activates \u03b21-integrin, increases adhesion and migration of human CD34+ cells, and protects these cells from induced apoptosis. TIMP-1 stimulation in murine bone marrow mononuclear cells also promotes migration and adhesion; this is associated with augmented homing of murine mononuclear cells and of murine LSK+ cells during bone marrow transplantation.

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is considered a hematopoietic stem cell disease that is characterized by abnormal hematopoietic differentiation and a high propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia. It is mostly associated with advanced age, but also with prior cancer therapy and inherited syndromes related to abnormalities in DNA repair. Recent technologic advances have led to the identification of a myriad of frequently occurring genomic perturbations associated with MDS. These observations suggest that MDS and its progression to acute myeloid leukemia is a genomic instability disorder, resulting from a stepwise accumulation of genetic abnormalities. The notion is now emerging that the underlying mechanism of this disease could be a defect in one or more pathways that are involved in responding to or repairing damaged DNA. In this review, we discuss these pathways in relationship to a large number of studies performed with MDS patient samples and MDS mouse models. Moreover, in view of our current understanding of how DNA damage response and repair pathways are affected by age in hematopoietic stem cells, we also explore how this might relate to MDS development.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has dramatically improved the treatment outcomes of patients with B cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the clinical response to rituximab varies, and a subpopulation of patients does not respond well to this antibody. Although several molecular events have been shown to be involved in the mechanism of action of rituximab, recent studies have demonstrated that intracellular signaling pathways and the direct effects of rituximab on cell membrane components are responsible for the antilymphoma action of this drug. In the present study, we demonstrated that rituximab activated Syk and Akt, molecules with antiapoptotic functions, in several CD20-positive lymphoma cell lines. Notably, rituximab activated Syk and Akt in all the tested primary lymphoma samples from six patients. Our results show that the cholesterol levels in lymphoma cell membranes have a crucial role in the regulation of Syk and Akt. The depletion of cholesterol from the cell membrane completely blocked rituximab-induced Syk and Akt activation. Simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, also abrogated rituximab-mediated Syk and Akt activation. Finally, we report that rituximab inhibited the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, which was observed solely in Akt-activated cells. This work demonstrates for the first time that rituximab paradoxically works to suppress apoptosis under certain conditions in a manner that is dependent on the cell membrane cholesterol level. Our observations provide novel insights and suggest that the cell membrane cholesterol level represents a new biomarker for predicting patient response to rituximab. Furthermore, the modulation of lipid rafts could provide a new strategy for enhancing the antilymphoma action of rituximab.",

Mouse models have not been useful because of a lack of significant response to oxidative challenge. We turned to zebrafish (Danrio rerio) embryos, which develop ex utero and are transparent, allowing visualization of hemolysis. We designed morpholinos to zebrafish g6pd that were effective in reducing gene expression as shown by Western blot and G6PD enzyme activity, resulting in a brisk hemolysis and pericardial edema secondary to anemia. Titration of the g6pd knockdown allowed us to generate embryos that displayed no overt phenotype until exposed to the prooxidant compounds 1-naphthol, menthol, or primaquine, after which they developed hemolysis and pericardial edema within 48\u201372 hours. We were also able to show that g6pd morphants displayed significant levels of increased oxidative stress compared with controls.

However, the functional role of sICAM-1 remains unknown. In this study, we found that Epstein-Barr virus\u2013positive NNKTL cell line SNK6 secreted sICAM-1 in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, exogenous sICAM-1 enhanced the growth of SNK6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In comparison, neutralizing ICAM-1 and LFA-1 antibodies, as well as the LFA-1 blocker simvastatin, caused a dose-dependent reduction in the number of viable SNK6 cells. Double immunohistologic staining of NNKTL tissues confirmed that CD56 positive lymphoma cells coexpressed LFA-1. Moreover, serum sICAM-1 levels in NNKTL patients decreased after treatment, suggesting that the levels reflected disease progression.

To identify an improved pretransplant conditioning regimen, we investigated the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine (Gem) and clofarabine (Clo) combinations toward MM cell lines and patient cell samples. A strong synergism of the two nucleoside analogs, when combined at their approximate IC10 concentrations, was observed. This synergism could be partly due to the observed Gem-mediated phosphorylation and activation of deoxycytidine kinase, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Gem and Clo. Their cytotoxicity correlated with a robust activation of the DNA damage response pathway. [Gem+Clo] decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential with a concomitant release of proapoptotic factors into the cytoplasm and nucleus and the activation of apoptosis. Exposure of MM cells to [Gem+Clo] also decreased the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which might have resulted in nucleolar stress, as reported previously, and caused a p53-dependent cell death. A reduction by approximately 50% in the cytotoxicity of Gem and Clo was observed in the presence of pifithrin \u03b1, a p53 inhibitor. Furthermore, MM cell lines with mutant p53 exhibited greater resistance to Gem and Clo, supporting a role for the p53 protein in these cytotoxic responses.

Within the system, two flows in different directions in which the angle between the directions of flow is 60 degrees but not 90 degrees contributed to suitable pressure and shear stress applied to MKs to promote platelet generation.

BMT of lethally irradiated mice lacking both endothelial selectins (E/P KO) with limiting numbers of wild type BM cells rescued significantly fewer E/P KO than WT recipients, but higher numbers of transplanted WT cells rescued E/P KOs in a dose-dependent fashion. Short-term homing assays confirmed a substantial defect in HSPC homing to BM in E/P KO mice. In contrast, BMT of E-selectin null or P-selectin null mice at limiting cell number uniformly rescued greater than 95% of the transplanted animals. Consistent with these functional results, flow cytometric analysis revealed both E-selectin ligands and P-selectin ligands on distinct subsets of HSPC.

In this report, we evaluated combination effects of dasatinib and dexamethasone on CD3+ and virus-specific CD8+ T cells directly ex\u00a0vivo and on antigen-specific leukemia-reactive and alloreactive CD8+ T cell clones. Functional outcomes assessed included cytokine production (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1), degranulation (CD107a/b), activation (CD69 upregulation), proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis induction, and signal transduction. Overall, helper CD4+ T cells were more sensitive to inhibitory effects of the drug combination than cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and were more naive than memory T cell subsets. Of note, synergistic inhibitory effects occurred in different memory but not in naive T cell subsets. The drug combination inhibited virus-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation, but left cytokine production and degranulation unaltered, which may be due to the viral memory subset composition. Dasatinib rather hampered IFN-\u03b3 secretion and cytotoxic activity of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-reactive CTLs, whereas effector functions of leukemia-reactive CTLs were maintained or enhanced when applied long term. Our data suggest that dasatinib might modulate GvL- differently than GvHD-promoting CTLs and provide a rationale to explore the drug combination further to treat GvHD while preserving GvL and antiviral CTL responses.",

The rate-limiting component of telomerase is human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), for which multiple transcripts exist. Two splicing sites, \u03b1 and \u03b2, have been described that generate deleted transcripts. Only the full-length (FL; \u03b1+\u03b2+) transcript translates into a functional protein. The aim of this work was to characterize hTERT splice variants in CLL in relation to disease activity, clinical stage, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes mutational status, and TL. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were validated for quantification of the hTERT transcripts with either \u03b1 deletion (del-\u03b1; \u03b1\u2212\u03b2+), \u03b2 deletion (del-\u03b2; \u03b1+\u03b2\u2212) or both \u03b1 and \u03b2 deletions (del-\u03b1\u03b2; \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2212). The splice variant expression pattern was studied in 97 patients with CLL, 6 healthy control subjects, and one CD34+ cell sample. TL was assessed with real-time polymerase chain reaction in 71 of 97 samples. Thirty-two percent of the cases did not express any of the splice variants. Average FL expression was 5.5-fold higher in IGHV-unmutated (n = 35) compared with mutated (n = 59) patients (p\u00a0< 0.0001).

More than half of the patients with CMN received at least 1 year of cytoreduction, mainly HU, before TL analysis. JAK2 mutation analysis was performed as well. TL was significantly shortened in patients with CMN compared with CTR (p < 0.0001). PV and MF showed the most pronounced decrease (p < 0.0001), whereas both essential thrombocythemia and SE showed no significant difference in TL compared with CTR. A short TL correlated with JAK2-V617F allele burden greater than 50% (p = 0.0025), age (p = 0.0132) and diagnosis of PV (p = 0.0122). No correlation was found with disease duration, history of thrombosis, cytoreductive treatment, antiaggregation agents, adverse cytogenetics, phlebotomies, or time to evolution to MF. In summary, TL is distinctly shortened in PV and MF, and it inversely correlates with JAK2V617F allele burden. In addition, HU is unlikely to contribute to telomere erosion. Lastly, PV and SE significantly differ in TL. Therefore, TL could be an additional diagnostic marker to identify and monitor Ph-neg-CMN patients.",

     "abstract": "Laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the oxygenation response of single normal adult, sickle, and cord blood red blood cells (RBCs) to an applied mechanical force. Individual cells were subjected to different forces by varying the laser power of a single-beam optical trap, and the intensities of several oxygenation-specific Raman spectral peaks were monitored to determine the oxygenation state of the cells. For all three cell types, an increase in laser power (or mechanical force) induced a greater deoxygenation of the cell. However, sickle RBCs deoxygenated more readily than normal RBCs when subjected to the same optical forces. Conversely, cord blood RBCs were able to maintain their oxygenation better than normal RBCs. These results suggest that differences in the chemical or mechanical properties of fetal, normal, and sickle cells affect the degree to which applied mechanical forces can deoxygenate the cell. Populations of normal, sickle, and cord RBCs were identified and discriminated based on this mechanochemical phenomenon. This study demonstrates the potential application of laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy as a single-cell, label-free analytical tool to characterize the functional (e.g., mechanical deformability, oxygen binding) properties of normal and diseased RBCs.",

In this study, we show that CIK cells have activity against subcutaneous and disseminated models of human myeloma (KAS-6/1), which can be enhanced by infecting the CIK cells with an oncolytic measles virus (MV) or by pretreating the myeloma cells with ionizing radiation (XRT). KAS-6/1 cells were killed by coculture with CIK or MV-infected CIK (CIK/MV) cells, and the addition of an anti-NKG2D antibody inhibited cytolysis by 50%. However, human bone marrow stromal cells can reduce CIK and CIK/MV mediated killing of myeloma cells (RPMI 8226, JJN-3 and MM1). In\u00a0vivo, CIK and CIK/MV prolonged the survival of mice with systemic myeloma, although CIK/MV showed enhanced antitumor activity compared with CIK. Irradiation of the KAS-6/1 cells induced mRNA and protein expression of NKG2D ligands, MICA, and MICB in a dose-dependent manner and enhanced delivery of CIK/MV to the irradiated tumors. In both subcutaneous and disseminated myeloma models, XRT at 2 Gy resulted in superior prolongation of the survival of mice given CIK/MV therapy compared with CIK/MV with no XRT. This study demonstrates the potential of CIK against myeloma and that the combination of virotherapy with radiation could be used to further enhance therapeutic outcome using CIK cells.",

     "abstract": "Hoxa9 is expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, although this expression is usually diminished as these cells undergo differentiation. In addition, aberrant expression of Hoxa9 is strongly associated with both T cell and myeloid leukemia in mice and humans. Despite this strong association, enforced expression of Hoxa9 in murine bone marrow or thymus has only shown a modest ability to transform cells. To investigate this question, we used Vav regulatory elements to generate a transgenic mouse that targets Hoxa9 overexpression to all hematopoietic tissues. High-level expression of the Hoxa9 transgene in the hematopoietic compartment was associated with embryonic lethality, as no pups from founders that expressed high levels of the transgene were born live. However, offspring of an additional founder line, which expressed lower levels of Hoxa9, developed a precursor T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, accompanied by spontaneous Notch1 mutations. In contrast to most murine models of leukemia associated with Hoxa9 overexpression, the Vav-Hoxa9 mice did not overexpress other Hoxa cluster genes, mir196b (a microRNA that is embedded in the Hoxa locus), Meis1, or Pbx3. The Hoxa9 transgenic mouse reported in this study provides a suitable system for the study of Hoxa9 collaborators that drive myeloid and lymphoid malignant transformation.",

In this study, we questioned whether leukemic stem cell\u2013enriched CD34+ cells are sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Surprisingly, we observed in short-term and long-term culture assays that CD34\u2212 AML cells were more sensitive to bortezomib treatment compared with the CD34+ AML cells at a clinical relevant dosage. Cotreatment with the apoptosis-inducing cytokine TRAIL did not enhance cell death in CD34+ AML cells, in contrast to the effects in AML cell lines. The better survival of CD34+ AML cells upon bortezomib treatment was due to a persisting NF-\u03baB activity that could be overcome by the IKK inhibitor BMS-345541. This difference in sensitivity might be related to differences in NF-\u03baB activation in AML CD34+ versus CD34\u2212 cells, as suggested by a gene expression profiling study. Besides NF-\u03baB, MCL-1 strongly determines the effectiveness of bortezomib. MCL-1 accumulated in CD34+ AML cells upon bortezomib treatment and inhibition of MCL-1 by shRNA, or Obatoclax, significantly improved the sensitivity of CD34+ AML cells to bortezomib. These results demonstrate that combining bortezomib with specific NF-\u03baB or MCL-1 inhibitors might potentially target the leukemic stem cells.",

We investigated the in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo effects of ICAs in murine leukemic cell lines regarding the iron status. The viability of both EL4 cells and L1210 cells incubated with either deferoxamine (DFO) or deferasirox (DFX) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was most prominent in L1210 cells treated with DFX. The viability of L1210 cells incubated with both ICAs did not change regardless of the presence of ferric chloride. The percentage of apoptosis in L1210 cells treated with DFO or DFX increased in a concentration-dependent manner; however, the expression of Fas showed no significant change. The non-SIO mice and SIO mice bearing L1210 cells showed longer survival than other groups when treated with DFX, whereas the SIO mice treated with DFO showed shorter survival than the control group. The tumor was significantly smaller in the SIO mice treated with DFX or DFO compared with the control group. The iron content of the liver or the tumor in SIO mice decreased after ICA treatment. This study indicates an antileukemic effect of DFX regardless of iron status and suggests that the use of DFX has a survival benefit for SIO leukemia murine model in terms of iron chelation and antileukemic therapy.",

The coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is not only essential for cellular metabolism; it also affects activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, such as PARP-1 and SIRT-1. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT/PBEF/visfatin, encoded by PBEF1) is a rate-limiting enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis from nicotinamide. Coculture of primary MM cells with osteoclasts induced PBEF1 upregulation in both cell types. PBEF1 expression was higher in experimental myelomatous bones than in nonmyelomatous bone and higher in MM patients\u2019 plasma cells than in healthy donors\u2019 counterparts. APO866 is a specific PBEF1 inhibitor known to deplete cellular NAD+. APO866 at low nanomolar concentrations inhibited growth of primary MM cells or MM cell lines cultured alone or cocultured with osteoclasts and induced apoptosis in these cells. PBEF1 activity and NAD+ content were reduced in MM cells by APO866, resulting in lower activity of PARP-1 and SIRT-1. The inhibitory effect of APO866 on MM cell growth was abrogated by supplementation of extracellular NAD+ or NAM. APO866 inhibited NF-\u03baB activity in osteoclast precursors and suppressed osteoclast formation and activity. PBEF1 knockdown similarly inhibited MM cell growth and osteoclast formation. In the SCID-rab model, APO866 inhibited growth of primary MM and H929 cells and prevented bone disease. These findings indicate that MM cells and osteoclasts are highly sensitive to NAD+ depletion and that PBEF1 inhibition represents a novel approach to target cellular metabolism and inhibit PARP-1 and bone disease in MM.",

In this specific microenvironment where adipocytes can interact with a variety of different cells, the role of fat is mainly unknown. To our knowledge, this report is the first to characterize mature adipocytes isolated from human bone marrow (BM-A) molecularly and functionally to better understand their roles into the hematopoietic microenvironment. Healthy BM-A were isolated after collagenase digestion and filtration. We studied the morphology of BM-A, their gene expression and immunophenotypic profile and their functional ability in the hematopoietic microenvironment, comparing them with adipocytes derived from adipose tissue (AT-A). BM-A showed a unilocular lipid morphology similar to AT-A and did not lose their morphology in culture; they showed a comparable pattern of stem cell-surface antigens to AT-A. In line with these observations, molecular data showed that BM-A expressed some embryonic stem cells genes, such as Oct4, KLf4, c-myc, Gata4, Tbx1, and Sox17, whereas they did not express the stem cell markers Sox2 and Nanog. Moreover, BM-A had long telomeres that were similar to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Notably, BM-A supported the survival and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in long-term cultures. These results showed that BM-A are stromal cells with a gene expression pattern that distinguished them from AT-A. BM-A showed stem cell properties through their hematopoietic supporting function, which was certainly linked to their role in the maintenance of the bone marrow microenvironment. Depending on specific demands, BM-A may acquire different functions based on their local environment.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic cells (HPCs) develop from hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs), a specialized type of ECs undergoing hematopoietic transition. However, the mesoderm origin for hemogenic ECs or HPCs has not been clarified. To examine the origin for hemogenic mesoderm, we inactivated Etv2, a master regulator for EC/HPC commitment, in specific regions. Region-specific Etv2 ablation in early mesoderm caused local EC differentiation block, resulting in the loss of specific vascular beds without compensatory migration of residual ECs into avascular area. This feature of local EC/HPC differentiation block was correlated to the hemogenic potential of each mesoderm subset. We found that caudal-lateral mesoderm of E7.5-8.5 embryos represent the pre-committed population critical for generating hemogenic ECs. Etv2 ablation in caudal-lateral mesoderm by Hoxb6 Cre or Hoxb6CreER transgene affected vitelline plexus formation and intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters. In differentiated embryonic stem cells, this mesoderm subset marked by Hoxb6-lateral mesoderm promoter showed enriched T lymphopoietic potential among Flk-1+ cells, which could be regarded as a characteristic for definitive HPCs. These findings indicate that critical mesoderm precursors possibly for definitive type hemogenic ECs are regionally specified in primitive mesoderm, suggesting that Hoxb6+ caudal-lateral mesoderm represents the critical source of HPCs, which are potentially useful to enrich definitive HPCs from embryonic stem cells.",

     "abstract": "The ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is complex, with multiple sites of embryonic origin as well as several locations of expansion and maturation in the embryo and the adult. Hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) with diverse developmental potential are first found in the yolk sac, aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and placenta. These progenitors then colonize the fetal liver (FL), where they undergo expansion and maturation. HSCs from the FL colonize the fetal bone marrow (FBM), governed by a complex orchestration of transcription programs including migratory molecules with chemotactic activity, adhesion molecules, and molecules that modulate the extracellular matrix. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the patterns of HSC migration between FL and FBM could improve the engraftment potential of embryonic stem cell\u2013derived HPs, because these cells might display a migratory behavior more similar to early HPs than to adult HSCs. Understanding the changes in migratory behavior in the context of FL to FBM HSC migration could lead to new approaches in the treatment of blood malignancies. We will review the current knowledge in the field of FL to the FBM HSCs migration during development, focusing on changes in expression of molecules important for this process and exploring its clinical applications.",

To explore this hypothesis, we studied KIRs and their human leukocyte antigen class I ligands in 59 consecutive patients with chronic-phase CML (mean age, 53 years; range, 23\u201381 years) and a group of 121 healthy control participants belonging to the same ethnic group as the patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence of complete molecular response, obtained after a median of 27 months (range, 4\u201352 months), was 51.2%. An increased frequency of the activating receptor KIR2DS1 (pm = 0.05) and a reduced frequency of the KIR-ligand combination KIR2DS2/2DL2 absent/C1 present (pm = 0.001) were significantly associated with CML. Moreover, KIR repertoires in patients appeared to influence response to TKI therapy. Homozygosity for KIR haplotype A (pm = 0.01), a decreased frequency of the inhibitory KIR gene KIR2DL2 (pm = 0.02), and low numbers of inhibitory KIR genes (pm = 0.05) were all significantly associated with achievement of complete molecular remission. These data suggest that a decrease in properly stimulated and activated NK cells might contribute to the occurrence of CML and indicate homozygosity for KIR haplotype A as a promising immunogenetic marker of complete molecular response that could help clinicians decide whether to withdraw treatment in patients with CML.",

It remains unclear how individual cells initially sense changes in phosphate availability and the cellular consequences of these changes. PiT1 (or SLC20A1) is a constitutively expressed, high-affinity sodium-dependent phosphate import protein. In\u00a0vitro data suggest that PiT1 serves a direct role in mediating cellular proliferation; its role in\u00a0vivo is unclear. We have discovered that mice lacking PiT1 develop a profound underproduction anemia characterized by mild macrocytosis, dyserythropoiesis, increased apoptosis, and a near complete block in terminal erythroid differentiation. In addition, the animals are severely B cell lymphopenic because of a defect in pro\u2013B cell development and mildly neutropenic. The phenotype is intrinsic to the hematopoietic system, is associated with a defect in cell cycle progression, and occurs in the absence of changes in serum phosphate or calcium concentrations and independently of a change in cellular phosphate uptake. The severity of the anemia and block in terminal erythroid differentiation and B cell lymphopenia are striking and suggest that PiT1 serves a fundamental and nonredundant role in murine terminal erythroid differentiation and B cell development. Intriguingly, as the anemia mimics the ineffective erythropoiesis in some low-grade human myelodysplastic syndromes, this murine model might also provide pathologic insight into these disorders.",

The ATX protein acts as a secreted lysophospholipase D by converting lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which signals via G-protein\u2013coupled receptors and has important functions in cell migration and proliferation. This study demonstrates that ATX expression is specifically upregulated and functionally active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of the FLT3 receptor gene.Moreover, ATX expression was also found in normal human CD34+ progenitor cells and selected myeloid and lymphoid subpopulations. Enforced expression of mutant FLT3-ITD by retroviral vector transduction increased ATX mRNA in selected cell lines, whereas inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling by sublethal doses of PKC412 or SU5614 led to a significant downregulation of ATX mRNA and protein levels. In the presence of LPC, ATX expression significantly increased proliferation. LPA induced proliferation, regardless of ATX expression, and induced chemotaxis in all tested human leukemic cell lines and human CD34+ progenitors. LPC increased chemotaxis only in cells with high expression of endogenous ATX by at least 80%, demonstrating the autocrine action of ATX. Inhibition of ATX using a small molecule inhibitor selectively induced killing of ATX-expressing cell lines and reduced motility in these cells. Our data suggest that the production of bioactive LPA through ATX is involved in controlling proliferation and migration during hematopoiesis and that deregulation of ATX contributes to the pathogenesis of AML.",

In this study, we demonstrate that mTOR activation in CML CD34+ progenitor cells is ERK dependent in chronic phase of the disease and ERK independent in blast crisis. Rapamycin effectively inhibits mTOR in all phases of CML, but does not reduce number of LSC-enriched CD34+ blast crisis (BC) cells, neither alone nor in combination with imatinib in CML-BC cells.

Selective inhibition within the JAK family can be beneficial in avoiding undesirable side effects (e.g., immunosuppression) caused by parallel inhibition of other JAK members. In an effort to design an assay paradigm for the development of JAK2 selective inhibitors, we investigated whether compound selectivity differed between cellular and purified enzyme environments. A set of JAK2 inhibitors was tested in a high-throughput JAK family cell assay suite and in corresponding purified enzyme assays. The high-throughput JAK cell assay suite comprises Ba/F3 cells individually expressing translocated ETS leukemia (TEL) fusions of each JAK family member (TEL-JAK Ba/F3) and an AlphaScreen phosphorylated-STAT5 (pSTAT5) immunoassay. Compound potencies from the TEL-JAK Ba/F3 pSTAT5 assays were similar to those determined in downstream cell proliferation measurements and more physiologically relevant cytokine-induced pSTAT5 PBMC assays. However, compound selectivity data between cell and purified enzyme assays were discrepant because of different potency shifts between cell and purified enzyme values for each JAK family member. For any JAK small molecule development program, our results suggest that relying solely on enzyme potency and selectivity data may be misleading. Adopting the high-throughput TEL-JAK Ba/F3 pSTAT5 cell assay suite in lead development paradigms should provide a more meaningful understanding of selectivity and facilitate the development of more selective JAK inhibitors.",

To study the effects of T315I-mutated breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell, we have used the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hematopoiesis model. Native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL were introduced retrovirally in mESC-derived embryonic bodies followed by induction of hematopoiesis. In several experiments, T315I-mutated and nonmutated BCR-ABL\u2013transduced embryonic bodies rapidly generated hematopoietic cells on OP-9 feeders, with evidence of hematopoietic stem cell markers. After injection into NOD/SCID mice, these cells induced myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, whereas transplantation of control (nontransduced) hematopoietic cells failed to produce any hematopoietic reconstitution in\u00a0vivo. Moreover, the expression of native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL conferred to mESC-derived hematopoietic cells a self-renewal capacity demonstrated by the generation of leukemias after secondary transplantations. Secondary leukemias were more aggressive with evidence of extramedullary tumors. The expression of stem cell regulator Musashi-2 was found to be increased in bone marrow of leukemic mice. These data show that T315I-mutated BCR-ABL is functional at the stem cell level, conferring to mESC-derived leukemic cells a long-term hematopoietic repopulation ability.

     "abstract": "This study evaluated the clinical and pathologic effects of human umbilical cord blood\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) in the recovery from total body irradiation by comparing it with the effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), an efficacious drug in the treatment of acute bone marrow radiation syndrome. BALB/c mice were treated with G-CSF or hUCB-MSCs after they were irradiated with 7 Gy cobalt-60 \u03b3-rays. Circulating blood counts, histopathologic changes in the bone marrow, and plasma level of Flt-3L and transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21) were monitored in the postirradiation period. Hematologic analysis revealed that the peripheral leukocyte counts were markedly increased in the hUCB-MSCs\u2013treated group, whereas G-CSF\u2013treated mice did not recover significantly. Moreover, differential counts showed that hUCB-MSC treatment has regenerative effects on white blood cells, lymphocytes, and monocytes compared with the irradiated group. Treatment with hUCB-MSCs or G-CSF significantly increased immunoreactivity of Ki-67 until 3 weeks after total body irradiation. However, at 3 weeks, the number of Ki-67 immunoreactive cells significantly increased in the hUCB-MSCs\u2013treated group compared with the G-CSF\u2013treated group. Furthermore, hUCB-MSC treatment significantly modulated plasma levels of the hematopoietic cytokines Flt-3L and TGF-\u03b21, whereas G-CSF treatment failed to decrease the plasma Flt-3L levels at 2 weeks after irradiation. Based on the differences in circulating blood cell reconstitution and cell density of bone marrow, the authors suggest that MSC treatment is superior to G-CSF treatment for hematopoietic reconstitution following sublethal dose radiation exposure.",

     "abstract": "Transcription factors are key regulators of both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has become the method of choice to interrogate the genome-wide effect of transcription factors. We have collected and integrated 142 publicly available ChIP-Seq datasets for both normal and leukemic murine blood cell types. In addition, we introduce the new bioinformatic tool Gene Set Control Analysis (GSCA). GSCA predicts likely upstream regulators for lists of genes based on statistical significance of binding event enrichment within the gene loci of a user-supplied gene set. We show that GSCA analysis of lineage-restricted gene sets reveals expected and previously unrecognized candidate upstream regulators. Moreover, application of GSCA to leukemic gene sets allowed us to predict the reactivation of blood stem cell control mechanisms as a likely contributor to LMO2 driven leukemia. It also allowed us to clarify the recent debate on the role of Myc in leukemia stem cell transcriptional programs. As a result, GSCA provides a valuable new addition to analyzing gene sets of interest, complementary to Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment analyses. To facilitate access to the wider research community, we have implemented GSCA as a freely accessible web tool (http://bioinformatics.cscr.cam.ac.uk/GSCA/GSCA.html).",

We examined the regulation of human early T lymphopoiesis by human bone marrow stromal cells to explore in\u00a0vitro manipulation of human T cell precursors in a human-only coculture system. The generation of CD7+CD56\u2212cyCD3\u2212 proT cells from human hematopoietic progenitors on telomerized human bone marrow stromal cells was enhanced by stem cell factor, flt3 ligand, and thrombopoietin, but these stimulatory effects were suppressed by interleukin 3. Expression of Notch ligands Delta-1 and -4 on stromal cells additively promoted T cell differentiation into the CD7+cyCD3+ pre\u2013T cell stage, while cell growth was strongly inhibited. By combining these coculture systems, we found that initial coculture with telomerized stromal cells in the presence of stem cell factor, flt3 ligand, and thrombopoietin, followed by coculture on Delta-1\u2013 and -4\u2013coexpressing stromal cells led to a higher percentage and number of pre\u2013T cells. Adoptive immunotherapy using peripheral blood T cells transduced with a tumor antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) is a promising strategy but has several limitations, such as the risk of forming a chimeric TCR with the endogenous TCR. We demonstrated that incubation of TCR-transduced hematopoietic progenitors with the combination of coculture systems gave rise to CD7+TCR+CD3+CD1a\u2212 T cell precursors that rapidly proliferated and differentiated under the culture condition to induce mature T cell differentiation. These data show the regulatory mechanism of early T lymphopoiesis on human stromal cells and the potential utility of engineered human stromal cells to manipulate early T cell development for clinical application.",

In a murine model of T-ALL induced by the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1), the genetic interaction between ICN1 signaling and Arf inactivation is developmentally stage-specific, with a more pronounced requirement for Arf deletion in thymocytes than in bone marrow precursors targeted for transformation. In the thymus, the target cell for transformation is a CD4 and CD8 double-negative progenitor that undergoes T cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement, a cell type in which polycomb silencing of Ink4a-Arf is normally requisite. Epigenetic remodeling during tumor progression licenses Arf as a tumor suppressor and in turn provides the selective pressure for Ink4a-Arf deletion in clonal T-ALLs that emerge.",

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of the immunomodulatory drugs on RANKL/OPG ratio, the production of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines, and MM-induced OC formation. We found that in\u00a0vivo concentrations of both lenalidomide (LEN) and pomalidomide (POM) significantly blunted RANKL upregulation normalizing the RANKL/OPG ratio in human osteoprogenitor cells (PreOBs) when co-cultured with MM cells and also inhibited CCL3 production by MM cells. A reduction in CD49d expression, a molecule critically involved in RANKL upregulation in the MM microenvironment, accompanied this effect. Consistently, the pro-osteoclastogenic property of MM cells co-cultured with PreOBs was reduced by both LEN and POM. We further investigated the effect of these drugs on the transcriptional profile of both MM cells and PreOBs by microarray analysis, which showed that adhesion molecules, such as ITGA8 and ICAM2, are significantly downregulated in MM cells. Our data suggest that LEN and POM inhibit MM-induced OC formation through normalization of the RANKL/OPG ratio targeting the expression of adhesion molecules by MM cells.",

In this report, we examine the mechanical properties of these cells to determine how their mechanical development differs from that of definitive erythroid cells, which mature extravascularly in protected marrow microenvironments. Primitive erythroid cells acquire normal membrane deformability by E12.5 (i.e., as late stage erythroblasts) and maintain the same level of surface stiffness through E17.5. During this same period, the strength of association between the membrane bilayer and the underlying skeleton increases, as indicated by an approximate doubling of the energy required to separate bilayer from skeleton. At the same time, these cells undergo dramatic changes in surface area and volume, losing 35% of their surface area and 50% of their volume from E14.5 to E17.5. Interestingly, membrane remodeling proceeded regardless of whether the cells completed enucleation. These data suggest that in primitive erythroid cells, unlike their definitive counterparts, the critical maturational processes of membrane remodeling and enucleation are uncoupled.",

However, resistance to rituximab often occurs in B-NHL patients, which has encouraged us to find new medications to treat B-NHL. In this study, we designed a gene therapy strategy targeting CD20 at a transcriptional level mediated by adenovirus, in which the stTRAIL gene was driven by a specific CD20 promoter fragment. We cloned the CD20 promoter from genome DNA of BJAB cell, a CD20-positive cell line, and identified its specific transcriptional activity with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. Meanwhile, we constructed the stTRAIL gene sequence, which contained secretion signal, isoleucine zipper, and soluble TRAIL gene sequence, in which the isoleucine zipper facilitated the product of this gene sequence to form a functional homotrimer. The recombinant adenovirus was termed as AdP20-stTRAIL, which carried on the fused gene of the CD20 promoter fragment and the stTRAIL gene. Our studies confirmed that the stTRAIL could be expressed and secreted from BJAB cells infected with AdP20-stTRAIL specifically, and it inhibited the growth of these infected BJAB cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Our results indicate that the gene therapy using stTRAIL gene driven by a CD20 promoter may be an effective strategy in B-NHL treatment.",

T cells were analyzed for expression of surface molecules, cytokine secretion, the presence of regulatory T cells, and the specific activation against the multiple myeloma antigen HM1.24. T cells from 69 multiple myeloma patients were analyzed: 19 patients were treated with IFN-\u03b1; 26 were treated with Thalidomide; and 24 patients received no maintenance therapy. Specific T cell activation with an immunogenic HLA-A2+\u2013restricted peptide from the myeloma-associated antigen HM1.24 was impaired in the Thalidomide group. In accordance with this observation, there was a trend toward a higher amount of regulatory T cells in the Thalidomide group. Furthermore, patients treated with IFN-\u03b1 showed high rates of naive T cells, whereas a high rate of effector memory T cells was observed in the Thalidomide group. Importantly, after cessation of Thalidomide therapy, this effect was reversible in the CD8 compartment.

Cytotoxicity (against K562 and U937 cell lines) and cytokine secretion (interleukin-2, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) were tested for AML-derived and healthy donor-derived CIK cells and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Importantly, we assessed the therapeutic effects of autologous CIK cell infusions in two patients with AML. The proportions of CD3+and CD3+CD56+ CIK cells from patients with AML were similar to those from healthy donors, and the number of CD3+CD56+ cells in AML-derived CIK cells was expanded approximately 1,020-fold. Phenotype analyses with flow cytometry showed that the leukemic cells were gradually eliminated during the process of CIK cell preparation to an almost undetectable level. Although the cytotoxic effect of AML-derived CIK cells was equivalent to that of healthy donors, AML-derived CIK cells had a significantly higher cytokine-secreting capacity.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors have been reported to possess anticancer activity through different mechanisms. However, whether HDACs inhibitors suppress JAK2/STAT signaling in MPNs is still unknown. In this study, we show that the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) inhibited JAK2/STAT signaling and increased the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, both of which are the potent feedback inhibitors of JAK2/STAT signaling. SB upregulated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 by triggering the promoter-associated histone acetylation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in K562 and HEL cell lines. Importantly, we found that upon knockdown of each class I HDACs, only knockdown of HDAC8 resulted in the increased expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Moreover, overexpression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 significantly inhibited cell growth and suppressed JAK2/STAT signaling in K562 and HEL cells. Furthermore, SB increased the transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and inhibited the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with MPNs. Taken together, these data establish a new anticancer mechanism that SB inhibits JAK2/STAT signaling through HDAC8-mediated upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Thus, HDACs inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of MPNs.",

In cells coexpressing RTK class III/CBL\u0394exon8, receptor internalization was delayed, and cells were protected from apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal. Ligand-stimulated Ba/F3 cells and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines coexpressing the CBL deletion mutant and FLT3 showed enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and FLT3 had an additive effect on cell proliferation. The transforming potential of the CBL mutant was completely abolished by the mutation of the CBL PTB domain and was decreased by the mutation of tyrosines 589 and 591 in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3.

These cells are named \u201cL-DCs\u201d because they reflect dendritic cells (DCs) produced in long-term spleen cultures (LTC). Similar cells were produced when bone marrow progenitors were cocultured over the splenic stromal line 5G3. Cocultures continuously produced a majority of L-DCs and a transient population of cells reflecting conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Both the L-DC and cDC-like subsets cross-present antigen to CD8+ T cells, inducing their activation and proliferation. However, as MHC-II\u2212 cells, L-DCs are unable to activate CD4+ T cells, while MHC-II+ cDC-like cells present antigen for CD4+ T cell activation. These results distinguish two APC subsets produced in\u00a0vitro: a transient population of cDC-like cells and L-DCs that are continuously produced, presumably from self-renewing progenitors.

ALL cells remained in the circulation up to 6 hours after AMD3100 administration, by which time normal HPCs were no longer detectable. AMD3100 also increased the proportion of actively cycling ALL cells in the peripheral blood. Together, these data suggest that ALL cells are more sensitive to the effects of bone marrow disruption than normal progenitors. Using the NOD/SCID xenograft model, we demonstrated that AMD3100 increased the efficacy of the cell cycle specific drug vincristine, resulting in reduced disease levels in the blood and spleens of animals over 3 weeks and extended the survival of NOD/SCID mice with ALL.

The analysis demonstrated that 667 and 598 genes were upregulated and downregulated (more than twofold), respectively, in ETO2-overexpressing cells. ETO2-repressed genes included those encoding prototypical erythroid proteins. To test what percentages of ETO2-repressed genes could be direct target genes of GATA-1 in K562 cells, we merged the microarray results with ChIP-seq profile (n\u00a0=\u00a05,749), demonstrating that 23.1% of ETO2-repressed genes contained significant GATA-1 in their loci. However, there was no significant enrichment of PU.1 target genes among ETO2-repressed genes. Gene ontology analysis among ETO2-repressed genes revealed significant enrichment of genes related to \u201coxygen transporter,\u201d corresponding to globin genes. Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and ETO2 knockdown analyses confirmed that ETO2 directly regulates globin genes in K562 cells. Next, we evaluated the role of ETO2 in human primary erythroblasts, derived from cord blood CD34-positive cells. In an ex\u00a0vivo model of erythroid differentiation from CD34-positive cells, ETO2 protein level peaked at day 2\u20134 and almost diminished at the later stage of differentiation. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA\u2013mediated knockdown and retroviral vector\u2013mediated overexpression of ETO2 in primary erythroblasts suggested that ETO2 significantly represses HBB, HBA, and ALAS2 expression.

These transplanted animals lack SOD2 only in hematopoietically generated cells and live longer than SOD2 knockouts. In these mice, approximately 2.8% of their total RBCs in circulation are iron-laden reticulocytes, with numerous siderocytic granules and increased protein oxidation similar to that seen in sideroblastic anemia.

We performed a prospective phase I/II study to define the dose-limiting toxicity and the immunologic effects of lenalidomide given early (day 100\u2013180) after allograft for four cycles in patients with multiple myeloma. According to the Fibonacci design, 24 patients with a median age of 53 years were included. Dose-limiting toxicity was organ toxicity owing to graft-versus-host disease, and the maximum tolerable dose was 5\u00a0mg. The incidence of graft-versus-host disease after lenalidomide was 38%, occurring after a median of 22 days, and was beside organ toxicity, a leading cause to discontinue the study in 29% of the patients. Immune monitoring revealed a significant increase in peripheral \u03b3-interferon\u2013secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the first week of lenalidomide treatment followed by a delayed increase in T regulatory cells. Furthermore, natural killer (NK) cells isolated from the peripheral blood of patients evidenced a significantly improved antimyeloma activity after lenalidomide treatment. The immune effect might have contributed to the increased CR rate from 24\u201342% after lenalidomide treatment because nonresponding patients showed significantly less natural killer and T cell activation.

We have recently demonstrated increased bone marrow cell survival and proliferation in response to exercise training, which may be attributable to increased quality of the niche. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which exercise preconditioning of recipients could increase the success of BMT. Recipient mice remained sedentary (SED) or were exercise-trained (EX) on a treadmill (3 d/wk for 8 weeks) before reconstitution with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled donor marrow. Recipient survival, both donor-derived and total (donor- and recipient-derived) blood reconstitution were measured by flow cytometry. The first and fourth day after BMT apoptosis, cellularity and donor cell homing were determined in the recipients' bone marrow cavity by flow cytometry. Whereas only 25% of SED mice survived, 82% of EX recipients survived the BMT. Homing of donor-derived marrow cells to the recipients' marrow cavity acutely after BMT was not altered in EX, but EX mice displayed decreased levels (10%; p < 0.05) of activated caspase-3/-7 one day after BMT, leading to a maintenance of marrow cellularity in mice preconditioned with exercise. The acute inhibition of marrow cell apoptosis in EX mice resulted in increased total blood cell reconstitution at 1 and 3.5 months after BMT in EX mice (42% and 43%, respectively; both p < 0.05). Short- and long-term donor-derived engraftment was not different between EX and SED recipients. Exercise training increases recipient survival after BMT with increased total blood cell reconstitution.",

     "abstract": "Red cell production is primarily determined by the action of erythropoietin. Additional erythropoiesis-regulatory factors include molecules and cellular interactions occurring within the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Sotatercept (ACE-011) is an activin receptor ligand trap that binds several members of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. Treatment with ACE-011 reverses bone loss and reduces the degree of osteoporosis, but it is accompanied by elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of ACE-011 on red cell production remain unknown. This study explores the means by which ACE-011 promotes erythropoiesis. We showed that ACE-011 does not directly affect erythroid differentiation of human CD34+ cells in\u00a0vitro. We next tested whether ACE-011 acts indirectly by affecting BM accessory cells. Conditioned media produced by BM stromal cells (SCs) inhibited erythroid differentiation of CD34+ cells while maintained their ability to proliferate. However, conditioned media from SCs treated with ACE-011 partially restored erythropoiesis, coinciding with changes in the molecular and secretory profile of SCs, including the expression and secretion of erythropoiesis-modulatory factors. We conclude that inhibitory factors produced by BM SCs in\u00a0vitro might control erythropoiesis in\u00a0vivo and that agents that reverse these microenvironmental signals could provide an approach to attenuate anemia in clinical conditions.",

The role of this enzyme in high-risk myelodysplastic diseases (MDS) and the effect of azacitidine on its expression in MDS and AML have not been studied in detail. In this work, we have analyzed the effect of different concentrations of azacitidine in two well-established, MDS-derived, acute myeloid leukemic cell lines: MOLM-13 and SKM-1. We have demonstrated that 1 \u03bcmol/L azacitidine decreases MMP9 DNA methylation levels and that this is correlated with a significant increase in messenger RNA expression in both cell lines. Surprisingly, changes in protein levels were minor. This paradoxic effect is explained by the drug-dependent induction of apoptosis that reduces the amount of active secreting cells. A balance between induced expression and apoptosis was established at an azacitidine concentration of 0.2 \u03bcmol/L in MOLM-13 cells. This dose significantly increased the invasive capacity of viable cells, as measured in the Matrigel assay. To evaluate the clinical relevance of this observation, we have examined the effect of azacitidine on MMP9 expression in bone marrow from five patients with MDS, with the finding that this drug significantly increased MMP9 protein levels in all analyzed patients after six cycles of treatment. Based on these results, we conclude that azacitidine increases MMP9 expression and may enhance invasiveness in\u00a0vitro. Because all five patients relapsed, these findings might explain, at least partially, the clinical failure of the drug and the progression to a more aggressive disease.",

The present studies were undertaken to clarify the relationship between the induction of a thymineless state and the formation of Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1CC) for inducing cell death and to clarify the role of DNA replication for induction of lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in FdUMP[10]-treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells.Human promyelocytic (HL60) and AML (KG1a, Molm13, THP-1) cells were synchronized by serum starvation and treated with FdUMP[10] with thymidine (Thy) rescue. Cells were assayed for TS inhibition, DNA DSBs, Top1CC, and apoptosis to clarify the interrelationship of TS inhibition and Top1CC for cell death. FdUMP[10] induced a thymineless state in AML cells and exogenous Thy administered within the first 18 hours of treatment rescued FdUMP[10]-induced Top1CC formation, \u03b3H2AX phosphorylation, and apoptosis induction. Exogenous Thy was not effective after cells had committed to mitosis and undergone cell division in the presence of FdUMP[10]. FdUMP[10] treatment resulted in Chk1 activation, and Chk1 inhibition enhanced FdUMP[10]-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Jnk-signaling was required for FdUMP[10]-induced apoptosis in promyelocytic HL60 cells and in THP1 cells, but was antiapoptotic in Molm13 and to a lesser extent KG1a AML cells. The results are consistent with FdUMP[10] inducing a thymineless state, leading to misincorporation of FdU into genomic DNA of proliferating cells.

All three cell lines were sensitive to DNMTIs, but MDS-L was the most susceptible. DAC-induced cell death in MDS-L was preceded by DNA damage\u2013induced G2 arrest via a p53-independent pathway. AZA did not influence the pattern of cell cycle, although it induced DNA damage response. The IC50 of DAC or AZA on MDS-L cells was associated with the dose inducing the maximal hypomethylation in long interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) methylation assay. AZA suppressed the level of methylation in a time-dependent manner (days 4, 7, and 10), whereas DAC maintained the level of methylation from day 4 to 11. The protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a decreased with the suppression of growth and methylation.

     "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that genomic alterations of cells in the hematopoietic microenvironment could induce myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ineffective hematopoiesis and dysmorphic hematopoietic cells, and subsequent transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. This investigation is the first attempt to correlate the gene expression profile of AURKA and AURKB in a cytogenetically stratified population of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from MDS patients. We found that AURKA messenger RNA was expressed at significantly higher levels in MSCs even with normal/altered karyotype when compared with hematopoietic cells and healthy donors. In addition, we found that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities (mainly aneuploidy) in hematopoietic cells/MSCs was also associated with higher levels of AURKA. Different from previous investigations, our findings, regarding AURKA expression support the hypothesis that the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in MSCs from MDS is not a consequence of the method used for chromosome preparation. They may reflect the genomic instability present in the bone marrow microenvironment of MDS patients. This information is also supported by differences observed in the growth kinetics between MSCs from healthy donors (normal karyotype) and from MDS patients with abnormal karyotype. In summary, our results may not be considered evidence that MDS and MSCs are originated from a single neoplastic clone. In fact, both cells (hematopoietic and MSCs) may probably be altered in response to damage-inducing factors, and the presence of genomic abnormalities in MSCs suggests that an unstable bone marrow microenvironment may facilitate the expansion of MDS/leukemic cells.",

This study evaluates the efficacy of combination therapy with Dex and BTZ and investigates the mechanistic underpinning of endogenous and therapy-induced NF-\u03baB activation in MM. Human myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were used in monocultures and cocultures to determine the cytotoxic effects of Dex and/or BTZ. Our results show that combined treatment of Dex with BTZ enhanced direct apoptosis of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant myeloma cells. In the presence of BMSCs, Dex plus BTZ combination inhibited ionizing radiation\u2013induced interleukin 6 secretion from BMSCs and induced myeloma cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, Dex treatment increased I\u03baB\u03b1 protein and mRNA expression and compensated for BTZ-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Dex plus BTZ combination inhibited basal and therapy-induced NF-\u03baB activity with cytotoxicity in myeloma cells resistant to BTZ. Furthermore, combination therapy downregulated the NF-\u03baB\u2013targeted gene expression of interleukin 6 and manganese superoxide dismutase, which can induce chemo- and radio-resistance in MM.

We analyzed 65 patients who received a total of 111 DLI for different reasons and at different intervals after transplantation. Median number of DLI was 2 (range, 1\u20134), median interval between transplantation and DLI was 9 months (range, 1\u201341 months) and median number of infused CD3+ cells/kg recipient body weight was 2.5 \u00d7 107 (range, 1 \u00d7 106\u201311.8 \u00d7 107). Reasons for DLI were relapse or progression in 37 patients (57%), residual disease in 15 patients (23%), and persistence of mixed chimerism in 13 patients (20%). Seven patients (11%) developed acute GVHD grade II to IV and 5 patients (8%) developed extensive chronic GVHD. In univariate analysis, we could identify a transplantation\u2013DLI interval \u22646 months, the dose of DLI (\u22651 \u00d7 107), and DLI number as predictive factors of GVHD.

Here we used these novel techniques for directly comparing clonal reconstitution kinetics in mice transplanted with bone-marrow\u2013derived stem cells genetically marked with either a standard, spleen focus\u2013forming virus long terminal repeat (LTR)\u2013driven \u03b3-retroviral, or a lentiviral self-inactivating vector containing an identical but internal spleen focus\u2013forming virus\u2013derived enhancer/promoter. We observed that the use of the lentiviral self-inactivating vector for gene marking was associated with a broader repertoire of differently marked hematopoietic clones. More importantly, we found a significantly higher probability of insertions in growth-promoting, clonal-dominance\u2013associated genes in the spleen focus\u2013forming virus LTR\u2013driven \u03b3-retroviral vector at later time points of analysis. Based on our data, we suggest that the combined use of LAM-PCR and next-generation sequencing represents a potent tool for the analysis of clonal reconstitution kinetics in the context of gene marking with integrated vectors. At the same time, our findings prove that the use of multiple restriction enzymes for LAM-PCR is indispensable to detect most or ideally all individual stem cell clones contributing to hematopoiesis. We have also found that techniques such as quantitative PCR can be helpful to retrospectively analyze reconstitution kinetics for individual hematopoietic stem cell clones. Finally, our results confirm the notion that marking with lentiviral self-inactivating vectors is associated with a lower risk of genotoxicity as compared with \u03b3-retroviral LTR vectors.",

Therefore, GVHD is prevented and treated with therapeutics that suppress proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell function (e.g., cyclosporine, glucocorticoids). Here we report that the small molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3, 6-bromoindirubin 3\u2032-oxime (BIO), prevents lethal GVHD in a humanized xenograft model in mice. BIO treatment did not affect donor T-cell engraftment, but suppressed their activation and attenuated bone marrow and liver destruction mediated by activated donor T cells. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibition modulated the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile in\u00a0vitro and suppressed activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 3 signaling pathways both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Importantly, human T cells derived from BIO-treated mice were able to mediate anti-tumor effects in\u00a0vitro, and BIO did not affect stem cell engraftment and multilineage reconstitution in a mouse model of transplantation.

Inhibition of CRM1 by two novel selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE), KPT-185 and KPT-276, in MCL cells resulted in significant growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. KPT-185 also induced CRM1 accumulation in the nucleus, resulting in CRM1 degradation by the proteasome.

We firstly demonstrated that protease-activated receptor 1-activating peptide induced robust, but transient \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation in CMK cells with high glycoprotein-Ib expression. Stable talin-1 or kindlin-3 knockdown cells confirmed that the protease-activated receptor 1-activating peptide\u2013induced \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation was dependent on talin-1 and kindlin-3 expression. In sharp contrast to exogenously expressed \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in Chinese hamster ovarian cells, transient overexpression of full-length talin (FL-talin) or talin-head domain (THD) alone did not\u00a0activate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 in CMK cells, but required agonist stimulation.

     "abstract": "The cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) regulate the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G\u00a0(PKG), respectively. This process helps maintain circulating platelets in a resting state. Here we studied the role of cAMP and cGMP in the regulation of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and platelet formation. Cultured, platelet-producing MKs were differentiated from fetal livers harvested from 13.5 days postcoital mouse embryos. MK development was accompanied by a dramatic increase in cAMP production and expression of soluble guanylate cyclase, PKG,\u00a0and PKA as well as their downstream targets vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and MENA. Stimulation of prostaglandin E1 receptor/adenylyl cyclase or soluble guanylate cyclase/PKG in cultured MKs increased VASP phosphorylation, indicating that these components share a common signaling pathway. To dissect out the role of cyclic nucleotides in MK differentiation, cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling were alternately blocked in cultured MKs. Down-regulation of cAMP pathway effectors decreased MK numbers and ploidy. Notably, cGMP levels increased at the beginning of MK development and returned to basal levels in parallel with MK maturation. However, inhibition of cGMP pathway effectors had no effect on MK development. In addition, platelet release from mature MKs was enhanced by cGMP and inhibited by\u00a0cAMP. Our data suggest that cAMP plays an important role in MK differentiation, while\u00a0cAMP and cGMP have opposite effects on platelet production. Identifying the signaling pathways that underpin MK development and proplatelet formation will provide greater\u00a0insights into thrombopoiesis and may potentially yield useful therapeutic targets.",

No information is currently available on the ligand responsible for Gpr171 activation and its biological role remains unknown. We reconstructed Gpr171 phylogenesis in mice and confirmed that Gpr171 is evolutionally related to members of a P2Y gene-cluster localized on mouse chromosome 3. As a first step toward unveiling a role for Gpr171, we investigated its expression profile in murine hematopoietic cells. As opposed to other P2YRs, we found that Gpr171 expression is down-regulated in monocytes and granulocytes, suggesting a negative role in myeloid lineage specification. To test Gpr171 functional role, we next enforced Gpr171 expression in a myeloblastic cell line (32D cells) and in primary Sca-1+ hematopoietic progenitors, and observed a decreased expression of myeloid markers upon induction of Gpr171, as well as an increased generation of colonies in\u00a0vitro. Conversely, Gpr171 silencing induced opposite results, diminishing the expression of myeloid markers and the clonogenic potential of 32D cells. In\u00a0vivo, mice transplanted with hematopoietic progenitor cells overexpressing Gpr171 displayed a significant reduction in the percentage of Mac-1+Gr-1\u2212 cells. As a preliminary step in the investigation of Gpr171 role in murine hematopoiesis, our findings indicate that the orphan receptor Gpr171 negatively regulates myeloid differentiation. Together with phylogenic analyses, our data suggest that Gpr171 may have followed a separate evolutionary pathway as compared to other P2YRs belonging to the same gene cluster.",

Identification of gene targets of HDIs is required to understand the full potential of these compounds and can allow for improved stem cell culturing protocols. The molecular process that underlies the biological effects of valproic acid (VPA), a widely used HDI, on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells was investigated by studying the early-response genes of VPA. These genes were linked to VPA-induced enhancement of cell function as measured by in\u00a0vitro assays. Genome-wide gene expression studies revealed over-representation of genes involved in glutathione metabolism, receptor and signal transducer activity, and changes in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells surface profile after short, 24-hour VPA treatment. Sca-1, a well-known and widely used stem cell surface marker, was identified as a prominent VPA target. We showed that multiple HDIs induce Sca-1 expression on hematopoietic cells. VPA strongly preserved Sca-1 expression on Lin\u2212Sca1+ckit+ cells, but also reactivated Sca-1 on committed progenitor cells that were Sca-1neg, thereby reverting them to the Lin\u2212Sca1+ckit+ phenotype. We demonstrated that reacquired Sca-1 expression coincided with induced self-renewal capacity as measured by in\u00a0vitro replating assays, while Sca-1 itself was not required for the biological effects of VPA as demonstrated using Sca-1\u2013deficient progenitor cells. In conclusion, our results show that VPA modulates several genes involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, of which Sca-1 was shown to mark cells with increased self-renewal capacity in response to HDIs.",

However, mice with disruptions in the Notch pathway do not show gross defects in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment, limiting Notch\u00a0effects at later stages of development. In this study, we identify cord blood CD34+CD38\u2212CD45RA\u2212CD90+ cells, a recently described population of hematopoietic stem cells, as one of the earliest targets of Notch in human hematopoiesis.

However, the underlying mechanism for the development of AIHA remains largely unclear. In this study, we carefully evaluated the potential role of Th17 cells in the development of AIHA. We found an elevated frequency of Th17 cells in patients with AIHA, which were closely correlated with their disease activity, including the level of anti-RBC IgG antibodies, hemoglobin, serum C3, and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, we observed that interleukin (IL)-17 was also closely correlated with the disease activity in AIHA patients. To further elucidate the potential role of Th17 cells in induction of AIHA, we used the Marshall-Clarke and Playfair model of murine AIHA. Notably, we found that Th17 cells affected development of AIHA by enhancing the adaptive humoral responses. Specifically, we found that adoptive transfer of Th17 cells heightened the initial anti-rat RBC antibody responses and concomitantly increased the onset of AIHA. In addition, in\u00a0vivo neutralization of IL-17 abrogated the development of AIHA, while initiation of anti-rat RBC IgG responses and induction of AIHA in IL-17\u2212/\u2212 mice were impaired.

We previously demonstrated that forced expression of each gene suppresses the proliferation of NK cell lines with the 6q deletion. In this study, the forced expression of FOXO3 or PRDM1 was performed in various cell lines to clarify these suppressive effects. Forced expression of PRDM1 suppressed the proliferation of not only NK cell lines, but also other broad lineage cell lines. On the other hand, forced expression of FOXO3 was only effective on NK cell lines. FOXO3 functions as a transcriptional factor when it is localized in nuclei. Akt is known to induce cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3 as a result of phosphorylation. Transduced FOXO3 was predominantly localized in nuclei of NK cell lines, while it was localized in the cytoplasm of all non\u2013NK cell lines. NK cell lines showed significantly lower Akt activity compared to other lineage cell lines. The low Akt activity and nucleic localization of FOXO3 in NK cell neoplasms seemed to cause NK cell\u2013specific suppression.

We employed genetic techniques to identify both preleukemic abnormalities in healthy transgenic mice as well as collaborating events leading to leukemic transformation. Candidate gene resequencing revealed that 6 of 27 (22%) CA10 AMLs spontaneously acquired a Ras pathway mutation and 8 of 27 (30%) acquired an Flt3 mutation. Two CA10 AMLs acquired an Flt3 internal-tandem duplication, demonstrating that these mutations can be acquired in murine as well as human AML. Gene expression profiles revealed a marked upregulation of Hox genes, particularly Hoxa5, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10 in both NHD13 and CA10 mice. Furthermore, mir196b, which is embedded within the Hoxa locus, was overexpressed in both CA10 and NHD13 samples. In contrast, the Hox cofactors Meis1 and Pbx3 were differentially expressed; Meis1 was increased in CA10 AMLs but not NHD13 AMLs, whereas Pbx3 was consistently increased in NHD13 but not CA10 AMLs. Silencing of Pbx3 in NHD13 cells led to decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased colony formation in\u00a0vitro, suggesting a previously unexpected role for Pbx3 in leukemic transformation.",

CD34+ cells derived from normal human bone marrow and K562 leukemic cells were effectively transduced with short-hairpin RNA to knockdown PDCD2. Colony-forming assays were used to investigate the effects of PDCD2 loss on HPC clonogenic potential and on 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate\u2013and arabinofuranosylcytosine\u2013induced terminal differentiation.

Similar results were observed in K562 cells, suggesting that PDCD2 is important for HPC differentiation and/or survival, and for erythroid lineage commitment. Furthermore, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate\u2013induced megakaryocytic differentiation and proliferation of K562 cells was not affected by PDCD2 knockdown. In contrast, arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was significantly reduced with PDCD2 knockdown, with no effect on cell proliferation. The effects of PDCD2 knockdown were attributed to a cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, along with increased messenger RNA expression of early progenitor factors c-MYB and GATA-2, and decreased expression of erythroid factors GATA-1, EpoR, and \u03b3-globin. We conclude that PDCD2 loss of function(s) impedes erythroid differentiation by inducing cell cycle arrest and increasing expression of early hematopoietic progenitor factors.

Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the myeloid commitment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we treated CD34+ cells with valproic acid (VPA). Our results demonstrate that VPA treatment induces H4 histone acetylation and hampers cell cycle progression in CD34+ cells sustaining high levels of CD34 protein expression. In addition, our data show that VPA treatment promotes erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. In fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of growth factor\u2013independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites. Finally, we show that GFI1B inhibition impairs erythroid and megakaryocyte differentiation induced by VPA, while MLLT3 silencing inhibits megakaryocyte commitment only. As a whole, our data suggest that VPA sustains the expression of stemness-related markers in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and is able to interfere with hematopoietic lineage commitment by enhancing erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation and by inhibiting the granulocyte and mono-macrophage maturation.",

The results revealed significant differences in the behavior of CD14++CD16+ and CD14+CD16\u2212 monocyte subsets toward tumor cells, thus providing further evidence that CD34+ cell\u2013derived monocytes differ in this respect from blood monocytes. The protocol for generation of monocytes with antitumor reactivity described here may be useful to obtain monocytes from CD34+ progenitor cells of cancer patients. This might offer a basis for a novel approach for various forms of cellular immunotherapy of cancer.",

Initial treatment of 12 AML samples with inhibitors targeting each of the four isoforms demonstrated that p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 inhibition are more effective in killing AML blast colony-forming cells (CFC) than p110\u03b2 or \u03b3 inhibition. In subsequent experiments, AML CFC from 46 patient samples were treated with the p110\u03b1 and \u03b4 selective inhibitors, PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor 2 or PCN5603, and dose-dependent progenitor kill and inhibition of phosphorylated Akt Ser473 expression was observed. AML samples were more sensitive to PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor 2 and PCN5603 killing than normal bone marrow or normal peripheral blood CFC (median IC50 for AML and normal CFCs treated with PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor 2, 1.8 and 4.3 \u03bcM, respectively, and for PCN5603, 1.9 and 6.2 \u03bcM, respectively). Furthermore, treatment of AML cells with PCN5603 also decreased survival of more primitive leukemia progenitors identified in long-term culture (AML long-term culture initiating cells), while less toxicity toward normal bone marrow long-term culture initiating cells was observed.

Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) supernatant was used to mimic the inflammatory milieu induced by an allogeneic immune response in\u00a0vitro. In addition to phenotype and proliferation, we monitored MSC differentiation, gene expression, and support of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells after priming with MLR supernatant. Priming of MSCs with MLR supernatant led to an 11-fold decrease in cobblestone area-forming cells in the 4-week coculture (p < 0.05) and a threefold decrease of colony-forming unit macrophage in the colony-forming cell assay (p < 0.05). MSC proliferation over 8 days was increased 2.5-fold (p < 0.05). Osteogenic differentiation was enhanced, while adipogenesis was concurrently suppressed. In addition, the surface expression of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule\u20131 was increased 20-fold (p = 0.06) and 45-fold (p < 0.05), respectively. This was associated with increased adhesion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to MLR-treated MSCs.

In this study, we developed NOG mice carrying a human Delta-like1 (DLL1) gene, which is a ligand of the Notch receptor and is known to be important in HSC maintenance and self-renewal. We also analyzed the effect of DLL1 signaling on human hematopoiesis and HSC maintenance using humanized DLL1 transgenic NOG mice. To develop DLL1 transgenic NOG (NOG-D1-Tg) mice, a transgenic vector consisting of a human DLL1 complementary DNA fragment placed downstream of the \u03b11(I) collagen (Col1a1) promoter for expression specifically in osteoblasts was constructed. Human CD34+ HSCs were transplanted into NOG-D1-Tg mice, and differentiation of lymphoid or myeloid lineage cells from human HSCs and maintenance of HSCs in bone marrow were analyzed. Severe osteosclerosis accompanied by increased bone mass and a decreased number of bone marrow cells were observed in NOG-D1-Tg mice. After human HSC transplantation, development of human B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, was significantly suppressed in both bone marrow and the periphery of NOG-D1-Tg mice. Contrary to the initial expectation, retention of human CD34+ HSCs was inhibited in the bone marrow of NOG-D1-Tg mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that the development of human B lymphocytes and HSC maintenance in osteosclerotic bone may be suppressed by introducing DLL1. These unique humanized mice with sclerotic bone reconstituted by human HSCs are useful models of hematopoiesis in patients with osteosclerosis, such as osteopetrosis, and for investigation of osteogenesis via Notch signaling.",

Acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma were the most frequent malignancies in the cohort. The detection of anti-HLA antibodies was systematically performed in all patients before transplantation. Anti-HLA antibodies were present in 24 patients (22%). There was no significant impact of anti-HLA antibodies on engraftment, incidence of relapse, and incidence of acute graft-vs-host disease. The presence of anti-HLA antibodies was associated with significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.006) and event-free survival (p = 0.024) after stratification on sex. The 3-year probability of overall survival was 34% without anti-HLA antibodies and 16% in their presence. Patients with anti-HLA antibodies had a higher transplant-related mortality associated with life-threatening vascular complications.

In an attempt to design an efficacious and safe prehematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen, we investigated the cytotoxicity of the combination of busulfan (B), melphalan (M), and gemcitabine (G) in lymphoma cell lines in the absence or presence of drugs that induce epigenetic changes. Cells were exposed to drugs individually or in combination and analyzed by the MTT proliferation assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. We used \u223cIC10 drug concentrations (57 \u03bcM B, 1 \u03bcM M and 0.02 \u03bcM G), which individually did not have major effects on cell proliferation. Their combination resulted in 50% inhibition of proliferation. Reduction to almost half concentration (20 \u03bcM B, 0.7 \u03bcM M and 0.01 \u03bcM G) did not have significant effects, but addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (0.6 \u03bcM) to this combination resulted in a marked (\u223c65%) growth inhibition. The cytotoxicity of these combinations correlates with the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated\u2013CHK2 pathway, phosphorylation of KRAB-associated protein-1, epigenetic changes such as methylation and acetylation of histone 3, and activation of apoptosis. The relevance of epigenetic changes is further shown by the induction of DNA methyltransferases in tumor cells with low constitutive levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. The addition of 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine to (BMG+suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) further enhances cell killing. Overall, BMG combinations are synergistically cytotoxic to lymphoma cells. Epigenetic changes induced by suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine further enhance the cytotoxicity.

     "abstract": "Iron chelation is essential to patients on chronic blood transfusions to prevent toxicity from iron overload and remove excess iron. Deferasirox (DFX) is the most commonly used iron chelator in the United States; however, some patients are relatively refractory to DFX therapy. We postulated that vitamin C supplementation would improve the availability of transfusional iron to DFX treatment by promoting iron's redox cycling, increasing its soluble ferrous form and promoting its release from reticuloendothelial cells. Osteogenic dystrophy rats (n = 54) were given iron dextran injections for 10 weeks. Cardiac and liver iron levels were measured after iron loading (n = 18), 12 weeks of sham chelation (n = 18), and 12 weeks of DFX chelation (n = 18) at 75 mg/kg/day. Ascorbate supplementation of 150 ppm, 900 ppm, and 2250 ppm was used in the chow to mimic a broad range of ascorbate status; plasma ascorbate levels were 5.4 \u00b1 1.9, 8.2 \u00b1 1.4, 23.6 \u00b1 9.8 \u03bcM, respectively (p < 0.0001). The most severe ascorbate deficiency produced reticuloenthelial retention, lowering total hepatic iron by 29% at the end of iron loading (p < 0.05) and limiting iron redistribution from cardiac and hepatic macrophages during 12 weeks of sham chelation. Most importantly, ascorbate supplementation at 2250 ppm improved DFX efficiency, allowing DFX to remove 21% more hepatic iron than ascorbate supplementation with 900 ppm or 150 ppm (p < 0.05). We conclude that vitamin C status modulates the release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system and correlates positively with DFX chelation efficiency. Our findings suggest that ascorbate status should be probed in patients with unsatisfactory response to DFX.",

The mechanisms that affected erythropoiesis were investigated by BM transplantation experiments. CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood were isolated by MiniMACS, and the effect of SPARC on human erythropoiesis was assessed by colony-formation assay and erythroid differentiation culture.

We have shown that lack of Eng results in reduced numbers of primitive erythroid colonies as well as downregulation of key hematopoietic genes. To determine the effect of Eng overexpression in hematopoietic development, we generated a doxycycline-inducible embryonic stem cell line. Our results demonstrate that induction of Eng during embryoid body differentiation leads to a significant increase in the frequency of hematopoietic progenitors, in particular, the erythroid lineage, which correlated with upregulation of Scl, Gata1, Runx1, and embryonic globin. Interestingly, activation of the hematopoietic program happened at the expense of endothelial and cardiac cells, as differentiation into these mesoderm lineages was compromised. Eng-induced enhanced erythroid activity was accompanied by high levels of Smad1 phosphorylation. This effect was attenuated by addition of a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling inhibitor to these cultures. Among the BMPs, BMP4 is well known for its role in hematopoietic specification from mesoderm by promoting expression of several hematopoietic genes, including Scl. Because Scl is considered the master regulator of the hematopoietic program, we investigated whether Scl would be capable of rescuing the defective hematopoietic phenotype observed in Eng\u2212/\u2212 embryonic stem cells. Scl expression in Eng-deficient embryonic stem cells resulted in increased erythroid colony-forming activity and upregulation of Gata1 and Gata2, positioning Eng upstream of Scl. Taken together, these findings support the premise that Eng modulates the hematopoietic transcriptional network, most likely through regulation of BMP4 signaling.",

In addition to their growth and differentiation characteristics, we focused on the ability of MSC to modulate T-cell function and support hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).Bone marrow\u2013derived MSCs were exposed to LEN (10 \u03bcM), and differences in proliferation, phenotype, inhibition of T-cell proliferation, and differentiation capacity were analyzed. A Boyden chamber assay was used to test the migratory potential of HSC toward the conditioned medium of LEN-treated or untreated MSCs, and the stromal cell\u2013derived factor-1 (SDF-1) concentrations in these supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Treatment of MSCs with LEN did not affect their growth rate, proliferation, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential, or capacity to inhibit T-cell proliferation. However, LEN treatment increased the average of mean fluorescence intensity of CD29 and CD73 by 15 and 22%, respectively. Interestingly, LEN reduced SDF-1 by MSCs by 32% compared to that of control cells. As a functional consequence, the serum-free supernatant of LEN-treated MSCs had a significantly lower potential to induce the directed migration of CD34+ HSCs.LEN can modulate the expression of cell surface molecules and the chemokine secretion of MSCs in\u00a0vitro.

The study consisted of 20 chronic-phase CML patients (10 optimal and 10 suboptimal response patients based on 18 months European-Leukemia-Net criteria) and healthy bone marrow cells, and CML cell lines were used as controls. The phosphorylation profile of normal bone marrow cells diverged from CML patients expectedly but, interestingly, CML cell lines (such as K562) also showed marked difference with primary CML cells.

Most prominent differences were seen in signal transducers and activators of transcription 5b, phospholipase C \u03b3-1, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, Hck, and Paxillin. These phosphoproteins were also increased in three additional nonresponder patients studied, but each of them also had unique phosphorylation patterns, such as highly active HSP27 protein in one patient.

     "publication date": "09-2012",
     "abstract": "Malignant transformation of normal hematopoietic progenitors is a multistep process that likely requires interaction between collaborating oncogenic signals at critical junctures. For instance, the MLL-AF9 fusion oncogene is thought to contribute to myeloid leukemogenesis by driving a hematopoietic stem cell-like \u201cself-renewal\u201d gene expression signature in committed myeloid progenitors. In addition, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling has been implicated in self-renewal/pluripotency in hematopoietic and embryonic stem cell contexts and supports cell growth/survival by activation of downstream pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase. We hypothesized that IGF signaling could be an important contributor in the process of cellular transformation and/or clonal propagation. Utilizing an MLL-AF9 mouse bone marrow transplantation model of acute myelogenous leukemia, we discovered that committed myeloid progenitor cells with genetically reduced levels of IGF1R were less susceptible to leukemogenic transformation due, at least in part, to a cell-autonomous defect in clonogenic activity. Rather unexpectedly, genetic deletion of IGF1R by inducible Cre recombinase had no effect on growth/survival of established leukemia cells. These findings suggest that IGF1R signaling contributes to transformation of normal myeloid progenitor cells, but is not required for propagation of the leukemic clone once it has become established. We also show that treatment of mouse MLL-AF9 acute myelogenous leukemia cells with BMS-536924, an IGF1R/insulin receptor\u2013selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked cell growth, suggesting its efficacy in this model may be due to inhibition of insulin receptor and/or related tyrosine kinases, and raising the possibility that similar IGF1R inhibitors in clinical development may be acting through alternate/related pathways.",

Despite this success, a proportion of patients, particularly with advanced disease, are, or become, resistant to this treatment. Overcoming resistance and uncovering the underlying mechanisms is vital for further improvement of clinical outcomes. Here we report the identification, development, and characterization of a novel chronic myeloid leukemia cell line carrying the additional chromosomal aberration t(3;12)(q26;p13) resulting in expression of the TEL/MDS1/EVI1 fusion protein, which is resistant to TKIs. Resistance to TKIs was overcome by the co-administration of the BH3-mimetic, ABT-737. In addition, application of EVI1-specific small interfering RNA decreased expression of the TEL/MDS1/EVI1 fusion, reduced resistance to imatinib, and increased sensitivity to ABT-737. Subsequent studies revealed a role for the BH3-only protein BAD, probably via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT-dependent pathway, as pharmacological inhibition of AKT could also resensitize cells to death from TKIs. These findings indicate a novel pathway of TKI resistance regulated by EVI1 proteins and provide a promising means for overcoming resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia and other hematological malignancies displaying EVI1 overexpression.",

     "abstract": "Etv2 is a master gene for the commitment of hematopoietic/endothelial cells and is a potent inducer of endothelial/hematopoietic cells from embryonic stem cells. Etv2 is highly expressed in endothelial/hematopoietic precursors but is downregulated when they are differentiated, indicating that Etv2 should have transient but not constitutive function. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the importance of transient Etv2 expression. To determine whether transient Etv2 expression is essential to normal development and cell differentiation, we generated mice that constitutively express Etv2 from a Cre-activatable ROSA26 locus in endothelial/hematopoietic, somite, or neuronal lineages. Constitutive Etv2 expression caused profound phenotypes in hematopoietic/endothelial cells, with little effect on somite or neuronal lineages. In hematopoietic/endothelial lineages, constitutive Etv2 expression induced by Tie-2 Cre transgene caused abnormal yolk sac vasculature. Prolonged vascular endothelial cadherin expression and decreased B lymphopoiesis were observed in Etv2 expressing vascular endothelial cadherin+/CD45+ cells, indicating that Etv2 forces endothelial program on hematopoietic cells. Etv2 expression in adult hematopoietic cells by Vav-iCre transgene also conferred an endothelial phenotype on hematopoietic stem cells and suppressed hematopoiesis, with erythropoiesis severely affected. We conclude that constitutive Etv2 expression perturbs vascular development and hematopoiesis. While promoting hematopoiesis/vasculogenesis, Etv2 expression should be tightly regulated to achieve normal vascular development and hematopoiesis.",

We constructed recombinant protein transduction domain (PTD)-Polycomb proteins and transduced them into murine bone marrow (BM) cells. We designed and fused the PTD\u2013protein transduction domain to three proteins (i.e., green fluorescent protein, Bmi1, and Mel18). Murine BM cells were incubated for 48 h and each PTD-Polycomb protein was added. Then, we analyzed the function of hematopoiesis using the colony assay and transplantation. BM cells exposed to PTD-Bmi1 showed an increased number of colonies. In contrast, BM cells exposed to PTD-Mel18 or to both proteins showed a decreased number of colonies. Hematopoietic cells derived from PTD-Bmi1\u2013transduced BM cells were significantly increased in the peripheral blood at 6 weeks after transplantation. Moreover, 80% of mice transplanted with PTD-Bmi1\u2013transduced BM cells died at 8 to 24 weeks after transplantation. However, only a few early deaths were observed in the mice transplanted with BM cells exposed to both PTD-Bmi1 and PTD-Mel18. We expect that hematopoietic stem cells could proliferate after transduction with PTD-Bmi1, but this may generate undesirable effects, e.g., tumorigenesis.

Furthermore, IL-10 may suppress expression of Ror\u03b3t, the key transcription factor for Th17 cells, both by activating suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 through signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 phosphorylation, and decreasing signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 binding, which is at the promoter of Ror\u03b3t.

Moreover, the analysis separates Janus activating kinase 2-negative ET patients from Janus activating kinase 2-positive ET patients. Functional annotation analysis demonstrates that clusters of gene ontology terms related to inflammation, immune system, apoptosis, RNA metabolism, and secretory system were the most significantly deregulated terms in the three different disease groups.

     "abstract": "Development of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia has been astonishingly successful; however, their off-target effects have generated both challenges and opportunities for extending their clinical application. Dasatinib and imatinib are two of the most commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors and both have been shown to impact T-cell function. Due to this activity, their use as potential immune suppressants has been proposed. In this report, we investigated drug interactions with cyclosporine A in suppressing T-cell proliferation. Dasatinib and imatinib were titrated against varying concentrations of cyclosporine in the cultures and T-cell proliferation assessed by 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester dye dilution. These proliferation data were then used to determine the combination index to evaluate additive, synergistic, or antagonistic interactions between the drugs. This analysis uncovered a number of different drug interactions affecting T-cell proliferation. Cyclosporine had an additive or synergistic effect on T-cell proliferation when combined with dasatinib and imatinib for 3 of the 4 methods of stimulating T-cell proliferation. However, when T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, this interaction was found to be strongly antagonistic at low dasatinib concentrations. In contrast, this strong antagonism was not observed when imatinib was used in combination with cyclosporine A. This study suggests drug interactions affecting T cells may need to be carefully taken into account when using tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, the technique to evaluate drug interactions is novel, and applicable to study any interaction affecting proliferation.",

Although many myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemic patients have compromised immunity, the role of underlying mutations in regulating immune function is poorly understood. Recent studies show that NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene results in myelodysplastic syndrome and impairs lymphocyte differentiation in transgenic mice. In our studies, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which NHD13 affects B-lymphocyte development and function. Based on our preliminary findings that transgenic mice had increased levels of IgM and reduced IgG1 and IgE, we hypothesized that the fusion gene might impair class switch recombination (CSR). Mice were immunologically challenged with dinitrophenol. NHD13 mice showed a marked reduction in B-lymphocyte differentiation in their bone marrow and spleen following dinitrophenol stimulation and had reduced production of dinitrophenol-specific antibodies. Spleen follicles from these mice were small and hypocellular, indicating failure of clonal expansion. When isolated NHD13 B lymphocytes were stimulated in\u00a0vitro using Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide + interleukin-4, they failed to undergo sufficient CSR and proliferation. Taken together, our findings show that expression of NUP98-HOXD13 impairs CSR and reduces the antibody-mediated immune response, in addition to its role in leukemia. Further delineation of the NUP98-HOXD13 transgene may reveal novel pathways involved in CSR.",

GVS inhibited colony formation and proliferation and induced apoptosis at doses two- to threefold lower in a panel of JAK2V617F MPN compared to JAK2 wild-type myeloid leukemia cell lines. By global gene expression analysis, we observed that at 6 hours, GVS modulated 293 common genes in the JAK2V617F cell lines HEL and UKE1, of which 19 are implicated in cell cycle regulation and 33 in hematopoiesis. In particular, the hematopoietic transcription factors NFE2 and C-MYB were downmodulated by the drug specifically in JAK2V617F cells at both the RNA and protein level. GVS also inhibited JAK2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, but modulation of NFE2 and C-MYB was JAK2-independent, as shown using the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209. GVS had a direct effect on the NFE2 promoters, as demonstrated by specific enrichment of associated histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9. Modulation by GVS of NFE2 was also observed in freshly isolated CD34+ cells from MPN patients, and was accompanied by inhibition of their proliferation and differentiation toward the erythroid lineage. We conclude that GVS acts on MPN cells through dual JAK2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 inhibition and downmodulation of NFE2 and C-MYB transcription.",

To further explore the role of Bim, we examined several Bim-deficient B non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells for their responses to pico, a synthetic bryostatin-1-like compound. The Bim\u2212 mantle cell lymphoma cell lines Jeko-1, Mino, Sp53, UPN1, and Z138 and the Bim+ cell line Rec-1, as well as the Burkitt lymphoma cells lines BL2 (Bim\u2212) and Daudi (Bim+), were examined for their response to pico using assays for proliferation and apoptosis as well as biochemical methods for Ras guanyl-releasing proteins and Bcl-2 family members. With the exception of UPN1, mantle cell lymphoma cell lines underwent pico-induced apoptosis, as did BL2. In some cases, hallmarks of apoptosis were substantially diminished in the presence of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors. Pico treatment generally led to increased expression of proapoptotic Bik, although the absolute levels of Bik varied considerably between cell lines. A pico-resistant variant of Z138 exhibited decreased Bik induction compared to parental Z138 cells. Pico also generally decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Mcl1. Although, these changes in Bcl-2 family members seem unlikely to fully account for the differential behavior of the cell lines, our demonstration of a potent apoptotic process in most cell lines derived from mantle cell lymphoma encourages a re-examination of diacylglycerol analogues in the treatment of this subset of B non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases.",

However, the importance of ASNS in response to L-asp has neither been confirmed nor refuted so far. In this study, we wanted to elucidate the effect of ASNS expression level on the sensitivity of ALL cells to L-asp treatment. We used four ALL cell lines (NALM-6, RS4;11, REH, and UOCB6) and 30 diagnostic bone marrow samples of ALL patients to study the relationship between ASNS expression and sensitivity to L-asp using MTS proliferation assay. RNA interference was used to study the effect of a range of ASNS levels on the response to L-asp treatment. Using a cell line model with a gradually knocked-down ASNS gene, we defined a cutoff level below which ASNS gene expression does not correlate with sensitivity to L-asp. Importantly, ASNS gene expression in patients' ALL blasts is below this level. We confirmed that there was no correlation between ASNS gene expression and sensitivity to L-asp in ALL blasts. In addition, we show that cells with low ASNS expression level do not respond to asparagine deprivation by upregulation of ASNS gene expression. In conclusion, the ASNS expression level does not predict sensitivity to L-asp in leukemic blasts. Moreover, cell lines with high basal expression of ASNS cannot serve as a valid model for studies on the relationship between the ASNS and L-asp cytotoxic effect.",

We further evaluated whether 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGcoAR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) are regulated by TP53 in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Gene expression was measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on RNA extracted from bone marrow and peripheral blood from eight newly diagnosed MDS patients and eight controls and from mice livers. Serum lipid profile was measured using colorimetric enzymatic procedures. Total- and LDL cholesterol were lower in MDS patients in comparison to controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively). HMGcoAR messenger RNA increased in peripheral blood and bone marrow of MDS patients compared to controls (p = 0.04 and p = 0.01, respectively). LDL-R messenger RNA was higher only in the peripheral blood of MDS patients (p = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained in\u00a0vivo. The transcription of these genes correlates with TP53 activation as documented by p21 messenger RNA elevation, a surrogate for TP53 activation and by using TP53 temperature-sensitive cells treated with adriamycin. To conclude, an association between reduced lipids in MDS and expression of HMGcoAR and LDL-R genes was documented. The transcription of these genes can be regulated by TP53.",

Previously, we showed that c-myc transformation regulated calpain activity and sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by calpain inhibition. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of calpain in the E\u03bc-myc transgenic model of B-cell lymphoma. Calpain activity assays, apoptosis, cell cycle assays, and expression measurements were used to determine the activity and role of calpain in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. We found that E\u03bc-myc transgenic cells have highly elevated calpain activity. Calpastatin, the negative calpain regulator, was expressed at much lower levels in E\u03bc-myc lymphoma cells compared to normal splenic B cells. The primary isoform in E\u03bc-myc lymphoma is calpain 1. Treatment of E\u03bc-myc lymphoma cells with the calpain inhibitors PD150606 or calpain inhibitor III induced caspase-3\u2212dependent apoptosis in\u00a0vitro. General caspase inhibitors or caspase-3/7 inhibitor protected cells from death induced by calpain inhibitor, whereas caspase-9 inhibitors failed to rescue cells. Human Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (BL2) cells display a pattern of sensitivity and caspase-3 dependence similar to calpain inhibition. Treatment of E\u03bc-myc lymphoma-bearing mice with PD150606 inhibited calpain activity in\u00a0vivo and induced cell death in these cells as determined by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Multiple daily treatments resulted in reduced tumor load, particularly in combination with etoposide. In conclusion, calpain is highly elevated in the E\u03bc-myc lymphoma and calpain inhibition has therapeutic potential.",

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia associated with the use of Panobinostat (LBH589), a histone deacetylase inhibitor with promising anti-cancer activities. The effects of LBH589 were tested on the cellular and molecular aspects of megakaryocytopoiesis by utilizing an ex\u00a0vivo system in which mature megakaryocytes (MK) and platelets were generated from human primary CD34+ cells. We demonstrated that LBH589 did not affect MK proliferation or lineage commitment but inhibited MK maturation and platelet formation. Although LBH589 treatment of primary MK resulted in hyperacetylation of histones, it did not interfere with the expression of genes that play important roles during megakaryocytopoiesis. Instead, we found that LBH589 induced post-translational modifications of tubulin, a nonhistone protein that is the major component of the microtubule cytoskeleton. We then demonstrated that LBH589 treatment induced hyperacetylation of tubulin and alteration of microtubule dynamics and organization required for proper MK maturation and platelet formation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying LBH589-induced thrombocytopenia and provides a rationale for using tubulin as a target for selective histone deacetylase inhibitor therapies to treat thrombocytosis in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.",

The Scl +19 enhancer is active in HSCs and progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and mast cells, but not mature erythroid cells. Here we demonstrate that in\u00a0vivo deletion of the Scl +19 enhancer (Scl\u039419/\u039419) results in viable mice with normal Scl expression in mature hematopoietic lineages. By contrast, Scl expression is reduced in the stem/progenitor compartment and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the HSC and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor populations are enlarged in Scl\u039419/\u039419 mice. The increase in HSC numbers contributed to enhanced expansion in bone marrow transplantation assays, but did not affect multilineage repopulation or stress responses. These results affirm that the Scl +19 enhancer plays a key role in the development of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, but is not necessary for mature hematopoietic lineages. Moreover, active histone marks across the Scl locus were significantly reduced in Scl\u039419/\u039419 fetal liver cells without major changes in steady-state messenger RNA levels, suggesting post-transcriptional compensation for loss of a regulatory element, a result that might be widely relevant given the frequent observation of mild phenotypes after deletion of regulatory elements.",

Busulfan (BU), a myeloablative agent, is often administered to patients before hematopoietic stem cells transplantation to improve the engraftment. In this study, hematopoietic activity was evaluated in adult sheep after administering BU at different doses. Next, pregnant ewes were administered BU, and dams as well as their fetuses were evaluated, as BU readily crosses the sheep placenta. Then, the BU dose with the desired outcomes was selected and administered to pregnant ewes at 2 or 6 days before performing IUT using human cord blood CD34+ cells. The engraftment was evaluated in recipients that underwent IUT in the presence or absence of BU. As a result, hematopoietic activity was safely and transiently suppressed in adult sheep treated with 5 to 7.5 mg/kg BU. BU crossed the sheep placenta, and fetal sheep were indeed conditioned by administering 3 mg/kg BU to pregnant ewes. Engraftment of human CD34+ cells in fetal recipients was enhanced when IUT was carried out 6 days post-BU. Up to 3.3% engraftment levels (in terms of bone marrow colony-forming units) were achieved with the IUT of 0.72 to 2.4 million CD34+ cells when BU was used. BU can be administered to pregnant ewes to effectively condition the fetal recipient for IUT with enhanced engraftment of donor cells.",

     "abstract": "Delayed engraftment remains a major hurdle after cord blood (CB) transplantation. It may be due, at least in part, to low fucosylation of cell surface molecules important for homing to the bone marrow microenvironment. Because fucosylation of specific cell surface ligands is required before effective interaction with selectins expressed by the bone marrow microvasculature can occur, a simple 30-minute ex\u00a0vivo incubation of CB hematopoietic progenitor cells with fucosyltransferase-VI and its substrate (GDP-fucose) was performed to increase levels of fucosylation. The physiologic impact of CB hematopoietic progenitor cell hypofucosylation was investigated in\u00a0vivo in NOD-SCID interleukin (IL)-2R\u03b3null (NSG) mice. By isolating fucosylated and nonfucosylated CD34+ cells from CB, we showed that only fucosylated CD34+ cells are responsible for engraftment in NSG mice. In addition, because the proportion of CD34+ cells that are fucosylated in CB is significantly less than in bone marrow and peripheral blood, we hypothesize that these combined observations might explain, at least in part, the delayed engraftment observed after CB transplantation. Because engraftment appears to be correlated with the fucosylation of CD34+ cells, we hypothesized that increasing the proportion of CD34+ cells that are fucosylated would improve CB engraftment. Ex\u00a0vivo treatment with fucosyltransferase-VI significantly increases the levels of CD34+ fucosylation and, as hypothesized, this was associated with improved engraftment. Ex\u00a0vivo fucosylation did not alter the biodistribution of engrafting cells or pattern of long-term, multilineage, multi-tissue engraftment.

Exposure of APL NB4 cells to recombinant human soluble TM (rTM, 1500 ng/mL) inhibited clonogenic growth of these cells by approximately 30%, and induced expression of CD11b, a marker of myeloid differentiation, on their surfaces, in association with upregulation of nuclear levels of myeloid-specific transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b5. These antileukemic effects of rTM were mediated by thrombin/activated protein C\u2013dependent mechanisms, as hirudin, an inhibitor of thrombin and a blocking antibody against endothelial receptor for protein C to which activated protein C binds, hampered the ability of rTM to induce expression of CD11b in NB4 cells. This study also found that rTM downregulated expression of Annexin II, a receptor for both plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, and inhibited plasmin activity in APL cells. Interestingly, rTM significantly enhanced the ability of all\u2013trans retinoic acid to induce growth arrest, differentiation and apoptosis, and inhibited plasmin activity in APL cells. Taken together, these results suggest that administration of rTM should be considered for treatment of individuals with disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with APL.",

Human ALAS2 protein consists of 587 amino acids and its carboxyl(C)-terminal region of 33 amino acids is conserved in higher eukaryotes, but is not present in prokaryotic ALAS. We explored the role of this C-terminal region in the pathogenesis of X-linked sideroblastic anemia. In\u00a0vitro enzymatic activity was measured using bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. In\u00a0vivo catalytic activity was evaluated by comparing the accumulation of porphyrins in eukaryotic cells stably expressing each mutant ALAS2 tagged with FLAG, and the half-life of each FLAG-tagged ALAS2 protein was determined by Western blot analysis. Two novel mutations (Val562Ala and Met567Ile) were identified in patients with X-linked sideroblastic anemia. Val562Ala showed the higher catalytic activity in\u00a0vitro, but a shorter half-life in\u00a0vivo compared to those of wild-type ALAS2 (WT). In contrast, the in\u00a0vitro activity of Met567Ile mutant was about 25% of WT, while its half-life was longer than that of WT. However, in\u00a0vivo catalytic activity of each mutant was lower than that of WT. In addition, the deletion of 33 amino acids at C-terminal end resulted in higher catalytic activity both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo with the longer half-life compared to WT. In conclusion, the C-terminal region of ALAS2 protein may function as an intrinsic modifier that suppresses catalytic activity and increases the degradation of its protein, each function of which is enhanced by the Met567Ile mutation and the Val562Ala mutation, respectively.",

However, the function of UTX in hematopoiesis is not well understood. To study the role of UTX in the mammalian hematopoietic system, we used lentiviral short hairpin RNA constructs to knockdown UTX in the murine hematopoietic progenitor cell line EML, in primary murine bone marrow cells and in leukemic cell lines. We report that Utx is highly expressed in the hematopoietic compartment and that it plays an important role in cell proliferation and homeostasis of hematopoietic cells in\u00a0vitro. Knockdown of UTX in EML and primary murine bone marrow cells impairs their colony-forming ability. Moreover, knockdown of UTX affects expression of key genes that regulate hematopoietic differentiation such as Mll1, Runx1, and Scl in primary murine bone marrow cells. And we further demonstrate that UTX directly associates with the promoters of the Mll1, Runx1, and Scl genes and modulate their transcription by controlling H3K27me3 marks on respective promoter regions. In addition, UTX depletion severely impaired proliferation of several human leukemia cell lines. Together, these data demonstrate a functional role for UTX in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",

We hypothesized that an increase in BIM activity could sensitize CML cells to TKI. We blocked the anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family by using ABT-737, a Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL inhibitor. ABT-737 modified Bcl-2 protein interactions toward a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Its combination with TKI resulted in a strong synergism in CML cell lines. The association also induced a large decrease in X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), followed by caspase-3 activation. This XIAP decrease was due to post-translational events. The mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi was identified as being responsible for this off-target effect. Then, ABT-737 and TKI cooperate at several levels to induce apoptosis of CML cells lines, and the benefit of this association was also observed in CML hematopoietic progenitors.

Non\u2212T-cell activation linker (NTAL) is a nonenzymatic transmembrane adaptor molecule that is involved in the proximal signaling of lymphocytes. In our previous work, we found an association between high NTAL expression in T-cell ALL blasts and a favorable response to initial glucocorticoid treatment. In the present study, we confirm our previous observation in an experimental model. In addition, the molecular mechanism of the contribution of NTAL to malignant T-cell ALL blast signaling and to methylprednisolone-induced cell death is analyzed. In the in\u00a0vitro experiments, we used the T-cell ALL Jurkat cell line (Jurkat/wt) and derived Jurkat cell line with stable NTAL expression (Jurkat/NTAL+). Cell signaling and cell death after methylprednisolone treatment and after TCR stimulation were analyzed using flow cytometry, Western blot, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Jurkat/NTAL+ cells are significantly more sensitive to both methylprednisolone treatment and TCR-induced stimulation. In addition, after TCR stimulation, Jurkat/NTAL+ cells show a higher level of intracellular extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation and increased expression of the CD69 activation marker on the cell surface than the Jurkat/wt cells. The ERK inhibitor U0126 almost completely abrogates TCR-induced cell death and, importantly, reverses the sensitizing effect of the NTAL protein on methylprednisolone-induced cell death. In conclusion, NTAL acts as a tumor suppressor that enhances the proximal signaling of leukemic blasts. The key downstream molecule responsible for the biological effect of TCR signaling is ERK. Higher ERK phosphorylation leads to enhanced cell death after TCR stimulation and increases cell sensitivity to methylprednisolone-induced cell death.",

     "abstract": "The transcription factor p45 nuclear factor-erythroid\u2212derived 2 (NF-E2) plays major roles in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Here, we investigated the role of p45 NF-E2 in erythroid differentiation in\u00a0vivo. Absence of p45 NF-E2 in mice leads to a twofold increase in serum erythropoietin levels. In the bone marrow of these animals, we found a different distribution of precursor populations compared to wild-type mice, suggesting abnormal differentiation. Loss of p45 NF-E2 was also associated with an increase in splenic erythropoiesis, as evidenced by an accumulation of early precursors, namely, late basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts. These observations are consistent with a stress erythropoiesis phenotype and indicate that the spleen is likely compensating for ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Analysis of bone marrow samples revealed increased GATA1 levels, as well as an increased proportion of erythroid cells arrested at the G1 stage of cell cycle in p45 NF-E2\u2013deficient mice. These results suggest that p45 NF-E2 is required for the differentiation of erythroid precursors.",

Differential activation of Shh signaling was found in about 50% CML chronic phase samples, about 70% of CML accelerated phase samples, and >80% CML blast crisis phase samples. Deregulated activation of Shh signaling was observed in CD34+ and c-kit+ leukemia progenitor cells. Stimulation of Shh signaling with exogenous Shh peptide induced expansion of CD34+ and c-kit+ progenitor cells (p < 0.05), inversely, blocking the pathway with signal inhibitor induced cell apoptosis (p < 0.05). Low level of Shh protein was observed in CML bone marrow stromal cells, and CD34+ progenitor cells are less sensitive to exogenous Shh peptide and more sensitive to cyclopamine than CD34\u2212 cells (p < 0.05), implying cell-autonomous activation of Shh signaling play a predominant role in progenitor cells. Coactivation of Shh and \u03b2-catenin signaling was found in CD34+ and c-kit+ progenitor cells. Administration of Shh-neutralizing antibody or Wnt3a-neutralizing antibody in c-kit+ progenitor cells induced cell apoptosis; however, Wnt3a peptide could salvage cell apoptosis, while Shh peptide failed to revert anti\u2212Wnt3a-induced cell apoptosis.

As pDC represent a rare cell type in the peripheral blood, the goal of this study was to develop a new method to efficiently generate large numbers of cells from a limited number of CD34+ cord blood progenitors to provide a tool to resolve important questions about how pDC mediate tolerance, autoimmunity, and cancer. Human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from cord blood were cultured with a combination of Flt3-ligand (Flt3L), thrombopoietin (TPO), and one of the following cytokine: interleukin (IL)-3, interferon-\u03b2(IFN-\u03b2), or prostaglandin E2(PGE2). Cells obtained in the different culture conditions were analyzed for their phenotype and functional characteristics. The addition of IL-3 cooperates with Flt3L and TPO in the induction of pDC from CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. Indeed, Flt3L/TPO alone or supplemented with prostaglandin E2 or interferon-\u03b2 produced smaller amounts of pDC from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, pDC generated in Flt3L/TPO/IL-3 cultures exhibited morphological, immunohistochemical, and functional features of peripheral blood pDC. We showed that IL-3, in association with Flt3L and TPO, provides an advantageous tool for large-scale generation of pDC.

We have previously reported that CREB binding protein (Crebbp) heterozygous mice have an increased incidence of hematological malignancies, and others have shown that CREBBP is one of the genes altered by chromosomal translocations found in patients suffering from therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. This led us to investigate whether hematopoietic tumor development in Crebbp+/\u2212 mice is preceded by a myelodysplastic phase and whether we could uncover molecular mechanisms that might contribute to its development. We report here that Crebbp+/\u2212 mice invariably develop myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm within 9 to 12 months of age. They are also hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and show a marked decrease in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activity after irradiation. In addition, protein levels of XRCC1 and APEX1, key components of base excision repair machinery, are reduced in unirradiated Crebbp+/\u2212 cells or upon targeted knockdown of CREBBP levels.

Focal adhesion kinase (Fak) is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays an essential role in many cell types, where its activation controls adhesion, motility, and survival. Fak expression is relatively increased in HSCs compared to progenitors and mature blood cells. Therefore, we explored its role in HSC homeostasis. We have used the Mx1-Cre\u2212inducible conditional knockout mouse model to investigate the effects of Fak deletion in bone marrow compartments. The total number as well as the fraction of cycling Lin\u2212Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells is increased in Fak\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to controls, while hematopoietic progenitors and mature blood cells are unaffected. Bone marrow cells from Fak\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit enhanced, long-term (i.e., 20-week duration) engraftment in competitive transplantation assays. Intrinsic Fak function was assessed in serial transplantation assays, which showed that HSCs (Lin\u2212Sca-1+c-kit+CD34\u2212Flk-2\u2212 cells) sorted from Fak\u2212/\u2212 mice have similar self-renewal and engraftment ability on a per-cell basis as wild-type HSCs. When Fak deletion is induced after engraftment of Fakfl/flMx1-Cre+ bone marrow cells into wild-type recipient mice, the number of LSKs is unchanged. In conclusion, Fak inactivation does not intrinsically regulate HSC behavior and is not essential for steady-state hematopoiesis. However, widespread Fak inactivation in the hematopoietic system induces an increased and activated HSC pool size, potentially as a result of altered reciprocal interactions between HSCs and their microenvironment.",

Intriguingly, however, we find that ALDH1A1 deficiency is associated with increased expression of the ALDH3A1 isoform, suggesting its potential to compensate for ALDH1A1. Mice deficient in ALDH3A1 have a block in B-cell development as well as abnormalities in cell cycling, intracellular signaling, and gene expression. Early B cells from these mice exhibit excess reactive oxygen species and reduced metabolism of reactive aldehydes. Mice deficient in both ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1 have reduced numbers of HSCs as well as aberrant cell cycle distribution, increased reactive oxygen species levels, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and sensitivity to DNA damage. These findings demonstrate that ALDH3A1 can compensate for ALDH1A1 in bone marrow and is important in B-cell development, both ALDH1A1 and 3A1 are important in HSC biology; and these effects may be due, in part, to changes in metabolism of reactive oxygen species and reactive aldehydes.",

Recognition of dsRNA by TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5 is cell-type\u2013dependent and recent studies have shown a direct link between TLRs and hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that viral dsRNA recognized by either TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5, affects the growth of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here we show that polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)\u2013mediated very rapid apoptosis occurs within 1 hour in CD34+ cells in a dose-dependent manner. Polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid, another synthetic dsRNA that signals only through TLR3, had no effect. Poly I:C-LMW/LyoVec, a complex between low molecular-weight poly I:C and the transfection reagent LyoVec, which signals only through RIG-I/MDA-5, induces apoptosis of CD34+ cells. A strong and sustained upregulation of messenger RNA and protein levels of Noxa, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that can be induced by RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway, is found\u00a0in CD34+ cells treated by poly I:C. Although poly I:C upregulates type-I IFNs in CD34+ cells, neither exogenous IFN-\u03b1 nor IFN-\u03b2 induces rapid apoptosis in CD34+ cells and neutralization or blocking of type-I IFN receptor does not rescue CD34+ cells, whereas Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, rescues the cells from apoptosis. These results suggest that RIG-I/MDA-5, but not TRL3, signaling triggers poly I:C\u2013induced rapid apoptosis of human CD34+\u00a0cells, which will provide an insight into the mechanisms of dsRNA virus-mediated hematopoietic disorders.",

We implemented HOXB4-mediated expansion based on our previous experience with HOXB4 in autologous cells. Cord blood units were divided into two equal parts; half of the cells were transduced with a yellow fluorescent protein control vector and cryopreserved, and half were transduced with a HOXB4GFP vector, expanded, and cryopreserved. Both fractions of cells were transplanted into Macaca nemestrina subjects. We found that neutrophil recovery occurred within 19 days in all animals, and both neutrophil and platelet recovery were substantially accelerated compared to human single unit cord blood transplants. In addition, HOXB4-transduced and expanded cells resulted in superior engraftment of all hematopoietic lineages in all animals over nonexpanded controls. In conclusion, we have successfully established a nonhuman primate cord blood transplantation model and demonstrated that HOXB4 stimulates expansion and engraftment of repopulating cells. The availability of such a model has significant implications for developing and testing strategies to improve clinical cord blood transplantation, as it will allow comparison of different stem cell expansion methodologies within a single animal. Furthermore, it can be used in long-term follow-up studies to determine how specific expansion techniques affect engraftment of various hematopoietic lineages.",

Microarray experiments were performed on 98 untreated CLL cases. Next, freshly isolated primary cells from 21 untreated patients were analyzed for in\u00a0vitro response to irradiation through Western blot, PARP activity assay, Annexin-V analysis, and PARP1 basal expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Microarray analysis showed that PARP1 and CHE1 were constitutively expressed in CLL and had a high degree of correlation with each other and with TP53. PARP1 and TP53 downmodulation was associated with worse clinical outcomes, especially in TP53-mutated cases. Next, CLL samples from 21 untreated patients were classified as responders and nonresponders based on IR-induced PARP1 cleavage. Notably, while responder samples were characterized by Che-1 and p53 induction at 8 hours and reduction at 24 hours post-IR, nonresponders included both samples with p53 dysfunctions and cases with a normal IR-induced Che-1 and/or p53 response. Finally, we observed that PARP1 was downregulated in nonresponder vs responder samples and that its basal expression was positively correlated with PARP1 cleavage after IR.

The transgenic N-ras animals develop B- and plasma cell lymphoproliferation, and aged mice develop immunoglobulinemia, renal hyaline tubular casts, and microscopic foci of abnormal plasma cells in extramedullary sites, including the liver and kidney. Bitransgenic 3\u2032KE/N-Ras V12 \u00d7 E\u03bc-c-Myc mice develop fatal B-cell neoplasia, with a median survival of 10 weeks. These data indicate that activated N-ras can play a role in B- and plasma cell homeostasis and that activated N-Ras and c-Myc can cooperate to induce B-cell neoplasia.",

     "abstract": "Disruption of ribosomal proteins is associated with hematopoietic phenotypes in cell culture and animal models. Mutations in ribosomal proteins are seen in patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia, a rare congenital disease characterized by red cell aplasia and distinctive craniofacial anomalies. A zebrafish screen uncovered decreased hematopoietic stem cells in embryos with mutations in ribosomal protein rps29. Here, we determined that rps29\u2212/\u2212 embryos also have red blood cell defects and increased apoptosis in the head. As the p53 pathway has been shown to play a role in other ribosomal protein mutants, we studied the genetic relationship of rps29 and p53. Transcriptional profiling revealed that genes upregulated in the rps29 mutant are enriched for genes upregulated by p53 after irradiation. p53 mutation near completely rescues the rps29 morphological and hematopoietic phenotypes, demonstrating that p53 mediates the effects of rps29 knockdown. We also identified neuronal gene orthopedia protein a (otpa) as one whose expression correlates with rps29 expression, suggesting that levels of expression of some genes are dependent on rps29 levels. Together, our studies demonstrate a role of p53 in mediating the cellular defects associated with rps29 and establish a role for rps29 and p53 in hematopoietic stem cells and red blood cell development.",

     "abstract": "The skeletal muscle is supported by a vast network of microvessels with the capacity to regenerate in response to injury. However, the dynamics of microvascular repair and the origin of reconstituted endothelial cells in the skeletal muscle are poorly understood. A growing body of literature exists to indicate bone marrow (BM)\u2212derived cells engraft into regenerating vascular endothelium and muscle macrovasculature. Therefore, we investigated the extent of BM contribution to skeletal muscle microvasculature after acute injury. Because reporters and markers commonly used to trace donor BM cells are not endothelial specific but are also expressed by leukocytes, we generated novel BM chimeras utilizing Tie2-green fluorescent protein BM cells transplanted into CD31 and Caveolin-1 knockout recipients. In turn, we surveyed BM vascular contribution, not just by the presence of green fluorescent protein, but also CD31 and Caveolin-1, respectively. After stable BM reconstitution, chimera limb muscles were cardiotoxin (CTX) injured and examined 21 days post-injury for the presence of green fluorescent protein, CD31, and Caveolin-1. Acute muscle injury by CTX is characterized by initial microvasculature death followed by rapid endothelial regeneration within 14 days post-damage. Histological analysis of injured and uninjured contralateral limb muscles revealed a complete absence of BM engraftment in the muscle vasculature of wild-type and CD31/Caveolin-1 knockout chimeras. In contrast, F4/80+ cells isolated from CTX-injured muscle, expressed endothelial-related markers and promoted angiogenesis in\u00a0vitro. Therefore, despite the absence of BM engraftment to regenerated skeletal muscle microvasculature, macrophages recruited after injury promote angiogenesis and, in turn, vascular regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Abnormal bone marrow (BM) suppression is one of the hallmarks of dengue virus (DENV) infection in patients. Although the etiology remains unclear, direct viral targeting of the BM has been reasoned to be a contributing factor. The present studies were carried out in an effort to determine the potential effect of DENV infection on the cellularity of BM using a previously established nonhuman primate model of DENV-induced coagulopathy. BM aspirates were collected at various times from the infected nonhuman primate and cells were phenotypically defined and isolated using standard flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). These isolated cells were subjected to detection of DENV utilizing quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, electron microscopy, and immunostaining techniques. DENV RNA was detectable by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in BM specimens and the presence of DENV-like particles within platelet was confirmed by electron microscopy. Enumeration of BM cells revealed a transient surge in cellularity at day 1, followed by a gradual decline from days 2 to 10 post infection. Detailed phenotypic studies showed similar kinetics in the frequencies of CD41+CD61+ cells, regardless of CD34 and CD45 expression. The CD61+ cells were not only the predominant cells that stained for DENV antigen but fluorescence-activated cell sorting\u2013assisted isolation of CD61+ cells from the BM were shown to contain infectious DENV by coculture with Vero cells. These data support the view that intravenous infection of nonhuman primate with DENV leads to direct infection of the BM, which is likely to be a contributing factor for transient cell suppression in the peripheral blood characteristic of acute DENV infection.",

CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 plays a crucial physiological role in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to BM. It is regulated by the ectopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV; DPP4) known as CD26, which cleaves dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptide chains. Blocking DPPIV enzymatic activity had a beneficial effect on hematopoietic stem cell engraftment in various but very specific experimental settings. Here we investigated whether inhibition of DPPIV enzymatic activity through Diprotin A or sitagliptin (Januvia) improves BM engraftment in nonmyeloablative murine models of syngeneic (i.e., CD45-congenic) and allogeneic (i.e., Balb/c to B6) BMT (1\u00a0Gy total body irradiation, 10\u201315 \u00d7 106 unseparated BM cells/mouse). Neither Diprotin A administered in\u00a0vivo at the time of BMT and/or used for in\u00a0vitro pretreatment of BM nor sitagliptin administered in\u00a0vivo had a detectable effect on the level of multilineage chimerism (follow-up >20 weeks). Similarly, sitagliptin did not enhance chimerism after allogeneic BMT, even though DPPIV enzymatic activity measured in serum was profoundly inhibited (>98% inhibition at peak exposure). Our results provide evidence that DPPIV inhibition via Diprotin A or sitagliptin does not improve engraftment of unseparated BM in a nonmyeloablative BMT setting.",

Unlike small lymphocytic lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, which are relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, MCL is highly refractory to most chemotherapy, and has the worst survival rate among NHL patients. Stem-like cells in MCL, which we have termed mantle cell lymphoma-initiating cells (MCL-ICs), enriched in the population that are lack of prototypic B-cell marker CD19. These cells were able to self-renew upon serial transplantation and are highly tumorigenic. Importantly, these stem-like cells confer chemotherapeutic resistance to MCL. In this report, we show that stem-like MCL-ICs are resistant to bortezomib, as well as chemotherapeutic regimens containing bortezomib, despite constitutive nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) expression. Interestingly, bortezomib treatment induced MCL-IC differentiation in plasma-like cells with upregulated expression of CD38 and CD138. This process was accompanied by expression of plasma cell differentiation transcriptional factors, BLIMP-1 and IRF4. This article is the first to show that stem-like MCL cells utilize constitutive NF-\u03baB expression for survival. Given that the NF-\u03baB expression in MCL-ICs is resistant to bortezomib, it will be important to find alternative therapeutic strategies to inhibit NF-\u03baB expression.",

To quantitatively study this process, a time-resolved analysis of cellular dynamics at the single-cell level is an essential prerequisite. One way to generate sufficient amounts of appropriate data is automatic single-cell tracking using time-lapse video microscopy. We describe and apply newly developed computational algorithms that allow for an automated generation of high-content data of single-cell characteristics at high temporal and spatial resolution, together with the reconstruction and statistical evaluation of complete genealogical histories. This methodology has been applied to the particular example of purified primary human HSPCs in bioengineered culture conditions. The combination of genealogical information and dynamic profiles of cellular properties identified a marked symmetry between sibling HSPCs regarding cell cycle time, but also migration speed and growth kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this symmetry of HSPC siblings can be altered by exogenous cues of the local biomimetic microenvironment. Using the example of HSPC growth in biomimetic culture systems, we show that our approach provides a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of dynamic single-cell features under defined in\u00a0vitro conditions, allowing for integration of functional and genealogical data. The efficiency and accuracy of our approach pave the way for new and intriguing insights into the organizational principles of developmental patterns and the respective influence of exogenous cues not limited to the study of primary HSPCs.",

We previously showed that p53 knock-down increased ploidy in megakaryocytic cultures. This study aims to examine the effect of p53 loss on in\u00a0vivo megakaryopoiesis, platelet production, and function, and to investigate the basis for greater ploidy in p53\u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytic cultures. Here, we used flow cytometry to analyze ploidy, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis in murine cultured and bone marrow megakaryocytes following thrombopoietin administration and to analyze fibrinogen binding to platelets in\u00a0vitro. Culture of p53\u2212/\u2212 marrow cells for 6 days with thrombopoietin gave rise to 1.7-fold more megakaryocytes, 26.1% \u00b1 3.6% of which reached ploidy classes \u226564 N compared to 8.2% \u00b1 0.9% of p53+/+ megakaryocytes. This was due to 30% greater DNA synthesis in p53\u2212/\u2212 megakaryocytes and 31% greater apoptosis in p53+/+ megakaryocytes by day 4 of culture. Although the bone marrow and spleen steady-state megakaryocytic content and ploidy were similar in p53+/+ and p53\u2212/\u2212 mice, thrombopoietin administration resulted in increased megakaryocytic polyploidization in p53\u2212/\u2212 mice. Although their platelet counts were normal, p53\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited significantly longer bleeding times and p53\u2212/\u2212 platelets were less sensitive than p53+/+ platelets to agonist-induced fibrinogen binding and P-selectin secretion. In summary, our in\u00a0vivo and ex\u00a0vivo studies indicate that p53 loss leads to increased polyploidization during megakaryopoiesis. Our findings also suggest for the first time a direct link between p53 loss and the development of fully functional platelets resulting in hemostatic deficiencies.",

However, whether plasmin is involved in erythropoiesis is not known. In the present study, we studied the consequences of plasminogen deficiency on erythropoiesis in plasminogen-deficient (Plg knockout [KO]) mice. Erythroid differentiation was attenuated in male Plg KO mice and resulted in erythroblastic accumulation within the spleen and bone marrow, with increased apoptosis in the former, erythrocytosis, and splenomegaly, whereas similar erythropoietic defect was less prominent in female Plg KO mice. In addition, erythrocyte lifespan was shorter in both male and female Plg KO mice. Erythropoietin levels were compensatory increased in both male and female Plg KO mice, and resulted in a higher frequency of burst-forming units-erythroid within the spleen and bone marrow. Surprisingly, we found that male Plg KO mice, but not their female counterparts, exhibited normochromic normocytic anemia. The observed sex-linked erythropoietic defect was attributed to decreased serum testosterone levels in Plg KO mice as a consequence of impaired secretion of the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) under steady-state condition. Surgical castration causing testosterone deficiency and stimulating LH release attenuated erythroid differentiation and induced anemia in wild-type animals, but did not further decrease the hematocrit levels in Plg KO mice. In addition, complementation of LH using human choriogonadotropin, which increases testosterone production, improved the erythropoietic defect and anemia in Plg KO mice. The present results identify a novel role for plasmin in the hormonal regulation of postnatal erythropoiesis by the LH-testosterone axis.",

Applying single-cell long-term culture-initiating cell assays, we have correlated the functional properties of individual cells within this LSCC population and the respective phenotypes. To define their biologic significance, we also analyzed the relationship between LSCC at diagnosis to long-term clinical outcomes. The median percentage of ALDHbright cells among 101 acute myeloid leukemia patients was 0.51% (range, 0.01\u201312.90%). Single-cell long-term culture-initiating cell assays, followed by genetic analysis of the progeny cells, showed that the leukemia-initiating activity was found in the ALDHbright/CD34high subset and, to a lesser extent, in ALDHbright/CD34low or ALDHbright/CD34\u2212 subsets. Nevertheless, the frequency of ALDHbright cells at diagnosis correlated significantly with the persistence of leukemia after induction chemotherapy (n = 84, Spearman R = 0.3261; p < 0.0025). In the multivariate model, frequency of ALDHbright cells was the strongest prognostic marker (p = 0.0095) affecting overall survival (hazard ratio = 9.107).

However, it is not fully understood how homeostasis of bone marrow HSCs is maintained. We attempted to identify a key molecule involved in the regulation of HSC numbers, a factor that, in the absence of Lnk, leads to HSC expansion. Here, we demonstrate that upon stimulation with thrombopoietin, expression of Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein, was highly enhanced in Lnk-deficient HSCs compared to normal HSCs. As a result, Lnk-deficient HSCs underwent reduced apoptosis following exposure to lethal radiation. Downregulation of Bcl-xL expression in Lnk-deficient HSCs by short-hairpin RNA resulted in a great reduction of their capacity for reconstitution. These findings suggest that Lnk/Sh2b3 constrains the expression of Bcl-xL and that the loss of Lnk/Sh2b3 function enhances survival of HSCs by inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, our observations indicate that HSCs in patients with an Lnk/Sh2b3 mutation might become resistant to apoptosis due to thrombopoietin-mediated enhanced expression of Bcl-xL. Consequently, reduced apoptosis could facilitate accumulation of HSCs with oncogenic mutations leading to development of myeloproliferative disorders.",

At appropriate doses, 6TG induced selective myelotoxicity without any adverse effects on extrahematopoietic tissues in HPRT wild-type mice, while hematopoietic stem cells deficient in HPRT activity were highly resistant to its cytotoxic effects. Combined 6TG conditioning and post-transplantation chemoselection consistently achieved \u223c95% engraftment of HPRT-deficient donor BM, with low overall toxicity.

Methylation status was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The role of HSPB8 in hematopoietic malignancies was addressed by reintroducing HSPB8 expression into the K562 (leukemia) and Namalwa (lymphoma) cell lines. Expression of HSPB8 was absent in hematopoietic tumor cell lines and primary patient and normal volunteer samples. Promoter DNA methylation of HSPB8 was observed in these cells. HSPB8 expression could be restored after demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of HSPB8 reduced colony formation of both K562 and Namalwa cell lines, inhibited the cell growth of Namalwa in\u00a0vitro, and suppressed tumor formation of K562 cells in\u00a0vivo.

The variability in chemoresistance of normal bone marrow precursors has been hypothesized as explanation for the variable CD34 mobilization in AML. In 37 patients with AML in CR, we determined the chemosensitivity of bone marrow clonogenic precursors to maphosphamide and etoposide, which was then correlated with the degree of CD34+ mobilization. In an enlarged set of 49 patients, we also studied the importance of chemosensitivity of marrow precursors for disease-free survival and relapse incidence. Significant correlations were demonstrated between the peak number of CD34+ cells and residual growth of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) after maphosphamide (R = 0.550; p = 0.0003) and after etoposide (R = 0.793; p = 0.0003). It was possible to identify three groups of AML patients based on chemosensitivity. The mean CD34+ peak was 33 \u00d7 106/L in the hyperchemosensitive group, 141\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106/L in the normochemosensitive (p = 0.03), and 379 \u00d7 106/L in the chemoresistant group (p = 0.002). Failed CD34+ mobilization was observed in 72% of the hyperchemosensitive group, 23% of the normochemosensitive group, and 0% of the chemoresistant group (p = 0.001). Hyperchemosensitivity of CFU-GM, together with a low platelet count, were independent factors important in the failure of CD34+ cell mobilization. A disease-free survival significantly inferior to that of all other patients was associated with chemoresistance of CFU-GM (log rank, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) and with chemoresistance of burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) (log rank, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Chemoresistance of CFU-GM (p = 0.048) and BFU-E (p = 0.017) was also associated with increase relapse incidence. Nonleukemic nature of these precursors was demonstrated studying minimal residual disease from single colony cells. In conclusion, we found that hyperchemosensitivity of normal nonleukemic CFU-GM is associated with a high risk of CD34+ cell mobilization failure, while a chemoresistant pattern in CFU-GM and BFU-E is associated with poor disease-free survival and increased cumulative incidence of relapse.",

Although ZStrC lacked the ability to differentiate into classic mesenchymal stromal cell lineages (i.e., osteocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes), they did have the capacity for endotube formation on Matrigel and low-density lipoprotein uptake. ZStrC supported marrow cells for >2 weeks in\u00a0vitro. Importantly, marrow cells were shown to retain homing ability in adoptive transfer experiments. ZStrC were also shown to improve hematopoietic recovery after sublethal irradiation after adoptive transfer. As the zebrafish model grows in popularity and importance in the study of hematopoiesis, new tools to aid in our understanding of the hematopoietic cell\u2212stromal cell interaction are required. ZStrC represent an additional tool in the study of hematopoiesis and will be useful in understanding the factors that mediate the stromal cell\u2212hematopoietic cell interactions that are important in hematopoietic cell maintenance.",

Because modulation of [Ca2+]i is an important signaling pathway in erythroid proliferation and differentiation, Trpc2, Trpc3, and Trpc2/Trpc3 double knockout mice were utilized to explore the roles of these channels in erythropoiesis. Trpc2, Trpc3, and Trpc2/Trpc3 double knockout mice were not anemic, and had similar red blood cell counts, hemoglobins, and reticulocyte counts as wild-type littermate controls. Although the erythropoietin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was reduced, these knockout mice showed no defects in red cell production. The major phenotypic difference at steady state was that the mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and hematocrit of red cells were significantly greater in Trpc2 and Trpc2/Trpc3 double knockout mice, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was significantly reduced. All hematological parameters in Trpc3 knockout mice were similar to controls. When exposed to phenylhydrazine, unlike the Trpc3 knockouts, Trpc2 and Trpc2/Trpc3 double knockout mice showed significant resistance to hemolysis. This was associated with a significant reduction in hydrogen peroxide\u2212induced calcium influx in erythroblasts. Although erythropoietin-induced calcium influx through TRPC2 or TRPC3 is not critical for erythroid production, these data demonstrate that TRPC2 plays an important role in oxidative stress-induced hemolysis, which may be related to reduced calcium entry in red cells in the presence of Trpc2 depletion.",

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) has been implicated as a regulator of murine HSPC self-renewal, but little is understood about the role of PTEN in human HSPC regulation. We tested the impact of transient small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u2013induced inhibition of PTEN expression in human CD34+ cells on their cell cycle profile, their susceptibility to retroviral transduction, and their ability to self-renew and repopulate nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency disease with interleukin-2 receptor \u03b3-chain deficiency mice. Reduced PTEN messenger RNA and protein levels were confirmed in PTEN siRNA-treated CD34+ cells compared with control siRNA-treated CD34+ cells. Transient silencing of PTEN in CD34+ cells promoted their entry into cell cycle, and increased their expansion in\u00a0vitro compared with control siRNA-treated CD34+ cells. When these cells were transduced with retroviral vectors, transduction efficiencies in the bulk CD34+ cells transfected with PTEN siRNA were significantly higher compared with CD34+ cells transfected with a control siRNA. Transient PTEN suppression in CD34+ cells also increased their proliferation and engraftment potential in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency disease with interleukin-2 receptor \u03b3-chain deficiency mice, and maintained their multilineage differentiation capacity in\u00a0vivo. No mice developed myeloproliferative disorders or leukemias. Similar to findings with murine HSPC, PTEN may also promote quiescence of human HSPC. With optimization of technologies for transfer of siRNA in primary CD34+ cells, this approach may facilitate investigations into the mechanisms underlying HSPC self-renewal, and could find clinical applications in gene therapy protocols.",

Paternal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were transduced with a porcine FVIII-encoding lentivector and transplanted via the intraperitoneal route without preconditioning. At the time of transplantation, these animals had received multiple human FVIII treatments for various spontaneous bleeds and had developed debilitating hemarthroses, which produced severe defects in posture and gait. Transplantation of transduced MSC resolved all existent hemarthroses, and spontaneous bleeds ceased. Damaged joints recovered fully; the animals regained normal posture and gait and resumed normal activity. Despite achieving factor-independence, a sharp rise in pre-existent Bethesda titers occurred following transplantation, decreasing the effectiveness and duration of therapy. Postmortem examination revealed widespread engraftment, with MSC present within the lung, liver, intestine, and thymus, but particularly within joints affected at the time of transplantation, suggesting MSC homed to sites of ongoing injury/inflammation to release FVIII, explaining the dramatic improvement in hemarthrotic joints. In summary, this novel, nonablative MSC transplantation was straightforward, safe, and converted life-threatening, debilitating HA to a moderate phenotype in a large animal model.",

Truncation mutations of CSF3R, encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), are associated with development of myelodysplasia/AML in severe congenital neutropenia. However, a causal relationship between CSF3R mutations and leukemic transformation has not been established.

Expression of truncated G-CSFR significantly shortens the latency of AML in\u00a0a G-CSF\u2212dependent fashion and it is associated with a distinct AML presentation characterized by higher blast counts and more severe myelosuppression. Basal and G-CSF\u2212induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation were highly variable but similar in leukemic blasts expressing wild-type and truncated G-CSFR.

A cohort of 169 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias was investigated for telomere length, human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene promoter methylation status, genomic aberrations, immunophenotype, and clinical outcomes. Methylation of the core promoter of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene was demonstrated in 24% of diagnostic samples, with a significant difference between B-cell precursor (n = 130) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 17) cases (18% and 72%, respectively; p < 0.001). No remission sample demonstrated hTERT promoter methylation (n = 40). Within the B-cell precursor group, t(12;21)(p13;q22) [ETV6/RUNX1] cases (n = 19) showed a much higher frequency of hTERT methylation than high-hyperdiploid (51\u221261 chromosomes) ALL (n = 44) (63% and 7%, respectively; p < 0.001). hTERT messenger RNA levels were negatively associated with methylation status and, in the t(12;21) group, methylated cases had shorter telomeres (p = 0.017). In low-risk B-cell precursor patients (n = 101), long telomeres indicated a worse prognosis.

Different Treg cell populations have been isolated from healthy donors and characterized by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for their phenotypic marker and purity, functional properties by suppression assay, stability by Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) of the Foxp3 promoter and their in\u00a0vitro expansion capacity. The direct comparison of the respective Treg target cell populations identified CD4+CD25hiCD127\u2212 and CD4+CD25hiICOS+ Tregs as the most promising Treg population for fresh cell infusions in clinical trials with respect to cell yield, phenotype, function, and stability. The CD4+CD25hi Tregs qualified as the best candidate for in\u00a0vitro expansion combining a highly stable phenotype with strong suppressive potential and attractive cell yield after repetitive stimulation. The suppressive capacity of freshly isolated CD4+CD25hiCD45RA+ and CD49d\u2212CD127\u2212 Tregs is comparable to freshly isolated CD4+CD25hi, but inferior to CD4+CD25hiCD127\u2212 and CD4+CD25hiICOS+ Tregs. In\u00a0vitro expansion of CD4+CD25hiCD45RA+ and CD49d-CD127- Tregs resulted in cell populations with less suppressive potency compared with CD4+CD25hi expanded Tregs correlating well with a higher TSDR demethylation level. In conclusion, future clinical trials should favor CD4+CD25hiCD127\u2212 and CD4+CD25hiICOS+ Tregs for direct Treg cell transfer, whereas CD4+CD25hi Tregs qualify as best candidate for in\u00a0vitro expansion.",

We report that the pan-leukocyte CD45 phosphatase plays an essential role in trafficking and repopulation of the bone marrow by immature human CD34+ cells and leukemic cells in transplanted nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice. Inhibiting CD45 function by blocking antibodies or a CD45 inhibitor impaired the motility of both normal and leukemic human cells. Blocking CD45 inhibited homing and repopulation by immature human CD34+ cells as well as homing of primary patient leukemic cells. In addition, CD45 inhibition negatively affected development of hematopoietic progenitors in\u00a0vitro and their recovery in transplanted recipients in\u00a0vivo, revealing the central role of CD45 in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Moreover, CD45 blockage induced a hyperadhesive phenotype in immature human progenitor cells as well as in murine leukocytes, leading to their defective adhesion interactions with endothelial cells. This phenotype was further manifested by the ability of CD45 blockage to prevent breakdown of adhesion interactions in the BM, which inhibited murine progenitor mobilization. The substantial effects of a direct CD45 inhibition point at its essential roles in cell trafficking, including murine progenitor cell mobilization and both normal immature and leukemic human hematopoietic cells as well as regulation of hematopoiesis and engraftment potential.",

     "abstract": "Various agents, including chemotherapeutic drugs, can induce cell senescence. However, the mechanisms involved in the aging pathway, particularly the stress that chemotherapy imposes on telomeres, are still undefined. To address these issues, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were assessed as target cells to investigate the initiation of the aging process by chemotherapy. The MSCs were obtained from bone marrow (BM) cells from normal adults and grown in the presence of platelet lysates. Cultured MSCs were identified for immunophenotype, and for growth and differentiation properties. The MSCs were exposed to 10 nM doxorubicin and 500 ng/mL etoposide, sublethal doses that induce DNA double-stranded breaks. Telomere length (TL) was assessed by flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blotting. Initial TL shortening was detectable in MSCs at 5 days after drug exposure, with progressive reduction compared with untreated cells at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in culture. After a single exposure, MSCs were unable to regain the lost telomere sequences for up to 28 days in culture. The ATM phosphorylation was documented early after drug exposure, while no telomerase activation was observed. Chemotherapy-induced TL shortening was associated with reduced clonogenic activity in\u00a0vitro and accelerated adipose differentiation. Analogous behavior in the differentiation pattern was observed in naturally aged MSCs. These results indicate that cultured MSCs represent a useful cellular model to investigate novel drugs that may favor or, conversely, might prevent TL loss in human stem cells. The TL shortening is a permanent signature of previous chemotherapy-mediated DNA\u00a0damage, and predicts impaired proliferative and differentiation potential.",

The PSGL-1 MPs significantly declined during conditioning therapy but increased again after transfusion of donor cells and even more at the time of engraftment.

We present the first studies on microvesicle production by excised cancers from human lung and the capacity of these microvesicles to alter the genetic phenotype of normal human marrow cells.

Under these varying conditions, each cancer derived from lung mediated marrow expression of between one and seven lung-specific genes.

Thus, there is a need for a systematic evaluation of different methodologies to identify the most suitable protocol. We compared Nucleofection with Accell, a novel nonviral-based delivery system in the setting of leukemic blasts from patients with myeloid leukemias. Two cell surface proteins, human inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor and CD96, both believed to be associated with leukemic stem cells, were chosen as target genes. Accell not only yielded higher transfection rates, but also retained superior cell viabilities for both cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Thus, transfection efficiencies in primary cells after Accell delivery was 85% (range, 71\u201397%) compared to 38% (23\u201365%) using Nucleofection for siRNA delivery. Preliminary studies of clonal growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells indicated growth inhibition after siRNA transfection.

Our study investigated the Mxd4 expression pattern at the onset of hematopoiesis and the biological relevance of its sharp and transient downregulation.To study the expression pattern and role of Mxd4 at the onset of hematopoiesis, the in\u00a0vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells was used as a model system. Gain of function assays were performed using a doxycycline-inducible embryonic stem cell system.We show here that Mxd4 expression is transiently downregulated at an early stage of commitment to the hematopoietic lineage. Enforced expression of Mxd4 at this period of differentiation results in a defect in hematopoietic progenitor development, with impaired development of both primitive and definitive blood lineages. This effect is due to a severe decrease in cell proliferation, with an increased frequency of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, alongside a reduced frequency of cells in the S phase.Together our results indicate that during embryonic hematopoietic differentiation Mxd4 is an important player in the regulation of blood progenitor proliferation, and suggest that downregulation of its expression might be required for a proliferative burst preceding lineage specification.",

Plasma CCL8 increases on day 5 of allogeneic transplantation, when signs of GVHD are barely detectable. Increase of allogeneic splenocytes in grafts exacerbates GVHD and leads to upregulation of plasma CCL8 on day 5. Overall survival is the gold standard in determining the severity of acute GVHD in mice, but the absence of clinical and/or pathological manifestations in the early phase make it difficult to estimate vital outcomes at this stage of allogeneic marrow transplantation.After lethal irradiation, BALB/c mice received bone marrow transplantation from C57BL/6 mice. Survival rate was monitored and clinical and pathological scores of GVHD were examined. Coculture of BALB/c-derived dendritic cells and C57BL/6-derived splenocytes was performed.

     "abstract": "One of the key challenges facing biomedical research is to extract biologically meaningful information from the ever-increasing scale and complexity of datasets generated through high-throughput approaches. Hematopoiesis represents one of the most experimentally tractable mammalian organ systems and, therefore, has historically tended to be at the forefront of applying new technologies within biomedical research. The combination of massive parallel sequencing technologies with chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) permits genome-scale characterization of histone modification status and identification of the complete set of binding sites for transcription factors. Because transcription factors have long been recognized as essential regulators of cell fate choice in hematopoiesis, ChIP-Seq technology has rapidly entered the arena of modern experimental hematology. Here we review the biological insights gained from ChIP-Seq studies performed in the hematopoietic system since the earliest studies just 4 years ago. A surprisingly large number of different approaches have already been implemented to extract new biological knowledge from ChIP-Seq datasets. By focusing on successful insights from multiple different approaches, we hope to provide stimulating reading for anyone wanting to utilize ChIP-Seq technology within their particular research field.",

     "abstract": "The intricately regulated Ras pathway coordinates multiple kit-ligand\u2212induced mast cell functions, including chemotaxis, proliferation, and degranulation. However, the intracellular proteins that modulate the intensity and duration of stem cell factor\u2212induced signals and the consequent cellular response are incompletely understood. Scaffolding proteins coordinate the spatial organization of mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins that may potentiate and/or inhibit cell functions. The kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR1) protein is known to function as a molecular scaffold and coordinates the organization of Raf/Mek/Erk in response to receptor tyrosine kinases. However, the impact of KSR1 in myeloid mast cell functions and in response to stem cell factor remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of KSR1 in regulating cellular functions of bone marrow\u2212derived mast cells of KSR1-deficient (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Genetic disruption of KSR1 resulted in both striking reductions in kit-ligand\u2212mediated proliferation and degranulation, which are commonly attributed to mitogen-activated protein kinase signals. Surprisingly, disruption of the KSR1 scaffold also resulted in a decline in migration that is generally not linked to Raf-Erk signals. We found that loss of KSR1 does impact the biochemical activation of p21-activated kinase, a kinase that is known to modulate Raf-Erk signals and also F-actin polymerization key to mast cell migration. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the scaffolding protein KSR1 has an important role in multiple kit-ligand\u2212mediated mast cell functions. This study elucidates varied mast cell physiological functions for KSR1, including those related to cytoskeletal organization, and it suggests a novel molecular target for attenuating mast cell\u2212mediated inflammation.",

Urine, blood glucose levels, and chimerism were monitored.Conditioning of NOD mice with costimulatory blockade significantly enhanced engraftment, with 61% of mice engrafting at 1 month. Eleven of 12 chimeric animals with engraftment at 1 month remained diabetes-free over a 12-month follow-up, whereas nonchimeric animals progressed to diabetes. In contrast, similar conditioning prolonged islet\u00a0allograft survival in only 2 of 11 overtly diabetic NOD recipients. Chimerism levels in the 9 islet rejector animals were 0%.Although nonmyeloablative conditioning reversed the autoimmune process in prediabetic NOD mice, the same regimen was significantly less effective in establishing chimerism and reversing autoimmune diabetes in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice.",

Definitive hematopoiesis was unaffected. Concomitant sox7 and sox18 knockdown disrupted vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, but not hematopoiesis. sox32 knockdown delayed medial migration of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors at 18 hpf and abolished cmyb expression at the caudal hematopoietic tissue at 48 hpf. These defects could be prevented by delaying its knockdown using a caged sox32 morpholino uncaged at 10 hpf. Knockdown of SoxF genes significantly upregulated their own expression and that of sox32 also upregulated sox18 expression.sox17 helped to maintain primitive hematopoiesis, whereas sox7 and sox18 regulated angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. sox32 affected both vascular and hematopoietic development through its effects on medial migration of the hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors.",

We investigated the molecular action of resveratrol on IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 axis in human MM cells.Human MM cell lines ANBL-6, OPM2, and MM.1S were utilized to determine the molecular signaling events following treatment with resveratrol. The stimulation of IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 axis was analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The effect of resveratrol on the transcriptional activity of spliced XBP1 was assessed by luciferase assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to determine the effects of resveratrol on the DNA binding activity of XBP1 in MM cells.Resveratrol activated IRE1\u03b1 as evidenced by XBP1 messenger RNA splicing and phosphorylation of both IRE1\u03b1 and its downstream kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase in MM cells. These responses were associated with resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity of MM cells. Resveratrol selectively suppressed the transcriptional activity of XBP1s while it stimulated gene expression of the molecules that are regulated by the non-IRE1/XBP1 axis of the ER stress response. Luciferase assays indicated that resveratrol suppressed the transcriptional activity of XBP1s through sirtuin 1, a downstream molecular target of resveratrol. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that resveratrol decreased the DNA binding capacity of XBP1 and increased the enrichment of sirtuin 1 at the XBP1 binding region in the XBP1 promoter.Resveratrol exerts its chemotherapeutic effect on human MM cells through mechanisms involving the impairment of the pro-survival XBP1 signaling and the activation of pro-apoptotic ER stress response.",

Gene and protein expression were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis. A multiplex assay was used to determine cytokines and chemokines.SNDX-275 induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC50 at the sub- and lower micromolar range at 72 hours. At the molecular level, SNDX-275 increased histone H3 acetylation, upregulated p21 expression, and activated the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by downregulating the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. SNDX-275 downregulated expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins without altering Mcl-1 or Bax levels. Combination studies demonstrated that two Bcl-2 inhibitors (ABT-737 and obatoclax) significantly enhanced the effect of SNDX-275. SNDX-275 modulated the level of several cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-12 p40-70, interferon-inducible protein-10, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted), interleukin-13, interleukin-4, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and variably induced the cancer/testis antigen expression of MAGE-A4 and survivin in HL cell lines.SNDX-275 has antiproliferative activity in HL cell lines, involving several mechanisms: induction of apoptosis, regulation of cytokines and chemokines, and alteration of cancer/testis antigens. Clinical investigation of SNDX-275 alone or in combination with Bcl-2 inhibitors is warranted in patients with HL. Phase 2 studies with SNDX-275 in HL are ongoing, and future clinical studies should investigate combinations with SNDX-275.",

P815 or L1214 (H-2d) tumor cells were injected intravenously or subcutaneously on day 1 post-transplantation to generate a GVL model.Tumors in allogeneic mice treated with 1300 cGy exhibited markedly delayed subcutaneous tumor growth in\u00a0vivo as compared with mice treated with 900 cGy, while intravenous tumor growths were comparable between the two radiation doses. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 or interferon-\u03b3 were similar and the percentages of donor T-cell proliferation or apoptosis early after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were comparable. The numbers of CD8+ T cells from recipients that received 1300 cGy were significantly elevated in skin and tumor tissues. CD62Llow and CD44high CD8+ T-cell fractions were also elevated in 1300 cGy. After the higher radiation dose, P815-specific interferon-\u03b3 responses of splenic CD8+ T cells were markedly enhanced and the fractions of T cells of interferon-\u03b3\u2013producing T cells in tumor tissues but not in spleen were increased. The protein concentrations of chemokines in skin and tumor tissues were substantially elevated in 1300 cGy compared to 900 cGy.The higher radiation dose (1300 vs. 900 cGy) resulted in significantly enhanced GVL effect against an extramedullary tumor and the alterations in effector T-cell trafficking into tumor tissue are the most likely mechanism.",

Furthermore, we determined an inverse association between miR-10a and MDM4 expression in AML (IR) samples with respect to their NPM1 mutational status.miR-10a expression is highly characteristic for AML (IR) patients with NPM1 mutations and may influence its biological properties in AML by interfering with the p53 machinery partly regulated by MDM4.",

Furthermore, CIK cells of donor origin could be expanded from leukapheresis product collected from patients who relapsed post-allogeneic transplantation, thereby offering a useful method of obtaining activated donor cells in patients for whom further donor cells were unavailable. Interestingly, CIK cells cultured from patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome had a significantly higher proportion of CD3+CD56+ subset and higher fold expansion of CD3+ cells as compared to other groups of patients or healthy donors.

Flow cytometry was used for quantification of hematopoietic stem cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, and differentiated cells in different lineages (T, B, and myeloid cells). Single cell culture and homing assays were performed to further evaluate hematopoietic stem cell functions. Hematopoietic progenitor cells were also measured by the colony-forming cell culture.Contrary to the widely recognized role of Bid as a pro-apoptotic protein, the absence of Bid significantly reduced the reconstitution of donor hematopoietic cells in \u03b3-irradiated recipients. Interestingly, however, numbers of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells and their functions were not overtly altered. Instead, the regeneration of donor T and B cells was significantly impaired in the absence of Bid. Further analysis indicated an accumulation of the triple-negative T-cell population in the thymus, and pro-B cells in the bone marrow.Our current study demonstrates a positive impact of Bid on hematopoietic regeneration mainly due to its unique effects on donor lymphopoiesis in the transplant recipients.",

     "abstract": "The prognosis for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concomitant overexpression of c-Myc and Bcl-2 remains dismal; there is an urgent need to clarify the significance of these two oncogenes as therapeutic targets for a more effective treatment strategy.We established two novel cell lines, KPUM-MS3 and KPUM-UH1, from two chemoresistant patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concomitant overexpression of c-Myc and Bcl-2, and investigated the significance of c-Myc and Bcl-2 as therapeutic targets.KPUM-MS3 possesses t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation and KPUM-UH1 bcl-2 gene amplification, both of which account for Bcl-2 overexpression. Chromosomal translocation t(8;14)(q24;q34) was found to coexist only in KPUM-UH1, overexpression of pvt-1 messenger RNA was detected only in KPUM-MS3, and reduced expression of miR-143 and miR-145 was identified in both. Working together, these abnormalities can contribute to c-Myc overexpression. Using ABT-263, an inhibitor for Bcl-2, and 10058-F4, an inhibitor for c-Myc, we found that both cell lines were more highly sensitive to cell death as a result of Bcl-2 inhibition than of c-Myc inhibition. When combined with genotoxic agents, ABT-263 exerted additive and/or synergistic cell-killing effects, while 10058-F4 showed, at most, a modest combinatory effect. Importantly, the combination of ABT-263 and 10058-F4 had a synergistic cell-killing effect on both cell lines.Our data suggest that Bcl-2 is a better therapeutic target than c-Myc, but attacking both Bcl-2 and c-Myc would be an even more effective treatment strategy for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concurrent Bcl-2 and c-Myc overexpression.",

Previously, a murine VB22B minibody for Mpl was shown to stimulate megakaryocyte colony formation in\u00a0vitro and increase the platelet count in cynomolgus monkeys. In this study, we directly compared the effects of a humanized VB22B minibody (huVB22B) with those of thrombopoietin and eltrombopag under the hypothesis that Mpl agonists might have different biological effects on megakaryopoiesis, platelet production, intracellular signal transduction, and platelet function.Human bone marrow\u2212derived CD34+ cells were used for colony formation assays and proplatelet formation assays in\u00a0vitro. The DNA ploidy in megakaryocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription and mitogen-activated protein kinase was detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies. The effects of the Mpl agonists on platelet aggregation were analyzed by aggregometry using human platelets.HuVB22B was as potent as thrombopoietin and eltrombopag in its ability to form mature megakaryocytes using human CD34+ cells in\u00a0vitro. It did not affect granulocyte-macrophage or erythroid colony formation. HuVB22B increased the number of proplatelet-forming megakaryocytes more efficiently than thrombopoietin or eltrombopag. Despite stronger phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription and mitogen-activated protein kinase compared with thrombopoietin in human platelets, huVB22B did not enhance adenosine diphosphate- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Eltrombopag did not enhance agonist-induced platelet aggregation.We found that huVB22B, eltrombopag, and thrombopoietin have different effects on megakaryopoiesis, platelet function, and intracellular signaling. The precise mechanisms for these different biological effects regarding stimulation through the same receptor, Mpl, remain to be elucidated.",

Flow cytometry monitored the effects of ECP on markers of cell death.For KMH2 and L428, ECP was cytotoxic with a dose\u2212response relationship similar to a previously investigated small-cell lung cancer cell line. HDLM-2 was more sensitive to ECP at low concentrations, but reached a plateau (survival index of 70%) at 0.018 \u03bcM. The IC50 for KMH2 and L428 were 0.2 and 0.15 \u03bcM, respectively. The IC50 was never reached for HDLM-2. All tested ECP variants displayed similar activity in HDLM-2, in contrast to KMH2 and L428, which were more sensitive to less glycosylated ECP. Positive DNA staining (propidium iodide) of HDLM-2 cells treated with ECP indicated cell death by necrosis.ECP is cytotoxic for HL tumor cells even at low concentrations, but heterogeneity between cell lines exists and not all tumor cells are eradicated. Two cell lines of B-cell origin, KMH2 and L428, were sensitive to ECP in a dose\u2212response manner, but for HDLM-2, which is of T-cell origin, the cytotoxicity reached a plateau.",

In the children, tryptase measurement and skin histopathological examination were performed.Blood, urine, and buccal swab specimens were collected from the\u00a0family members. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing KIT-WT and KIT-N882I.

Western blot analysis using HEK293T and Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT-N822I isoform showed that KIT-N822I constitutively activated KIT tyrosine phosphorylation. In vitro assays on KIT-N822I-expressing Ba/F3 cells confirmed that the N822I mutant is resistant to imatinib mesylate. In contrast, a high efficacy of dasatinib toward the KIT-N822I\u2013expressing Ba/F3 cells was observed.We provided evidence that KIT p.N822I mutation has transforming potential and can cause a constitutive activation of KIT. In addition, we demonstrated that KIT-N822I is resistant to imatinib and sensitive to dasatinib. Finally, our findings support the hypothesis that not only KIT mutations but other additional genetic abnormalities are contributing to\u00a0more advanced forms of the disease.",

Validation of candidate regulators involved promoter analyses, Affymetrix profiling, real-time PCR, and immunoprecipitation.Promoter analysis of genes differentially expressed across multiple serial-analysis-of-gene-expression libraries identified E2F motifs in the promoters of many PS cell-specific genes (e.g., POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, FOXD3). siRNA analyses identified two retinoblastoma binding proteins (RBBP4, RBBP9) as required for maintenance of multiple human PS cell types. Both RBBPs were bound to RB in human PS cells, and E2F motifs were present in the promoters of genes whose expression was altered by decreasing RBBP4 and RBBP9 expression. Affymetrix and real-time PCR studies of siRNA-treated human PS cells showed that reduced RBBP4 or RBBP9 expression concomitantly decreased expression of POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, and/or FOXD3 plus certain cell cycle genes (e.g., CCNA2, CCNB1), while increasing expression of genes involved in organogenesis (particularly neurogenesis).These results reveal new candidate positive regulators of human PS cells, providing evidence of their ability to regulate expression of pluripotency, cell cycle, and differentiation genes in human PS cells. These data provide valuable new leads for further elucidating mechanisms of human pluripotency.",

For patients who achieved rescue donor engraftment, the response rate was 90.9% (eight complete response, two partial response, and one stable disease). Six of the eight patients with complete response survived without GVHD symptoms, with a median follow-up of 2128 days. No new development of GVHD by the second graft was observed. No patients had recurrence of the original malignant disease. In contrast, no long-term survivors were observed in patients who rejected rescue donor grafts.We propose here a novel graft-versus-GVHD treatment to treat refractory GVHD, and these results strongly suggest that GVHD can be successfully treated by eliminating the harmful lymphocytes responsible for GVHD by a second allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

     "abstract": "Several stem cell mobilization strategies have been employed in the past 2 decades, including chemotherapy, hematopoietic growth factors, and chemotherapy plus growth factors. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF are standard agents approved for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization since the early 1990s. Between 5% and 20% of patients, however, fail to mobilize a sufficient numbers of peripheral blood stem cells in response to G-CSF with or without chemotherapy. Recent advances in defining the basic mechanisms regulating the interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and their marrow niche had led to the discovery that CXCR4 and stromal-cell\u2212derived factor 1\u03b1 axis play a significant role. Plerixafor, an antagonist of the CXCR4-stromal-cell\u2212derived factor 1\u03b1 axis has been shown to result in a significant mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that the combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 (G+A) resulted in a significant increase in CD34+ cell yield as compared to the administration of G-CSF alone. In particular, the progenitors mobilized have been shown to comprise a significantly higher proportion of primitive and possibly more potent CD34+/CD38- subpopulation. Transplantation of PBSC mobilized by G+A administration have led to a rapid and sustained neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Another prospective role of this new class of agents might lie in the mobilization of dormant leukemia stem cells that are well protected by the niche. The future role of CXCR4 antagonists in treatment of hematologic malignancies includes mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation and mobilization of leukemia-initiating cells for long-term cure.",

     "abstract": "The transcription factor PAX5 is essential for the activation of B-cell\u2212specific genes and for the silencing of myeloid-specific genes. We previously determined the molecular mechanism by which PAX5 silences the myeloid-specific colony-stimulating-factor-receptor (Csf1R) gene and showed that PAX5 directly binds to the Csf1r promoter as well as to an intronic enhancer that generates an antisense transcript in B cells. Here we examine the role of PAX5 in the regulation of sense and antisense transcription in B cells.We performed PAX5-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses across the Csfr1 locus. We investigated the role of PAX5 in regulating Csf1r sense and antisense promoter activity by transient transfections and by employing a Pax5\u2212/\u2212 pro\u2212B-cell line expressing an inducible PAX5 protein. PAX5 interacting factors were identified by pull-down experiments. The role of the transcription factor Sp3 in driving antisense promoter expression was examined in B cells from Sp3 knockout mice.PAX5 differentially regulates the Csf1r promoter and the promoter of the antisense transcript. PAX5 interferes with PU.1 transactivation at the sense promoter by binding to a PAX5 consensus sequence. At the antisense promoter, PAX5 does not specifically recognize DNA, but interacts with Sp3 to upregulate antisense promoter activity. Antisense promoter activation by PAX5 is dependent on the presence of its partial homeo-domain.We demonstrate that PAX5 regulates Csf1r in B cells by reducing the frequency of binding of the basal transcription machinery to the promoter and by activating antisense RNA expression.",

Elevated T cell subsets in PNH were assessed for differential cytotoxic lysis of GPI+ and GPI\u2212 CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell lines.In PNH patients, the frequency (p < 0.001) and absolute number of T cells expressing the NKR CD56 (p = 0.01) were significantly increased. Furthermore, a higher percentage of T cells expressed the activating NKR NKG2D (p < 0.01), NKG2C (p < 0.01), and KIR2DS4 (p = 0.01). Further characterization showed that these populations predominantly consist of CD8+ effector memory CD45RA+ T cells (TEMRA). NKR+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lines isolated from PNH patient peripheral blood and bone marrow displayed high cytotoxicity towards CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell lines and K562 cells, suggesting major histocompatibility complex class I\u2212independent cytotoxicity.

Cytokines secreted from macrophages were characterized by protein array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Resting macrophages released soluble factors that promoted megakaryocyte growth, cell ploidy, a size increase, proplatelet production, and platelet release. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation triggered the secretion of cytokines that exerted opposite effects together with a dramatic switch of CD34+ commitment to the megakaryocytic lineage toward the myeloid lineage. Neutralization of interleukin-8 released by stimulated macrophages partially reversed the inhibition of megakaryocyte growth. Activation of nuclear factor \u03baB had a major role in the synthesis of molecules involved in the megakaryocyte inhibition mediated by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages.Our study extends our understanding about the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in the regulation of megakaryo/thrombopoiesis by showing that soluble factors derived from macrophages positively or negatively control megakaryocyte growth, differentiation, maturation, and their ability to produce platelets.",

Chemokine receptors, tumor-mediated chemotaxis, and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) expression were investigated in iDCs, whereas receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) levels were measured in primary plasma cells. Furthermore, cocultures of myeloma cells with autologous iDCs were installed to verify OC differentiation of these cells. Finally, the role of RANK/RANKL in such OC differentiation was investigated by inhibiting this molecular pathway.Peripheral and marrow iDCs from MM showed high CXCR4 expression and were augmented in bone marrow of MM patients with respect to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Also, iDCs expressed APRIL, whereas RANKL and TACI were upregulated by malignant cells. The cellular contact of myeloma cells with iDCs enhanced the clonogenic effect on tumor growth, whereas iDCs were directly primed to undergo OC transformation. These iDCs, indeed, exerted typical bone resorption that was abrogated by disabling the RANK/RANKL pathway signals. By contrast, plasma cells from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients were ineffective in transforming autologous iDCs.Our results emphasize the marrow cross-talk of iDCs with myeloma cells as an additional mechanism that upregulates osteoclastogenesis in MM, and suggest that such a RANKL-mediated OC differentiation of iDCs observed in\u00a0vitro may also occur in\u00a0vivo.",

All had an abnormal transcript of MFRN1 in messenger RNA extracted from blood leukocytes and/or liver tissue. The abnormal transcript contained an insert of intron 2 that had a stop codon. The consequences of abnormal MFRN1 expression were examined using zebrafish and yeast MFRN-deficient strains and cultured lymphoblasts from the patients.Abnormal human MFRN1 complementary DNA showed loss-of-function in zebrafish and yeast mutants, whereas normal human MFRN1 complementary DNA rescued both. Using cultured lymphoblasts, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed increased formation of abnormal transcript that was accompanied by decreased formation of normal transcript and reduced FECH activity in patients compared to normal lines. A positive correlation coefficient (0.75) was found between FECH activity and normal MFRN1 messenger RNA in lymphoblasts. However, no obvious cause for increased formation of abnormal transcript was identified in MFRN1 exons and splice junctions.Abnormal MFRN1 expression can contribute to erythropoietic protoporphyria phenotype in some patients, probably by causing a reduction in FECH activity.",

     "abstract": "The number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs) per cord blood unit is limited, and this can result in delayed engraftment or graft failure. In vitro expansion of HPCs provides a perspective to overcome these limitations. Cytokines as well as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to support HPCs ex vivo expansion, but a systematic analysis of their interplay remains elusive.Twenty different combinations of growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF], thrombopoietin [TPO], fibroblast growth factor\u22121 [FGF-1], angiopoietin-like 5, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2), either with or without MSC coculture were systematically compared for their ability to support HPC expansion. CD34+ cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester to monitor cell division history in conjunction with immunophenotype. Colony-forming unit frequencies and hematopoietic reconstitution of nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice were also assessed.Proliferation of HPCs was stimulated by coculture with MSCs. This was further enhanced in combination with SCF, TPO, and FGF-1. Moreover, these conditions maintained expression of primitive surface markers for more than four cell divisions. Colony-forming unit\u2212initiating cells were not expanded without stromal support, whereas an eightfold increase was reached by simultaneous cytokine-treatment and MSC coculture. Importantly, in comparison to expansion without stromal support, coculture with MSCs significantly enhanced hematopoietic chimerism in a murine transplantation model.The supportive effect of MSCs on hematopoiesis can be significantly increased by addition of specific recombinant growth factors; especially in combination with SCF, TPO, and FGF-1.",

Because LYL-1 is expressed in erythroid cell populations, we addressed its role in erythropoiesis using knockin mice.Erythropoiesis of LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice was studied by progenitor assays, flow cytometry, reconstitution assays, and functional tests. Expression of LYL-1, SCL, and GATA-1 was assessed at messenger RNA level by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed decreased erythropoiesis with a partial arrest in differentiation, and enhanced apoptosis associated with decreased Bcl-xL expression in the bone marrow (BM). In addition, LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 BM cells were severely impaired in their abilities to reconstitute the erythroid lineage in competitive assays, suggesting a cell autonomous abnormality of erythropoiesis. In parallel, erythroid progenitor and precursor cells were significantly increased in the spleen of LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Expression of LYL-1 was differentially regulated during maturation of erythroblasts and strikingly different between spleen- and BM-derived erythroblasts. Expression of LYL-1 decreased during erythroid differentiation in the spleen whereas it increased in the BM to reach the same level in mature erythroblasts as in the soleen. Loss of Lyl-1 expression was accompanied with an increase of SCL/TAL-1 and GATA-1 transcripts in spleen but not in BM-derived erythroblasts. Furthermore, phenylhydrazine-induced stress erythropoiesis was elevated in LYL-1\u2212/\u2212 mice and mutant BM and spleen erythroid progenitors were hypersensitive to erythropoietin.Taken together, these results suggest that LYL-1 plays a definite role in erythropoiesis, albeit with different effects in BM specifically regulating basal erythropoiesis, and spleen, controlling stress-induced erythropoiesis.",

Novel foamy virus vectors expressing the human codon-optimized gp91phox were evaluated for the genetic correction of the disease in the X-CGD cell line and in X-CGD mouse model.The vectors were evaluated in vitro, in the human X-CGD PLB-985 cell line and in the X-CGD bone marrow Lin\u2212 cells. Transplantation of transduced Lin\u2212 cells was performed in X-CGD mice after busulfan conditioning. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for chimerism and vector copy number determination. Restoration of reduced NADPH oxidase production was assessed by nitrobluetetrazolium and dihydrorhodamine assays.High and stable gp91phox expression, as well as reconstitution of reduced NADPH activity, was achieved in the human X-CGD PLB-985 cell line and in primary murine X-CGD hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo. Transplantation of transduced bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells in the murine model of X-CGD, even with low multiplicities of infection (MOI), reconstituted the levels of oxidase-producing neutrophils and provided enzymatic activity that reached 70% of normal.Foamy virus vectors expressing the human gp91phox transgene constitute potential candidates for the gene therapy of CGD because they combine lack of pathogenicity with efficacy even at low MOI.",

Despite impressive advances in oncogene-directed therapeutics, genetic instability in cancer cells often manifest acquired resistance. This is particularly noted in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapies and not more evident than for chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.In this study, we used continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib (0.6\u22121 \u03bcM) to select imatinib-resistant K562 cells.Expression of BCR-ABL increased both at RNA and protein levels in imatinib-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) were increased significantly in resistant cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the SphK1 pathway and activating sphingosine-1-phosphate\u2212dependent tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that include the adaptor protein Crk. The partial inhibition of SphK1 activity by N,N-dimethylsphingosine or expression by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells and returned BCR-ABL to baseline levels. To determine the resistance mechanism-induced SphK1 upregulation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and observed robust downmodulation of SphK1 expression and activity when AKT2, but not AKT1 or AKT3, was suppressed.These results demonstrate that SphK1 is upregulated in imatinib-resistant K562 cells by a pathway contingent on a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT2/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. We propose that SphK1 plays an important role in development of acquired resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines.",

Mitochondrial pathology in MDS is suggested by abnormal mitochondrial iron accumulation, increased apoptosis, and a high frequency of acquired mitochondrial DNA mutations in bone marrow cells.Mitochondrial gene expression was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in CD34+ bone marrow cells from 37 patients with MDS (22 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 9 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [5\u22129% marrow blasts], 6 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [10\u221219% marrow blasts]), 14 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (acute myeloid leukemia-MDS), and 9 normal controls. Relative quantification was achieved by using specific plasmid standards and 18S ribosomal RNA. Genes were selected to represent the multi-enzyme complexes I to IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 3 (subunit of complex I), succinate dehydrogenase B (complex II), cytochrome B (complex III), and cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit I (complex IV).Expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes was significantly reduced in patients with MDS and acute myeloid leukemia-MDS compared to normal controls, while mitochondrial DNA copy number was increased rather than diminished. An age-related decrease in mitochondrial gene expression was observed in MDS patients as well as controls. However, this effect was less pronounced than the MDS-related effect. Besides an overall decrease in mitochondrial gene expression, MDS patients displayed a stochiometric imbalance of mitochondrial-encoded genes, assessed in relation to the nuclear-encoded succinate dehydrogenase B.Our results show dysregulated mitochondrial gene expression that goes beyond a simple age-related effect and is compatible with the putative role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MDS pathophysiology. However, it remains unclear whether the problem arises from primary lesions in the mitochondria, i.e., mitochondrial DNA mutations, or as a result of changes in the cell nucleus.",

When transferred into na\u00efve mice, they enhanced the anti-mouse platelet antibody response induced by subsequent immunization with rat platelets.

Cells were transduced with retroviral vector carrying either CXCR4 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) complementary DNA, and neo-resistant colonies were selected and used in experiments. Chemotaxis, invasion through Matrigel, motor activity, gene expression, osteodifferentiation potential, and engraftment into bone marrow of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice were analyzed for CXCR4-overexpressing cells and GFP-control cells.Approximately 90% of retrovirus-transduced AT-MSCs expressed CXCR4 or GFP and maintained their ability to differentiate into osteocytes. CXCR4-transduced AT-MSCs displayed enhanced migration and higher invasiveness toward SDF-1 gradient. The upregulation of CXCR4 led to phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein and AKT kinases and an increase in metalloproteinase expression after SDF-1 stimulation. The transplantation of CXCR4-transduced AT-MSCs into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice led to increased engraftment into bone marrow in comparison to GFP-transduced AT-MSCs.Adipose tissue is one of the alternative sources of MSCs to bone marrow. We showed that AT-MSCs overexpressing CXCR4 preserve their ability for osteodifferentiation. Enhanced migration and engraftment of the transduced AT-MSCs into bone marrow indicate the usefulness of this strategy in overcoming low engraftment of MSCs in clinical approaches of cellular therapies for bone disorders and can represent a powerful tool in regenerative medicine and gene therapies. Thus, these cells may be used as an alternative to bone marrow\u2212derived MSCs.",

Histone demethylases have recently been implicated in this process. However, it is unknown how histone demethylases function in the maintenance of self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).We profiled the expression of histone demethylase genes in mouse hematopoietic cells and listed genes preferentially expressed in HSCs. We analyzed the impact of a selected gene by transducing CD34\u2212c-Kit+Sca-1+lineage marker\u2212 (CD34\u2212KSL) HSCs using retroviral system followed by in\u00a0vitro methylcellulose colony assays and in\u00a0vivo competitive repopulation assays.We found that F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 10 (Fbxl10, also known as Jhdm1b or Kdm2b), is highly expressed in CD34\u2212KSL HSCs. Fbxl10 encodes a demethylase specific to the histone H3 mono/di-methylated at lysine 36 (H3K36me1/me2) and forms complexes with polycomb-group proteins, essential regulators of HSCs. Forced expression of Fbxl10 in HSCs expanded numbers of colony-forming cells with multilineage differentiation potential in culture and prevented exhaustion of the long-term repopulating potential of HSCs following serial transplantation. Fbxl10 tightly repressed the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes, including Ink4a, Ink4b, and Ink4c, through direct binding to their promoters and gene bodies and demethylation at H3K36. Increased levels of mono-ubiquitylation of H2A at target loci also suggested the collaboration of Fbxl10 with polycomb-group proteins.Our findings implicate Fbxl10 in the maintenance of self-renewal capacity of HSCs, thus highlight a role of histone demethylation for the first time in the epigenetic regulation of HSCs.",

Phenotypic changes, apoptosis, allogeneic stimulation, and I\u03baB\u03b1 expression levels in bortezomib-treated mature DCs or immature DCs were analyzed in vitro.Neither early bortezomib (day 0 BMT) administration in a modest (SC 1 \u00d7 107) or severe (SC 2 \u00d7 107) aGVHD model, nor delayed administration (day +6 BMT) could protect mice form aGVHD. Marked inhibition of aGVHD was observed in a mild aGVHD model (SC 5 \u00d7 106) with early intervention. This inhibition correlated with a relatively immature state of host DCs before intervention. Additional in vitro studies showed that, in comparison to mature DCs, bortezomib inhibited phenotypic and functional maturation as well as induced more potent apoptosis in immature DCs through suppression of nuclear factor\u2212\u03baB activity.Manipulating host immature DCs may represent a novel mechanism by which bortezomib improves aGVHD.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) either stays in quiescence or proliferates toward differentiation for the production of mature blood cells, or toward self-renewal for giving rise to itself. In order to both maintain a supply of mature blood cells and not exhaust HSCs throughout the lifetime of an individual, under steady state, most HSCs remain quiescent and only a small number enter the cell cycle. Quiescence of HSCs is not only critical for protecting the stem cell compartment and sustaining stem cell pools over long periods, but it is also critical for protecting stem cells by minimizing their accumulation of replication-associated mutations. The balance between quiescence and proliferation is tightly controlled by both HSC-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms. In recent years, through reductionistic strategies, a wide variety of molecules or pathways critical for HSC quiescence regulation have been identified. This regulation network involves both positive and negative regulators. Understanding quiescence regulation in HSC is of great importance not only for understanding the physiological foundation of HSCs, but also for understanding the\u00a0pathophysiological origins of many related disorders.

Considering the influences of TNF-\u03b1 on MMP-9 expression and activity, here we examined the effect of the A2bAR on the expression of MMP-9 and its potential dependency on TNF-\u03b1.We applied protein activity and mRNA analyses of MMP-9 in macrophages derived from A2bAR knockout (KO) and TNF-\u03b1 receptor KO mice. We employed guidewire-induced femoral artery injuries on A2bAR KO and control mice and analyzed by immunohistochemistry MMP-9 expression in the neointima area.MMP-9 activity is somewhat less in resident A2bAR KO macrophages compared with wild-type cells. However, MMP-9 is increased in activated macrophages from A2bAR KO when TNF-\u03b1 is further elevated, or in wild-type cells after TNF-\u03b1 treatment. In accordance, A2bAR activation downregulates MMP-9 expression in wild-type macrophages, which is ablated in TNF-\u03b1 receptor KO cells. A greater vascular lesion after femoral artery injury in A2bAR KO mice is associated with elevated TNF-\u03b1 levels and augmented MMP-9, compared to control mice.Ablation of the A2bAR in activated macrophages increases MMP-9. A2bAR activation reduces MMP-9 expression, which depends on TNF-\u03b1 and could contribute to the protective role of A2bAR in a vascular injury model.",

However, transcription factors operate in a combinatorial fashion suggesting that integrated analysis of genome-wide maps for multiple transcription factors will be essential to fully exploit these new genome-scale data sets.Here we have generated a compendium that integrates 53 ChIP-Seq studies covering 30 factors across all major hematopoietic lineages with a total of 754,380 binding peaks. We also used transgenic mouse assays to validate a newly predicted transcriptional enhancer.Integrated analysis of all 53 ChIP-Seq studies demonstrated that cell-type identity exerts a larger influence on global transcription factor binding patterns than the nature of the individual transcription factors. Furthermore, regions highlighted by multifactor binding within specific gene loci overlap with known regulatory elements and also provide a useful guide for identifying novel elements, as demonstrated by transgenic analysis of a previously unrecognized enhancer in the Maml3 gene locus.The ChIP-Seq compendium described here provides a valuable resource for the wider research community by accelerating the discovery of transcriptional mechanisms operating in the hematopoietic system.",

In humans, the presence of an acquired recurrent mutation within the JAK2 gene has recently been identified in 90% of the patients with polycythemia vera. This mutation (V617F) is located in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2, leading to constitutive activation of the kinase responsible for the polycythemia. Detection of the mutation has now become a major diagnostic tool in humans for polycythemia vera diagnosis. As the canine JAK2 gene shares strong homology with its human counterpart, we looked for the presence of JAK2 mutations in dogs with an elevated hematocrit.Direct sequencing of the JAK2 exon 14 was performed on DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of five dogs suspected of primary polycythemia. Mutant subclones were expressed in interleukin-3\u2212dependent BaF3 cells and tested for cytokine independency.One dog presented with a three-base change in codons 617 and 618 of JAK2 giving rise to V617F and C618L mutations. By polymerase chain reaction product subcloning, we demonstrated the coexistence of the wild-type sequence and a triple mutant sequence, while DNA from buccal swab contained the wild-type sequence only. Transfection of BaF3 cells with the triple mutant cDNA, but not with the wild-type complementary DNA, resulted in cytokine-independent growth and constitutive signal transducer and activation of transcription 5 phosphorylation.Identical mutations of the JAK2 gene occur in humans and dogs, giving rise to a constitutively active JAK2 kinase, suggesting a common mechanism for human and canine diseases.

The prognostic value of the expression of these genes was analyzed in two independent series of newly diagnosed patients.ADAM28 and ADAMTS6 were overexpressed in normal memory B cells, ADAM10 and ADAM19 in plasmablasts, and TIMP1 and TIMP2 in normal bone marrow plasma cells. ADAMTS9 was aberrantly expressed by primary malignant plasma cells and ADAM23 expression was associated with a bad prognosis, its expression being spiked in some primary myeloma cell samples.

Interaction of Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) with the Y-box motif of the mdr1 gene promoters was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The effects of YB-1 on mdr1 promoter activity were examined by luciferase assay. After silencing of YB-1 gene by shRNA, the role of YB-1 nuclear translocation in the formation of induced MDR was examined. Expression of mdr1 and YB-1 was examined further after Daudi cells were pretreated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD98059 for 1 hour.Doxorubicin-resistant sublines was generated from the Daudi cell line by stepwise selection in doxorubicin. We found that acquisition of MDR is associated with enhanced YB-1 nuclear translocation and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that doxorubicin increased binding of YB-1 to the Y-box of mdr1 promoter. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the Y-box region is essential for YB-1 regulation of mdr1 expression. The introduction of exogenous YB-1 shRNA into Daudi cells resulted in decreased levels of the expression of mdr1 gene and P-glycoprotein induced by doxorubicin. When Daudi cells were pretreated with MAPK inhibitor PD98059, the phosphorylation of ERK was effectively inhibited as well as the nuclear translocation of YB-1 and the expression of mdr1 gene.Doxorubicin can increase expression of mdr1/P-glycoprotein through activating MAPK/ERK transduction pathway, then increasing expression of YB-1, inducing YB-1 nuclear translocation, and enhancing DNA-binding activity of YB-1.",

The exact mechanism of megakaryocyte development from HSC is unknown, but growth factors such as thrombopoietin have been identified as critical. Additionally, it has been suggested that the chemokine CXCL12/stromal-cell derived factor-1\u03b1 has a role in regulating megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. We recently reported the importance of the extracellular protease CD26 (dipeptidylpeptidase IV) in regulating HSC responses to CXCL12, as well as modulating HSC trafficking into and out of the bone marrow. However, the importance of CD26 for megakaryopoiesis has not been reported. We therefore compared megakaryocyte development between CD26-deficient (CD26\u2212/\u2212) mice and C57BL/6 control mice.Adult CD26\u2212/\u2212 mice and C57BL/6 control mice were evaluated using blood differentials, histological analysis, flow cytometric analysis, and progenitor colony assays.Bone marrow from CD26\u2212/\u2212 mice has a significantly expanded megakaryocyte and megakaryocyte progenitor population compared to control C57BL/6 mice bone marrow.Our results indicate that endogenous CD26 normally suppresses megakaryopoiesis and that loss of CD26 activity results in expansion of the megakaryocyte progenitor population in vivo. This suggests the potential use of CD26 inhibitors to improve megakaryocyte progenitor function and/or reconstitution of the megakaryocyte cell population.",

     "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2 (PDGFRA, PDGFRB) are frequently expressed on hematopoietic cells and regulate cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, and transformation. Stimulation by autocrine loops or activation by chromosomal translocation makes them important factors in development of hematopoietic disorders. Interaction with the ligand PDGF results in activation of the tyrosine kinase domain and phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, thereby creating binding sites for molecules containing Src homology 2 domains. We hypothesized that one such protein may be Lnk, a negative regulator of cytokine receptors, including Mpl, EpoR, c-Kit, and c-Fms.Interaction of Lnk with PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or leukemogenic FIP1L1-PDGFRA or TEL-PDGFRB was studied in cotransfected 293T cells. Effects of Lnk on PDGFR signaling were shown in 293T and NIH3T3 cells, whereas its influence on either PDGF-dependent or factor-independent growth was investigated using Ba/F3 or 32D cells expressing wild-type PDGFR, FIP1L1-PDGFRA, or TEL-PDGFRB.We show that Lnk binds to PDGFR after exposure of cells to PDGF. Furthermore, Lnk can bind the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein. Mutation or deletion of the Lnk Src homology 2 domain completely abolished binding of Lnk to FIP1L1-PDGFRA, but just partly prevented binding to PDGFRA or PDGFRB. Expression of Lnk inhibited proliferation of PDGF-dependent Ba/F3 cells and diminished phosphorylation of Erk in PDGF-treated NIH3T3. 32D cells transformed by either FIP1L1-PDGFRA or TEL-PDGFRB stopped growing when Lnk was expressed.Lnk is a negative regulator of PDGFR signaling. Development of Lnk mimetic drugs might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for myeloproliferative disorders.",

     "abstract": "The past 20 years of experience with umbilical cord blood transplantation have demonstrated that cord blood is effective in the treatment of a spectrum of diseases, including hematological malignancies, bone marrow failure, hemoglobinopathies, and inborn errors of metabolism. Cord blood can be obtained with ease and then safely cryopreserved for either public or private use without loss of viability. As compared to other unrelated donor cell sources, cord blood transplantation allows for greater human leukocyte antigen disparity without a corresponding increase in graft-vs.-host disease. Moreover, cord blood has a lower risk of transmitting infections by latent viruses and is less likely to carry somatic mutations than other adult cells. Recently, multiple populations of stem cells with primitive stem cell properties have been identified from cord blood. Meanwhile, there is an increasing interest in applying cord blood mononuclear cells or enriched stem cell populations to regenerative therapies. Accumulating evidence has suggested functional improvements after cord blood transplantation in various animal models for treatments of cardiac infarction, diabetes, neurological diseases, etc. In this review, we will summarize the most recent updates on clinical applications of cord blood transplantation and the promises and limitations of cell-based therapies for tissue repair and regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Clastogenic injury of the erythroid lineage results in anemia, reticulocytopenia, and transient appearance of micronucleated reticulocytes. However, the micronucleated reticulocyte dose-response in murine models is only linear to 2 Gy total body irradiation and paradoxically decreases at higher exposures, suggesting complex radiation effects on erythroid intermediates. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the kinetics and apoptotic response of the erythron to sublethal radiation injury.We analyzed the response to 1 and 4 Gy total body irradiation of erythroid progenitors and precursors using colony assays and imaging flow cytometry, respectively. We also investigated cell cycling and apoptotic gene expression of the steady-state erythron.After 1 Gy total body irradiation, erythroid progenitors and precursors were partially depleted. In contrast, essentially all bone marrow erythroid progenitors and precursors were lost within 2 days after 4 Gy irradiation. Imaging flow cytometry analysis revealed preferential loss of phenotypic erythroid colony-forming units and proerythroblasts immediately after sublethal irradiation. Furthermore, these populations underwent radiation-induced apoptosis, without changes in steady-state cellular proliferation, at much higher frequencies than later-stage erythroid precursors. Primary erythroid precursor maturation is associated with marked Bcl-xL upregulation and Bax and Bid downregulation.Micronucleated reticulocyte loss after higher sublethal radiation exposures results from rapid depletion of erythroid progenitors and precursors. This injury reveals that erythroid colony-forming units and proerythroblasts constitute a particularly proapoptotic compartment within the erythron. We conclude that the functional transition of primary proerythroblasts to later-stage erythroid precursors is characterized by a shift from a proapoptotic to an antiapoptotic phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Hydroxyurea has proven laboratory and clinical therapeutic benefits for sickle cell anemia and other diseases, yet many questions remain about its in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Previous reports suggest that hydroxyurea passively diffuses across cells, but its observed rapid absorption and distribution are more consistent with facilitated or active transport. We investigated the potential role of solute carrier (SLC) transporters in cellular uptake and accumulation of hydroxyurea.Passive diffusion of hydroxyurea across cell membranes was determined using the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. SLC transporter screens were conducted using in vitro intracellular drug accumulation and transcellular transport assays in cell lines and oocytes overexpressing SLC transporters. Gene expression of SLC transporters was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in human tissues and cell lines.Hydroxyurea had minimal diffusion across a lipid bilayer but was a substrate for five different SLC transporters belonging to the organic cation/carnitine transporters and organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) families of transporters and urea transporters A and B. Further characterization of hydroxyurea transport revealed that cellular uptake by OATP1B3 is time- and temperature-dependent and inhibited by known substrates of OATP1B3. Urea transporters A and B are expressed differentially in human tissues and erythroid cells, and transport hydroxyurea bidirectionally via facilitated diffusion.These studies provide new insight into drug transport proteins that may be involved in the in vivo absorption, cellular distribution, and elimination of hydroxyurea. Elucidation of hydroxyurea transcellular movement should improve our understanding of its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and may help explain some of the interpatient drug variability observed in patients with sickle cell anemia.",

In T-ALL cells, mTOR blockade was associated with accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, which preferentially adopted a nuclear localization. Functional studies using rapamycin or CCI-779 showed a dominant inhibitory effect of mTOR blockade on interleukin-7\u2212induced proliferation, survival, and cell-cycle progression of T-ALL cells. Furthermore, mTOR blockade markedly potentiated the antileukemia effects of dexamethasone and doxorubicin, and showed highly synergistic interactions in combination with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Janus kinase 3 signaling.This study shows activation of mTOR signaling in primary T-ALL cells evolving in the leukemic bone marrow, and supports the inclusion of mTOR antagonists in current therapeutic regimens for this cancer.",

This resistance was reversible by the Flt3-ITD inhibitor sorafenib. The Flt3-ITD did not affect DNA damage levels after treatment, but was associated with increased levels of p53. The p53 response was critical to the observed changes as the Flt3-ITD had no effect on chemotherapy response in the setting of p53 null AML. In vivo, the Flt3-ITD accelerated engraftment that was partially reversible by Ara-C but not doxorubicin. Additionally, Ara-C provided a significant reduction in disease burden and a survival advantage that was not increased by the addition of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin alone led to only minimal disease reduction and no survival benefit.These data demonstrate that the Flt3-ITD confers sensitivity to Ara-C, but resistance to doxorubicin in a manner that depends on p53.

In this study, we evaluated if the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis may be involved in the apoptosis and clearance of platelets in human ITP.Using flow cytometry, we characterized whether expression of CD47 on fresh and in vitro\u2013aged platelets- and of SIRP\u03b1 receptor on CD14-derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, circulating DCs, and monocytes is reduced is ITP; whether the in vitro platelet phagocytic capacity of CD14-derived DCs and macrophages is differentially modulated in the presence or absence of antibodies against CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 in ITP; and whether platelets are more susceptible to the CD47-induced death signal in ITP.We demonstrated that low platelet count in ITP is not due to increased phagocytosis associated with decreased expression of CD47 on the platelet surface and, despite reduced SIRP\u03b1 expression, blockage of SIRP\u03b1 on immature CD14-derived DCs or CD47 on platelets by specific antibodies failed to modify platelet uptake/phagocytosis of DCs. In contrast, targeting platelet CD47 with specific antibody significantly increases platelet phagocytosis of CD14-derived macrophages, and platelets are not healthy because they show increased apoptosis and are resistant to CD47-induced death signal.Our results demonstrate that the CD47 pathway in ITP patients abnormally modulates platelet homeostasis.",

The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1\u03b1 and -2\u03b1 were measured by immunoblotting.In nonirradiated mice, continuous captopril administration in the water transiently reduced reticulocytes and red blood cells after 7 and 10 days, respectively. EPO plasma levels and gene expression were reduced below detectable limits after 2 days of captopril treatment, but recovered within 7 days. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 were activated preceding reticulocyte and red blood cell recovery. TBI, which ablates early and late-stage erythroid progenitors, activated both HIFs and increased EPO and TPO. Captopril treatment postirradiation suppressed radiation-induced HIF activation and EPO expression. In contrast, captopril administration for 7 days before TBI resulted in earlier EPO induction and activation. Captopril treatment lowered TPO levels in nonirradiated mice, but had minimal effects on radiation-induced TPO.In nonirradiated mice, captopril biphasically regulates EPO via HIF activation. TBI ablates erythroid progenitors, resulting in hypoxia, HIF activation, and increased EPO expression that are modulated by captopril treatment.

Differential expressions of Bcl-2 members were observed in those samples and BIM was further investigated using gene silencing technology in representative cell line Sup-B15.The proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member BIM was upregulated only in PRED-sensitive cells. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that BIM expression was highly predictive of PRED response (area under the curve = 0.81; p = 0.032) in paired patient bone marrow samples and is, most excitingly, independent of molecular subtype. Patients whose BIM protein expression levels fail to upregulate at day 8 compared to day 0 (D8/D0 ratio <0.93) have significantly poorer event-free survival (60%) than those patients whose BIM protein expression levels did upregulate (92%).

Here we explored phenotypic and functional differences between these cells.Global-wide and TRAP (Acp5) promoter messenger RNA expression, ability for phagocytosis, macrophage colony-stimulating factor\u2013dependent migration, and in situ localization of these cells were investigated.Gene expression of PT-adherent cells was skewed toward expression of innate immune response, phagocytosis, and scavenger receptor genes. They avidly phagocytosed Staphylococcus aureus and Dextran particles, and their migration on PT was enhanced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In contrast, OPN-adherent cells lacked ability to phagocytose particles and their migration on OPN was inhibited by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. They expressed typical osteoclast proteases implicated in bone matrix degradation, such as the collagenases cathepsin K; matrix metalloprotease-2; -9; -13; and -14, consistent with their high bone resorptive activity in vitro. In addition, OPN-adherent cells predominantly expressed the PU.1/MiTF/NFATc1-driven TRAP exon 1C messenger RNA, whereas PT-adherent cells preferably expressed TRAP exon 1B messenger RNA. Furthermore, CD163/cathepsin-K immunohistochemistry demonstrated that PT-adherent cells were predominantly located in the diaphyseal bone marrow compartment, whereas the OPN-adherent cells were attached to cortical and distal metaphyseal trabecular bone surfaces.This study identifies differences in expression of several osteoclast and macrophage genes, as well as functional differences between PT- and OPN-adherent cells. We conclude that the OPN-adherent cells display osteoclast characteristics, especially with regard to expression of matrix-degrading enzymes, whereas the PT-adherent cell might represent a unique TRAP-positive multinucleated bone marrow macrophage implicated in immune recognition and phagocytosis.",

Cell-cycle analysis revealed that spleen HSCs cycle twice as frequently as do BM HSCs, suggesting that G0 phase length is longer in BM HSCs than in spleen HSCs. The cycling difference between BM and spleen HSCs was also observed in mice that had been reconstituted with BM or spleen cells, suggesting that HSC quiescence is regulated in an organ-specific manner.Spleen HSCs and BM HSCs are functionally similar, but their cycling behaviors differ.",

Clonogenic and migration assays in vitro, as well as xenotransplant experiments in vivo, were performed to evaluate the effects of ATP on hMSCs proliferation and BM homing. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess hMSCs cytokines production, whereas T-cell cultures demonstrated the immunoregulatory activity of ATP-treated hMSCs.hMSCs were resistant to the cytotoxic effects of ATP, as demonstrated by the lack of morphological and mitochondrial changes or release of intracellular markers of cell death. Gene expression profiling revealed that ATP-stimulated hMSCs underwent a downregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, whereas those involved in cell migration were strongly upregulated. The inhibitory activity of ATP on hMSCs proliferation was confirmed by assessing clonogenic stromal progenitors. ATP potentiated the chemotactic response of hMSCs to the chemokine CXCL12, and increased their spontaneous migration. In vivo, the homing capacity of hMSCs to the BM of immunodeficient mice was significantly increased by pretreatment with ATP. Moreover, ATP increased the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-2, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-12p70, while decreasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, and this finding was associated with the reduced ability of MSCs to inhibit T-cell proliferation.Our data show that purinergic signaling modulates hMSCs functions and highlights a role for extracellular nucleotides in hMSCs biology.",

Our goal in this study was to determine whether mobilization can be induced by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 in mice lacking CD26 (CD26\u2212/\u2212).Ten week old CD26\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 mice received a subcutaneous injection of AMD3100.

Stem cell transplants are often the only curative treatment in some cancer patients. The ability to perform the transplantation and its success is dependent on the ability to mobilize adequate numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The use of AMD3100 as a single agent would give patients or donors an additional option for a successful stem cell transplant.",

A wealth of information on the role played by transcription factors in myeloid biology has contributed to our understanding of both normal and abnormal neutrophil development.

Colony-forming cell assays, CXCL12 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses were used to determine stem or progenitor cell mobilization by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation, binding assays, and chemotactic assays were employed to determine if annexin-2 is associated with CXCL12. Degradation assays were also used to determine if annexin-2 and CXCL12 protect each other from proteolytic degradation.Anxa2\u2212/\u2212 animals had fewer HSCs in their marrow, and the HSCs in anxa2\u2212/\u2212 animals express less CXCR4 and CXCR7, suggesting a cell intrinsic defect. Transplantation studies of wild-type marrow into anxa2\u2212/\u2212 animals demonstrated a cell-extrinsic defect in the anxa2\u2212/\u2212 animals. CXCL12 binds directly to annexin-2, and this interaction facilitates presentation of CXCL12 to HSCs. Yet the binding of CXCL12 to annexin-2 did not protect CXCL12 from proteolytic cleavage after stem or progenitor cell mobilization by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.These results suggest that annexin-2 serves as an anchor for CXCL12 to help in the localization of HSCs to the niche.",

Overexpression of miR-146a in hematopoietic stem cells, followed by bone marrow transplantation, resulted in a transient myeloid expansion, decreased erythropoiesis, and impaired lymphopoiesis in select anatomical locations. Enforced expression of miR-146a also impaired bone marrow reconstitution in recipient mice and reduced survival of hematopoietic stem cells.Our results indicate that miR-146a, an LPS-induced miRNA, regulates multiple aspects of hematopoietic differentiation and survival.

To elucidate the role of LR in leukemia cells, we studied the relationship between the phenotype of leukemia cells and LR expression.The relationship between clinical features of acute myeloid leukemia and expression of LR was examined. LR was overexpressed or suppressed by the introduction of complementary DNA or small interfering RNA for LR in a human leukemia cell line to test the effect of LR on the phenotype of leukemia. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (GM-CSFR) was also tested in leukemia cells, including clinical samples.Expression of LR was significantly related to elevation of white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and survival among acute myeloid leukemia patients. Forced expression of LR enhanced proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and antiapoptosis of leukemia cells associated with phosphorylation of a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, in the absence of stimulation by laminin. On the other hand, suppression of LR expression had the opposite effects. The number of GM-CSFR increased in leukemia cells overexpressing LR, and there was a significant relationship between the expression of LR and GM-CSFR in acute myeloid leukemia samples.These results suggest that LR expression influenced the characteristics of leukemia cells toward an aggressive phenotype and increased the number of GM-CSFR. These changes might be partly related to enhanced GM-CSF signaling.",

Gene expression alterations in CD45+ cells invading the liver were examined by polymerase chain reaction arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (including polymerase chain reaction arrays) analysis of selected genes.Liver chemokine receptors (Ccr1, Ccr2, Ccr5, and others) were expressed in cells invading the liver. The expression level of Ccr1 was increased 149-fold in comparison with CD45+ cells derived from the livers of healthy mice. Expression levels of several genes responsible for proliferation and self-renewal were elevated dramatically, which is in accordance with a high concentration of leukemia stem cells in the livers of moribund animals. The nuclear factor\u2212\u03baB signaling pathway and several oncogenes are also activated in these leukemia cells.Overexpression of liver-specific cytokine receptors allowed the leukemic cells to invade the liver.

AML0 and AML3 display the lowest amounts of hTERT transcripts, and ALL and AML cells with cytogenetic abnormalities possess the shortest telomeres. hTERT expression includes phenotype-specific RNA maturation and correlates with TA but not with TL. A wide ratio of TA to hTERT expression between leukemia subtypes suggests phenotype-specific hTERT post-transcriptional deregulations. B- and T-ALL overexpress Ku70 and Pinx1, T-ALL PTOP and RAP1, and B-ALL TRF2, the expression of which is significantly higher in cases with abnormal karyotype. hTERT transcription and TL correlate with response to intensive chemotherapy, and hTERT and RAD50 are independent prognostic factors for survival.Each leukemia subtype possesses specific telomere dysregulations that rely on phenotype, karyotype, response to treatment, and survival.",

In addition, AMSCs expressed a high level of Jagged-1, which induced activation of Notch signaling in T lymphocytes, thus reducing NF-\u03baB activity. Anti\u2212Jagged-1 neutralizing antibody and N [N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester could reverse this trend.Human AMSCs facilitate the immunosuppressive effect of CsA on T lymphocytes through Jagged-1/Notch-related inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling. The combination of AMSCs and CsA represents a rationale therapeutic approach aimed to prevent adverse effects of CsA while maintaining its adequate immunosuppressive effect.

Systemic treatment with steroids has been the mainstay of first-line therapy of aGVHD, although controlled experimental data in this context are limited.Using a haploidentical murine BMT model, steroid effects on hepatic and intestinal inflammation during aGVHD have been investigated. Lethally irradiated B6D2F1 mice received bone marrow cells and splenocytes from either syngeneic (B6D2F1) or allogeneic (C57BL/6) donors.Intraperitoneal administration of prednisolone (2 mg/kg body weight every day) early after onset of GVHD from day +10 until day +42 resulted in reduced clinical GVHD severity and improved survival of allogeneic recipients. Although the liver was barely affected by prednisolone treatment, aGVHD-related histopathologic injury of the gastrointestinal tract was strongly reduced in association with diminished expression of interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor, CXCL 9-11, CCL2-3, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule\u22121, and intercellular adhesion molecule\u22121. Prednisolone-induced reduction of adhesion molecule expression in the gut manifested earlier than seen for cytokines or chemokines. Interestingly, when starting steroid treatment on day +28, the course of GVHD was unchanged and no major differences in cyto- or chemokine expression in gastrointestinal tract or liver on day +42 were seen.When started early after GVHD onset, prednisolone-related beneficial effects can affect aGVHD target organs differently, involving divergent regulation of inflammation and leukocyte migration. Specifically, a change in adhesion properties between leukocytes and endothelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract may be one of the initial steps in a cascade of steroid-related aGVHD-attenuating events.",

In the spleen, large AML cell clusters were only recovered after ALDHbright, CD34+, or PKHbright cell transfer. Importantly, in secondary long-term in vitro cultures, quite exclusively CD34+ AML mononuclear cells survived and expanded.Separation of ALDHbright, CD34+, or PKHbright cells enriches for AML long-term surviving capacity, which reside in the CD34+ subpopulation, as rather exclusively CD34+ cells survived and expanded in vivo and ex vivo. Long-term survival capacity may be supported by CD44v7 expression.",

     "abstract": "The SH2-containing inositol-5\u2032-phosphatase, SHIP (or SHIP1), is a hematopoietic-restricted phosphatidylinositide phosphatase that translocates to the plasma membrane after extracellular stimulation and hydrolyzes the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-generated second messenger PI-3,4,5-P3 to PI-3,4-P2. As a result, SHIP dampens down PI-3,4,5-P3-mediated signaling and represses the proliferation, differentiation, survival, activation, and migration of hematopoietic cells. There are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that SHIP may act as a tumor suppressor during leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis. Because of its ability to skew macrophage progenitors toward M1 macrophages and na\u00efve T cells toward T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells, SHIP may play a critical role in activating the immune system to eradicate solid tumors. In this review, we will discuss the role of SHIP in hematopoietic cells and its therapeutic potential in terms of suppressing leukemias and lymphomas and manipulating the immune system to combat cancer.",

To investigate the hypothesis that drugs that inhibit JAK2 have therapeutic potential, we developed a small molecule inhibitor, SGI-1252, that targets the adenosine triphosphate-binding and solvent pocket of the protein.Established cells lines each expressing different JAK2V617F copy numbers, a cell line transfected with wild-type and mutant JAK2, ex vivo expanded erythroid progenitor cells from patients with MPNs, and a murine xenograft model were used to characterize the activity of SGI-1252.In vitro studies showed that SGI-1252 potently inhibits the kinase activity of wild-type JAK2, JAK2V617F and JAK1, but not JAK3. SGI-1252 blocked phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, a downstream target of JAK2 and inhibited expression of the JAK2-dependent antiapoptotic gene BCL-XL. Additional studies confirmed induction of apoptosis in JAK2V617F-positive cell lines by SGI-1252. Moreover, cell lines transfected with either wild-type JAK2 or JAK2V617F were equally susceptible to the antiproliferative effects of SGI-1252 and the antiproliferative activity of SGI-1252 toward ex vivo\u2212expanded erythroid progenitors from patients with polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis appeared independent of the JAK2V617F allele burden.

Normal LSK cells were then cultured under different conditions (varying EPO levels, oxygen concentrations, and BM supernatants) to investigate the causes of the HSC responses.Hypoxic mice exhibited a marked expansion in BM and spleen LSK compartments, which were associated with enhanced proliferation. BM HSCs seemed to play a more important role in erythropoiesis at high altitude than spleen HSCs. There was also a lineage fate change of BM HSCs in hypoxic mice that was manifested in increased megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors and periodically reduced granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the BM. The LSK cells in hypoxic mice displayed upregulated erythroid-specific GATA-1 and downregulated granulocyte-macrophage\u2013specific PU.1 messenger RNA expression, as well as the capacity to differentiate into more erythroid precursors after culture. BM culture supernatant from hypoxic mice (but not elevated EPO or varying O2 tension) could induce expansion and erythroid-priority differentiation of the HSC population, a phenomenon partially caused by increasing interleukin-3 and interleukin-6 secretion in the BM.The present study suggests a new EPO-independent HSC mechanism of high-altitude erythrocytosis.",

We tested the SeV/\u0394P vector expressing the HoxB4 gene (SeV/\u0394P/HoxB4) for the ex vivo expansion of human cord blood CD34+ cells (HSCs) using a sheep in utero transplantation assay.Human HSCs were ex vivo\u2212expanded by transduction with SeV/\u0394P/HoxB4 vector and transplanted into the abdominal cavity of fetal sheep. The engraftment of human HSCs in the lambs was quantitatively evaluated by hematopoietic colony-forming unit assays.After transplantation, the HoxB4-transduced HSCs contributed to longer-period (up to 20 months) repopulation in sheep, and human hematopoietic progenitors were detected more frequently in the bone marrow of the HoxB4 group as compared with the control untreated group (p < 0.05). The expansion of human HSCs with the SeV/\u0394P/HoxB4 vector was comparable with previously reported retroviral vectors expressing HoxB4. The SeV/\u0394P/HoxB4 vector and the transgene were cleared from the recipient sheep and leukemia was not detected at 20 months post-transplantation.The SeV/\u0394P vector would be suitable for transient expression of HoxB4 in human CD34+ cells.

A transcriptional analysis by microarray was also performed to identify genes specifically modulated by ZOL in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. Finally, we show an additive effect of arsenic trioxide on apoptosis when used in combination with ZOL.Our in vitro data suggest that the use of ZOL at appropriate doses could be explored clinically in bortezomib-resistant MM patients and combined with arsenic trioxide to increase its proapoptotic effect.",

     "abstract": "In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), increased cellular turnover of hematopoietic cells driven by the oncogene BCR-ABL leads to accelerated telomere shortening despite increased telomerase activity. It has been postulated that shortened telomeres, particularly in the context of increased telomerase activity, might facilitate accumulation of genetic aberrations and, consequently, disease progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase and blast crisis. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase might be a promising approach in CML therapy.To investigate the therapeutic potential of telomerase inhibition in this model disorder, we used a small molecule telomerase inhibitor, BIBR1532 as well as expression of a dominant-negative mutant of hTERT (DNhTERT-IRES-GFP) in the p53-negative CML blast crisis cell line K562 and characterized the effects in long-term culture. Furthermore, we expressed an inducible p53 construct (vector pBabe-p53ERtam) via retroviral transduction in cells with critically short telomeres and in cells with a normal telomere length to explain the role of the tumor suppressor in response to critical telomere shortening in BCR-ABL\u2013positive cells.BIBR1532-treated bulk cultures did not show altered growth kinetics despite significant telomere shortening to a critical length of approximately 5 kb. In comparison, DNhTERT-expressing clones either lost telomere length, leading to a significant but transient slow down in proliferation but eventually all escaped senescence/crisis (group I) or, alternatively, remained virtually unaffected despite measurable telomerase inhibition (group II). Further analyses of group I clones revealed impaired DNA damage response and an accumulation of dicentric chromosomes. However, upon restoration of p53 in telomerase-negative K562 clones with critically short telomeres, immediate reinduction of apoptosis and complete eradication of cells was observed, whereas vector control cells continued to escape from crisis.These results suggest that the success of strategies aimed at telomerase inhibition in CML is highly dependent on the presence of functional p53 and should be explored preferentially in chronic phase CML.",

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine how binding of associating proteins compare across Hoxa9 and Meis1 in cell lines with and without MLL fusion proteins and how binding is altered during gene down-regulation and differentiation.Consistent with earlier purifications of ENL and AF4 from 293 cells, the 90 amino acid C\u2212terminal domain of AF9 associates with many other MLL translocation partners including Enl, Af4, Laf4, Af5q31, Ell, and Af10. This complex, termed elongation assisting proteins (EAPs), also contains the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase Cdk9/Cyclin T1/T2 (pTEFb) and the histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L. Myeloid cells transformed by MLL fusions show higher levels and a broader distribution of EAP components at genes critical for leukemia. Inhibition of EAP components pTEFb and Dot1l show that both contribute significantly to activation of Hoxa9 and Meis1 expression. EAP is dynamically associated with the Hoxa9 and Meis1 loci in hematopoietic cells and rapidly dissociates during induction of differentiation. In the presence of MLL fusion proteins, its dissociation is prevented.The findings suggest that MLL fusion proteins deregulate genes critical for leukemia by excessive recruitment and impaired dissociation of EAP from target loci.",

One of the genetic alterations within CEBPA (c.1175_1180dup; p.P194_H195dup) was later suggested to represent an inherited polymorphism. As this is not a simple single nucleotide polymorphism, but a six-base pair insertion that leads to a two amino acid elongation of the protein, functional implications cannot be excluded.We analyzed 1135 AML patients from selected cytogenetic subgroups for CEBPA mutations.Besides acquired CEBPA mutation in 76 cases (6.7%), we detected the p.P194_H195dup polymorphism in 61 of 1135 AML cases (5.4%). In healthy controls, p.P194_H195dup was detected in a comparable frequency (10 of 187; 5.3%) and therefore is unlikely to be predisposing for AML. More detailed analysis (taking French-American-British classification subtype, cytogenetics, and etiology into account) showed no preference for the p.P194_H195dup for any subgroup. Prognosis of the AML with p.P194_H195dup was comparable with AML without\u00a0CEBPAmut. In this primary cohort, we never detected coincidence of the p.P194_H195dup and a CEBPA mutation in the same AML patient.

The p.P194_H195dup was again associated with unmutated CEBPA alleles.These results further confirm that the p.P194_H195dup is a polymorphism and illustrate the difficulties that can arise in the differentiation of genetic polymorphisms from\u00a0malignancy-inducing alterations.",

The JAK2 V617F CD34+ progenitor and neutrophil allele burdens were measured using an allele-specific, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.After adjusting for genotype, sex, age at diagnosis, and disease duration, disease type was the strongest predictor of clonal dominance, with the odds ratio being nearly 61.9 times higher for MF patients when compared with ET patients (p < 0.001), and 9.7 times higher when compared with PV patients (p = 0.002). Additionally, clonal dominance was associated with a clinical phenotype of an increased spleen size (p = 0.006), increased white blood cell count (p = 0.009), and lower hemoglobin (p < 0.001), even after adjusting for disease type and duration.These data indicate that loss of wild-type clones at the progenitor level is a feature of MF (primary MF, post-ET MF, and post-PV MF), presumably due to expansion of the JAK2 V617F clone and that this characteristic is surprisingly independent of JAK2 V617F homozygosity, suggesting that additional genomic lesions may contribute to this unique molecular process that distinguishes MF from ET and PV.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the immune cell function by phosphoprotein profiling in CML patients.Blood samples from diagnostic phase and TKI-treated patients were analyzed by multicolor phosphoprotein flow cytometry enabling measurements at the single-cell level. Both unstimulated baseline activation status and cytokine-induced responses were evaluated.In diagnostic-phase and imatinib-treated patients, the baseline phosphoprotein activation status was similar to healthy controls. In dasatinib-treated patients, basal phosphoprotein levels were slightly decreased; in particular, the signal transduction and activator of transcription protein 3 pathway was affected in both myeloid and lymphoid cells. The activation responses to various cytokines, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in particular were significantly suppressed in untreated CML patients. During imatinib and dasatinib therapy, the aberrantly suppressed phosphorylation responses were normalized.Cytokine responses are hampered in untreated CML patients, which may have an effect on various immunological processes in vivo. Interestingly, during TKI treatment, phosphorylation responses were normal, suggesting that TKI treatment does not alter the reactivity of healthy immune effector cells.

The absolute numbers of circulating VSELs and hematopoietic stem cells in STEMI correlated negatively with patient age.Myocardial ischemia mobilizes primitive PSCs including pluripotent VSELs into the circulation.

Conversely, inhibition of Cdc25A resulted in decreased proliferation, reduced expression of activation markers, and upregulation of the lymph node homing molecule, CD62L, which promoted cell adhesion when engaged by ligand. We found that IL-7 prevented the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Foxo1, in a manner dependent on the activity of Cdc25A, resulting in decreased levels of CD62L. In vivo administration of IL-7 decreased lymph node cellularity, while treatment with IL-7, premixed with a neutralizing IL-7 antibody (M25), increased total lymph node cells\u2014with more nuclear Foxo1 detected in cells from mice receiving IL-7 + M25.These results are consistent with the model that IL-7 drives Cdc25A-mediated T-cell proliferation, which prevents the nuclear translocation of Foxo1, leading to reduced expression of CD62L and the migration of T cells into circulation.",

Thymic infection by HIV-1 is known to disrupt thymocyte maturation by both direct and indirect means; however, the mechanism behind these effects remains poorly defined. Macrophages represent one of the most important peripheral targets of HIV-1 infection, are resident in the thymic stroma, and play a central role in thymocyte maturation.Studies presented here define three primary features and outcomes of thymic macrophages (TM) and HIV-1 infection: (1) The distinctive TM phenotype (surface markers and cytokine production measured by immunofluorescence, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) relative to macrophages from other sources (blood [monocyte-derived macrophages] and bone marrow); (2) infection of TM by different HIV-1 subtypes (X4, R5, and X4/R5) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction; and (3) consequences of HIV-1 infection on cytokine production by TM measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.The results demonstrate that TM display a distinctive phenotype of HIV-1 receptors (CD4lo, CXCR4lo, CCR5med, CCR3hi), chemokine production (macrophage inflammatory protein\u22121\u03b1+; regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted+; macrophage inflammatory protein\u22121b\u2212; stromal cell\u2212derived factor -1\u2212); and cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor\u2212\u03b1+, interleukin-8+, macrophage colony-stimulating factor+, interleukin-6\u2212) relative to either monocyte-derived macrophages or bone marrow. TM were infected in vitro with R5 and X4/R5-tropic HIV-1 subtypes, and developed syncytia formation during long-term X4/R5 culture. In contrast, TM supported only transient replication of X4-tropic HIV-1. Lastly, infection of TM with HIV-1 abolished the production of all cytokines tested in long-term in vitro cultures.Taken together, these results indicate that TM are a potential direct target of in situ HIV-1 infection, and that this infection may result in the disruption of macrophage functions that govern normal thymocyte maturation.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of DPP2 inhibition and the role of DPP2 in cell cycle in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).We screened 152 peripheral blood samples from patients with CLL in an apoptosis assay with AX8819, a DPP2-specific inhibitor. The apoptotic response was correlated with B-cell receptor signaling and cell cycle and molecular prognostic factors.We categorized CLL into two prognostic subgroups. Inhibition of DPP2 induced apoptosis in 60% of CLL, while 40% were resistant to apoptosis. Resistance to apoptosis correlated with unmutated IgVH and increased ZAP-70 expression and was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. Sensitive CLL B cells expressed high p27, low c-Myc protein levels and decreased Syk phosphorylation, indicative of a resting phenotype. DPP2 inhibition in those cells resulted in apoptosis accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of Syk, degradation of p27 and p130, and upregulation of c-Myc, indicative of activation and inappropriate cell cycle entry. Resistant CLL demonstrated baseline low p27 and high c-Myc protein levels and increased pSyk, indicative of an activated phenotype. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 in this subset of CLL partially reversed apoptosis resistance.The DPP2 apoptosis assay provides a reliable prognostic factor in CLL. CLL B cells sensitive to DPP2 inhibition are in true G0, while resistant CLL B-cells are partially activated. DPP2 inhibition alone or with concomitant inhibition of heat shock protein 90 warrants investigation as a therapeutic modality in CLL.",

RA induces cell differentiation through retinoic acid receptor (RAR) transcription factors. Because redox mechanisms influence how readily transcription factors bind to DNA response elements (RARE), the impact of small molecule (E3330) inhibition of the redox regulatory protein, apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox effector factor (APE1/Ref-1) on RAR DNA binding and function in RA-induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation and apoptosis was investigated.The redox function of APE1 was studied using the small molecule inhibitor E3330 in HL-60 and PLB acute myeloid leukemia cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were employed to determine effect of inhibitor on APE1/Ref-1 redox signaling function. Trypan blue assays, Annexin-V/propidium iodide and CD11b staining, and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses were employed to determine survival, apoptosis, and differentiation status of cells in culture.RAR\u03b1 binds to its RARE in a redox-dependent manner mediated by APE1/Ref-1 redox regulation. Redox-dependent RAR-RARE binding is blocked by E3330, a small molecule redox inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1. Combination treatment of RA + E3330 results in a profound hypersensitivity of myeloid leukemia cells to RA-induced differentiation and apoptosis. Additionally, redox inhibition by E3330 results in enhanced RAR target gene, BLR-1, expression in myeloid leukemia cells.The redox function of APE1/Ref-1 regulates RAR binding to its DNA RAREs influencing the response of myeloid leukemia cells to RA-induced differentiation. Targeting of APE1/Ref-1 redox function may allow manipulation of the retinoid response with therapeutic implications.",

MYEOV gene is not expressed in cells of the patients\u2019 bone marrow environment. The downregulation of MYEOV gene reduced the growth of a MYEOVpresent myeloma cell line, unlike a MYEOVabsent one. Patients with MYEOVabsent MMC have an increased event-free survival compared to patients with MYEOVpresent MMC, after high-dose therapy and stem cell transplantation and a trend for increased overall survival. In a Cox proportional hazard model, MYEOV expression in MMC is predictive for event-free survival for patients independently of International Staging System stage, t(4;14) translocation, albumin, or B2M serum levels. A knockout of MYEOV significantly reduced the growth of MMC.Thus, MYEOV expression is a prognostic factor for patients with multiple myeloma, in part through a role of MYEOV in the control of MMC proliferation.",

To investigate the role of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB in abnormal HIF-1\u03b1 expression in lymphoma cells, we performed a reporter assay using HIF-1\u03b1 promoter constructs that contained or lacked an NF-\u03baB binding site. We also used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to assess whether NF-\u03baB binds the HIF-1\u03b1 promoter. In addition, we took advantage of NF-\u03baB inhibitors. To analyze the function of HIF-1 in lymphoma cells, we established stable HIF-1\u03b1 knockdown cells using short-hairpin RNA.Malignant lymphoma cells, but not normal B cells, demonstrated constitutive expression of HIF-1\u03b1. Inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, however, drastically suppressed this HIF-1\u03b1 expression at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found that exposure of lymphoma cells to ionizing radiation clearly induced NF-\u03baB activation and increased HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Suppressing HIF-1\u03b1 expression by short-hairpin RNA increased the sensitivity of lymphoma cells to ionizing radiation-induced cell death. In searching for downstream targets of the NF-\u03baB/HIF-1 axis, we identified survivin, a member of the IAP family of anti-apoptotic proteins.We found that aberrant activation of HIF-1 in malignant lymphoma cells was mediated, at least in part, by NF-\u03baB activity.

T-cell responses against BCR-ABL and other antigens are well-described, but their relevance to the in vivo control of CML is unclear. The suppressive role of naturally occurring T regulatory (T-reg) cells in antitumor immunity is well-established, although little is known about their role in modulating the T-cell response to BCR-ABL.Naturally occurring T-reg cells were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry in 39 CML patients and 10 healthy donors. Their function was studied by observing their effect on responses to purified protein derivative, a recall antigen, and on the response of an autologous T-cell line recognizing BCR-ABL.T-reg cells were CD4+, CD25+, FOXP3+, CD127low, and CD62Lhigh. T-reg numbers in patients in complete cytogenetic remission were significantly lower than in patients not in complete cytogenetic remission (p < 0.01). T-reg cell depletion using anti-CD25 selection enhanced proliferative responses to purified protein derivative. Furthermore, the interferon-\u03b3 and/or granzyme-B production of effector cells specific for viral peptides or a BCR-ABL HLA-A3\u2212restricted peptide was inhibited when autologous T-reg cells were present.Taken together, these data suggest a role for T-reg cells in limiting immune responses in CML patients and this may include immune responses to BCR-ABL. The increased frequency of T-reg cells in patients with high levels of BCR-ABL transcripts indicates that an immune mechanism may be important in the control of CML.",

Cell cycle and hypoxia assay analyses were performed, to identify changes in the characteristics of human hematopoietic stem cells following transplantation. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying this transition.Engrafted primitive lineage-negative CD34-positive CD38-negative cells acquired hypoxic state and quiescence in the recipient bone marrow between 4 and 8 weeks, and between 8 and 12 weeks after transplantation, respectively. During 4 and 8 weeks after transplantation, changes in the transcription levels of G0 regulatory factors, such as CCNC and RBL1, and stem cell regulators, such as Flt3, were also seen, which may be related to the characteristic changes in the cell cycle or oxygenation state.Behavioral changes of hematopoietic stem cells in their cell cycle and oxygenation state during and after bone marrow engraftment may provide insights into hematopoietic stem cell regulation, mediating the improvement of clinical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation protocols and the eradication of leukemia stem cells.",

The reduced-intensity conditioning regimen consisted of oral Busulfan, rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin, and Fludarabin.Median age was 50 years (range, 18\u201364 years). The incidences of acute and chronic graft-vs.-host disease were 43% and 81%, respectively. The probability of nonrelapse mortality at 1 and 5 years was 15% and 25%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality was adversely associated with acute graft-vs.-host disease (hazard ratio = 6; p = 0.0002). Of the 52 patients with measurable disease, 37 (71%) achieved a response. Relapse/progression occurred at a median of 11 months (range 1\u201352 months) in 21 patients, for a cumulative incidence of 22%. The probability of overall survival and progression-free survival at 5 years were 60% and 54%, respectively.

We measured peripheral cell counts, the presence of circulating donor-derived cells by flow cytometry, changes in the cellularity of the bone marrow and splenic weight on day 5, 7, 14, and 1 month post-transplantation.Compared to wild-type recipients, mafG recipients had delayed platelet and leukocyte recovery and lower spleen weight at early time points after transplantation. Intrinsic effects: When mafG-deficient bone marrow served as donor source, we observed more rapid recovery of bone marrow cellularity and increased splenic hematopoiesis. The finding of increased short-term hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in the mafG-deficient bone marrow could explain the accelerated hematopoietic recovery after transplantation. Furthermore, the expression of Bach 2, which can form a heterodimer with mafG protein, was found to be greatly reduced, while Notch 1 expression was increased in mafG-deficient mice. Extrinsic effects: When mafG-deficient mice were transplant recipients, there were delays in recovery of normal levels of marrow and splenic hematopoiesis as well as circulating leukocytes and platelets.Our study demonstrates that mafG expression has intrinsic and extrinsic effects on hematopoietic engraftment following bone marrow transplantation.",

Subsequent decrease of donor alleles was associated with relapses in 17 of 18 cases (94%), while no patient with subsequent increasing donor alleles relapsed (p < 0.001).

Nampt and \u03b3-tubulin levels, as well as caspase-3 cleavage were detected by immunoblotting. DR4 and DR5 expression were assessed by immunostaining and flow cytometry. Caspases were inhibited with zVAD-FMK and zDEVD-FMK; autophagy with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, and wortmannin. Intracellular NAD+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were measured by cycling assays and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively.APO866 induced NAD+ depletion, \u0394\u03a8m dissipation, and ATP shortage in leukemia cells, thereby leading to autophagic cell death. TRAIL induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. TRAIL addition to APO866 synergistically increased its activity in leukemia cells by enhancing NAD+ depletion, \u0394\u03a8m dissipation, and ATP shortage. No DR5 upregulation at the cell surface in response to APO866 was observed. Remarkably, in healthy leukocytes APO866 and TRAIL were poorly active and failed to show any cooperation.Activation of the extrinsic apoptotic cascade with TRAIL selectively amplifies the sequelae of Nampt inhibition in leukemia cells, and appears as a promising strategy to enhance APO866 activity in hematological malignancies.",

None of the antibodies were suitable for immunohistochemistry. Competitive inhibition with soluble G-CSFR extracellular domain and small inhibitory RNA-mediated knock-down of G-CSFR messenger RNA further demonstrated the limited specificity of these antibodies for HuG-CSFR expressed on the cell surface.Most commercially available anti\u2212HuG-CSFR antibodies do not bind specifically to this protein. These studies highlight the need for investigators to validate antibodies in their own systems to avoid the inadvertent use of nonspecifically binding antibodies that could lead, as exemplified in this case with a hematopoietic growth factor receptor, to erroneous conclusions about protein expression.",

Based on our observation of aberrant myeloid cell representation in hematopoietic tissues of 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX)-deficient (Alox15) mice, we tested the hypothesis that polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism regulates myelopoiesis.Multicolor flow cytometric analysis and methylcellulose assays were used to compare myelopoiesis and the differentiative capacity of progenitors from Alox15 and wild-type mice. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanism by which 12/15-LOX is involved in regulation of myelopoiesis.Granulopoiesis in Alox15 mice is increased while monopoiesis is reduced. Moreover, there is an accumulation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors that exhibit defective differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that transcriptional activity of interferon regulatory factor-8 (Irf8), which regulates myelopoiesis, is impaired in Alox15 progenitors and bone marrow-derived macrophages due to loss of 12/15-LOX-mediated redox regulation of Irf8 nuclear accumulation. Restoration of redox signaling in Alox15 bone marrow cells and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors reversed the defect in myeloid differentiation.These data establish 12/15-LOX-mediated redox signaling as a novel regulator of myelopoiesis and Irf8.",

Its expression detected in a number of malignancies, including B-cell lymphomas, may be important for oncogenesis.In our work, we determined the level of cyclin D1 expression in various B-cell lymphomas (i.e., mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma) and compared it with normal B cells. For cyclin D1 level evaluation, the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data was normalized. We tested five reference genes for stability on our sample set and using the three most stable ones (YWHAZ, ubiquitin c, and HPRT) obtained rather small intra-group variance for cyclin D1 expression in most lymphomas. This allowed their statistically significant ranking according to cyclin D1 expression level.Median values of normalized cyclin D1 expression determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were 1.32 for mantle cell lymphoma, 0.02 for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 0.009 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 0.004 for marginal zone lymphoma, 0.002 for follicular lymphoma compared with 0.0003 for reactive lymphoid tissue, and 0.00004 for sorted B cells of healthy donors.Our data demonstrate that mantle cell lymphoma, a lymphoma with t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, has the level of cyclin D1 increased by four orders of magnitude, while other B-cell lymphomas without t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation still have the level of cyclin D1 significantly elevated above that of normal lymphocytes (2 orders for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and an order for other lymphomas) and suggests more than one method of its upregulation in malignant B cells.",

Because HoxB genes are dispensable for hematopoiesis, and most HoxA genes are expressed an order of magnitude higher than other cluster genes in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)\u2212enriched populations, we hypothesize that maintenance of HoxA cluster expression is important for adult hematopoiesis and that global decrease of HoxA gene expression levels affects steady-state hematopoiesis.Expression levels of HoxA cluster genes have been determined in primitive hematopoietic populations derived from adult mice using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the functional effect of single allelic deletion of the entire HoxA cluster on hematopoietic cells was analyzed by competitive repopulation assays using HoxA+/\u2212 mice.We show that the HoxA cluster is predominantly expressed in long-term HSCs and that expression declines with progression to short-term HSCs and early progenitors in a quantifiable manner. Monoallelic deletion of the HoxA cluster caused a general increase in primitive hematopoietic cell populations, but a decrease in side populations. In addition exhaustion of B-cell progenitors with age was observed, resulting in less mature B cells. Moreover, bone marrow of HoxA+/\u2212 mice had a significant larger population of Mac1/Gr1 neutrophils, which might be caused by accelerated maturation of myeloid progenitors. Transplantation assays demonstrated that HoxA+/\u2212 HSCs were less competitive in long-term repopulation of myeloablated recipients, which appeared intrinsic to HSCs.These results show for the first time that maintenance of adult HSCs and progenitors is particularly sensitive to HoxA gene levels, suggesting a specific role for the HoxA cluster in primary regulation of definitive hematopoiesis.",

     "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest that transplantation of total bone marrow (BM) after myocardial infarction (MI) is feasible and potentially effective. However, focusing on a defined BM-derived stem cell type may enable a more specific and optimized treatment. Multilineage differentiation potential makes BM-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) a promising stem cell pool for regenerative purposes. We analyzed the cardioregenerative potential of human MAPCs in a murine model of myocardial infarction.Human MAPCs were selected by negative depletion of CD45+/glycophorin+ BM cells and plated on fibronectin-coated dishes. In vitro, stem cells were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo, we transplanted human MAPCs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) by intramyocardial injection after MI in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice. Six and 30 days after the surgical procedure, pressure-volume relationships were investigated in vivo. Heart tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically.Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments on early human MAPC passages evidenced an expression of Oct-4, a stem cell marker indicating pluripotency. In later passages, cardiac markers (Nkx2.5, GATA4, MLC-2v, MLC-2a, ANP, cTnT, cTnI,) and smooth muscle cell markers (SMA, SM22\u03b1) were expressed. Transplantation of human MAPCs into the ischemic border zone after MI resulted in an improved cardiac function at day 6 (ejection fraction, 26% vs 20%) and day 30 (ejection fraction, 30% vs 23%). Confirmation of human MAPC marker vimentin in immunohistochemistry demonstrated that human MAPC integrated in the peri-infarct region. The proliferation marker Ki67 was absent in immunohistochemistry and teratoma formation was not found, indicating no tumorous potential of transplanted human MAPCs in the tumor-sensitive SCID model.Transplantation of human MAPCs after MI ameliorates myocardial function, which may be explained by trophic effects of human MAPCs. Lack of evidence of tumorous potential in the tumor-sensitive SCID model indicates that human MAPCs may deliver an effective and safe stem cell pool for potential treatment of ischemic heart disease.",

Only in the first 48 hours after transplantation, engraftment in IF-transplanted animals was higher compared with intravenous injection. However, at all later time points no differences could be detected using whole body bioluminescence or measuring blood cell reconstitution. Most importantly, we found that IF-transplanted cells did not outcompete cells transplanted intravenously when cotransplanted in the same recipient.In conclusion, IF transplantation in a murine syngeneic setting revealed no enhanced engraftment. Previous reports on IF transplantation may have relied on escape from immune rejection in xenogeneic or allogeneic models. Therefore, we conclude that stem cells can find the proper microenvironment irrespective of the route of administration.",

This brief review utilizes the article of Eliasson and colleagues in this Journal to summarize the major results and questions about the relationships between O2 and hematopoiesis.In order to be concise and interesting for readers unfamiliar with this field, we selected only the most significant data that either reinforce or contradict the conclusions of Eliasson et\u00a0al., but we also provide references of reviews with a more detailed bibliography.A critical analysis of some key publications provides partial answers to three important questions: is the term hypoxia appropriate to describe physiological low O2 concentrations? Is a very low O2 level sufficient to control the quiescence/slow cycling balance of hematopoietic stem cells? Is the O2 concentration able to modify the effect of cytokines on hematopoietic stem cells?We propose to use in situ normoxia instead of the confusing term hypoxia when working with normal cells at physiological low O2 concentrations. We suggest that a very low O2 concentration is necessary but not sufficient to induce hematopoietic stem cell quiescence.

In addition, we correlated telomere length in granulocytes with those in whole leukocyte samples of individuals ranging in age from birth to 100 years.In the UCB, we found strong correlations of telomere length in HPCs with telomere length in T lymphocytes (r ranging from 0.882 to 0.935; p ranging from 0.0038 to 0.0007) and in granulocytes (r = 0.930; p = 0.0072). At birth, strong correlations were also observed between telomere length in granulocytes and those in all leukocytes (r = 0.979; p = 0.0003). Throughout the human lifespan, the relationship between telomere length in granulocytes and that in all leukocytes was r > 0.980 and p < 0.0001.Robust synchrony exists among leukocyte subsets throughout the human lifespan; individuals with relatively long (or short) telomeres in one leukocyte subset have long (or short) telomeres in other leukocyte subsets. Moreover, telomere length in leukocytes reflects its length in cells up the hematopoietic hierarchy, i.e., HPCs and, by inference, HSCs. Strong links have been found by many studies between leukocyte telomere length and a host of aging-related diseases. Our findings suggest, therefore, that these links might be traced to telomere dynamics in HSCs.",

Expression of membrane-anchored IL-6R was determined by flow cytometry. In order to study the mechanism of sIL-6R production, tumor necrosis factor\u2212\u03b1 protease inhibitor was added to specifically block IL-6R shedding. Gene expression of sIL-6R levels were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Monocytes were the main source of sIL-6R. Besides, in ET patients, monocyte sIL-6R release was higher than that of controls (p = 0.0014). Lymphocytes enhanced monocyte sIL-6R production by cell-mediated contact in normal controls, but this cooperation could not be seen in patients. Membrane expression of IL-6R was increased after monocyte adhesion in ET. sIL-6R synthesis was upregulated in most patients, while messenger RNA was normal.Our results indicate that ET monocytes are responsible for sIL-6R overproduction within mononuclear cells through synthesis upregulation. In addition, the lack of cooperation of lymphocytes in monocyte sIL-6R production in ET could be due to a monocyte abnormality. The agonistic effect of sIL-6R on IL-6 action could contribute to the exacerbated megakaryocytic growth in ET.",

The demethylating agent, 5-aza 2\u2032deoxycytidine, upregulated the gene expression of DR4/DR5, but was insufficient for their surface expression due to low basal promoter activity.In contrast to higher sensitivity to FasL, T-ALL showed resistance to TRAIL, which might be responsible for resistance to TRAIL-mediated cellular immunity.",

     "abstract": "In mast cell (MC) neoplasms, clinical problems requiring therapy include local aggressive and sometimes devastating growth of MCs and mediator-related symptoms. A key mediator of MCs responsible for clinical symptoms is histamine. Therefore, use of histamine receptor (HR) antagonists is an established approach to block histamine effects in these patients.We screened for additional beneficial effects of HR antagonists and asked whether any of these agents would also exert growth-inhibitory effects on primary neoplastic MCs, the human MC line HMC-1, and on two canine MC lines, C2 and NI-1.We found that the HR1 antagonists terfenadine and loratadine suppress spontaneous growth of HMC-1, C2, and NI-1 cells, as well as growth of primary neoplastic MCs in all donors tested (human patients, n = 5; canine patients, n = 8). The effects of both drugs were found to be dose-dependent (IC50: terfenadine, 1\u201320 \u03bcM; loratadine, 10\u221250 \u03bcM). Both agents also produced apoptosis in neoplastic MCs and augmented apoptosis-inducing effects of two KIT-targeting drugs, PKC412 and dasatinib. The other HR1 antagonists (fexofenadine, diphenhydramine) and HR2 antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, ranitidine) tested did not exert substantial growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MCs. None of the histamine receptor blockers were found to modulate cell-cycle progression in neoplastic MCs.The HR1 antagonists terfenadine and loratadine, in addition to their antimediator activity, exert in vitro growth-inhibitory effects on neoplastic MCs. Whether these drugs (terfenadine) alone, or in combination with KIT inhibitors, can also affect in vivo neoplastic MC growth remains to be determined.",

Apoptosis was investigated by Annexin-V/7-aminoactinomycin D and caspase-3 expression. The effect of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors was also tested in vivo in an animal model of leukemia. Gene expression analysis was performed to identify the genes modulated by GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition in leukemia cells.GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in seven leukemia cell lines of diverse origin, four acute myeloid leukemia, one myelodysplastic syndrome, and one acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors are cytotoxic for rapidly dividing clonogenic leukemia blasts, and higher doses of the inhibitors are needed to eliminate primitive leukemia progenitor/stem cells. Slow cell-division rate, low drug uptake, and interaction with bone marrow stroma make leukemia cells more resistant to apoptosis induced by GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors. Global gene expression analysis combined with functional approaches identified multiple genes and specific signaling pathways modulated by GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition. An important role for Bcl2 in the regulation of apoptosis induced by GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors was defined by expression analysis and confirmed by using pharmacological inhibitors of the protein. In vivo administration of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors delayed tumor formation in a mouse leukemia model. GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors did not affect hematopoietic recovery following irradiation.Our data support further evaluation of GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors as promising novel agents for therapeutic intervention in leukemia and warrant clinical investigation in leukemia patients.",

We evaluated the expression of adhesion molecules and galectin-1 by MSCs and the impact of an inflammatory or infectious environment on these expressions. Using neutralizing antibodies against adhesion molecules and a galectin-1 inhibitor, we assessed the role of these molecules in MSC functions.MSCs inhibition of T-cell proliferation depended on MSC concentrations, cell contact, and culture environment. Expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of galectin-1 by MSCs are tightly regulated. Coculture with activated T cells upregulated expression of CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and CD58 (lymphocyte function\u2212associated antigen 3) and secretion of galectin-1 by MSCs. Interestingly, in an inflammatory or infectious environment, expression of adhesion molecules and galectin-1 by MSCs was differentially modulated. Furthermore, blocking galectin-1 activity prevented the suppressive potential of MSCs. Neutralization of adhesion molecule activity had no effect on MSC inhibition.Galectin-1 plays an important role in MSC immunoregulatory functions, which are depending on cell environment. The present study provides new insights concerning MSC physiology and will increase the safety and efficiency of MSCs in clinical settings.",

In order to understand the pathogenesis of HMB, we established an EBV-infected cell line and characterized the cytological profiles.A novel EBV-infected NK-cell line, designated NKED, was established from a patient with HMB and used for the present study along with two other NK-cell lines, KAI3 and KHYG-1.NKED expressed the latency II-related transcripts. NKED cells were positive for CD2 and CD161 antigens, and negative for CD3, CD16, CD34, CD56, and T-cell receptor \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3/\u03b4 antigens. Although NKED cells contained several cytotoxic molecules, the cells had an extremely poor cytotoxic activity. The majority of NKED cells were negative for perforin, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted NK-cell receptors, CD94 and KIR2D, and an activating receptor, NKG2D. NKED cells, however, secreted higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 induced expression of BZLF1 messenger RNA in the NKED and KAI3 cells, indicating the transition from the latent- to the lytic-cycle infection.These data suggested that NKED cells revealed a very low cytotoxic effect probably because of the low expression levels of perforin, but had the ability to release proinflammatory cytokines. NKED cells did not reflect the characteristics of HMB, as they were different from\u00a0pathogenic NK cells proliferating in the HMB patient, but the difference indicated that pathogenic NK cells could change their character in the presence of interleukin-2.",

Bone marrow MSCs were cultured in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum and basic fibroblast growth factor (2 ng\u00b7mL\u22121). Autologous MSCs were intradermally injected twice or three times from days 27 to 96 (range, 99\u2212128.5 \u00d7 106 MSCs per injection).All animals exhibited a clinical evolution similar to humans after a latency phase of several weeks, including early erythema, hair loss, and dry/moist desquamation followed by necrosis during 81 to 222 days post\u2212ionizing radiation. Skin damage in higher exposed animals appeared slightly earlier. Immunohistology revealed severe skin damage in all animals and rhabdomyolysis in the muscle tissue below the entry area, with the latter being more severe in controls. In grafted animals, MSCs led to local accumulation of lymphocytes at the dermis/subcutis border and improved vascularization.This study establishes a new minipig model that is close to human and allows development of stem cell therapy strategies that can be applied in treatment of human radiation burns.",

Blood cell counts and circulating levels of lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified prior to surgery and at 10, 30, and 90 to 180 days postsurgery by flow cytometry. Immunoreactivity of recipient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to donor MSCs was evaluated in vitro and alloantibody production in vivo was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry.MSC transplantation induced transient but significant increases in circulating white blood cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in most transplant recipients, but not sham-operated control animals. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a strong correlation between expansion of CD8+, CD16+, and CD8+/CD16+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood, the dose of administered MSCs, and degree of antigenic mismatch between donor and recipient. MSC-specific alloantibodies were also detected in several transplant recipients. However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from transplant recipients postsurgery exhibited no lytic activity against donor MSCs in vitro upon rechallenge.MSCs induced an allograft response in rhesus macaques that involved principally CD8+, CD16+, and CD8+/CD16+ lymphocyte subpopulations and was cell-dose\u2212 and haplotype-dependent.

To solve this problem, intrabone (IB) injection of HSCs has been proposed. However, the mechanisms underlying the benefit provided by this procedure remain unknown. This study aims to evaluate the effect of IB on HSCs trafficking and homing features in the living rat.A total of 35 Lewis rats underwent IB or IV administration of HSCs harvested from syngeneic animals and purified according to CD90 expression. These cells were labeled with 37 MBq 99mTc-exametazime and injected either IV or IB. Cell trafficking and distribution in heart, lung, spleen, liver, and forelimb was evaluated by dynamic radionuclide imaging. Logan graphical approach was used to estimate tissue recruitment of HSCs.More than 90% of cells escaped from the injected bone to the bloodstream in <15 seconds. However, this short contact profoundly modified HSCs kinetics, reducing their lung sequestration and shortening their blood persistence with respect to IV. More importantly, IB passage resulted in reduced lung uptake and in a fourfold increase in homing of remote bone marrow sites. CD90+ cells transplantation restored hematopoiesis in eight further rats previously exposed to lethal irradiation.The first-entry contact with the hematopoietic microenvironment immediately readdresses the fate of transplanted HSCs, providing them with \u201cthe final destination stamp\u201d to define their bone marrow homing.",

In contrast to other vector systems in use for genetic engineering of CD34+ cells, rAAV-mediated gene expression does not depend on vector integration. This is relevant for application in regenerative medicine of ischemic tissues, where transient transgene expression is likely sufficient to achieve therapeutic benefits.We compared three different human AAV serotypes, packaged as pseudotypes by a helper virus-free production method, for their transduction efficiency in human cord blood\u2212derived CD34+ cells.

The mechanisms by which leukocytes interact with human brain\u2212derived microvasculature endothelial cells (HBMEC) and enter the CNS are largely derived from models of inflammation. However, our data indicate that ALL cells do not elicit an inflammatory phenotype by HBMEC. Our current investigation focuses on the contribution of the unique coexpression of vascular endothelial (VE)\u2212cadherin and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule\u22121 (PECAM-1) by ALL in mediating leukemic cell interactions with HBMEC as an in vitro model of the blood-brain barrier.Primary ALL and ALL cell lines were evaluated for VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 expression. Lentiviral-mediated transduction of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 into REH cells and antibody neutralization of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 in SUP-B15 cells was used to delineate the role of these two proteins in mediating ALL adhesion to, and migration through, HBMEC monolayers.Although cell line models indicate that VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 expression is found on the surface Philadelphia chromosome\u2212positive ALL, evaluation of primary ALL demonstrates that VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 are expressed independent of Philadelphia status. Expression of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 by ALL enhanced the adhesion of ALL to HBMEC, while expression of PECAM-1 enhanced ALL adhesion to, and migration through, HBMEC.Expression of VE-cadherin and PECAM-1 by ALL cells positions them to interact with HBMEC.

We investigated the role of different signaling pathways triggered by CCR7 engagement by its ligands, the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, in the control of CLL migration and survival.Chemotaxis and apoptosis assays were performed in the presence of pharmacologic inhibitors and genetic mutants of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), Rho guanosine triphosphatase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades to assess the role of these pathways on primary CLL migration and survival in response to CCR7 activation. Kinase activation was determined by immunoblotting and pull-down experiments.CLL chemotactic activity induced by CCL19 or CCL21 was markedly reduced by inhibitors of PI3K and the Rho effector molecule Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases (ROCK), and also by the expression of dominant negative forms of PI3K and RhoA, whereas constitutively activated PI3K and RhoA mutants strongly promoted CLL migration. In contrast, MAPKs were not significantly involved in CLL migration to CCL19/CCL21. Conversely, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, along with PI3K, had a role in CCR7-mediated CLL cell survival. Biochemical experiments confirmed that CCL19/21 induced PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B, activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinases/myosin light chain pathway and MAPKs phosphorylation.The role of PI3K, Rho guanosine triphosphatases, and MAPKs in CCR7-mediated CLL cells migration and survival suggests that these signal transduction pathways could represent promising targets for CLL therapy.",

Here we demonstrate that U6 promoter activity\u2014and consequently gene silencing success\u2014differs significantly among species.We have modified pLeGO-G, an HIV-based third-generation lentivector, to express a 19nt shRNA sequence against the human transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 or against its murine homologue, as well as an shRNA against murine JAK2, from either the human or the murine U6 promoter. Gene silencing efficiency was analyzed in a human erythroleukemic cell line, in primary human CD34+ cells, as well as in a murine erythroleukemic cell line and in primary murine bone marrow.ShRNA expression from the human U6 promoter resulted in a fourfold increase in knockdown efficiency compared to expression from the murine U6 promoter in both human and murine cells.The U6 promoter constitutes an important determinant for efficient gene silencing by shRNAs.",

     "abstract": "Myeloid ectropic viral integration site 1 (MEIS1) is a Hox cofactor known for its role in development and is strongly linked to normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. Although previous studies have focused on identifying protein partners of MEIS1 and its transcriptionally regulated targets, little is known about the upstream transcriptional regulators of this tightly regulated gene. Understanding the regulation of MEIS1 is important to understanding normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.Here we describe our studies focusing on the evolutionary conserved putative MEIS1 promoter region. Phylogenetic sequence analysis and reporter assays in MEIS1-expressing (K562) and nonexpressing (HL60) leukemic cell line models were used to identify key regulatory regions and potential transcription factor binding sites within the candidate promoter region followed by functional and expression studies of one identified regulator in both cell lines and primary human cord blood and leukemia samples.Chromatin status of MEIS1 promoter region is associated with MEIS1 expression. Truncation and mutation studies coupled with reporter assays revealed that a conserved ETS family member binding site located 289 bp upstream of the annotated human MEIS1 transcription start site is required for promoter activity. Of the three ETS family members tested, only ELF1 was enriched on the MEIS1 promoter as assessed by both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in K562. This finding was confirmed in MEIS1-expressing primary human samples. Moreover, small interfering RNA\u2212mediated knockdown of ELF1 in K562 cells was associated with a decreased MEIS1 expression.We conclude that the ETS transcription factor ELF1 is an important positive regulator of MEIS1 expression.",

Here we characterized a retroviral CIS observed at high frequency in baboon hematopoietic repopulating cells that has not been described previously.Gammaretroviral vector integration sites in baboon repopulating cells identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification were localized to the human genome to identify a CIS. The presence of each clone was tracked over time using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction.In three different animals that received gammaretrovirally transduced CD34-enriched bone marrow cells, vector proviruses were identified at three distinct sites within a window of 664 base pairs between leupaxin and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFP91). All three integrants of the CIS occurred within a CpG island between leupaxin and zinc finger protein 91 (ZFP91).We describe a novel CIS between leupaxin and ZFP91 in hematopoietic repopulating cells.

We also investigated the subcellular localization of MT1-MMP and the signaling pathways that regulate its expression and function in hematopoietic cells after exposure to G-CSF.We found that G-CSF increases MT1-MMP transcription and protein synthesis in hematopoietic cells; proMMP-2 activation in cocultures of HSPC with BM fibroblasts; chemoinvasion across reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel toward a stromal cell\u2212derived factor-1 gradient, which is reduced by small interfering RNA silencing of MT1-MMP; and localization of MT1-MMP to membrane lipid rafts through a mechanism that is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway.

We previously reported the first clinical trial of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for a genetic disorder of bone, osteogenesis imperfecta. Although the patients demonstrated striking clinical benefits after transplantation, measured osteopoietic engraftment was low and did not seem to be durable. Therefore, we sought an animal model, which closely reflects the clinical experience, to facilitate development of strategies to improve the efficiency of osteoprogenitor engraftment after BMT.We transplanted unfractionated bone marrow cells from green fluorescent protein\u2212transgenic mice into lethally irradiated recipients in four combinations of inbred mouse strains: from C57BL/6 into C57BL/6 (C-C), from C57BL/6 into FVB/N (C-F), from FVB/N into C57BL/6 (F-C), and from FVB/N into FVB/N (F-F). At 2 weeks after transplantation, we assessed donor hematopoietic and osteopoietic engraftment by flow cytometry, using a novel mean fluorescence assay, and by immunohistochemical staining for green fluorescent protein.Hematopoietic reconstitution by donor cells was complete in all four combinations. Although osteopoietic engraftment of the transplanted cells was also documented in all the four groups, the magnitude of osteopoietic engraftment differed markedly among the strains where F-F > C-F > F-C > C-C.Our findings indicate that the genetic background of inbred mouse strains affects efficiency of osteopoietic engraftment after BMT.

Our previous studies have identified a role for Nramp1 during macrophage erythrophagocytosis; however, little is known about the function of DMT1 during this process.Wild-type RAW264.7 macrophages (RAW), and those stably transfected with Nramp1 (RAW/Nramp1) were treated with either DMT1\u2212small interfering RNA, or with ebselen, a selective inhibitor of DMT1.Although macrophages lacking either functional DMT1 or Nramp1 experienced a moderate reduction in iron recycling efficiency, the ability of macrophages lacking both functional DMT1 and Nramp1 to recycle hemoglobin-derived iron was severely compromised. Compared to macrophages singly deficient in either DMT1 or Nramp1 transport ability, macrophages where DMT1 and Nramp1 were both compromised exhibited an abrogated increase in labile iron pool content, released less iron, and experienced diminished upregulation of ferroportin and heme-oxygenase 1 levels following erythrophagocytosis.These results suggest that although the loss of either Nramp1 or DMT1 transport ability results in minor impairment after erythrophagocytosis, the simultaneous loss of both Nramp1 and DMT1 iron transport activity is detrimental to the iron recycling capacity of the macrophage.",

The promoter for an miRNA cluster upregulated by PU.1 induction was analyzed for PU.1 binding by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Retroviral transduction of hematopoietic progenitors was performed to evaluate the effect of miRNA expression on hematopoietic development in vitro and in vivo.We identified an miRNA cluster whose pri-transcript is regulated by PU.1. The pri-miRNA encodes three mature miRNAs: miR-23a, miR-27a, and miR-24-2. Each miRNA is more abundant in myeloid cells compared to lymphoid cells. When hematopoietic progenitors expressing the 23a cluster miRNAs were cultured in B-cell\u2212promoting conditions, we observed a dramatic decrease in B lymphopoiesis and an increase in myelopoiesis compared to control cultures. In vivo, hematopoietic progenitors expressing the miR-23a cluster generate reduced numbers of B cells compared to control cells.The miR-23a cluster is a downstream target of PU.1 involved in antagonizing lymphoid cell fate acquisition. Although miRNAs have been identified downstream of PU.1 in mediating development of monocytes and granulocytes, the 23a cluster is the first downstream miRNA target implicated in regulating development of myeloid vs lymphoid cells.",

BMNCs were cultured without CD8+CD57+T cells or cocultured with a 1:4 ratio of CD8+CD57+T cells to study the association between stem/progenitor cell colony formation and the existence of activated CD8+ T cells, as well as the polarization of T cells towards Tc1.

Crossing cultures between MDS patients and normal volunteer was performed. The impact of effector CD8+T cells on the malignant growth of BMNCs was closely examined.After deprivation of CD8+CD57+T cells, BMNCs from 33 MDS patients formed colonies in the culture media.

Here, we examined whether the widely used valproic acid (VPA) affects megakaryopoiesis as well as erythropoiesis.CD34+ cells were incubated in serum-free or serum-containing cultures with cytokines, with or without VPA.In the serum-free cultures containing IL-3+stem cell factor (SCF), VPA significantly increased generation of CD61+GPA\u2212 megakaryocytic and a CD61+GPA+ mixture of megakaryocytic and erythroid precursors from CD34+ hematopoietic precursors at a pharmacological concentration (100 \u03bcg/mL). The increase in generation of megakaryocytic and erythroid precursors by VPA was confirmed by replating cultured cells with thrombopoietin+SCF and erythropoietin+SCF, respectively. VPA was as potent as FK228. In cultures with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor+SCF, where CD61\u2212GPA+ erythroid precursors were mostly developed, VPA mainly enhanced the generation of CD61\u2212GPA+ erythroid precursors. In serum-containing cultures, only low numbers of CD61+ or GPA+ cells were developed with IL-3+SCF. Nevertheless, a substantial number of these cells were generated with VPA. Furthermore, these stimulating effects of VPA were observed by incubating CD34+ cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that VPA enhanced GATA-2, but not GATA-1, messenger RNA expression with IL-3+SCF.These results indicate a novel role for VPA in enhancing the potential of IL-3 to stimulate megakaryopoiesis as well as erythropoiesis and suggest a new therapeutic approach of epigenetic therapy for hematological disease.",

This review looks back at the four known pathways of cell plasticity and at previously described \u201cplasticity principles\u201d of Genomic Completeness, Cellular Uncertainty, Stochasticity of Cell Origin and Fate, relating these to issues of experimental design and discourse that are key to understanding and evaluating plasticity data. Although the physiologic roles played by such plasticity may still be debated, the manipulations of these phenomena for therapeutic or industrial purposes should finally be considered ripe for exploration. For the future, plasticity, indeed all stem cell biology, must be considered as part of a larger web of cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions that function fully only at the tissue level; thus, the success of stem cell biology necessarily must involve assembling data from cell and molecular biology research into systems of interactions that might be reasonably called \u201ctissue biology.\u201d Interdisciplinary collaborations with complexity and chaos theorists, using mathematical/computer modeling of cell behaviors, will be vital to fully exploring stem cell behaviors in the coming decades.",

Recently, we have reported a primitive cell population termed monocyte-derived multipotential cells (MOMCs), which has a fibroblast-like morphology in culture and a unique phenotype positive for CD14, CD45, CD34, and type I collagen. MOMCs are derived from circulating CD14+ monocytes, but circulating precursors for MOMCs still remain undetermined. Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles of MOMCs and other monocyte-derived cells has revealed that embryonic stem cell markers, Nanog and Oct-4, are specifically expressed by MOMCs. In vitro generation of MOMCs requires binding to fibronectin and exposure to soluble factors derived from activated platelets. MOMCs contain progenitors with capacity to differentiate into a variety of nonphagocytes, including bone, cartilage, fat, skeletal and cardiac muscle, neuron, and endothelium, indicating that circulating monocytes are more multipotent than previously thought. In addition, MOMCs are capable of promoting ex vivo expansion of human hematopoietic progenitor cells through direct cell-to-cell contact and secretion of a variety of hematopoietic growth factors. These findings obtained from the research on MOMCs indicate that CD14+ monocytes in circulation are involved in a variety of physiologic functions other than innate and acquired immune responses, such as repair and regeneration of the damaged tissue.",

In this review, we critically evaluate the literature related to engraftment of bone marrow\u2013derived cells as epithelial cells in the lung. More than 40 articles focused on whether bone marrow cells can differentiate into lung epithelial cells have been published, nearly all of which claim to identify marrow-derived epithelial cells. A few investigations have concluded that no such cells are present and that the phenomenon of marrow-derived epithelial cells is based on detection artifacts. Here we discuss the problems that exist in published articles identifying marrow-derived epithelial cells, and propose standards for detection methods that provide the most definitive data. Identification of bone marrow\u2212derived epithelial cells requires reliable and sensitive techniques for their detection, which must include cell identification based on the presence of an epithelial marker and the absence of blood cell markers as well as a marker for donor bone marrow origin. In order for these studies to be rigorous, they must also use approaches to rule out cell overlap by microscopy or single-cell isolation. Once\u00a0these stringent criteria for identification of marrow-derived epithelial cells are used universally, then the field can move forward to address the critical questions about which bone marrow\u2212derived cells are responsible for engraftment as epithelial cells, the mechanisms by which this occurs, whether these cells play a role in normal tissue repair, and whether specific cell subsets can be used for therapeutic benefit.",

Use of cell therapy as a means of repopulating the liver has several advantages over whole-organ transplantation because it would be less invasive, less immunogenic, and would allow the use, in some instances, of autologous-derived cells. Stem/progenitor cells that would be ideal for liver repopulation would need to have characteristics such as availability and ease of isolation, the ability to be expanded in vitro, ensuring adequate numbers of cells, susceptibility to modification by viral vector transduction/genetic recombination, to correct any underlying genetic defects, and the ability of restoring liver function following transplantation. Bone marrow\u2212derived stem cells, such as hematopoietic, mesenchymal and endothelial progenitor cells possess some or most of these characteristics, making them ideal candidates for liver regenerative therapies.

The stem cell population is continually changing based on cell-cycle transit and can only be defined on a population basis. Purification of marrow stem cells only addresses the heterogeneity of these populations. When whole marrow is studied, the long-term repopulating stem cells are in active cell cycle. However, with some variability, when highly purified stem cells are studied, the cells appear to be dormant. Thus, the study of purified stem cells is intrinsically misleading. Tissue-derived microvesicles enhanced by injury effect the phenotype of different cell classes. We propose that previously described stem cell plasticity is due to microvesicle modulation. We further propose a stem cell population model in which the individual cell phenotypes continually change, but the population phenotype is relatively stable. This, in turn, is modulated by microvesicle and\u00a0microenvironmental influences.",

OI is a genetic disorder resulting from abnormal amount and/or structure of type I collagen and is characterized by osteopenia, fragile bones, and skeletal deformities. Homozygous OI murine mice (oim; B6C3Fe a/a-Col1a2oim/J) offer excellent recipients for transplantation of normal HSCs, because fast turnover of osteoprogenitors has been shown.We transplanted BM mononuclear cells or 50 BM cells highly enriched for HSCs from transgenic enhanced green fluorescent protein mice into irradiated oim mice and analyzed changes in bone parameters using longitudinal microcomputed tomography.Dramatic improvements were observed in three-dimensional microcomputed tomography images of these bones 3 to 6 months post-transplantation when the mice showed high levels of hematopoietic engraftment. Histomorphometric assessment of the bone parameters, such as trabecular structure and cortical width, supported observations from three-dimensional images. There was an increase in bone volume, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness with a concomitant decrease in trabecular spacing. Analysis of a nonengrafted mouse or a mouse that was transplanted with BM cells from oim mice showed continued deterioration in the bone parameters. The engrafted mice gained weight and became less prone to spontaneous fractures while the control mice worsened clinically and eventually developed kyphosis.These findings strongly support the concept that HSCs generate bone cells. Furthermore, they are consistent with observations from clinical transplantation studies and suggest therapeutic potentials of HSCs in OI.",

One week later, the resulting clones of cells were individually transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. We also carried out time-course analysis of proliferation of the individual clones. Finally, we used micromanipulation of the paired progenies of the single cells and studied self-renewal and differentiation potentials of HSCs again in combination with transplantation.There was a correlation between clone size at day 7 of culture and engraftment at 2 months post-transplantation. Small clones, such as those consisting of <15 cells, often showed high-level multilineage engraftment, while clones consisting of \u226540 cells showed very low levels of engraftment. Daily observation of cell divisions of individual clones revealed that some HSCs are in the G0 state for as long as 1 week, despite the presence of permissive cytokines. Studies using micromanipulation of paired progenies documented the ability of an HSC to generate two HSCs, as well as asymmetric cell divisions.Single-cell sorting combined with short-term culture of individual putative HSCs provides an efficient method for single HSC transplantation.

During in vivo test, we used mice that were bled approximately 0.5 mL by retro-orbital bleeding at day 0 as our anemia model.We found that polysaccharide (ASPS) was the major component responsible for the hematopoietic effect of Angelica sinensis. The hematopoietic activity was through the stimulation of secretion of interleukin-6 and GM colony-stimulating factor, and the amounts of these hematopoietic growth factors secreted, in general, agreed with the number of GM colony formations. Administration of low-dose ASPS (2.3 mg ASPS/kg body weight per day) could significantly accelerate the recovery of hemoglobin level of the blood-loss mice to its original value, as compared to the control (p < 0.05). Moreover, the colony-forming ability of bone marrow cells that were removed from mice that received ASPS was also markedly increased (p < 0.05) during ex vivo test.Results of this study demonstrated the potential of ASPS for treatment of anemia.",

The aims of this study were to establish an in vivo platelet and erythrocyte labeling method using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), determine the most appropriate mathematical model for lifespan analysis, and apply both to the study of factors that control platelet and erythrocyte lifespans.Control, c-mpl knockout (KO), and Bcl-XL mutant mice were injected with CFSE and platelet and erythrocyte fluorescence followed over time.

Mathematical modeling revealed the lognormal model gave a robust fit to control and extreme datasets when either extrinsic or intrinsic factors determined lifespan. Using these methods, platelet lifespans were found to be significantly shortened in thrombopoietin-receptor\u2013deficient mice independent of blood loss, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was shown to play a role in prolonging erythrocyte lifespans.The simultaneous study of platelet and erythrocyte lifespans using in vivo CFSE labeling with lognormal modeling yielded insight into common intrinsic and extrinsic platelet and erythrocyte lifespan determinants and provides an improved methodology for use in this field of research.",

We measured cCD33 levels in the plasma of 48 healthy subjects and in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 98), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 46), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 50), and myeloproliferative disorder (n = 49).Patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders had significantly higher concentrations of cCD33 than the other patient groups and normal individuals (p = 0.0001), and among these groups, MDS patients displayed the lowest cCD33 levels (p = 0.02). Circulating CD33 values correlated positively with the CD33+ blast cell counts in these patients.

Vesicle recycling was monitored by acridine orange and FM1-43 staining and glutamate release activity was assessed by an enzyme-linked fluorimetric assay. Genetically modified MEG-01 cells, with deletion or overexpression of SNARE and vesicular proteins, were also examined for glutamate release activity.We demonstrated that megakaryocytes express numerous proteins required for vesicular glutamate release, including core SNARE proteins, vesicle-associated membrane protein, soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein\u221223, and syntaxin, as well as specific glutamate-loading vesicle proteins, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Moreover, active vesicle recycling and differentiation-dependent glutamate release were observed in megakaryocytes. Vesicle-associated membrane protein\u2212deficient MEG-01 cells, which are impaired in vesicle recycling, showed a 30% decrease in released glutamate, whereas overexpression of VGLUT1 exhibited up to a 2.2-fold increase in glutamate release.These data show that glutamate release from megakaryocytes occurs in a SNARE-dependent, exocytotic manner and is increased during differentiation, suggesting that manipulation of glutamate signaling could influence megakaryocytopoiesis and, therefore, offer a suitable target for the treatment of thrombosis and other hematological disorders.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the protein patterns of platelets from patients with stable or acute coronary atherosclerosis (CAD), in which platelets play a key role.A proteomic approach was adopted to investigate specific protein patterns in platelets of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, or of subjects with no history of CAD.Six differentially expressed proteins were identified: two involved in energy metabolism (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase [OGDH], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]); three were associated with cytoskeleton-based processes (\u03b3-actin, coronin 1B, and pleckstrin); and one involved in protein degradation (proteasome subunit type 8). Expression levels of OGDH and a cleaved form of \u03b3-actin were significantly higher in the platelets of patients than in controls, whereas that of LDH was higher only in the platelets of patients with acute coronary disease. The increases in protein expression of OGDH and LDH are paralleled by changes in their functional activities. Coronin and proteasome subunit type 8 were less expressed in the platelets of patients, as were the basic isoforms of pleckstrin.The platelet proteome is altered in CAD patients with stable or acute coronary syndrome possibly because of the ongoing atherosclerotic process. The identified protein changes not previously connected with CAD were an increase in the energy metabolism enzymes and alterations in the proteins associated with cytoskeleton-based processes, both of which indicate platelet activation.",

NK-cell cytotoxicity was evaluated after isolation and culture. Expression of NKG2D, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL1 was monitored during expansion.Highly T- and B-cell\u2212depleted NK cells were obtained and enriched 2.6-fold. The optimal cytokine concentration for expansion was 10 ng/mL for IL-2 or 50 ng/mL for IL-15. NK-cell cytotoxicity was significantly improved after an overnight incubation with 10 or 50 ng/mL IL-2 or with 2, 10, or 50 ng/mL IL-15, and after 13 days with 50 ng/mL IL-15. The use of a combination of IL-2 and IL-15 showed no additional benefit and negative results were obtained with IL-7. The three NK cell receptors were significantly upregulated after culture, mainly with IL-2 or IL-15.In our study, 10 ng/mL IL-2 or 50 ng/mL IL-15 were the optimal concentrations for expansion and were equivalent in significantly enhancing cytotoxicity and modifying NK-cell receptor expression patterns.",

Biological activity of recombinant xlEPO expressed in COS-1 cells was evaluated using xlEPOR-expressing murine FDC/P2 cells and human EPO-dependent UT-7/EPO cells. Expression of xlepo messenger RNA in adult X. laevis tissues in the normal state and under the condition of phenylhydrazine-induced anemia was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.In the encoded protein, the positions of four cysteine residues were conserved; however, xlEPO had only 38% identity with human EPO. N-glycosylation sites were absent. Recombinant xlEPO induced proliferation of cell lines expressing xlEPOR and UT-7/EPO, confirming biological activity and cross-species reactivity. Despite little primary amino acid sequence similarity, the evolutionary highly conserved sequence NFLRGK was identified in the EPOR-binding site 1\u00a0region as in the human EPO protein. Strong expression of xlepo messenger RNA was detected in the lung and liver, especially in fractionated hepatocytes. No marked increase in xlepo expression was seen in the lung and liver of phenylhydrazine-induced anemic X. laevis.We confirmed that xlEPO is the ligand to the previously reported xlEPOR in X.\u00a0laevis. xlEPO shares structural and functional similarities and differences with mammalian counterparts, and regulation of xlepo expression and its influence on the erythropoietic system appears to be unique.",

IL-21 may either induce apoptosis or promote growth in different lymphoid malignancies. We therefore investigated the IL-21/IL-21R system in follicular lymphoma (FL) cells.IL-21R expression was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V\u2212propidium iodide staining. Signaling via IL-21R was studied using antibodies specific for phosphorylated Janus-activating kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins by Western Blot.IL-21R was found on primary FL cells in 15 of 15 cases at diagnosis and IL-21 increased apoptosis in 10 of 10 FL samples. However, cells from areas of diffuse growth in FL and from two diffuse lymphomas evolved from previous FL, showed low IL-21R expression. The latter were also resistant to IL-21\u2212mediated apoptosis. Among lymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) translocation, only 1 of 7 showed increased apoptosis in response to IL-21 stimulation. This cell line was IL-21R\u2212positive, whereas five of six nonresponsive cell lines showed very low IL-21R expression. Intriguingly, one of the IL-21-resistant cell lines (DOHH2) expressed high levels of IL-21R.

We selected F104S c-Mpl for further study because it exhibited surface expression of the receptor. We measured proliferation of cell lines expressing wild-type or F104S c-Mpl in response to thrombopoetin receptor agonists targeting the extracellular (m-AMP4) or transmembrane (LGD-4665) domains of the receptor by 1-methyltetrazole-5-thiol assay. We measured thrombopoietin binding to the mutant receptor using an in vitro thrombopoietin uptake assay and identified F104 as a potentially critical residue for the interaction between the receptor and its ligand by aligning thrombopoietin and erythropoietin receptors from multiple species.Cells expressing F104S c-Mpl proliferated in response to LGD-4665, but not thrombopoietin or m-AMP4. Compared to thrombopoietin, LGD-4665 stimulates signaling with delayed kinetics in both wild-type and F104S c-Mpl\u2212expressing cells. Although F104S c-Mpl is expressed on the cell surface in our BaF3 cell line model, the mutant receptor does not bind thrombopoietin. Comparison to the erythropoietin receptor suggests that F104 engages in hydrogen-bonding interactions that are critical for binding to thrombopoietin.These findings suggest that a small subset of patients with congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia might respond to treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists, but that responsiveness will depend on the type of mutation and agonist used. We postulate that F104 is critical for thrombopoietin binding. The kinetics of signaling in response to a transmembrane domain\u2212binding agonist are delayed in comparison to thrombopoietin.",

We sought to determine the mechanism(s) involved in its downregulation by BCR-ABL and by interleukin (IL)-4.We used Ba/F3p210-tetOFF cells to study the downregulation of SHIP by BCR-ABL and bone marrow\u2212derived macrophages to study SHIP's downregulation by IL-4.We show herein that BCR-ABL downregulates SHIP, but not SHIP2 or PTEN, and this can be blocked with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2, which inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, or with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. We also show, using anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates, that c-Cbl and Cbl-b are associated with SHIP and that BCR-ABL induces SHIP's polyubiquitination. This ubiquitination can be blocked with PP2, consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP acting as a signal for its ubiquitination. In bone marrow\u2212derived macrophages, IL-4 also leads to the proteasomal degradation of SHIP\u00a0but, unlike in Ba/F3p210-tetOFF cells, SHIP2 is also proteasomally degraded and the degradation of both inositol phosphatases can be prevented with PP2 or MG-132.Our results suggest that SHIP protein levels can be reduced via BCR-ABL and/or Src family member-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP because this triggers its polyubiquitination and degradation within the proteasome.",

We then determined the functional effects of Runx1c using enforced retroviral overexpression in mouse HSCs.We observed differential expression profiles of RUNX1 isoforms during hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs. The RUNX1a and RUNX1b isoforms were expressed consistently throughout hematopoietic differentiation, whereas the RUNX1c isoform was only expressed at the time of emergence of definitive HSCs. RUNX1c was also expressed in the AGM region of E10.5 to E11.5 mouse embryos, the region where definitive HSCs arise. These observations suggested that the RUNX1c isoform may be important for the specification or function of definitive HSCs. However, using retroviral overexpression to study the effect of RUNX1 isoforms on HSCs in a gain-of-function system, no discernable functional difference could be identified between RUNX1 isoforms in mouse HSCs. Overexpression of both RUNX1b and RUNX1c induced quiescence in mouse HSCs in vitro and in vivo.Although the divergent expression profiles of Runx1 isoforms during development suggest specific roles for these proteins at different stages of HSC maturation, we could not detect an important functional distinction in adult mouse HSCs using our assay systems.",

In this study, we evaluated the regeneration capability of Lin\u2212/c-Kit+/Sca-1+ (LKS) cells, the putative hematopoietic stem cells, after radiation exposure at graded doses, for long-term regeneration of peripheral blood in lethally irradiated recipients.LKS primitive progenitor cells, collected from the bone marrow of Ly5.1 mice that had been irradiated at graded increased doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 Gy) were transfused into lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy) Ly5.2 mice. Then, the Ly5.1 chimeric ratio in repopulated peripheral blood cells in the recipients was monitored. A reactive oxygen species (ROS)\u2013reacting CM-H2DCFDA dye was used to evaluate the amount of ROS in LKS primitive progenitor cells with/without irradiation. Moreover, the amount of intracytoplasmic ROS generated after irradiation was estimated in terms of percent attenuation of cellular increase in number by the treatment with 100 \u03bcM N-acetyl-L-cysteine before irradiation.Differential regeneration capability of LKS cells irradiated at graded increased doses showed a dose-dependent suppression of regeneration of peripheral blood in the recipient mice as compared with LKS cells without radiation exposure. The amount of intracytoplasmic ROS in LKS cells was much smaller than that in mature bone marrow cells, and that of ROS in LKS increased slightly after radiation exposure, as evaluated by CM-H2DCFDA dye fluorescence analysis. The estimated amount of ROS generated in LKS cells after radiation exposure was different between progenitor cells for early regeneration and those for late regeneration; namely, the amount of ROS in progenitors on day 270 were estimated to be smaller than that in progenitors for day 35 or day 90.Because of the small amount of generated radiation-induced ROS calculated in terms of attenuation rate after N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment, progenitor cells regenerating peripheral blood cells 270 days after transfusion were assumed to be anaerobic and more immature and radioresistant than those on day 35 or day 90. However, limited long-term regeneration capability (up to 270 days) of steady-state LKS cells than that of unfractionated rescue bone marrow cells suggests that LKS cells do not seem to be true hematopoietic stem cells.",

A high number of variables have been shown to play a role in aGVHD, but the search for a predictive algorithm is still ongoing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) represent an attractive alternative to multivariate analysis for clinical prognosis. So far, no reports have investigated the ability of ANNs in predicting HSCT outcome.We compared the prognostic performance of ANNs with that of logistic regression (LR) in 78 \u03b2-thalassemia major patients given unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-four independent variables were analyzed for their potential impact on outcomes.Twenty-six patients (33.3%) developed grade II to IV aGVHD. In multivariate analysis, homozygosity for donor KIR haplotype A (p = 0.03), donor age (p = 0.05), and donor homozygosity for the deletion of the human leukocyte antigen\u2212G 14-bp polymorphism (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) were independently significantly correlated to aGVHD. The mean sensitivity of LR and ANNs (capability of predicting aGVHD in patients who developed aGVHD) in test datasets was 21.7% and 83.3%, respectively (p < 0.001); the mean specificity (capability of predicting absence of aGVHD in patients who did not develop aGVHD) was 80.5% and 90.1%, respectively (p = NS).Although ANNs are unable to calculate the weight of single variables on outcomes, they were found to have a better performance than LR. A combination of these two methods could be more efficient in predicting outcomes and help tailor GVHD prophylaxis regimens according to the predicted risk of each patient. Whether ANN technology will provide better predictive performance when applied to other datasets remains to be confirmed.",

The drug activity at the molecular level was analyzed by Western blotting. PHA-793887 was also tested in vivo in several leukemia xenograft models.PHA-793887 was cytotoxic for leukemic cell lines in vitro, with IC50 ranging from 0.3 to 7 \u03bcM (mean: 2.9 \u03bcM), regardless of any specific chromosomal aberration. At these doses, the drug was not cytotoxic for normal unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Interestingly, in colony assays PHA-793887 showed very high activity against leukemia cell lines, with an IC50 <0.1 \u03bcM (mean: 0.08 \u03bcM), indicating that it has efficient and prolonged antiproliferative activity. PHA-793887 induced cell-cycle arrest, inhibited Rb and nucleophosmin phosphorylation, and modulated cyclin E and cdc6 expression at low doses (0.2\u22121 \u03bcM) and induced apoptosis at the highest dose (5 \u03bcM). It was also effective in vivo in both subcutaneous xenograft and primary leukemic disseminated models that better mimic naturally occurring human disease. Interestingly, in one disseminated model derived from a relapsed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoid leukemia patient, PHA-793887 showed strong therapeutic activity also when treatment was started after establishment of high disease burden.We conclude that PHA-793887 has promising therapeutic activity against acute leukemias in vitro and in vivo.",

Mixed findings have been reported for the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on radiation-induced injury to the hematopoietic system. We investigated the consequences of different regimens of the ACE inhibitor captopril on radiation-induced hematopoietic injury.C57BL/6 mice were either sham-irradiated or exposed to 60Co total body irradiation (0.6 Gy/min). Captopril was provided in the water for different time periods relative to irradiation.In untreated mice, the survival rate from 7.5 Gy was 50% at 30 days postirradiation. Captopril treatment for 7 days prior to irradiation resulted in radiosensitization with 100% lethality and a rapid decline in mature blood cells. In contrast, captopril treatment beginning 1 hour postirradiation and continuing for 30 days resulted in 100% survival, with improved recovery of mature blood cells and multilineage hematopoietic progenitors. In nonirradiated control mice, captopril biphasically modulated Lin\u2212 marrow progenitor cell cycling. After 2 days, captopril suppressed G0\u2212G1 transition and a greater number of cells entered a quiescent state. However, after 7 days of captopril treatment Lin\u2212 progenitor cell cycling increased compared to untreated control mice.These findings suggest that ACE inhibition affects hematopoietic recovery following radiation by modulating the hematopoietic progenitor cell cycle. The timing of captopril treatment relative to radiation exposure differentially affects the viability and repopulation capacity of spared hematopoietic stem cells and, therefore, can result in either radiation protection or radiation sensitization.",

Knockdown by small interfering RNA lipoplexes of \u03b1v-integrins and Rac1 confirmed classical tethering and internalization of rigid RGD-erythrocytes. Upon in vivo administration, tumor endothelium showed pronounced erythrophagocytosis.The pronounced phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes with reduced deformability by angiogenic growth factor\u2212activated endothelial cells evokes new insights in endothelial cell function and suggests a role for these endothelial cells in (hematological) disorders because of their capacity to clear disordered erythrocytes.",

This was due to a decrease in proliferation and more cells accumulating in G0. Moreover, the proportion of HSCs with long-term engraftment potential was increased. Whereas expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes p21cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2 increased in LSK cells by hypoxia, only p21cip1 was upregulated in FLT3\u2212CD34\u2212LSK cells.

C5 cleavage fragments did not chemoattract myeloid progenitors (colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage), but desArgC5a did strongly chemoattract mature nucleated cells. Consistently, CD88 was not detected on CD34+ cells, but appeared on more mature myeloid precursors, monocytes, and granulocytes. Moreover, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\u2212mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear cells had a significantly higher percentage of cells expressing CD88 than nonmobilized peripheral blood. Furthermore, C5a stimulation of granulocytes and monocytes decreased CXCR4 expression and chemotaxis toward an SDF-1 gradient and increased secretion of MMP-9 and expression of MT1\u2212MMP and carboxypeptidase M.C5 cleavage fragments not only induce a highly proteolytic microenvironment in human bone marrow, which perturbs retention through the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis, but also strongly chemoattracts granulocytes, promoting their egress into mobilized peripheral blood, which is crucial for subsequent mobilization of HSPC.",

Host-type CD8 T cells were shown to be required for these anti-tumor effects in the murine model. Because sustained host CD8 T-cell activation was observed in the murine bone marrow following the disappearance of donor chimerism in the peripheral blood, we hypothesized that donor antigen presentation in the bone marrow might be prolonged.To assess this hypothesis, we established mixed chimerism with green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2212positive allogeneic bone marrow cells, induced rejection of the donor cells by giving recipient leukocyte infusions, and utilized in vivo microscopy to follow GFP-positive cells.After peripheral donor leukocytes disappeared, GFP persisted within host myeloid cells surrounding the blood vessels in the bone marrow, suggesting that the host myeloid cells captured donor-derived GFP protein.Because the host-vs-graft reaction promotes induction of anti-tumor responses in this model, this retention of donor-derived protein may play a role in the efficacy of recipient leukocyte infusions as an anti-tumor therapy.",

Cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometric assay. Expression of proteins related to apoptosis and cell signal transduction were assessed using Western blot. In vivo antitumor activity of EriB was examined in murine xenograft B- and T-lymphoma models, with in situ cell apoptosis detected by terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick-end labeling assay.EriB significantly inhibited lymphoma cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in association with caspase activation. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were downregulated, with proapoptotic member Bax stable or upregulated, resulting in reduced Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax ratios. Meanwhile, multiple signal transduction pathways were involved in lymphoma cell apoptosis in response to EriB, including inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and AKT pathways, and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. AKT inactivation was related to increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, decreased expression of antiapoptotic phosphorylated form of Bad, and NF-\u03baB activator I\u03baB kinase \u03b1/\u03b2. ERK activation corresponded to reactive oxygen species production and could be blocked by antioxidant dithiothreitol.

NK-cell activation was triggered via stimulation of the Fc receptor with immunoglobulin G aggregates, rituximab-labeled HLA-defined CD20-positive B-lymphoblast cell lines or CD20-positive B-lymphoma cell lines. The effect of KIR ligation by anti-KIR antibodies and HLA, the HLA expression density and rituximab concentrations on the efficacy of ADCC were analyzed in granzyme B ELISPOT measuring NK-cell activation and fluorescein-activated cell sorting cytotoxicity assay.HLA, but not CD20 expression density correlated with NK-cell activity against rituximab-labeled targets. ADCC was increased or decreased following HLA shielding or KIR activation by anti-KIR antibodies, respectively. Herein we show that rituximab-induced ADCC is attenuated upon ligation of KIR by HLA molecules expressed on human B-lymphoma target cells. Moreover, anti-KIR antibodies do not only block KIR/HLA interactions, but display agonistic effects at the KIR, which has to be considered for therapeutical applications.KIR activation and HLA expression density are critical determinants for the efficacy of rituximab treatment.

Previously, we have correlated entry of murine lung-derived microvesicles into murine bone marrow cells with expression of pulmonary epithelial cell-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) in these marrow cells. The present studies establish that entry of lung-derived microvesicles into marrow cells is a prerequisite for marrow expression of pulmonary epithelial cell-derived mRNA.Murine bone marrow cells cocultured with rat lung, but separated from them using a cell-impermeable membrane (0.4-\u03bcm pore size), were analyzed using species-specific primers (for rat or mouse).These studies revealed that surfactant B and C mRNA produced by murine marrow cells were of both rat and mouse origin. Similar results were obtained using murine lung cocultured with rat bone marrow cells or when bone marrow cells were analyzed for the presence of species-specific albumin mRNA after coculture with rat or murine liver. These studies show that microvesicles both deliver mRNA to marrow cells and mediate marrow cell transcription of tissue-specific mRNA. The latter likely underlies the longer-term stable change in genetic phenotype that has been observed. We have also observed microRNA in lung-derived microvesicles, and studies with RNase-treated microvesicles indicate that microRNA negatively modulates pulmonary epithelial cell-specific mRNA levels in cocultured marrow cells. In addition, we have also observed tissue-specific expression of brain, heart, and liver mRNA in cocultured marrow cells, suggesting that microvesicle-mediated cellular phenotype change is a universal phenomena.These studies suggest that cellular systems are more phenotypically labile than previously considered.",

These studies better define the developmental origin and reveal the relationship between these two cell types, as well as provide a more complete biological characterization.hESCs are cocultured on M2-10B4 stromal cells or Wnt1-expressing M2-10B4 for 13 to 15 days to generate a CD34+ cell population. These cells are isolated using a magnetic antibody separation kit and cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes in EC medium. To induce SMC differentiation, culture medium is changed and a morphological and phenotypic change occurs within 24 to 48\u00a0hours.CD34+ vascular progenitor cells give rise to ECs and SMCs. The two populations express respective cell-specific transcripts and proteins, exhibit intracellular calcium in response to various agonists, and form robust tube-like structures when cocultured in Matrigel. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured under SMC conditions do not exhibit a change in phenotype or genotype. Wnt1-overexpressing stromal cells produced an increased number of progenitor cells.The ability to generate large numbers of ECs and SMCs from a single vascular progenitor cell population is promising for therapeutic use to treat a variety of diseased and ischemic conditions.

TNF-\u03b1 inhibition of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell growth involves type I TNF-\u03b1 receptor (TNF-RI) and type II TNF-\u03b1 receptor (TNF-RII). However, the role of TNF-RI vs TNF-RII in mediating this response is less clear. Full induction of NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent gene expression through TNF-RI requires the transcriptional coactivator SIMPL (substrate that interacts with mouse pelle-like kinase). To address the role of SIMPL in TNF-\u03b1-dependent signaling in hematopoiesis, endothelial cells and hematopoietic progenitors expressing SIMPL short hairpin RNA were characterized.In vitro gene expression and progenitor assays employing SIMPL short hairpin RNA were used to examine the requirement for SIMPL in TNF-\u03b1\u2013dependent effects upon cytokine gene expression and hematopoietic progenitor cell growth. Competitive repopulation studies were used to extend these studies in vivo.SIMPL is required for full TNF-RI\u2013dependent expression of NF-\u03baB\u2013controlled cytokines in endothelial cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion is not affected if progenitors lacked SIMPL or if progenitors are treated with human TNF-\u03b1, which signals through TNF-RI. In the absence of SIMPL, human TNF-\u03b1 leads to a dramatic decrease in progenitor cell expansion that is not due to apoptosis.

Ang-1 enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt, while Ang-2 again reduced the effect of Ang-1. The colony assay demonstrated that neither Ang-1, nor Ang-2 influenced the colony formation of HSCs. BM transplantation assay, following in vitro cultivation of HSCs with angiopoietins, showed that Ang-1 maintained long-term repopulating activity of HSCs, while the addition of Ang-2 interfered drastically with the effects of Ang-1.Gene expression analysis and BM transplantation assay demonstrated that Ang-1 maintained HSC activity in an in vitro culture. In contrast, Ang-2 reversed the effects of Ang-1/Tie2 signaling in the regulation of long-term HSCs. Our data suggest that Ang-1 is a dominant ligand for the Tie2 receptor in long HSCs in BM.",

Although the specific granule deficiency phenotype has been replicated in C/EBP\u03b5\u2212/\u2212 (knockout [KO]) mice, the mechanisms by which C/EBP\u03b5 mutations act to decrease neutrophil function are not entirely clear.In order to determine the role of C/EBP\u03b5 in neutrophil differentiation and migration, we generated immortalized progenitor cell lines from C/EBP\u03b5 KO and wild-type mice and performed expression and flow cytometric analysis and functional studies.Expression of lineage-specific cell surface antigens on our in vitro differentiated cell lines revealed persistent expression of monocytic markers on KO granulocytes. We verified this in primary murine peripheral blood and bone marrow cells. In addition, KO bone marrow had an increase in immature myeloid precursors at the common myeloid progenitor and granulocyte/monocyte progenitor levels, suggesting a critical role for C/EBP\u03b5 not only in granulocyte maturation beyond the promyelocyte stage, but also in the monocyte/granulocyte lineage decision.

     "abstract": "It is generally assumed that plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patients do not express the stem cell marker CD34. This assumption has led to several clinical trials based on autologous CD34+ cell transplantation. However, the results of these trials have been disappointing.We investigated the presence of CD34+ cell populations in RPMI 8226, KARPAS 417, and U266 MM cell lines in vitro and during their growth as plasmacytoma tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice, and in plasma cells isolated from the bone marrow of 38 MM patients.We showed that in both patients and cell lines, a small population of plasma cells expresses CD34. These cells display morphological characteristics of MM plasma cells, are CD19-negative, and express B7-H1 (PD-L1), a T-cell inhibitory molecule. In patients, CD34+CD138+ cells expressed Ki67, a marker for proliferation. Moreover, when cells from the human myeloma cell line U266 were injected into nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice, the U266-derived plasmacytoma tumors showed a large CD34+CD138+ Ki67+ cell population, indicating that these cells were not quiescent in vivo.MM patients carry a small subpopulation of cycling CD34+CD138+B7-H1+ plasma cells. Their presence may limit the clinical benefits of autologous CD34+ cell transplantation.",

Importantly, GAS6 supports survival and prevents apoptosis from chemotherapy of E2A/PBX1-positive ALL cells by inducing dormancy.These data suggest that GAS6/Mer axis regulates homing and survival of the E2A/PBX1-positive B-cell precursor ALL in the bone marrow niche.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a high incidence of osteolytic bone lesions, which have been previously correlated with the gene expression profiles of MM cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional patterns of cells in the bone microenvironment and their relationships with the presence of osteolysis in MM patients.Both mesenchymal (MSC) and osteoblastic (OB) cells were isolated directly from bone biopsies of MM patients and controls to perform gene expression profiling by microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction on selected bone-related genes.We identified a series of upregulated and downregulated genes that were differentially expressed in the MSC cells of osteolytic and nonosteolytic patients. Comparison of the osteolytic and nonosteolytic samples also showed that the MSC cells and OB had distinct transcriptional patterns. No significantly modulated genes were found in the OBs of the osteolytic and nonosteolytic patients.Our data suggest that the gene expression profiles of cells of the bone microenvironment are different in MM patients and controls, and that MSC cells, but not OBs, have a distinct transcriptional pattern associated with the occurrence of bone lesions in MM patients. These data support the idea that alterations in MSC cells may be involved in MM bone disease.",

     "abstract": "Cord blood banks provide fully human leukocyte antigen\u2212typed cells, from which a set of standard induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for use in allogenic transplantation can be derived. Hence, the ability to generate iPS cells from cord blood cells has the potential to provide a suitable source for clinical transplantation. The aim of this work is to determine the reprogramming methods, culture conditions, and cell fractions that can be used to generate iPS cells from cord blood cells effectively.CD34+, mononucleated, and derived adherent cells from cord blood were cultured in hematopoietic medium (X-vivo10 containing 50 ng/mL interleukin-6, 50 ng/mL soluble interleukin-6 receptor, 50 ng/mL stem cell factor, 10 ng/mL thrombopoietin, and 20 ng/mL Flit3/4 ligand) 3 days prior to viral infection. Cells were then infected with retroviral constructs driving the expression of OCT3/4, SOX2, Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4, c-MYC, and enhanced green fluorescent protein together with or without the p53 knockdown lentiviral construct Shp53 pLKO.1-puro. Infected cells were then cultured for an additional 4 days in hematopoietic culture medium before being transferred onto mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) or SNL76/7 feeder cells in human embryonic stem cell medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F-12 containing 20% knockout serum replacement, 200\u00a0mM l-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 0.1\u00a0mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor). Subsequently, the number of embryonic stem cell\u2212like colonies that emerged in the following 4 weeks was scored. Expression of a number of pluripotency makers were examined by immunochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the differentiation potential of selected colonies was determined by teratoma formation in severe combined immunodeficient mice and in vitro culture.Repression of p53 expression by the addition of a lentiviral p53 short-hairpin RNA expression vector increased the frequency of formation of iPS-like colonies from 1 (on average) to around 100 per 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells when infected cells were grown on SNL feeder cells.iPS cells can be generated easily from CD34+ cord blood cells through the addition of p53 inhibition to standard reprogramming conditions.",

Most transplantation models have required conditioning in which the recipients were either irradiated or treated with chemotherapy prior to injection of human leukemia cells. In this study, we reported an undescribed model in which adult ALL cells were injected into unconditioned newborn nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice via an intrahepatic route.Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood were collected from patients with ALL at diagnosis or relapse. CD34+ selected lymphoblasts or mononuclear cells were transplanted as mentioned previously. Cells were also transplanted into sublethally irradiated adult mice via intravenous route for comparison. Leukemia engraftment was enumerated from mouse BM 6 to 18 weeks after transplantation. Clonality of the engrafting cells was examined based on IGH rearrangement and fluorescent in situ hybridization.Five of 13 ALL samples engrafted into the recipient BM 6 to 18 weeks after transplantation. Engrafted cells recapitulated the immunophenotype and cytogenetic characteristics of the original samples. Engraftment in BM and peripheral blood was significantly correlated. Importantly, there was significant correlation of engraftment between this and the conventional adult nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mouse model involving irradiation.Our results demonstrated that this unconditioned newborn mouse model could be used for enumeration of leukemia initiating cells in ALL and should be further evaluated.",

However, no suitable experimental model to quantify transforming potential of individual mutations and functional cooperation between defined genetic/epigenetic alterations has been established so far.Based on cytokine-independent proliferation as a marker for cellular transformation, we used limiting dilution and clonal expansion of retrovirally transduced cells in the presence or absence of cytokines to quantify the transformation potential of constitutively active receptor mutants and short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting transcription factors by RNA interference. Interleukin-3\u2212dependent 32D cells were transduced with \u03b2GMR-I374N, c-KitV558D, or c-MplS368C, and cloning efficiencies were normalized to viral integration numbers as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.In this assay, c-KitV558D and c-MplS368C were about 25-fold more effective than \u03b2GMR-I374N. To study cooperation of defined genetic/epigenetic aberrations, receptor mutants were coexpressed with shRNAs targeting PU.1 and p53. In p53-hypomorphic, but not in 32D wild-type cells, RNA interference against PU.1 significantly enhances transformation efficacy by c-KitV558D, but not by c-MplS368C, as compared to control shRNA. These data demonstrate nonredundant, receptor-specific and p53-dependent responses to reduced PU.1 expression in 32D cells.This cell culture model represents a useful tool to quantify hematopoietic cell transformation by defined genetic and epigenetic alterations.",

Median follow-up of unchanged BCR-ABL transcript level was 12 months (range, 6 \u2212 64). We tested this group of patient for BCR-ABL mutations to reveal resistance development and to evaluate the risk of disease progression.Altogether, 134 samples of peripheral blood of these 32 patients were tested for mutation in BCR-ABL kinase domain.Mutation was detected by direct sequencing in 9 of 32 patients (28%). Loss of complete cytogenetic remission or 1 log rise of BCR-ABL was observed in five of nine patients at a median of 5 months (range, 4\u221217) since first detection of mutation. One patient with no mutation relapsed 12 months after the start of the BCR-ABL plateau. In 5 of 32 patients without mutation (16%), BCR-ABL level significantly decreased after the first plateau to levels that stayed unchanged for a median of 11 months (range, 7\u221228).We show here that the BCR-ABL constant levels \u22650.1% (BCR-ABL plateau) in imatinib-responding patients may indicate mutation analysis.

Considering the significant role of telomerase in malignant transformation, we studied the effect of IM on telomerase activity (TA) and regulation in BCR-ABL\u2013positive and \u2013negative cells, sensitive and resistant to IM.Through combining telomeric repeat amplification protocol for detecting TA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blots for detecting RNA and protein levels of telomerase regulating proteins and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we showed that IM targets telomerase and the signal transduction cascade upstream of it.IM significantly inhibited TA in BCR-ABL\u2013positive and \u2013negative cells and in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. TA inhibition was also observed in BCR-ABL positive cells resistant to IM at drug concentrations that did not lead to a reduction in BCR-ABL expression. In addition, a reduction in phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated PDK-1 was also detected following IM incubation.We demonstrate an inhibitory effect of IM on TA and on the AKT/PDK pathway. Because this effect was observed in cell expressing the BCR-ABL protein as well as cells not expressing it, and in cells sensitive as well as resistant to IM, it is reasonable to assume that the inhibitory effect of IM on TA is not mediated through known IM targets. The results of this study show that cells resistant to IM with regard to its effect on BCR-ABL could still be sensitive to IM treatment regarding other cellular components.",

With the growing number of associated molecules found to form functional complexes with CD44, we analyzed a larger cohort of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and equivalently treated DLBCL patients to define the prognostic role of such CD44-associated molecules.Two-hundred and ninety formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary DLBCL tissue samples were analyzed in tissue microarrays. To obtain potential biologically meaningful associations, optimal cutoff values were established by receiver operating characteristic curves. The prognostic significance of every possible multimarker phenotype was also addressed.We showed that coexpression of any of the CD44v with the receptor for hyaluronic acid\u2212mediated motility (RHAMM, CD168) identifies a subgroup of DLBCL patients with a very poor prognosis, independent of the International Prognostic Index. These patients did not show C-MYC translocations or amplifications. CD44v-RHAMM coexpression was most prevalent in non\u2212germinal center DLBCL cases and usually coincided with expression of osteopontin.Evaluation of CD44v-RHAMM coexpression may improve the accuracy of DLBCL prognosis and identify a subgroup of patients who will benefit from therapeutic alternatives to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone.",
