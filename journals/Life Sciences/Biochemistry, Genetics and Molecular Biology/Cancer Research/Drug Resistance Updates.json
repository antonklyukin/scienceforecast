     "abstract": "Nitrofurantoin is an old antibiotic and an important first-line oral antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections. However despite its long term use for over 60 years, little information is available with respect to its dose justification and this may be the reason of highly variable recommended doses and dosing schedules. Furthermore, nitrofurantoin is not a uniform product -crystal sizes of nitrofurantoin, and therefore pharmacokinetic properties, differ significantly by product. Moreover, pharmacokinetic profiling of some products is even lacking, or difficult to interpret because of its unstable chemical properties. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data is now slowly becoming available. This review provides an overview of nitrofurantoins antibacterial, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This shows that a clear rationale of current dosing regimens is scanty.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the treatment and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, these patients display disease progression driven by the onset of acquired mechanisms of drug resistance that limit the efficacy of EGFR-TKI to no longer than one year. Moreover, a small fraction of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients does not benefit from this targeted treatment due to primary (i.e. intrinsic) mechanisms of resistance that preexist prior to TKI drug treatment. Research efforts are focusing on deciphering the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance, which should prompt the development of novel antitumor agents that surmount such chemoresistance modalities.The capability of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate the expression of many oncogenic pathways and their central role in lung cancer progression, provided new directions for research on prognostic biomarkers, as well as innovative tools for predicting patients\u2019 response to systemic therapies. Recent evidence suggests that modulation of key miRNAs may also reverse oncogenic signaling pathways, and potentiate the cytotoxic effect of anti-cancer therapies.In this review, we focus on the putative emerging role of miRNAs in modulating drug resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Moreover, we discuss the current implications of miRNAs analyses in the clinical setting, using both tissue and liquid biopsies, as well as the future potential use of miRNA-based therapies in overcoming resistance to targeted agents like TKIs.",

     "abstract": "Metastatic dissemination of tumor cells represents a major obstacle towards cancer cure. Tumor cells with metastatic capacity are often resistant to chemotherapy. Experimental efforts revealed that the metastatic cascade is a complex process that involves multiple positive and negative regulators. In this respect, several metastasis suppressor genes have been described. Here, we review the role of the metastasis suppressor KiSS1 in regulation of metastasis and in response to antitumor agents. Physiologically, KiSS1 plays a key role in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulating puberty and reproductive functions. KiSS1-derived peptides i.e., kisspeptins, signal through the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54. In cancer, KiSS1 signaling suppresses metastases and maintains dormancy of disseminated malignant cells, by interfering with cell migratory and invasive abilities. Besides, KiSS1 modulates glucose and lipid metabolism, by reprogramming energy production towards oxidative phosphorylation and \u03b2-oxidation. Loss or reduced expression of KiSS1, in part through promoter hypermethylation, is related to the development of metastases in various cancer types, with some conflicting reports. The poorly understood role of KiSS1 in response to chemotherapeutic agents appears to be linked to stimulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and inhibition of cell defense factors (e.g., glutathione S-transferase-\u03c0) as well as autophagy modulation. Deciphering the molecular basis underlying regulation of the metastatic potential is crucial for the establishment of novel treatment strategies.",

Although many of the concepts apply to multiple pathogenic fungi, for the sake of simplicity, we will focus on the validity of using S. cerevisiae as a model organism for two Candida species, C. albicans and C. glabrata. Apart from the general benefits, we explore how S. cerevisiae can specifically be used to improve our knowledge on azole drug resistance and enables fast and efficient screening for novel drug targets in combinatorial therapy. We consider the shortcomings of the model system, yet conclude that it is still opportune to use S. cerevisiae as a model system for pathogenic fungi in this era.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most incurable cancers. GBMs survival rate has not markedly improved, despite new radical surgery protocols, the introduction of new anticancer drugs, new treatment protocols, and advances in radiation techniques. The low efficacy of therapy, and short interval between remission and recurrence, could be attributed to the resistance of a small fraction of tumorigenic cells to treatment. The existence and importance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is perceived by some as controversial. Experimental evidences suggest that the presence of therapy-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) could explain tumor recurrence and metastasis. Some scientists, including most of the authors of this review, believe that GSCs are the driving force behind GBM relapses, whereas others however, question the existence of GSCs. Evidence has accumulated indicating that non-tumorigenic cancer cells with high heterogeneity, could undergo reprogramming and become GSCs. Hence, targeting GSCs as the \u201croot cells\u201d initiating malignancy has been proposed to eradicate this devastating disease. Most standard treatments fail to completely eradicate GSCs, which can then cause the recurrence of the disease. To effectively target GSCs, a comprehensive understanding of the biology of GSCs as well as the mechanisms by which these cells survive during treatment and develop into new tumor, is urgently needed. Herein, we provide an overview of the molecular features of GSCs, and elaborate how to facilitate their detection and efficient targeting for therapeutic interventions. We also discuss GBM classifications based on the molecular stem cell subtypes with a focus on potential therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "The successful treatment of cancer has significantly improved as a result of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. However, during chemotherapy, cancer cells evolve and can acquire \u201cmultidrug resistance\u201d (MDR), which significantly limits the efficacy of cancer treatment and impacts patient survival and quality of life. Among the approaches to reverse MDR, modulating reactive oxidative species (ROS) may represent a strategy to kill MDR cancer cells that are mechanistically diverse. ROS in cancer cells play a central role in regulating and inducing apoptosis, thereby modulating cancer cells proliferation, survival and drug resistance. The levels of ROS and the activity of scavenging/anti-oxidant enzymes in drug resistant cancer cells are typically increased compared to non-MDR cancer and normal cells. Consequently, MDR cancer cells may be more susceptible to alterations in ROS levels. Numerous studies suggest that compounds modulating cellular ROS levels can enhance MDR cancer cell death and sensitize MDR cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic drugs.In the current review, we discuss the critical and targetable redox-regulating enzymes, including mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, NADPH oxidases (NOXs), enzymes related to glutathione metabolism, glutamate/cystine antiporter xCT, thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and their roles in regulating cellular ROS levels, drug resistance as well as their clinical significance. We also discuss and summarize the findings in the past decade regarding the efficacy of ROS modulators for the treatment of MDR cancer alone or as sensitizing compounds. Compounds that are efficacious in modulating ROS generation represent a prominent class of drug candidates that warrants evaluation in clinical trials for patients harboring MDR cancers.",

     "abstract": "In multiply resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, complex transposons located in the chromosomal comM gene carry antibiotic and heavy metal resistance determinants. For one type, known collectively as AbaR, the ancestral form, AbaR0, entered a member of global clone 1 (GC1) in the mid 1970s and continued to evolve in situ forming many variants. In AbaR0, antibiotic and mercuric ion resistance genes are located between copies of a cadmium-zinc resistance transposon, Tn6018, and this composite transposon is in a class III transposon, Tn6019, carrying arsenate/arsenite resistance genes and five tni transposition genes. The antibiotic resistance genes in the AbaR0 and derived AbaR3 configurations are aphA1b, blaTEM, catA1, sul1, tetA(A), and cassette-associated aacC1 and aadA1 genes. These genes are in a specific arrangement of fragments from well-known transposons, e.g. Tn1, Tn1721, Tn1696 and Tn2670, that arose in an IncM1 plasmid. All known GC1 lineage 1 isolates carry AbaR0 or AbaR3, which arose around 1990, or a variant derived from one of them. Variants arose via deletions caused by one of three internal IS26s, by recombination between duplicate copies of sul1 or Tn6018, or by gene cassette addition or replacement. A few GC2 isolates also carry an AbaR island with different cassette-associated genes, aacA4 and oxa20.",

     "abstract": "\u03b2-Lactamases are hydrolytic enzymes capable of opening the \u03b2-lactam ring of antibiotics such as penicillin, thus endowing the bacteria that produce them with antibiotic resistance. Of particular medical concern are metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs), with an active site built around coordinated Zn cations. MBLs are pan-reactive enzymes that can break down almost all classes of \u03b2-lactams, including such last-resort antibiotics as carbapenems. They are not only broad-spectrum-reactive but are often plasmid-borne (e.g., the New Delhi enzyme, NDM), and can spread horizontally even among unrelated bacteria. Acquired MBLs are encoded by mobile genetic elements, which often include other resistance genes, making the microbiological situation particularly alarming. There is an urgent need to develop MBL inhibitors in order to rescue our antibiotic armory. A number of such efforts have been undertaken, most notably using the 3D structures of various MBLs as drug-design targets. Structure-guided drug discovery depends on the quality of the structures that are collected in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and on the consistency of the information in dedicated \u03b2-lactamase databases. We conducted a careful review of the crystal structures of class B \u03b2-lactamases, concluding that the quality of these structures varies widely, especially in the regions where small molecules interact with the macromolecules. In a number of examples the interpretation of the bound ligands (e.g., inhibitors, substrate/product analogs) is doubtful or even incorrect, and it appears that in some cases the modeling of ligands was not supported by electron density. For ten MBL structures, alternative interpretations of the original diffraction data could be proposed and the new models have been deposited in the PDB. In four cases, these models, prepared jointly with the authors of the original depositions, superseded the previous deposits. This review emphasizes the importance of critical assessment of structural models describing key drug design targets at the level of the raw experimental data. Since the structures reviewed here are the basis for ongoing design of new MBL inhibitors, it is important to identify and correct the problems with ambiguous crystallographic interpretations, thus enhancing reproducibility in this highly medically relevant area.",

     "abstract": "Head and Neck cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide, with a high prevalence in south East Asia, Brazil and central Europe. Head and Neck Squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with elevated mutational load but lacks specific genetic mutations. Exposure to carcinogens including tobacco and alcohol are the most dominant etiologic factors of HNSCC, while Epstein-Barr (HBV) and Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) are associated with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal carcinoma, respectively. Surgery including open and minimally invasive procedures is considered the standard of care for the majority of oral cavity and early larynx cancers, while radiation therapy or concurrent chemoradiation are used for the other head and neck cancers. The treatment of patients with head and neck cancer is complex and has undergone considerable transformation in the last decade. These modalities include immunotherapy, targeted therapy (small molecule inhibitors or antibodies), or combined modality treatments. Emerging evidence supports a vital role of the immune system in eradicating HNSCC. Cancer cells express programmed death ligand 1 or 2 (PD-L1/2) which binds to the PD receptor on the T-cell, leading to an inactivation of the cytotoxic response of the T-cell. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is another key player, expressed by cancer-activated T-cells, which binds to B7 ligand on the cancer cells, leading to inhibition of T-cells activation. Checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies, were shown to significantly improve disease free survival and overall survival after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, expression of HPV is associated with better response to single modality treatment (e.g. radiotherapy or surgery) and improved survival. In future years we expect to see the establishment of precision medicine modalities in an attempt to extend survival and improve quality of life of advanced stage HNSCC patients. Several phase III clinical trials are in progress to evaluate the utility of checkpoint inhibitors at different treatment settings, including combinations with adjuvant surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor and their spread to distant sites of the body is the leading cause of mortality in metastatic cancer patients. Metastatic cancer cells invade surrounding tissues and blood vessels by forming F-actin-rich protrusions known as invadopodia, which degrade the extracellular matrix and enable invasion of tumor cells through it. Invadopodia have now been observed in vivo, and recent evidence demonstrates direct molecular links between assembly of invadopodia and cancer metastasis in both mouse models and in human patients. While significant progress has been achieved in the last decade in understanding the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways regulating invadopodia formation and function, the application of this knowledge to development of prognostic and therapeutic approaches for cancer metastasis has not been discussed before. Here, we provide a detailed overview of current prognostic markers and tests for cancer metastasis and discuss their advantages, disadvantages, and their predicted efficiency. Using bioinformatic patient database analysis, we demonstrate, for the first time, a significant correlation between invadopodia-associated genes to breast cancer metastasis, suggesting that invadopodia could be used as both a prognostic marker and as a therapeutic target for blocking cancer metastasis. We include here a novel network interaction map of invadopodia-associated proteins with currently available inhibitors, demonstrating a central role for the recently identified EGFR-Pyk2-Src-Arg-cortactin invadopodial pathway, to which re-purposing of existent inhibitors could be used to block breast cancer metastasis. We then present an updated overview of current cancer-related clinical trials, demonstrating the negligible number of trials focusing on cancer metastasis. We also discuss the difficulties and complexity of performing cancer metastasis clinical trials, and the possible development of anti-metastasis drug resistance when using a prolonged preventive treatment with invadopodia inhibitors. This review presents a new perspective on invadopodia-mediated tumor invasiveness and may lead to the development of novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for cancer metastasis.",

Chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin is the cornerstone of the pharmacological treatment of CRC. The introduction of novel targeted agents, as anti-EGFR (i.e. cetuximab, panitumumab) and antiangiogenic (i.e. bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, regorafenib, and ramucirumab) molecules, into the oncologist\u2019s toolbox has led to significant improvements in the life expectancy of advanced CRC patients, but with a substantial increase in toxicity burden. In this respect, pharmacogenomics has largely been applied to the personalization of CRC chemotherapy, focusing mainly on the study of inhered polymorphisms in genes encoding phase I and II enzymes, ATP-binding cassette (ABC)/solute carrier (SLC) membrane transporters, proteins involved in DNA repair, folate pathway and immune response. These research efforts have led to the identification of some validated genetic markers of chemotherapy toxicity, for fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan. No validated genetic determinants of oxaliplatin-specific toxicity, as peripheral neuropathy, has thus far been established. The contribution of host genetic markers in predicting the toxicity associated with novel targeted agents\u2019 administration is still controversial due to the heterogeneity of published data. Pharmacogenomics guidelines have been published by some international scientific consortia such as the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) strongly suggesting a pre-treatment dose adjustment of irinotecan based on UGT1A1*28 genotype and of fluoropyrimidines based on some DPYD genetic variants, to increase treatment safety. However, these recommendations are still poorly applied at the patient\u2019s bedside. Several ongoing projects in the U.S. and Europe are currently evaluating how pharmacogenomics can be implemented successfully in daily clinical practice. The majority of drug-related adverse events are still unexplained, and a great deal of ongoing research is aimed at improving knowledge of the role of pharmacogenomics in increasing treatment safety. In this review, the issue of pre-treatment identification of CRC patients at risk of toxicity via the analysis of patients\u2019 genetic profiles is addressed. Available pharmacogenomics guidelines with ongoing efforts to implement them in clinical practice and new exploratory markers for clinical validation are described.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells employ both conventional oxidative metabolism and glycolytic anaerobic metabolism. However, their proliferation is marked by a shift towards increasing glycolytic metabolism even in the presence of O2 (Warburg effect). HIF1, a major hypoxia induced transcription factor, promotes a dissociation between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a process limiting the efficient production of ATP and citrate which otherwise would arrest glycolysis. The Warburg effect also favors an intracellular alkaline pH which is a driving force in many aspects of cancer cell proliferation (enhancement of glycolysis and cell cycle progression) and of cancer aggressiveness (resistance to various processes including hypoxia, apoptosis, cytotoxic drugs and immune response). This metabolism leads to epigenetic and genetic alterations with the occurrence of multiple new cell phenotypes which enhance cancer cell growth and aggressiveness. In depth understanding of these metabolic changes in cancer cells may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, which when combined with existing cancer treatments, might improve their effectiveness and/or overcome chemoresistance.",

     "abstract": "In addition to the well-known strategies of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation, bacterial populations possess an additional survival strategy to endure hostile environments or antibiotic exposure. A small fraction of transiently antibiotic-tolerant phenotypical variants, called persister cells, is capable of surviving treatment with high doses of antibiotics. When antibiotic pressure drops, persisters that switch back to a normal phenotype can resume growth, ensuring survival of the bacterial population. Persister cells have been identified in every major pathogen, contribute to the antibiotic tolerance observed in biofilms, and are responsible for the recalcitrant nature of chronic infections. Also, evidence is accumulating that persister cells can contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Consequently, effective treatment of persister cells could greatly improve patient outcome. The small number of persisters and the redundancy in mechanisms of persister formation impede target-based development of anti-persister therapies. Nonetheless, the armory of anti-persister molecules is increasing. This review presents a comprehensive overview of anti-persister molecules and strategies described in literature to date and offers perspectives on potential anti-persistence targets and methods for the development of future therapies.

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressive transcription factor p53 regulates a wide array of cellular processes that confer upon cells an essential protection against cancer development. Wild-type p53 regulates gene expression by directly binding to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. p53 missense mutations are the most common mutations in malignant cells and can be regarded as synonymous with anticancer drug resistance and poor prognosis. The current review provides an overview of how the extraordinary variety of more than 2000 different mutant p53 proteins, known as the p53 mutome, affect the interaction of p53 with DNA. We discuss how the classification of p53 mutations to loss of function (LOF), gain of function (GOF), and dominant-negative (DN) inhibition of a remaining wild-type allele, hides a complex p53 mutation spectrum that depends on the distinctive nature of each mutant protein, requiring different therapeutic strategies for each mutant p53 protein. We propose to regard the different mutant p53 categories as continuous variables, that may not be independent of each other. In particular, we suggest here to consider GOF mutations as a special subset of LOF mutations, especially when mutant p53 binds to DNA through cooperation with other transcription factors, and we present a model for GOF mechanism that consolidates many observations on the GOF phenomenon. We review how novel mutant p53 targeting approaches aim to restore a wild-type-like DNA interaction and to overcome resistance to cancer therapy.",

The development of small molecule inhibitors was once an accepted \u201cone-size fits all\u201d approach to these varied problems, but persistence and resistance threaten to return society to a pre-antibiotic era. Only five essential cellular targets in bacteria have been developed for the majority of our clinically-relevant antibiotics. These include: cell wall synthesis, cell membrane function, protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and antimetabolites. Many of these targets are now compromised through rapidly spreading antimicrobial resistance and the need to target non-replicating cells (persisters). Recently, an unprecedented medical breakthrough was achieved by the FDA approval of the drug bedaquiline (BDQ, trade name Sirturo) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease. BDQ targets the membrane-bound F1Fo-ATP synthase, validating cellular energy generating machinery as a new target space for drug discovery. Recently, BDQ and several other FDA-approved drugs have been demonstrated to be respiratory \u201cuncouplers\u201d disrupting transmembrane electrochemical gradients, in addition to binding to enzyme targets.

     "abstract": "Despite substantial advances in the treatment of various cancers, many patients still receive anti-cancer therapies that hardly eradicate tumor cells but inflict considerable side effects. To provide the best treatment regimen for an individual patient, a major goal in molecular oncology is to identify predictive markers for a personalized therapeutic strategy. Regarding novel targeted anti-cancer therapies, there are usually good markers available. Unfortunately, however, targeted therapies alone often result in rather short remissions and little cytotoxic effect on the cancer cells. Therefore, classical chemotherapy with frequent long remissions, cures, and a clear effect on cancer cell eradication remains a corner stone in current anti-cancer therapy. Reliable biomarkers which predict the response of tumors to classical chemotherapy are rare, in contrast to the situation for targeted therapy. For the bulk of cytotoxic therapeutic agents, including DNA-damaging drugs, drugs targeting microtubules or antimetabolites, there are still no reliable biomarkers used in the clinic to predict tumor response. To make progress in this direction, meticulous studies of classical chemotherapeutic drug action and resistance mechanisms are required. For this purpose, novel functional screening technologies have emerged as successful technologies to study chemotherapeutic drug response in a variety of models. They allow a systematic analysis of genetic contributions to a drug-responsive or \u2212sensitive phenotype and facilitate a better understanding of the mode of action of these drugs. These functional genomic approaches are not only useful for the development of novel targeted anti-cancer drugs but may also guide the use of classical chemotherapeutic drugs by deciphering novel mechanisms influencing a tumor\u2019s drug response. Moreover, due to the advances of 3D organoid cultures from patient tumors and in vivo screens in mice, these genetic screens can be applied using conditions that are more representative of the clinical setting. Patient-derived 3D organoid lines furthermore allow the characterization of the \u201cessentialome\u201d, the specific set of genes required for survival of these cells, of an individual tumor, which could be monitored over the course of treatment and help understanding how drug resistance evolves in clinical tumors. Thus, we expect that these functional screens will enable the discovery of novel cancer-specific vulnerabilities, and through clinical validation, move the field of predictive biomarkers forward. This review focuses on novel advanced techniques to decipher the interplay between genetic alterations and drug response.",

Currently, over eleven drugs targeting angiogenesis have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of various malignancies. Of the registered anti-angiogenic clinical trials until the end of 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov), over 47% were completed, 10% were terminated, 3% withdrawn, over 0.5% were suspended and only 4 trials have culminated in FDA approval for marketing.

On the other hand, however, a plethora of recent studies demonstrated the emergence of tumor drug resistance towards currently used anti-angiogenic therapeutics. Series of preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted the enigma of drug resistance with functional bypass pathways, and identified compensatory or alternative angiogenic mechanisms assuring tumor growth in the midst of an anti-angiogenic stress environment. In the present review the classical literature of such redundant angiogenic pathways in concert with the key angiogenic factors and specialized cells involved in anti-angiogenic escape mechanisms is described.

     "abstract": "The advent of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) and its success in treating primary and metastatic cancer may offer substantially improved outcomes for patients. Despite recent advancements, many malignancies remain resistant to CIT, among which are brain metastases, a particularly virulent disease with no apparent cure. The immunologically unique niche of the brain has prompted compelling new questions in immuno-oncology such as the effects of tissue-specific differences in immune response, heterogeneity between primary tumors and distant metastases, and the role of spatiotemporal dynamics in shaping an effective anti-tumor immune response. Current methods to examine the immunobiology of metastases in the brain are constrained by tissue processing methods that limit spatial data collection, omit dynamic information, and cannot recapitulate the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment. In the current review, we describe how high-resolution, live imaging tools, particularly intravital microscopy (IVM), are instrumental in answering these questions. IVM of pre-clinical cancer models enables short- and long-term observations of critical immunobiology and metastatic growth phenomena to potentially generate revolutionary insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain metastasis, interactions of CIT with immune elements therein, and influence of chemo- and radiotherapy. We describe the utility of IVM to study brain metastasis in mice by tracking the migration and growth of fluorescently-labeled cells, including cancer cells and immune subsets, while monitoring the physical environment within optical windows using imaging dyes and other signal generation mechanisms to illuminate angiogenesis, hypoxia, and/or CIT drug expression within the metastatic niche. Our review summarizes the current knowledge regarding brain metastases and the immune milieu, presents the current status of CIT and its prospects in targeting brain metastases to circumvent therapeutic resistance, and proposes avenues to utilize IVM to study CIT drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models that will ultimately facilitate novel drug discovery and innovative combination therapies.",

     "abstract": "Cellular drug resistance remains the main obstacle to the clinical efficacy of cancer chemotherapy. Alterations in key pathways regulating cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis and Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), such as the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, appear to be closely associated to cancer chemoresistance.Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)- activated kinase 1 (TAK1, also known as MAP3K7) is a serine/threonine kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP3K) family. It represents the cellular hub to which IL1, TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt signaling pathways converge. By regulating the phosphorylation status and activities of transcription factors including Activated Protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor \u03ba-B (NF-\u03baB), TAK1 mediates inflammatory and pro-survival responses. The interest towards the therapeutic targeting of TAK1 is due to its identification as one of the main mediators of both chemoresistance and EMT in several types of tumors, and as the possible target for a subset of treatment-refractory colon cancers exhibiting mutated KRAS or activated WNT pathways. For these reasons, many efforts have been made to design inhibitors of TAK1 kinase activity, which could be used to reverse TAK1-mediated chemoresistance. The activity of these inhibitors, in combination with the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs, has been tested in preclinical studies, proving the efficacy of TAK1 inhibition in reducing tumor growth and survival following chemotherapy administration. In the first part of this review, we describe the mechanisms underlying TAK1 regulation such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and targeting by microRNAs. We then focus on the development of therapeutic small molecule inhibitors of TAK1 kinase activity, as well as preclinical studies supporting the role of TAK1 as a potential target for enhancing the response of tumors to anticancer therapies.",

Thus, more effective therapeutic options are sorely needed for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which occurs in approximately 20% of diagnosed breast cancers. In recent years, exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of the host immune system to eradicate cancer cells has achieved impressive success, and the advances in immunotherapy have yielded potential new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this devastating subtype of breast cancer. It is anticipated that the responses initiated by immunotherapeutic interventions will explicitly target and annihilate tumor cells, while at the same time spare normal cells. Various immunotherapeutic approaches have been already developed and tested, which include the blockade of immune checkpoints using neutralizing or blocking antibodies, induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), adoptive cell transfer-based therapy, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment to enhance the activity of CTLs. One of the most important areas of breast cancer research today is understanding the immune features and profiles of TNBC and devising novel immune-modulatory strategies to tackling TNBC, a subtype of breast cancer notorious for its poor prognosis and its imperviousness to conventional treatments. On the optimal side, one can anticipate that novel, effective, and personalized immunotherapy for TNBC will soon achieve more success and impact clinical treatment of this disease which afflicts approximately 20% of patients with breast cancer. In the present review, we highlight the current progress and encouraging developments in cancer immunotherapy, with a goal to discuss the challenges and to provide future perspectives on how to exploit a variety of new immunotherapeutic approaches including checkpoint inhibitors and neoadjuvant immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with TNBC.",

A-to-I RNA editing changes adenosine to inosine on double stranded RNA, thereby changing transcript sequence and structure. Although A-to-I RNA editing have the potential to change essential mRNA transcripts, affecting their corresponding protein structures, most of the human editing sites identified to date reside in non-coding repetitive transcripts such as Alu elements. Therefore, the impact of the hypo- or hyper-editing found in specific cancers remains unknown. Moreover, it is yet unclear whether or not changes in RNA editing and ADAR expression levels facilitate or even drive cancer progression or are just a byproduct of other affected pathways. In both cases, however, the levels of RNA editing and ADAR enzymes can possibly be used as specific biomarkers, as their levels change differently in specific malignancies. More significantly, recent studies suggest that ADAR enzymes can be used to reverse the oncogenic process, suggesting a potential for gene therapies. This review focuses on new findings that suggest that RNA editing by ADARs can affect cancer progression and even formation. We also discuss new possibilities of using ADAR enzymes and RNA editing as cancer biomarkers, indicators of chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity, and even to be themselves potential therapeutic tools.",

     "abstract": "The development of drug resistance continues to be a dominant hindrance toward curative cancer treatment. Overexpression of a wide-spectrum of ATP-dependent efflux pumps, and in particular of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein or MDR1) is a well-known resistance mechanism for a plethora of cancer chemotherapeutics including for example taxenes, anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, and epipodopyllotoxins, demonstrated by a large array of published papers, both in tumor cell lines and in a variety of tumors, including various solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Upon repeated or even single dose treatment of cultured tumor cells or tumors in vivo with anti-tumor agents such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin, increased ABCB1 copy number has been demonstrated, resulting from chromosomal amplification events at 7q11.2-21 locus, leading to marked P-glycoprotein overexpression, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Clearly however, additional mechanisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epigenetic modifications have shown a role in the overexpression of ABCB1 and of other MDR efflux pumps. However, notwithstanding the design of 4 generations of ABCB1 inhibitors and the wealth of information on the biochemistry and substrate specificity of ABC transporters, translation of this vast knowledge from the bench to the bedside has proven to be unexpectedly difficult.Many studies show that upon repeated treatment schedules of cell cultures or tumors with taxenes and anthracyclines as well as other chemotherapeutic drugs, amplification, and/or overexpression of a series of genes genomically surrounding the ABCB1 locus, is observed. Consequently, altered levels of other proteins may contribute to the establishment of the MDR phenotype, and lead to poor clinical outcome. Thus, the genes contained in this ABCB1 amplicon including ABCB4, SRI, DBF4, TMEM243, and RUNDC3B are overexpressed in many cancers, and especially in MDR tumors, while TP53TG1 and DMTF1 are bona fide tumor suppressors. This review describes the role of these genes in cancer and especially in the acquisition of MDR, elucidates possible connections in transcriptional regulation (co-amplification/repression) of genes belonging to the same ABCB1 amplicon region, and delineates their novel emerging contributions to tumor biology and possible strategies to overcome cancer MDR.",

     "abstract": "Infections have been a major cause of disease throughout the history of humans on earth. With the introduction of antibiotics, it was thought that infections had been conquered. However, bacteria have been able to develop resistance to antibiotics at an exponentially increasing rate. The growing threat from multi-drug resistant organisms calls for intensive action to prevent the emergence of totally resistant and untreatable infections. Novel, non-invasive, non-antibiotic strategies are needed that act more efficiently and faster than current antibiotics. One promising alternative is antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (APDI), an approach that produces reactive oxygen species when dyes and light are combined. So far, it has been questionable if bacteria can develop resistance against APDI. This review paper gives an overview of recent studies concerning the susceptibility of bacteria towards oxidative stress, and suggests possible mechanisms of the development of APDI-resistance that should at least be addressed. Some ways to potentiate APDI and also to overcome future resistance are suggested.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly chemoresistant malignancy. This chemoresistant phenotype has been historically associated with genetic factors. Major biomedical research efforts were concentrated that resulted in the identification of subtypes characterized by specific genetic lesions and gene expression signatures that suggest important biological differences. However, to date, these distinct differences could not be exploited for therapeutic interventions. Apart from these genetic factors, desmoplasia and tumor microenvironment have been recognized as key contributors to PDAC chemoresistance. However, while several strategies targeting tumor-stroma have been explored including drugs against members of the Hedgehog family, they failed to meet the expectations in the clinical setting. These unsatisfactory clinical results suggest that, an important link between genetics and the influence of tumor microenvironment on PDAC chemoresistance remains to be elucidated. In this respect, mechanobiology is an emerging multidisciplinary field that encompasses cell and developmental biology as well as biophysics and bioengineering. Herein we provide a comprehensive overview of the key players in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance from the perspective of mechanobiology, and discuss novel experimental avenues such as elastic micropillar arrays that could provide fresh insights for the development of mechanobiology-targeted therapeutic approaches (know as mechanopharmacology) to overcome anticancer drug resistance in pancreatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Several gene products have been postulated to mediate inherent and/or acquired anticancer drug resistance and tumor metastasis. Among these, the metastasis suppressor and chemo-immuno-sensitizing gene product, Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP), is poorly expressed in many cancers. In contrast, the metastasis inducer and chemo-immuno-resistant factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is overexpressed in many cancers. This inverse relationship between RKIP and YY1 expression suggests that these two gene products may be regulated via cross-talks of molecular signaling pathways, culminating in the expression of different phenotypes based on their targets. Analyses of the molecular regulation of the expression patterns of RKIP and YY1 as well as epigenetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation revealed the existence of several effector mechanisms and crosstalk pathways, of which five pathways of relevance have been identified and analyzed. The five examined cross-talk pathways include the following loops: RKIP/NF-\u03baB/Snail/YY1, p38/MAPK/RKIP/GSK3\u03b2/Snail/YY1, RKIP/Smurf2/YY1/Snail, RKIP/MAPK/Myc/Let-7/HMGA2/Snail/YY1, as well as RKIP/GPCR/STAT3/miR-34/YY1. Each loop is comprised of multiple interactions and cascades that provide evidence for YY1\u2019s negative regulation of RKIP expression and vice versa. These loops elucidate potential prognostic motifs and targets for therapeutic intervention. Chiefly, these findings suggest that targeted inhibition of YY1 by specific small molecule inhibitors and/or the specific induction of RKIP expression and activity are potential therapeutic strategies to block tumor growth and metastasis in many cancers, as well as to overcome anticancer drug resistance. These strategies present potential alternatives for their synergistic uses in combination with low doses of conventional chemo-immunotherapeutics and hence, increasing survival, reducing toxicity, and improving quality of life.",

However, treatment of various human malignancies with biologics, mostly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is not limited by such chemoresistance mechanisms. However, other resistance or evasion mechanisms limit the efficacy to anticancer therapeutic mAbs that engage tumor-associated antigens on the surface of the malignant cells. Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways. Three mAbs targeting immune checkpoint molecules are currently used in the clinic and new mAbs that target other potential inhibitory targets are being actively investigated. This therapeutic approach, while proving as highly beneficial for many patients, is prone to toxicities and side effects of an autoimmune nature. Defining suitable management algorithms and biomarkers that predict therapeutic effects and adverse toxicity are required to provide survival benefit for larger numbers of cancer patients. Overcoming these challenges, along with opportunities for new agents and combinatorial strategies are the main focus of immune checkpoint blockade research today.",

     "abstract": "The semaphorins were initially characterized as repulsive axon guidance factors. However, they are currently also recognized as important regulators of diverse biological processes which include regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, organogenesis, and a variety of additional physiological and developmental functions. The semaphorin family consists of more than 20 genes divided into seven subfamilies, all of which contain the sema domain signature. They usually transduce signals by activation of receptors belonging to the plexin family, either directly, or indirectly following the binding of some semaphorins to receptors of the neuropilin family which subsequently associate with plexins. Additional receptors which form complexes with these primary semaphorin receptors are also frequently involved in semaphorin signalling, and can strongly influence the nature of the biological responses of cells to semaphorins. Recent evidence suggests that semaphorins play important roles in the etiology of multiple forms of cancer. Some semaphorins such as some semaphorins belonging to the class-3 semaphorin subfamily, have been found to function as bona fide tumor suppressors and to inhibit tumor progression by various mechanisms. Because these class-3 semaphorins are secreted proteins, these semaphorins may potentially be used as anti-tumorigenic drugs. Other semaphorins, such as semaphorin-4D, function as inducers of tumor progression and represent targets for the development of novel anti-tumorigenic drugs. The mechanisms by which semaphorins affect tumor progression are diverse, ranging from direct effects on tumor cells to modulation of accessory processes such as modulation of immune responses and inhibition or promotion of tumor angiogenesis and tumor lymphangiogenesis. This review focuses on the diverse mechanisms by which semaphorins affect tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "Heparanase, the sole heparan sulfate degrading endoglycosidase, regulates multiple biological activities that enhance tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Heparanase expression is enhanced in almost all cancers examined including various carcinomas, sarcomas and hematological malignancies. Numerous clinical association studies have consistently demonstrated that upregulation of heparanase expression correlates with increased tumor size, tumor angiogenesis, enhanced metastasis and poor prognosis. In contrast, knockdown of heparanase or treatments of tumor-bearing mice with heparanase-inhibiting compounds, markedly attenuate tumor progression further underscoring the potential of anti-heparanase therapy for multiple types of cancer. Heparanase neutralizing monoclonal antibodies block myeloma and lymphoma tumor growth and dissemination; this is attributable to a combined effect on the tumor cells and/or cells of the tumor microenvironment. In fact, much of the impact of heparanase on tumor progression is related to its function in mediating tumor-host crosstalk, priming the tumor microenvironment to better support tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. The repertoire of the physio-pathological activities of heparanase is expanding. Specifically, heparanase regulates gene expression, activates cells of the innate immune system, promotes the formation of exosomes and autophagosomes, and stimulates signal transduction pathways via enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities. These effects dynamically impact multiple regulatory pathways that together drive inflammatory responses, tumor survival, growth, dissemination and drug resistance; but in the same time, may fulfill some normal functions associated, for example, with vesicular traffic, lysosomal-based secretion, stress response, and heparan sulfate turnover. Heparanase is upregulated in response to chemotherapy in cancer patients and the surviving cells acquire chemoresistance, attributed, at least in part, to autophagy. Consequently, heparanase inhibitors used in tandem with chemotherapeutic drugs overcome initial chemoresistance, providing a strong rationale for applying anti-heparanase therapy in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs. Heparin-like compounds that inhibit heparanase activity are being evaluated in clinical trials for various types of cancer. Heparanase neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are being evaluated in pre-clinical studies, and heparanase-inhibiting small molecules are being developed based on the recently resolved crystal structure of the heparanase protein. Collectively, the emerging premise is that heparanase expressed by tumor cells, innate immune cells, activated endothelial cells as well as other cells of the tumor microenvironment is a master regulator of the aggressive phenotype of cancer, an important contributor to the poor outcome of cancer patients and a prime target for therapy.",

PLD is a complex formulation of doxorubicin based on pharmaceutical nanotechnology with unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Its long circulation time with stable retention of the payload and its accumulation in tumors with high vascular permeability both result in important advantages over conventional chemotherapy. The ability of PLD to buffer a number of undesirable side effects of doxorubicin, including a major risk reduction in cardiac toxicity, is now well-established and confers a major added value in a number of disease conditions. PLD is approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi sarcoma. In addition, clinically significant antitumor activity of PLD has been reported in a number of other cancer types, including lymphomas and soft tissue sarcomas. In spite of this, PLD has not replaced conventional doxorubicin in common applications such as the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer, and its use in the clinic has not become as widespread as one may have predicted. Exploiting the unique pharmacology of PLD, analyzing its selective biodistribution and homing to tumors in cancer patients with proper theranostic tools, and harnessing its complex interaction with the immune system, will lead to a more selective and rational use of PLD that may have great impact on future clinical results and may help realize its largely untapped potential.",

     "abstract": "Mammalians are devoid of autonomous biosynthesis of folates and hence must obtain them from the diet. Reduced folate cofactors are B9-vitamins which play a key role as donors of one-carbon units in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, thymidylate and amino acids as well as in a multitude of methylation reactions including DNA, RNA, histone and non-histone proteins, phospholipids, as well as intermediate metabolites. The products of these S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methylations are involved in the regulation of key biological processes including transcription, translation and intracellular signaling. Folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism occurs in several subcellular compartments including the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and nucleus. Since folates are essential for DNA replication, intracellular folate cofactors play a central role in cancer biology and inflammatory autoimmune disorders. In this respect, various folate-dependent enzymes catalyzing nucleotide biosynthesis have been targeted by specific folate antagonists known as antifolates. Currently, antifolates are used in drug treatment of multiple human cancers, non-malignant chronic inflammatory disorders as well as bacterial and parasitic infections. An obligatory key component of intracellular folate retention and intracellular homeostasis is (anti)folate polyglutamylation, mediated by the unique enzyme folylpoly-\u03b3-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), which resides in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Consistently, knockout of the FPGS gene in mice results in embryonic lethality. FPGS catalyzes the addition of a long polyglutamate chain to folates and antifolates, hence rendering them polyanions which are efficiently retained in the cell and are now bound with enhanced affinity by various folate-dependent enzymes. The current review highlights the crucial role that FPGS plays in maintenance of folate homeostasis under physiological conditions and delineates the plethora of the molecular mechanisms underlying loss of FPGS function and consequent antifolate resistance in cancer.",

A few members of the genus are prominent opportunistic pathogens. These include Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei of the B. pseudomallei complex, which cause glanders and melioidosis, respectively. Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia multivorans, and Burkholderia vietnamiensis belong to the Burkholderia cepacia complex and affect mostly cystic fibrosis patients. Infections caused by these bacteria are difficult to treat because of significant antibiotic resistance. The first line of defense against antimicrobials in Burkholderia species is the outer membrane penetration barrier. Most Burkholderia contain a modified lipopolysaccharide that causes intrinsic polymyxin resistance. Contributing to reduced drug penetration are restrictive porin proteins. Efflux pumps of the resistance nodulation cell division family are major players in Burkholderia multidrug resistance. Third and fourth generation \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are seminal for treatment of Burkholderia infections, but therapeutic efficacy is compromised by expression of several \u03b2-lactamases and ceftazidime target mutations. Altered DNA gyrase and dihydrofolate reductase targets cause fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim resistance, respectively. Although antibiotic resistance hampers therapy of Burkholderia infections, the characterization of resistance mechanisms lags behind other non-enteric Gram-negative pathogens, especially ESKAPE bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

In addition to clinically relevant antimicrobial agents, MDR efflux proteins can transport environmental biocides and disinfectants which may allow persistence in the healthcare environment and subsequent acquisition by patients or staff. Intensive research on MDR efflux proteins and the regulation of expression of their genes is ongoing, providing some insight into the mechanisms of multidrug recognition and transport. Inhibitors of many of these proteins have been identified, including drugs currently being used for other indications. Structural modifications guided by structure\u2013activity studies have resulted in the identification of potent compounds.

One of the major causes of multidrug resistance is the enhanced efflux of drugs by membrane ABC transporters. Targeting ABC transporters projects a promising approach to eliminating or suppressing drug resistance in cancer treatment. To reveal the functional mechanisms of ABC transporters in drug resistance, extensive studies have been conducted from identifying drug binding sites to elucidating structural dynamics. In this review article, we examined the recent crystal structures of ABC proteins to depict the functionally important structural elements, such as domains, conserved motifs, and critical amino acids that are involved in ATP-binding and drug efflux. We inspected the drug-binding sites on ABC proteins and the molecular mechanisms of various substrate interactions with the drug binding pocket. While our continuous battle against drug resistance is far from over, new approaches and technologies have emerged to push forward our frontier.

Active prophages carrying genes encoding virulence factors and antibiotic resistance can be excised from the host chromosome to form active phages and are transmissible among different bacterial hosts upon SOS responses. Cryptic prophages are artifacts of mutagenesis in which lysogenic phage are captured in the bacterial chromosome: they may excise but they do not form active phage particles or lyse their captors. Hence, cryptic prophages are relatively permanent reservoirs of genes, many of which benefit pathogens, in ways we are just beginning to discern. Here we explore the role of active prophage- and cryptic prophage-derived proteins in terms of (i) virulence, (ii) antibiotic resistance, and (iii) antibiotic tolerance; antibiotic tolerance occurs as a result of the non-heritable phenotype of dormancy which is a result of activation of toxins of toxin/antitoxin loci that are frequently encoded in cryptic prophages.

Nanotheranostics, composed of nanoparticles (NPs) carrying therapeutic and/or diagnostics probes, have the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine.

However, the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in the clinical, community and agricultural settings has resulted in selection for multidrug-resistant bacteria, which has led to the prediction of possible re-entrance to the pre-antibiotic era. The situation is further exacerbated by significantly reduced antimicrobial drug discovery efforts by large pharmaceutical companies, resulting in a steady decline in the number of new antimicrobial agents brought to the market in the past several decades. Consequently, there is a pressing need for new antimicrobial therapies that can be readily designed and implemented. Recently, it has become clear that the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to collateral damage to the human commensal microbiota, which plays several key roles in host health. Advances in genetic engineering have opened the possibility of reprogramming commensal bacteria that are in symbiotic existence throughout the human body to implement antimicrobial drugs with high versatility and efficacy against pathogenic bacteria.

Owing to their prominent expression in the sinusoidal plasma membrane of hepatocytes, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 play key roles in the hepatic uptake and plasma clearance of a multitude of structurally diverse anti-cancer and other drugs. Here, we present a thorough assessment of the currently available OATP1A and OATP1B knockout and transgenic mouse models as key tools to study OATP functions in vivo. We discuss recent studies using these models demonstrating the importance of OATPs, primarily in the plasma and hepatic clearance of anticancer drugs such as taxanes, irinotecan/SN-38, methotrexate, doxorubicin, and platinum compounds. We further discuss recent work on OATP-mediated drug\u2013drug interactions in these mouse models, as well as on the role of OATP1A/1B proteins in the phenomenon of hepatocyte hopping, an efficient and flexible way of liver detoxification for both endogenous and exogenous substrates. Interestingly, glucuronide conjugates of both the heme breakdown product bilirubin and the protein tyrosine kinase-targeted anticancer drug sorafenib are strongly affected by this process. The clinical relevance of variation in OATP1A/1B activity in patients has been previously revealed by the effects of polymorphic variants and drug\u2013drug interactions on drug toxicity. The development of in vivo tools to study OATP1A/1B functions has greatly advanced our mechanistic understanding of their functional role in drug pharmacokinetics, and their implications for therapeutic efficacy and toxic side effects of anticancer and other drug treatments.",

A less well understood but emerging theme is the drug efflux-independent contributions of ABC transporters to cancer biology, supported by a growing body of evidence that their loss or inhibition impacts on the malignant potential of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. As with multidrug resistance, these contributions likely represent a hijacking of normal ABC transporter functions in the efflux of endogenous metabolites and signaling molecules, however they may expand the clinical relevance of ABC transporters beyond P-gp, BCRP and MRP1.

Thus, strategies are needed to minimize time and costs, while maximizing success rates. A very attractive strategy for novel cancer therapeutic options is the repositioning of already approved drugs. These medicines, approved for the treatment of non-malignant disorders, have already passed some early costs and time, have been tested in humans and are ready for clinical trials as anti-cancer drugs.

Over 100 different human AMPs are known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Because of the increased frequency of resistance to conventional antibiotics there is an interest in developing AMPs as an alternative antibacterial therapy. Several cationic peptides that are derivatives of AMPs from the human innate immune system are currently in clinical development. There are also ongoing clinical studies aimed at modulating the expression of AMPs to boost the human innate immune response. In this review we discuss the potential problems associated with these therapeutic approaches. There is considerable experimental data describing mechanisms by which bacteria can develop resistance to AMPs. As for any type of drug resistance, the rate by which AMP resistance would emerge and spread in a population of bacteria in a natural setting will be determined by a complex interplay of several different factors, including the mutation supply rate, the fitness of the resistant mutant at different AMP concentrations, and the strength of the selective pressure. Several studies have already shown that AMP-resistant bacterial mutants display broad cross-resistance to a variety of AMPs with different structures and modes of action. Therefore, routine clinical administration of AMPs to treat bacterial infections may select for resistant bacterial pathogens capable of better evading the innate immune system. The ramifications of therapeutic levels of exposure on the development of AMP resistance and bacterial pathogenesis are not yet understood. This is something that needs to be carefully studied and monitored if AMPs are used in clinical settings.",

     "abstract": "The RAS\u2013ERK pathway plays a major regulatory role in various cellular processes. This pathway is hyperactivated and takes an active part in the malignant transformation of more than 85% of cancers. The hyperactivation is mainly due to oncogenic activating mutations in the pathway's components RAS, RAF and MEK, but also due to indirect mechanisms in cells transformed by other oncogenes. Various inhibitors targeting the different tiers of the cascade have been successfully developed and clinically approved, while some are still undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. Treatments with the clinically approved RAF and MEK inhibitors have substantially improved the clinical outcome of metastatic mutated-BRAF melanoma. However, the rapid emergence of drug resistance of initially responsive cancers and limited efficacy towards other cancers has led to only marginal patient benefit. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic or acquired resistance is a necessity in order to enhance the treatment efficacy of ERK-addicted cancers. Therefore, many studies in the past 5 years embarked on this campaign, revealing several resistance mechanisms. These include, expression of drug-resistant RAF isoforms, molecular or genetic alterations of active downstream components, overexpression of upstream components of the cascade that can reactivate ERK and other survival-related pathways. The understanding of these molecular resistance mechanisms led to further development of drugs that can overcome drug resistance, including our own effort aiming to prevent the nuclear translocation of ERK without affecting its activation. In this review we will focus on the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and efforts to develop activity-independent, more efficacious, antitumor drugs.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the connection between metabolic pathways and cancer is very important for the development of new therapeutic approaches based on regulatory enzymes in pathways associated with tumorigenesis. The mevalonate cascade and its rate-liming enzyme HMG CoA-reductase has recently drawn the attention of cancer researchers because strong evidences arising mostly from epidemiologic studies, show that it could promote transformation. Hence, these studies pinpoint HMG CoA-reductase as a candidate proto-oncogene. Several recent epidemiological studies, in different populations, have proven that statins are beneficial for the treatment-outcome of various cancers, and may improve common cancer therapy strategies involving alkylating agents, and antimetabolites. Cancer stem cells/cancer initiating cells (CSC) are key to cancer progression and metastasis. Therefore, in the current review we address the different effects of statins on cancer stem cells. The mevalonate cascade is among the most pleiotropic, and highly interconnected signaling pathways. Through G-protein-coupled receptors (GRCP), it integrates extra-, and intracellular signals. The mevalonate pathway is implicated in cell stemness, cell proliferation, and organ size regulation through the Hippo pathway (e.g. Yap/Taz signaling axis). This pathway is a prime preventive target through the administration of statins for the prophylaxis of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Its prominent role in regulation of cell growth and stemness also invokes its role in cancer development and progression. The mevalonate pathway affects cancer metastasis in several ways by: (i) affecting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), (ii) affecting remodeling of the cytoskeleton as well as cell motility, (iii) affecting cell polarity (non-canonical Wnt/planar pathway), and (iv) modulation of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Herein we provide an overview of the mevalonate signaling network. We then briefly highlight diverse functions of various elements of this mevalonate pathway.

     "abstract": "An increased tendency of genomic alterations during the life cycle of cells leads to genomic instability, which is a major driving force for tumorigenesis. A considerable fraction of tumor cells are tetraploid or aneuploid, which renders them intrinsically susceptible to mitotic aberrations, and hence, are particularly sensitive to the induction of mitotic catastrophe. Resistance to cell death is also closely linked to genomic instability, as it enables malignant cells to expand even in a stressful environment. Currently it is known that cells can die via multiple mechanisms. Mitotic catastrophe represents a step preceding apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the expression and/or proper function of several proteins. Mitotic catastrophe was proposed to be an onco-suppressive mechanism and the evasion of mitotic catastrophe constitutes one of the gateways to cancer development. Thus, stimulation of mitotic catastrophe appears to be a promising strategy in cancer treatment. Indeed, several chemotherapeutic drugs are currently used at concentrations that induce apoptosis irrespective of the cell cycle phase, yet are very efficient at triggering mitotic catastrophe at lower doses, significantly limiting side effects. In the present review we summarize current data concerning the role of mitotic catastrophe in cancer drug resistance and discuss novel strategies to break this link.",

Selecting the optimal treatment order from among the variety of currently available therapy options presents a relevant challenge for medical oncologists. With the understanding that the majority of patients with breast cancer and those who succumb to this disease have HR-positive disease, this review will focus on treatment options and treatment order in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. While endocrine therapy is considered the preferred treatment for first-line therapy in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, selection of the specific agent depends on the menopausal status of the patient. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, is also recommended as first-line treatment in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease. In patients with endocrine therapy\u2013resistant disease, specific strategies include sequencing of other antiestrogen receptor agents, or agents that target other molecular pathways. Future treatment strategies for patients with primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy for advanced disease are discussed. These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene.",

     "abstract": "Drug resistance remains a leading cause of chemotherapeutic treatment failure and cancer-related mortality. While some mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance have been well characterized, multiple mechanisms remain elusive. In this respect, passive ion trapping-based lysosomal sequestration of multiple hydrophobic weak-base chemotherapeutic agents was found to reduce the accessibility of these drugs to their target sites, resulting in a markedly reduced cytotoxic effect and drug resistance. Recently we have demonstrated that lysosomal sequestration of hydrophobic weak base drugs triggers TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis resulting in an enlarged lysosomal compartment, capable of enhanced drug sequestration. This study further showed that cancer cells with an increased number of drug-accumulating lysosomes are more resistant to lysosome-sequestered drugs, suggesting a model of drug-induced lysosome-mediated chemoresistance. In addition to passive drug sequestration of hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics, other mechanisms of lysosome-mediated drug resistance have also been reported; these include active lysosomal drug sequestration mediated by ATP-driven transporters from the ABC superfamily, and a role for lysosomal copper transporters in cancer resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, lysosomal exocytosis was suggested as a mechanism to facilitate the clearance of chemotherapeutics which highly accumulated in lysosomes, thus providing an additional line of resistance, supplementing the organelle entrapment of chemotherapeutics away from their target sites. Along with these mechanisms of lysosome-mediated drug resistance, several approaches were recently developed for the overcoming of drug resistance or exploiting lysosomal drug sequestration, including lysosomal photodestruction and drug-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In this review we explore the current literature addressing the role of lysosomes in mediating cancer drug resistance as well as novel modalities to overcome this chemoresistance.",

While platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens have proven effective against highly proliferative malignant tumors, significant relapse and progression rates as well as decreased overall survival are still observed. Currently, it is known that sub-populations of chemoresistant cells share biological properties with cancer stem cells (CSC), which are believed to be responsible for tumor relapse, invasion and ultimately disease dissemination through acquisition of mesenchymal cell traits. In spite of concentrated efforts devoted to decipher the mechanisms underlying CSC chemoresistance and to design targeted therapeutics to these cells, proteomics has failed to unveil molecular signatures capable of distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant stem cells. This has hampered substantial developments in this complex field. Envisaging a novel rationale for an effective therapy, the current review summarizes the main cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance and the impact of chemotherapy challenge in CSC selection and clinical outcome. It further emphasizes the growing amount of data supporting a role for protein glycosylation in drug resistance. The dynamic and context-dependent nature of protein glycosylation is also comprehensively discussed, hence highlighting its potentially important role as a biomarker of CSC. As the paradigm of cancer therapeutics shifts towards precision medicine and patient-tailored therapeutics, we bring into focus the need to introduce glycomics and glycoproteomics in holistic pan-omics models, in order to integrate diverse, multimodal and clinically relevant information towards more effective cancer therapeutics.",

Patients are generally diagnosed in an advanced stage with the majority of cases displaying platinum resistant relapses. Recent genomic interrogation of large numbers of HGSOC patient samples indicated high complexity in terms of genetic aberrations, intra- and intertumor heterogeneity and underscored their lack of targetable oncogenic mutations. Sub-classifications of HGSOC based on expression profiles, termed \u2018differentiated\u2019, \u2018immunoreactive\u2019, \u2018mesenchymal\u2019 and \u2018proliferative\u2019, were shown to have prognostic value. In addition, in almost half of all HGSOC patients, a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) was found that potentially can be targeted using PARP inhibitors. Developing precision medicine requires advanced experimental models. In the current review, we discuss experimental HGSOC models in which resistance to platinum therapy and the use of novel therapeutics can be carefully studied. Panels of better-defined primary cell lines need to be established to capture the full spectrum of HGSOC subtypes. Further refinement of cell lines is obtained with a 3-dimensional culture model mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, ex vivo ovarian tumor tissue slices are used. For in vivo studies, larger panels of ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are being established, encompassing all expression subtypes. Ovarian cancer PDXs grossly retain tumor heterogeneity and clinical response to platinum therapy is preserved. PDXs are currently used in drug screens and as avatars for patient response. The role of the immune system in tumor responses can be assessed using humanized PDXs and immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models. Dynamic tracking of genetic alterations in PDXs as well as patients during treatment and after relapse is feasible by sequencing circulating cell-free tumor DNA and analyzing circulating tumor cells. We discuss how various models and methods can be combined to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and to select HGSOC patients other than BRCA1/2-mutation carriers that could potentially benefit from the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors. This integrated approach is a first step to improve therapy outcomes in specific subgroups of HGSOC patients.",

Among multiple steps of the UPS system required to regulate protein ubiquitination and stability, UBLs define specificity, as they recognize and interact with substrates in a temporally- and spatially-regulated manner. Such interactions are required for substrate modification by ubiquitin chains, which marks proteins for recognition and degradation by the proteasome or alters their subcellular localization or assembly into functional complexes. UBLs are often deregulated in cancer, altering substrate availability or activity in a manner that can promote cellular transformation. Such deregulation can occur at the epigenetic, genomic, or post-translational levels. Alterations in UBL can be used to predict their contributions, affecting tumor suppressors or oncogenes in select tumors. Better understanding of mechanisms underlying UBL expression and activities is expected to drive the development of next generation modulators that can serve as novel therapeutic modalities.

Clinical breakpoints for some agents have been proposed and can have predictive value for the success or failure of therapy. Tolerance to antifungals has been a much more ignored area. By definition, tolerance operates at antifungal concentrations above individual intrinsic inhibitory values. Important is that tolerance to antifungal agents favours the emergence of persister cells, which are able to survive antifungal therapy and can cause relapses.

     "abstract": "Our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of antitumor agents and the precise mechanisms underlying drug resistance is that these two processes are directly linked. Moreover, it is often possible to delineate chemoresistance mechanisms based on the specific mechanism of action of a given anticancer drug. A more holistic approach to the chemoresistance problem suggests that entire metabolic pathways, rather than single enzyme targets may better explain and educate us about the complexity of the cellular responses upon cytotoxic drug administration. Drugs, which target thymidylate synthase and folate-dependent enzymes, represent an important therapeutic arm in the treatment of various human malignancies. However, prolonged patient treatment often provokes drug resistance phenomena that render the chemotherapeutic treatment highly ineffective. Hence, strategies to overcome drug resistance are primarily designed to achieve either enhanced intracellular drug accumulation, to avoid the upregulation of folate-dependent enzymes, and to circumvent the impairment of DNA repair enzymes which are also responsible for cross-resistance to various anticancer drugs. The current clinical practice based on drug combination therapeutic regimens represents the most effective approach to counteract drug resistance. In the current paper, we review the molecular aspects of the activity of TS-targeting drugs and describe how such mechanisms are related to the emergence of clinical drug resistance. We also discuss the current possibilities to overcome drug resistance by using a molecular mechanistic approach based on medicinal chemistry methods focusing on rational structural modifications of novel antitumor agents. This paper also focuses on the importance of the modulation of metabolic pathways upon drug administration, their analysis and the assessment of their putative roles in the networks involved using a meta-analysis approach. The present review describes the main pathways that are modulated by TS-targeting anticancer drugs starting from the description of the normal functioning of the folate metabolic pathway, through the protein modulation occurring upon drug delivery to cultured tumor cells as well as cancer patients, finally describing how the pathways are modulated by drug resistance development. The data collected are then analyzed using network/netwire connecting methods in order to provide a wider view of the pathways involved and of the importance of such information in identifying additional proteins that could serve as novel druggable targets for efficacious cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) ranks fourth among cancer related deaths. The disappointing 5-year survival rate of below 5% stems from drug resistance to all known therapies, as well as from disease presentation at a late stage when PDA is already metastatic. Gemcitabine has been the cornerstone of PDA treatment in all stages of the disease for the last two decades, but gemcitabine resistance develops within weeks of chemotherapy initiation. From a mechanistic perspective, gemcitabine resistance may result from alterations in drug metabolism until the point that the cytidine analog is incorporated into the DNA, or from mitigation of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Both of these drug resistance modalities can be either intrinsic to the cancer cell, or influenced by the cancer microenvironment. Mechanisms of intrinsic gemcitabine resistance are difficult to tackle, as many of the genes that drive the carcinogenic process itself also interfere with gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. In this regard, recent understanding of the involvement of microRNAs in gemcitabine resistance may offer new opportunities to overcome intrinsic gemcitabine resistance. The characteristically fibrotic and immune infiltrated stroma of PDA that accompanies tumor inception and expansion is a lush ground for treatments aimed at targeting tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. In the last couple of years, drugs interfering with tumor microenvironment have matured to clinical trials. Although drugs inducing \u2018stromal depletion\u2019 have yet failed to improve survival, they have greatly increased our understanding of tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance.

     "abstract": "Despite the major progresses in biomedical research and the development of novel therapeutics and treatment strategies, cancer is still among the dominant causes of death worldwide. One of the crucial challenges in the clinical management of cancer is primary (intrinsic) and secondary (acquired) resistance to both conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics. Multiple mechanisms have been identifiedthat underlie intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance: these include impaired drug uptake, increased drug efflux, deletion of receptors, altered drug metabolism, quantitative and qualitative alterations in drug targets, increased DNA damage repair and various mechanisms of anti-apoptosis. The fast efflux of anticancer drugs mediated by multidrug efflux pumps and the partial or complete reversibility of chemoresistance combined with the absence of genetic mutations suggests a multifactorial process. However, a growing body of recent evidence suggests that chemoresistance is often triggered by the highly acidic microenvironment of tumors. The vast majority of drugs, including conventional chemotherapeutics and more recent biological agents, are weak bases that are quickly protonated and neutralized in acidic environments, such as the extracellular microenvironment and the acidic organelles of tumor cells. It is therefore essential to develop new strategies to overcome the entrapment and neutralization of weak base drugs. One such strategy is the use of proton pump inhibitors which can enhance tumor chemosensitivity by increasing the pH of the tumor microenvironment. Recent clinical trials in animals with spontaneous tumors have indicated that patient alkalization is capable of reversing acquired chemoresistance in a large percentage of tumors that are refractory to chemotherapy. Of particular interest was the benefit of alkalization for patients undergoing metronomic regimens which are becoming more widely used in veterinary medicine. Overall, these results provide substantial new evidence that altering the acidic tumor microenvironment is an effective, well tolerated and low cost strategy for the overcoming of anticancer drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a major hurdle in the eradication of malignant tumors. Despite the high sensitivity of various cancers to treatment, some residual cancer cells persist and lead to tumor recurrence and treatment failure. Obvious reasons for residual disease include mechanisms of secondary therapy resistance, such as the presence of mutant cells that are insensitive to the drugs, or the presence of cells that become drug resistant due to activation of survival pathways. In addition to such unambiguous resistance modalities, several patients with relapsing tumors do not show refractory disease and respond again when the initial therapy is repeated. These cases cannot be explained by the selection of mutant tumor cells, and the precise mechanisms underlying this clinical drug resistance are ill-defined. In the current review, we put special emphasis on cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms that may explain mechanisms of MRD that are independent of secondary therapy resistance. In particular, we show that studying genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), which highly resemble the disease in humans, provides a complementary approach to understand MRD. In these animal models, specific mechanisms of secondary resistance can be excluded by targeted genetic modifications. This allows a clear distinction between the selection of cells with stable secondary resistance and mechanisms that result in the survival of residual cells but do not provoke secondary drug resistance. Mechanisms that may explain the latter feature include special biochemical defense properties of cancer stem cells, metabolic peculiarities such as the dependence on autophagy, drug-tolerant persisting cells, intratumoral heterogeneity, secreted factors from the microenvironment, tumor vascularization patterns and immunosurveillance-related factors. We propose in the current review that a common feature of these various mechanisms is cancer cell dormancy. Therefore, dormant cancer cells appear to be an important target in the attempt to eradicate residual cancer cells, and eventually cure patients who repeatedly respond to anticancer therapy but lack complete tumor eradication.",

     "abstract": "By controlling ion fluxes at multiple time scales, ion channels shape rapid cell signals, such as action potential and synaptic transmission, as well as much slower processes, such as mitosis and cell migration. As is currently increasingly recognized, a variety of channel types are involved in cancer hallmarks, and regulate specific stages of neoplastic progression. Long-term in vitro work has established that inhibition of these ion channels impairs the growth of cancer cells. Recently, these studies have been followed up in vivo, hence revealing that ion channels constitute promising pharmacological targets in oncology.The channel proteins can be often accessed from the extracellular milieu, which allows use of lower drug doses and decrease untoward toxicity. However, because of the central physiological roles exerted by ion channels in excitable cells, other types of side effects may arise, the gravest of which is cardiac arrhythmia. A paradigmatic case is offered by Kv11.1 (hERG1) channels. HERG1 blockers attenuate the progression of both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, but may also lead to the lengthening of the electrocardiographic QT interval, thus predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias. These side effects can be avoided by specifically inhibiting the channel isoforms which are highly expressed in certain tumors, such as Kv11.1B and the neonatal forms of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Preclinical studies are also being explored in breast and prostate cancer (targeting voltage-gated Na+ channels), and gliomas (targeting CLC-3). Overall, the possible approaches to improve the efficacy and safety of ion channel targeting in oncology include: (1) the development of specific inhibitors for the channel subtypes expressed in specific tumors; (2) drug delivery into the tumor by using antibodies or nanotechnology-based approaches; (3) combination regimen therapy and (4) blocking specific conformational states of the ion channel. We believe that expanding this relatively neglected field of oncology research might lead to unforeseen therapeutic benefits for cancer patients.",

Indeed, recent concerning reports have provided evidence of the existence of MDR/XDR global clones, denominated high-risk clones, disseminated in hospitals worldwide; ST235, ST111, and ST175 are likely those more widespread. Noteworthy, the vast majority of infections by MDR, and specially XDR, strains are produced by these and few other clones worldwide. Moreover, the association of high-risk clones, particularly ST235, with transferable resistance is overwhelming; nearly 100 different horizontally-acquired resistance elements and up to 39 different acquired \u03b2-lactamases have been reported so far among ST235 isolates. Likewise, MDR internationally-disseminated epidemic strains, such as the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES, ST146), have been noted as well among cystic fibrosis patients. Here we review the population structure, epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and virulence of the P. aeruginosa high-risk clones. The phenotypic and genetic factors potentially driving the success of high-risk clones, the aspects related to their detection in the clinical microbiology laboratory and the implications for infection control and public health are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Platinum drugs have been widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors. Although DNA has been recognized as the primary cellular target for these agents, there are unresolved issues concerning their effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor efficacy. These cytotoxic agents interact with sub-cellular compartments other than the nucleus. Here, we review how such emerging phenomena contribute to the pharmacologic activity as well as to drug resistance phenotypes. DNA-unrelated effects of platinum drugs involve alterations at the plasma membrane and in endo-lysosomal compartments. A direct interaction with the mitochondria also appears to be implicated in drug-induced cell death. Moreover, the pioneering work of a few groups has shown that platinum drugs can act on the tumor microenvironment as well, and potentiate antitumor activity of the immune system. These poorly understood aspects of platinum drug activity sites may be harnessed to enhance their antitumor efficacy. A complete understanding of DNA-unrelated effects of platinum compounds might reveal new aspects of drug resistance allowing the implementation of the antitumor therapeutic efficacy of platinum compound-based regimens and minimization of their toxic side effects.",

     "abstract": "Multiple mutations in the EGFR gene are a major cause for the failure of Erlotinib and Gefitinib in the treatment of patients harboring non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who initially responded to this therapy. The development of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is going back to the early 90s, where cancer was widely considered and fully treated as a disease of an organ. Fundamental gain of knowledge in cell biology in general and cancer genetics in particular led us to where we currently stand: cancer is a disease that originates in the genome. Fast and affordable gene sequencing paved the way and opened our eyes for the genetic instability of many cancers, particularly EGFR driven NSCLC. This might allow highly rational and personal therapies by aiming at a very particular wild type and mutant kinase pattern. However, the paradigm \u201cone disease \u2013 one target \u2013 one drug\u201d is currently challenged.Both activating and deactivating EGFR mutations are known to render the development of novel targeted drugs difficult. Among all lung adenocarcinomas, only 20% are driven by EGFR and only a subpopulation has an activating mutation (e.g. L858R), making them sensitive to first generation EGFR inhibitors. Unfortunately, most of them acquire second deactivating mutations (e.g. T790M) during treatment, leading to a complete loss of response.Are specific inhibitors of the double EGFR mutant L858R/T790M the magic bullet? Much scientific evidence but also high expectations justify this approach. Structural biology of EGFR mutants constitutes the basis for highly rational approaches. Second generation pan EGFR inhibitors inhibiting wild type (WT) and mutant EGFR like Afatinib suffer from dose-limiting adverse effects. Inhibition of WT EGFR is considered to be the culprit.Third generation EGFR inhibitors follow two strategies. Mutant selectivity and improved target residential time. These inhibitors display high mutant selectivity and irreversible binding patterns while sparing WT EGFR activity, hence enhancing tumor selectivity while minimizing adverse effects. Third generation EGFR inhibitors are still undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. The most advanced are Rociletinib and AZD9291 which displayed encouraging preliminary clinical phase II data regarding response and adverse effects. In the current review we show both a medicinal chemists\u2019 approach toward the design of third generation EGFR inhibitors as well as a detailed overview of the development of EGFR inhibitors over the last decade. High interdisciplinary approaches, such as structural biology and time-resolved tumor genetics pave the way toward the development of drugs that target EGFR mutants. This might lead to highly effective targeted and personalized therapies with enhanced response rates for a minor cohort of patients which have to undergo continuous gene sequencing, hence enabling therapies with tailor-made TKIs.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the most common malignancies and is major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. A great improvement in response rate and patient's survival was recently achieved through the introduction of new targeted agents including the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, the anti-angiogenic drugs bevacizumab and aflibercept, as well as the multi-kinase inhibitor regorafenib, in combination with standard fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapeutic regimens. Intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance continue to be a major hindrance toward curative therapy. To overcome the obstacle of the currently unpredictable inter-individual variability in the therapy outcome, concentrated research efforts have been focused on elucidating the contribution of genetic variants predictive of pharmacoresistance in CRC. The occurrence of tumor somatic mutations in the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways remains the main challenge for CRC treatment with the new biological agents. It has been recently proposed to consider a quadruple negative profile for CRC, based on the status of KRAS exon 2, BRAF-p.V600E, PI3KCA-exon 9 and PTEN, as tumor markers of sensitivity to anti-EGFR treatment. However, in the last years, great efforts have been devoted to address germline genetic profiles of pharmacoresistance. Heritable genetic variants in the ABC and SLC transport pathways; in the CYP450, GST, and UGT-mediated phase I and II metabolism; in the folate metabolic pathway; as well as in the EGF and VEGF signaling pathways, have been associated with a distinct tumor sensitivity phenotype in CRC patients treated with fluoropyrimidines combined with either irinotecan, oxaliplatin or targeted biological agents. More recently, computation of clinical-pharmacogenetic algorithms, combining multiple host polymorphisms with clinico-demographic features, appeared to be a more reliable strategy to test a complex phenomenon as tumor response to therapy. The final goal of the pharmacogenomics research in the domain of pharmacoresistance in CRC should be the definition of integrated somatic and germline genetic profiles of both intrinsic and acquired resistance. The aim of the present review is to provide a comprehensive update on the most important findings regarding the research of pharmacogenomics markers in the field of CRC treatment that could be integrated in clinical practice in order to accomplish an efficacious personalized treatment.",

     "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Particularly in adult patients, the vast majority of gliomas belongs to the heterogeneous group of diffuse gliomas, i.e. glial tumors characterized by diffuse infiltrative growth in the preexistent brain tissue. Unfortunately, glioblastoma, the most aggressive (WHO grade IV) diffuse glioma is also by far the most frequent one. After standard treatment, the 2-year overall survival of glioblastoma patients is approximately only 25%. Advanced knowledge in the molecular pathology underlying malignant transformation has offered new handles and better treatments for several cancer types. Unfortunately, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients have not yet profited as although numerous experimental drugs have been tested in clinical trials, all failed miserably. This grim prognosis for GBM is at least partly due to the lack of successful drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The human brain comprises over 100 billion capillaries with a total length of 400 miles, a total surface area of 20\u00a0m2 and a median inter-capillary distance of about 50\u00a0\u03bcm, making it the best perfused organ in the body. The BBTB encompasses existing and newly formed blood vessels that contribute to the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor and facilitate glioma cell migration to other parts of the brain. The high metabolic demands of high-grade glioma create hypoxic areas that trigger increased expression of VEGF and angiogenesis, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels and a dysfunctional BBTB. Even though the BBTB is considered \u2018leaky\u2019 in the core part of glioblastomas, in large parts of glioblastomas and, even more so, in lower grade diffuse gliomas the BBTB more closely resembles the intact blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and prevents efficient passage of cancer therapeutics, including small molecules and antibodies. Thus, many drugs can still be blocked from reaching the many infiltrative glioblastoma cells that demonstrate \u2018within-organ-metastasis\u2019 away from the core part to brain areas displaying a more organized and less leaky BBTB. Hence, drug delivery in glioblastoma deserves explicit attention as otherwise new experimental therapies will continue to fail. In the current review we highlight different aspects of the BBTB in glioma patients and preclinical models and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of drug delivery approaches for the treatment of glioma patients. We provide an overview on methods to overcome the BBTB, including osmotic blood\u2013brain barrier disruption (BBBD), bradykinin receptor-mediated BBTB opening, inhibition of multidrug efflux transporters, receptor-mediated transport systems and physiological circumvention of the BBTB. While our knowledge about the molecular biology of glioma cells is rapidly expanding and is, to some extent, already assisting us in the design of tumor-tailored therapeutics, we are still struggling to develop modalities to expose the entire tumor to such therapeutics at pharmacologically meaningful quantities. Therefore, we must expand our knowledge about the fundamentals of the BBTB as a step toward the design of practical and safe devices and approaches for enhanced drug delivery into the diseased brain area.",

Currently, multiple clinical trials are underway to evaluate the antitumor activity of recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and agonistic antibodies that target death receptors (DRs) 4 or 5. It is encouraging that these products have shown a tolerated safety profile in early phase studies. However, their therapeutic potential is likely limited by the emergence of tumor drug resistance phenomena. Increasing evidence indicates that TRAIL DRs are deficient on the plasma membrane of some cancer cells despite their total protein expression. Notably, the lack of surface DR4/DR5 is sufficient to render cancers resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, regardless of the status of other apoptosis signaling components. The current review highlights recent findings on the dynamic expression of TRAIL death receptors, including the regulatory roles of endocytosis, autophagy, and Ras GTPase-mediated signaling events. This information could aid in the identification of novel predictive biomarkers of tumor response as well as the development of combinational drugs to overcome or bypass tumor drug resistance to TRAIL receptor-targeted therapies.",

Yet, cisplatin resistance is a major impediment in cancer therapy, and deciphering the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance is crucial for the development of novel therapies with enhanced efficacy. The Rho subfamily of small GTPases plays a significant role in cancer progression, and a growing body of evidence points toward the involvement of these proteins in anticancer drug resistance, including cisplatin resistance. The cycling between active and inactive states, governed by the balance between their GEFs, GAPs and GDIs, RhoGTPases, acts as molecular switches with a pivotal role in actin cytoskeleton organization. The Rho subfamily of proteins is involved in many key cellular processes including adhesion, vesicular trafficking, proliferation, survival, cell morphology and cell\u2013matrix interactions. Although RhoA, RhoB and RhoC are highly homologous and share some upstream regulators and downstream effectors, they each have different roles in cancer progression and chemoresistance. While RhoA and RhoC are upregulated in many tumors and can stimulate transformation, RhoB appears to exhibit tumor suppressor characteristics with proapoptotic effects. In the current review, we discuss the role of Rho subfamily of proteins in cancer, and focus on their involvement in intrinsic and acquired drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent one of the largest and oldest families of membrane proteins in all extant phyla from prokaryotes to humans, which couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis essentially to translocate, among various substrates, toxic compounds across the membrane. The fundamental functions of these multiple transporter proteins include: (1) conserved mechanisms related to nutrition and pathogenesis in bacteria, (2) spore formation in fungi, and (3) signal transduction, protein secretion and antigen presentation in eukaryotes. Moreover, one of the major causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) and chemotherapeutic failure in cancer therapy is believed to be the ABC transporter-mediated active efflux of a multitude of structurally and mechanistically distinct cytotoxic compounds across membranes. It has been postulated that ABC transporter inhibitors known as chemosensitizers may be used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The current paper reviews the advance in the past decade in this important domain of cancer chemoresistance and summarizes the development of new compounds and the re-evaluation of compounds originally designed for other targets as transport inhibitors of ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps.",

However, the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib is hampered by the emergence of acquired resistance, for which multifactorial mechanisms have been identified. This review summarizes the current status of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to proteasome inhibitors that emerged in preclinical therapeutic studies, and discusses these findings in the clinical perspective of novel therapeutic modalities of hematological malignancies. The specific topics that will be addressed in the current review include the recently established mechanisms of resistance to proteasome inhibitors: the role of constitutive and immunoproteasomes, mutations in proteasome subunits, unfolded protein response, XBP1 and MARCKS proteins, multidrug efflux transporters, aggresomes and autophagy, as well as the impact of pro-survival signaling pathways and bone marrow microenvironment. The growing knowledge of the determinants that confer bortezomib resistance and/or toxicity has provided the basis for the rational development of second generation proteasome inhibitors, some of which were recently approved or that are undergoing clinical evaluation as novel strategies to overcome bortezomib resistance as well as to enhance clinical therapeutic efficacy along with minimal side effects.

After carefully reading the titles and abstracts based on the three previously mentioned criteria, 103 publications were evaluated. Backward citation screening was performed on all eligible studies and revealed another 24 articles. This search revealed that (1) High glucose uptake and low contrast enhancement on PET- and CT-imaging before start of treatment may correlate with poor response to therapy, (2) Low dose intensity due to treatment intolerance is related to shorter progression free survival. (3) Acquired resistance appears to be associated with rebound vascularization based on both longitudinal monitoring of contrast enhancement by CT and blood vessel counts in tumor tissue, and (4) Based on plasma cytokine and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies, interleukin-8, VEGFR-3, FGFR2 and HGF/MET emerged as potential clinical markers for chemoresistance.Low dose intensity, specific tumor-imaging techniques and potential biological biomarkers may be predictive for response to VEGF-targeted therapy in ccRCC.

     "abstract": "Conventional cancer treatment modalities have several limitations including lack of sufficient efficacy, serious untoward toxicity, as well as innate and acquired drug resistance. In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FR\u03b1-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FR\u03b1 tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, 99mTc-etarfolatide (99mTc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FR\u03b1-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FR\u03b1. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FR\u03b1-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. 99mTc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FR\u03b1 expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FR\u03b1 and FR\u03b2 in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.",

Five of these settings had declining trends (Estonia, Latvia, Macao, Hong Kong, and Portugal) ranging from decreases of 3% to 14% annually, while five had increasing trends (four individual oblasts of the Russian Federation and Botswana) ranging from 14% to 20% annually. In unadjusted analysis, better surveillance indicators and higher GDP per capita were associated with declining MDR-TB, while a higher existing absolute burden of MDR-TB was associated with an increasing trend.Only a small fraction of countries in which the burden of MDR-TB is concentrated currently have sufficient surveillance data to estimate trends in drug-resistant TB. Where trend analysis was possible, smaller absolute burdens of MDR-TB and more robust surveillance systems were associated with declining per capita rates of MDR-TB among new notified cases.",

An azole resistance mechanism typically decreases the activity of multiple azole compounds, depending on the mutation. As alternative treatment options are limited and in some isolates the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) increases by only a few two-fold dilutions steps, we investigated if voriconazole and posaconazole have a role in treating azole-resistant Aspergillus disease. The relation between resistance genotype and phenotype, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and (pre)clinical treatment efficacy were reviewed. The results were used to estimate the exposure needed to achieve the pharmacodynamic target for each MIC. For posaconazole adequate exposure can be achieved only for wild type isolates as dose escalation does not allow PD target attainment. However, the new intravenous formulation might result in sufficient exposure to treat isolates with a MIC of 0.5\u00a0mg/L. For voriconazole our analysis indicated that the exposure needed to treat infection due to isolates with a MIC of 2\u00a0mg/L is feasible and maybe isolates with a MIC of 4\u00a0mg/L. However, extreme caution and strict monitoring of drug levels would be required, as the probability of toxicity will also increase.",

The present article proposed a novel model of module network rewiring to characterize functional reorganization of a complex biological system, and described a new framework named as module network rewiring-analysis (MNR) for systematically studying dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance during drug treatment. MNR was used to investigate functional reorganization or rewiring on the module network, rather than molecular network or individual molecules. Our experiments on expression data of patients with Hepatitis C virus infection receiving Interferon therapy demonstrated that consistent module genes derived by MNR could be directly used to reveal new genotypes relevant to drug sensitivity, unlike the other differential analyses of gene expressions. Our results showed that functional connections and reconnections among consistent modules bridged by biological paths were necessary for achieving effective responses of a drug. The hierarchical structures of the temporal module network can be considered as spatio-temporal biomarkers to monitor the efficacy, efficiency, toxicity, and resistance of the therapy. Our study indicates that MNR is a useful tool to identify module biomarkers and further predict dynamical drug sensitivity and resistance, characterize complex dynamic processes for therapy response, and provide biologically systematic clues for pharmacogenomic applications.",

This oxazolidinone drug has in vitro and in vivo activity against essentially all Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The in vitro activity of linezolid was well documented prior to its clinical application, and several ongoing surveillance studies demonstrated consistent and potent results during the subsequent years of clinical use. Emergence of resistance has been limited and associated with invasive procedures, deep organ involvement, presence of foreign material and mainly prolonged therapy. Non-susceptible organisms usually demonstrate alterations in the 23S rRNA target, which remain the main resistance mechanism observed in enterococci; although a few reports have described the detection of cfr-mediated resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. S. aureus isolates non-susceptible to linezolid remain rare in large surveillance studies. Most isolates harbour 23S rRNA mutations; however, cfr-carrying MRSA isolates have been observed in the United States and elsewhere. It is still uncertain whether the occurrences of such isolates are becoming more prevalent. Coagulase-negative isolates (CoNS) resistant to linezolid were uncommon following clinical approval. Surveillance data have indicated that CoNS isolates, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis, currently account for the majority of Gram-positive organisms displaying elevated MIC results to linezolid. In addition, these isolates frequently demonstrate complex and numerous resistance mechanisms, such as alterations in the ribosomal proteins L3 and/or L4 and/or presence of cfr and/or modifications in 23S rRNA. The knowledge acquired during the past decades on this initially used oxazolidinone has been utilized for developing new candidate agents, such as tedizolid and radezolid, and as linezolid patents soon begin to expire, generic brands will certainly become available. These events will likely establish a new chapter for this successful class of antimicrobial agents.",

Docetaxel resistance is either intrinsic or acquired by adopting various mechanisms that are highly associated with genetic alterations, decreased influx and increased efflux of drugs. Several combination therapies and small P-glycoprotein inhibitors have been proposed to improve the therapeutic potential of docetaxel in prostate cancer. Novel therapeutic strategies that may allow reversal of docetaxel resistance include alterations of enzymes, improving drug uptake and enhancement of apoptosis. In this review, we provide the most current docetaxel reversal approaches utilizing nanotechnology.

Experimental evolution offers a compelling addition to such studies because the combination of replicated experiments under tightly controlled conditions with genomics of intermediate time points allows real-time reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories. Recent studies thus established causal links between antibiotic deployment therapies and the course and timing of mutations, the cost of resistance and the likelihood of compensating mutations. They particularly underscored the importance of long-term effects. Similar investigations incorporating horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are wanting, likely because of difficulties associated with its integration into experiments. In this review, we describe current advances in experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance and reflect on ways to incorporate horizontal gene transfer into the approach. We contend it provides a powerful tool for systematic and highly controlled dissection of evolutionary paths to antibiotic resistance that needs to be taken into account for the development of sustainable anti-bacterial treatment strategies.",

Experimental evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of specific miRNAs leads to drug resistance in different cancers and correction of these miRNAs using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs can normalize the gene regulatory network and signaling pathways and sensitize cancerous cells to chemotherapy. Therefore, miRNA-based gene therapy provides an attractive anti-tumor approach for integrated cancer therapy.

Almost every week new data appear on how direct acting antivirals (DAAs) succeed or fail in clinical trials. Despite the potency of many of the DAA combinations, the effect exerted by ribavirin (RBV) is still needed for an effective therapy in many new DAA combinations. Due to the strong antiviral effect of DAAs, it is likely that a major complementary therapeutic effect exerted by RBV is immune modulation resulting in an increased barrier to development of resistance. For HCV genotype 1a infections elimination of pegylated interferon, is not possible in many DAA combinations without jeopardizing the results. The host immune response is thus likely to play a key role even during DAA-based therapies. Hence, T cells may recognize and eliminate viral variants with resistance to the DAAs. We herein show several examples where this may be the case, supporting the rationale of including the host response also in the new therapeutic regimens. This review will describe the potential benefits of combining various DAAs with means to activate the specific immune response against HCV.",

The tumor stroma mainly consists of the basement membrane, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, immune cells, and vasculature. Although most host cells in the stroma possess certain tumor-suppressing abilities, the stroma will change during malignancy and eventually promote growth, invasion, and metastasis. There is growing evidence that the stroma influences importantly the response to radiation therapy (RT). On the one hand, irradiation releases numerous inflammatory cytokines within the extracellular matrix and activates tumor specific antigens presentation, triggering an immune reaction that contributes to the antitumor effect seen after RT. On the other hand, the stroma significantly contributes to radioresistance but also increases the metastatic risk. Indeed, fibroblasts, which are major actors of the impact of stroma on tumor response, are involved in activation of autocrine and paracrine molecular signaling pathways regulating tumor cell proliferation, cell death, response to hypoxia, DNA repair systems and mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition. They are also actors of the peritumoral desmoplastic reaction, which decreases tumor radiosensitivity. The irradiated stroma can also contribute to tumor relapse after RT through recruitment of bone marrow-derived progenitors that contribute to local tumor relapse through neovascularization. It is therefore time to question preclinical models that would not take into account this impact of stroma. The increasing knowledge of the relationship between stroma and response to IR could help developing innovative strategies for potentially improve antitumor effect of RT.",

Serious infections due to these organisms are usually treated with extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). However, in the past two decades we have faced a rapid increasing of infections and colonization caused by ESC-resistant (ESC-R) isolates due to production of extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpCs (pAmpCs) and/or carbapenemase enzymes. This situation limits drastically our therapeutic armamentarium and puts under peril the human health. Animals are considered as potential reservoirs of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms. The massive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine has contributed to the selection of ESC-R E. coli, ESC-R Salmonella spp. and, to less extent, MDR Acinetobacter spp. among animals, food, and environment. This complex scenario is responsible for the expansion of these MDR organisms which may have life-threatening clinical significance. Nowadays, the prevalence of food-producing animals carrying ESC-R E. coli and ESC-R Salmonella (especially those producing CTX-M-type ESBLs and the CMY-2 pAmpC) has reached worryingly high values. More recently, the appearance of carbapenem-resistant isolates (i.e., VIM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and NDM-1 or OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp.) in livestock has even drawn greater concerns. In this review, we describe the aspects related to the spread of the above MDR organisms among pigs, cattle, and poultry, focusing on epidemiology, molecular mechanisms of resistance, impact of antibiotic use, and strategies to contain the overall problem.

Thus, in order to understand how emerging approaches to drug development might aid the creation of new therapeutic combinations, it is critical to understand the defining principles underlying classic combination therapy and the original experimental rationales behind them. One such principle is that the use of combination therapies with independent mechanisms of action can minimize the evolution of drug resistance. Another is that in order to kill sufficient cancer cells to cure a patient, multiple drugs must be delivered at their maximum tolerated dose \u2013 a condition that allows for enhanced cancer cell killing with manageable toxicity. In light of these models, we aim to explore recent genomic evidence underlying the mechanisms of resistance to the combination regimens constructed on these principles. Interestingly, we find that emerging genomic evidence contradicts some of the rationales of early practitioners in developing commonly used drug regimens. However, we also find that the addition of recent targeted therapies has yet to change the current principles underlying the construction of anti-cancer combinatorial regimens, nor have they made substantial inroads into the treatment of most cancers. We suggest that emerging systems/network biology approaches have an immense opportunity to impact the rational development of successful drug regimens. Specifically, by examining drug combinations in multivariate ways, next generation combination therapies can be constructed with a clear understanding of how mechanisms of resistance to multi-drug regimens differ from single agent resistance.",

Among novel antifolates are pemetrexed which primarily targets thymidylate synthase as well as pralatrexate which blocks dihydrofolate reductase, and displays enhanced transport and cellular retention properties. The present review describes the evolution and pharmacological activity of antifolates and prospects for the development of the next generation antifolates. Pre-clinical and clinical studies identified a plethora of mechanisms of antifolate resistance that are a primary hindrance to curative cancer chemotherapy; these are frequently associated with qualitative and/or quantitative alterations in influx and/or efflux transporters of antifolates and in folate-dependent enzymes. Current advances including for example the deciphering of the dominant folate transporter proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT/SLC46A1) facilitated the synthesis of experimental antifolates aimed at selectively targeting solid tumor cells, which reside in an acidic microenvironment where PCFT supposedly functions optimally. Moreover, drugs that are structurally and mechanistically distinct from folates were conjugated to folic acid (e.g. Vintafolide/EC145, a folic acid desacetylvinblastine conjugate) to facilitate endocytosis via the folate receptor (FR) which is markedly overexpressed in various solid tumors. In an alternative approach, novel antifolates selectively targeting the FR but not other folate transporters are being developed (e.g. BGC 945). Hence, targeting mechanisms of antifolate-resistance could facilitate the development of rationally-based novel antifolates and strategies that overcome chemoresistance.",

Indeed, a large body of preclinical data supports such an action, but promising clinical data are still limited to basal cell carcinoma (BSC) and medulloblastoma.

     "abstract": "Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405\u2013470\u00a0nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P. acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.",

The 16S-RMTases are classified into two subgroups, N7-G1405 16S-RMTases and N1-A1408 16S-RMTases, based on the mode of modification of 16S rRNA. Both MTases add the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to the specific nucleotides at the A-site of 16S rRNA, which interferes with aminoglycoside binding to the target. The genetic determinants responsible for 16S-RMTase production are often mediated by mobile genetic elements like transposons and further embedded into transferable plasmids or chromosome. This genetic apparatus may thus contribute to the rapid worldwide dissemination of the resistance mechanism among pathogenic microbes. More worrisome is the fact that 16S-RMTase genes are frequently associated with other antimicrobial resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1 metallo-\u03b2-lactamase and CTX-M-type ESBLs, and some highly pathogenic microbes including Salmonella spp. have already acquired these genes. Thus far, 16S-RMTases have been reported from at least 30 countries or regions. The worldwide dissemination of 16S-RMTases is becoming a serious global concern and this implies the necessity to continue investigations on the trend of 16S-RMTases to restrict their further worldwide dissemination.",

In general, drug treatment is long, costly, and often associated with drug-related toxicities; outcome of drug treatment is poor and is likely related to the high levels of natural antibiotic resistance in NTM. The role of drug susceptibility testing (DST) in the choice of agents for antimicrobial treatment of NTM disease, mainly that by slow growers, remains subject of debate. There are important discrepancies between drug susceptibility measured in vitro and the activity of the drug observed in vivo. In part, these discrepancies derive from laboratory technical issues. There is still no consensus on a standardized method. With the increasing clinical importance of NTM disease, DST of NTM is again in the spotlight.

To improve the efficacy of treatment, there is an increasing interest in combining radiotherapy with novel targeted therapies. Inhibiting the growth of new tumor blood vessels, i.e. tumor angiogenesis, is such a targeted therapy. Growing tumors induce angiogenesis to ensure an adequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients and several angiostatic drugs have been approved for the treatment of cancer patients. Both pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that radiotherapy can influence tumor angiogenesis and that angiogenesis inhibition can potentiate the effect of radiotherapy. Therefore, the combination of angiogenesis inhibition and radiotherapy holds a promising future in cancer treatment. However, the radiosensitizing effects of angiogenesis inhibition are transient and recent findings indicate that the effects of irradiation on angiogenesis depend on the dose and treatment schedule. This raises questions regarding the scheduling of both treatment modalities in order to achieve the optimal treatment efficacy with minimal toxicity. In this review the opportunities and pitfalls of combining angiostatic agents with radiotherapy are discussed. The lessons learned from (pre)clinical studies are summarized with an emphasis on scheduling and dosing of the combination therapy.

Multiple mechanisms contribute to drug resistance such as increased drug efflux, altered drug metabolism, secondary mutations in drug targets, and activation of downstream or parallel signal transduction pathways. The rapid kinetics, the reversibility of acquired drug resistance and the absence of genetic mutations suggest an epigenetic basis for drug insensitivity. Similar to the cellular variance seen in the human body, epigenetic mechanisms, through reversible histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns, generate a variety of transcriptional states resulting in a dynamic heterogeneous tumor cell population. Consequently, epigenomes favoring survival in the presence of a drug by aberrant transcription of drug transporters, DNA-repair enzymes and pro-apoptotic factors render cytotoxic and targeted drugs ineffective and allow selection of rare drug-resistant tumor cells. Recent advances in charting cancer genomes indeed strongly indicate a role for epigenetic regulators in driving cancer, which may result in the acquisition of additional (epi)genetic modifications leading to drug resistance. These observations have important clinical consequences as they provide an opportunity for \u201cepigenetic drugs\u201d to change reversible drug-resistance-associated epigenomes to prevent or reverse non-responsiveness to anti-cancer drugs.",

Despite clear in vitro evidence that P-glycoprotein (Pgp), encoded by MDR-1, is able to dramatically reduce drug concentrations in cultured cells, and that drug accumulation can be increased by small molecule inhibitors, clinical trials testing this paradigm have mostly failed. Some have argued that it is no longer worthy of study. However, repeated analyses have demonstrated MDR-1 expression in a tumor is a poor prognostic indicator leading some to conclude MDR-1 is a marker of a more aggressive phenotype, rather than a mechanism of drug resistance. In this review we will re-evaluate the MDR-1 story in light of our new understanding of molecular targeted therapy, using breast and lung cancer as examples.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1, ABCB1), as well as a family of structurally and functionally related proteins, are plasma membrane transporters able to efflux a variety of substrates from the cell cytoplasm, including chemotherapeutic agents. The discovery of ABCB1 made available a potential target for pharmacologic down-regulation of efflux-mediated chemotherapy resistance. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a neoplasm characterized by proliferation of poorly differentiated myeloid progenitor cells, leukemic cells often express ABCB1 at high levels, which may lead to the development of resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, AML seemed to be a likely cancer for which the addition of drug efflux inhibitors to the chemotherapeutic regimen would improve outcomes in patients. Despite this rational hypothesis, the majority of clinical trials evaluating this strategy have failed to reach a positive endpoint, most recently the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E3999 trial.

The controversy regarding the contribution of ABC transporters to drug resistance in patients is one example. The study of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), which closely resemble cancer in human patients, can help to bridge this gap. In models for BRCA1- or BRCA2-associated breast cancer, we observed a substantial synergy between the defect in homology-directed DNA repair and sensitivity to DNA-targeting drugs. Nevertheless, tumors are not easily eradicated and eventually drug resistance develops.

Importantly, clues to key resistance mechanisms may lie in the well-orchestrated and highly conserved cellular and systemic responses to injury and stress. Many anti-neoplastic therapies typically rely on DNA damage, which engages potent DNA damage response signaling pathways that culminate in apoptosis or growth arrest at checkpoints to allow for damage repair. However, an alternative cellular response, senescence, can also be initiated when challenged with these internal/external pressures and in ideal situations acts as a self-protecting mechanism. Senescence-induction therapies are an attractive concept in that they represent a normal, highly conserved and commonly invoked tumor-suppressing response to overwhelming genotoxic stress or oncogene activation. Yet, such approaches should ensure that senescence by-pass or senescence re-emergence does not occur, as emergent cells appear to have highly drug resistant phenotypes. Further, cell non-autonomous senescence responses may contribute to therapy-resistance in certain circumstances. Here we provide an overview of mechanisms by which cellular senescence plausibly contributes to therapy resistance and concepts by which senescence responses can be influenced to improve cancer treatment outcomes.",

We summarize alternative sources of resistance among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through regulation of ligand availability, post-translational modification of EGFR, availability of EGFR partners for hetero-dimerization and control of EGFR intracellular trafficking for recycling versus degradation. Finally, we discuss new strategies to identify effective therapeutic combinations involving EGFR-targeted inhibitors, in the context of new system level data becoming available for analysis of individual tumors.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. Despite many therapeutic opportunities, prognosis remains dismal for patients with metastatic disease, and a significant portion of early-stage patients develop recurrence after chemotherapy. Epigenetic gene regulation is a major mechanism of cancer initiation and progression, through the inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes. Emerging evidence indicates that epigenetics may also play a key role in the development of chemoresistance. In the present review, we summarize epigenetic mechanisms triggering resistance to three commonly used agents in colorectal cancer: 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Those epigenetic biomarkers may help stratify colorectal cancer patients and develop a tailored therapeutic approach. In addition, epigenetic modifications are reversible through specific drugs: histone-deacetylase and DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitors. Preclinical studies suggest that these drugs may reverse chemoresistance in colorectal tumors. In conclusion, an epigenetic approach to colorectal cancer chemoresistance may pave the way to personalized treatment and to innovative therapeutic strategies.",

Thus inhibition of these survival pathways or efflux transporter expression may increase the efficacy of drug treatment. Here we review the role of the oncogenic PIM kinase family in regulating important proliferation and survival pathways in cancer cells and the involvement of PIM kinases in the expression and activity of MDR-1 and BCRP, two of the most important drug efflux transporters. PIM kinases are over expressed in various types of tumors and regulate the activation of signaling pathways that are important for tumor cell proliferation, survival and expression of drug efflux proteins. This makes PIM kinases attractive targets for the development of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. Focussing mainly on solid tumors, we provide an update on the literature describing the tumorigenic functions of PIM kinases. Also we provide an overview of the development of selective small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. Because of the intense effort by pharmaceutical companies and academia it is reasonable to expect that PIM kinase inhibitors will enter the clinic in the foreseeable future. We therefore finish this review with a discussion on the most efficient application of these PIM inhibitors. This includes a consideration of which tumor type is the most appropriate target for treatment, how to select the patient population that stands to gain the most from treatment with PIM inhibitors, which molecular markers are suitable to follow the course of treatment and whether PIM kinase inhibitors should be used as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic agents.",

New imaging technologies are now designed to evaluate, in a functional manner, modifications in tumor metabolic activity, cellularity, and vascularization before a reduction in tumor volume can be detected. Introduction of physiological imaging end-points, derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging protocols \u2013 including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) \u2013 allow for early assessment of disruption in tumor perfusion and permeability for targeted anti-angiogenic agents.

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii represent more than 50% of microbial isolates. Additionally, bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones, macrolides and third-generation cephalosporins is of serious concern. The molecular epidemiology and resistance mechanisms of the antimicrobial strains in China exhibited regional specificity, as well as the influence of dissemination of international clonal complexes. The molecular characteristics of MRSA, ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and macrolide-resistant gram-positive Streptococci in China were significantly different from those in other countries and regions, while S. pneumoniae serotypes appear to have been affected by the global spread of prevalent clones in other parts of the world.

The availability of potent antiretroviral drugs and the ability of viral load assays that accurately evaluate the true level of viral replication, have led to a better understanding of pathogenesis of the disease and how to obtain improved therapeutic profiles. The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), based on a combination of three or more antiretroviral drugs, has radically changed the clinical outcome of HIV. In particular, reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs) play an essential role in most protocols and are often used in first line treatment. The high specificity of these inhibitors towards HIV-1 has increased the number of structural and molecular modeling studies of enzyme complexes and that have led to chemical syntheses of more selective second and third-generation NNRTIs. However, a considerable percentage of new HIV-1 infections are caused by the emergence of drug-resistant mutant viruses that complicate treatment strategies.In this review we discuss relevant clinical and structural aspects for the management of antiretroviral drug resistance, with detailed explanations of mechanisms and mutation patterns useful to better understand the relation between drug resistance and therapy failure.",

     "abstract": "Anticancer drug resistance almost invariably emerges and poses major obstacles towards curative therapy of various human malignancies. In the current review we will distinguish between mechanisms of chemoresistance that are predominantly mediated by ATP-driven multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux transporters, typically of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, and those that are independent of such drug efflux pumps. In recent years, multiple nanoparticle (NP)-based therapeutic systems have been developed that were rationally designed to overcome drug resistance by neutralizing, evading or exploiting various drug efflux pumps and other resistance mechanisms. NPs are being exploited for selective drug delivery to tumor cells, to cancer stem/tumor initiating cells and/or to the supportive cancer cell microenvironment, i.e. stroma or tumor vasculature. Some of these NPs are currently undergoing preclinical in vivo studies as well as advanced stages of clinical evaluation with promising results. Nanovehicles harboring a payload of therapeutic drug combinations for the selective targeting and elimination of tumor cells as well as the simultaneous overcoming of mechanisms of drug resistance are a subject of intense research efforts, some of which are expected to enter clinical trials in the near future. In the present review we highlight novel approaches to selectively target cancer cells and overcome drug resistance phenomena, through the use of various nanometric drug delivery systems. In the near future, it is anticipated that innovative theragnostic nanovehicles will be developed which will harbor four major components: (1) a selective targeting moiety, (2) a diagnostic imaging aid for the localization of the malignant tumor and its micro- or macrometastases, (3) a cytotoxic, small molecule drug(s) or novel therapeutic biological(s), and (4) a chemosensitizing agent aimed at neutralizing a resistance mechanism, or exploiting a molecular \u201cAchilles hill\u201d of drug resistant cells. We propose to name these envisioned four element-containing nanovehicle platform, \u201cquadrugnostic\u201d nanomedicine.

More data now allow reassessment of these CBPs.We examined cases of echinocandin failure where both MICs and fks mutations were assessed; wild type (WT) MICs and epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs) for a large Candida collection; molecular analysis of fks hotspots for Candida with known MICs; and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data. We applied these findings to propose new species-specific CBPs for echinocandins and Candida.Of 18 candidiasis cases refractory to echinocandins and with fks mutations, 28% (CSF), 58% (ANF) and 66% (MCF) had MICs in the S category using CBP of \u22642\u00a0mcg/ml, while 0\u20138% would be S using CBP of \u22640.25\u00a0mcg/ml.

Among Candida tested for fks mutations, only 15.7\u201345.1% of 51 mutants were detected using the CBP for NS of >2\u00a0mcg/ml.

     "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, resistance to platinum agents invariably develops. Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have great potential here as they exert their anti-tumour effect via alternative mechanisms to platinum-based drugs and as such may remain unaffected by emergent resistance to platinum.A systematic review was conducted to investigate whether two EGFR-TKIs, erlotinib and gefitinib, have efficacy in the platinum-resistance setting. Preclinical studies of platinum-resistant cancer cell lines, which had been subsequently treated with EGFR-TKIs, were sought to establish proof-of-concept. Clinical trials reporting administration of EGFR-TKIs to ovarian cancer and NSCLC patients relapsed after therapy with platinum drugs were investigated to determine sensitivity of these cohorts to EGFR-TKI treatment. The role of EGFR mutation, copy number and protein expression on response to EGFR-TKIs after failure of platinum chemotherapy were also investigated.Preclinical models of platinum-resistant cancer were found which display a spectrum of cross-resistance profiles to EGFR-TKIs. Sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs is dependent on the activation of the EGFR pathway or EGFR interacting proteins such as HER-2. EGFR-TKIs show favourable response rates in platinum-pretreated NSCLC, 11.14% and 15.25% for 150\u00a0mg/day erlotinib and 250\u00a0mg/day gefitinib, respectively. These response rates significantly improve in patients of Asian descent (28.3% and 29.17%, respectively) and patients with EGFR activation mutations (41.6% and 63.89%, respectively) or increased copy number (33.3% and 45.45%, respectively). Gefitinib significantly outperformed erlotinib and should therefore be the EGFR-TKI of choice in platinum-pretreated relapsed NSCLC. In contrast, response rates are very poor to both erlotinib and gefitinib in platinum pretreated ovarian cancer, 0\u20135.9% and they should not be used in this cohort of patients.Preclinical models demonstrate that, while cross resistance can occur between platinums and EGFR-TKIs, there is not a generalised cross-resistance phenotype. Erlotinib and gefitinib are suitable for the treatment of platinum-pretreated NSCLC, particularly in patients with EGFR mutations or increases in copy number. Unfortunately, the high rates of EGFR protein overexpression in ovarian cancer are not translating to a clinically useful therapeutic target for EGFR-TKIs; EGFR mutations are rare in ovarian cancer. Newer TKIs may improve response rates in these cohorts and future clinical trials need to collect tumour biopsies from all patients to ensure the success of personalised chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Resistance towards chemotherapy, either primary or acquired, represents a major obstacle in clinical oncology. Three basic categories underlie most cases of chemotherapy failure: Inadequate pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, tumor cell intrinsic factors such as the expression of drug efflux pumps and tumor cell extrinsic conditions present in the tumor microenvironment, characterized by such hostile conditions as hypoxia, acidosis, nutrient starvation and increased interstitial pressure. Tumor hypoxia has been known to negatively affect therapy outcome for decades. Hypoxia inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, ultimately conferring chemoresistance since anticancer drugs preferentially target rapidly proliferating cells. However, this knowledge has been largely neglected while screening for anti-proliferative substances in vitro, resulting in hypoxia-mediated failure of most newly identified substances in vivo. To achieve a tangible therapeutic benefit from this knowledge, the mechanisms that drive tumoral responses to hypoxia need to be identified and exploited for their validity as innovative therapy targets. The HIF family of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors represents the main mediator of the hypoxic response and is widely upregulated in human cancers. HIF-1\u03b1 and to a lesser extent HIF-2\u03b1, the oxygen-regulated HIF isoforms, have been associated with chemotherapy failure and interference with HIF function holds great promise to improve future anticancer therapy. In this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of the HIFs in drug resistance. Specifically, we will highlight the multifaceted interaction of HIF with apoptosis, senescence, autophagy, p53 and mitochondrial activity and outline how these are at the heart of HIF-mediated therapy failure.",

The optimization of dosing regimens is accomplished by choosing the dose and schedule that results in the antimicrobial exposure that will achieve the microbiological and clinical outcome desired while simultaneously suppressing emergence of resistance. PK/PD of antimicrobial agents describe how the therapeutic drug effect is dependent on the potency of a drug against a microorganism and the exposure (the concentration of antimicrobial available for effect over time). The description and modeling of these relationships quantitatively then allow for a rational approach to dose optimization and several strategies to that purpose are described. These strategies include not only the dosing regimen itself but also the duration of therapy, preventing collateral damage through inappropriate use and the application of PK/PD in drug development. Furthermore, PK/PD relationships of older antibiotics need to be urgently established. The need for global harmonization of breakpoints is also suggested and would add efficacy to antibiotic therapy. For each of the strategies, a number of priority actions are provided.",

In addition, PubMed was searched for antibacterial agents in development that appeared in review articles. Out of 90 agents that were considered to fulfil the inclusion criteria for the analysis, 66 were new active substances. Fifteen of these could be systemically administered and were assessed as acting via a new or possibly new mechanism of action or on a new or possibly new target. Out of these, 12 agents were assessed as having documented in vitro activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria and only four had documented in vitro activity against antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Of these four, two acted on new or possibly new targets and, crucially, none acted via new mechanisms of action. There is an urgent need to address the lack of effective treatments to meet the increasing public health burden caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, in particular against Gram-negative bacteria.",

     "abstract": "The introduction of antimicrobial drugs in medicine gave hope for a future in which all infectious diseases could be controlled. Decades later it appears certain this will not be the case, because antibiotic resistance is growing relentlessly. Bacteria possess an extraordinary ability to adapt to environmental challenges like antimicrobials by both genetic and phenotypic means, which contributes to their evolutionary success. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that adaptation is a major mechanism behind the acquisition and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Adaptive resistance is a specific class of non-mutational resistance that is characterized by its transient nature. It occurs in response to certain environmental conditions or due to epigenetic phenomena like persistence. We propose that this type of resistance could be the key to understanding the failure of some antibiotic therapy programs, although adaptive resistance mechanisms are still somewhat unexplored. Similarly, hard wiring of some of the changes involved in adaptive resistance might explain the phenomenon of \u201cbaseline creep\u201d whereby the average minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a given medically important bacterial species increases steadily but inexorably over time, making the likelihood of breakthrough resistance greater. This review summarizes the available information on adaptive resistance.",

     "abstract": "Sirtuins, commonly referred to as SIRTs, are a family of seven mammalian NAD+-dependent deacetylases implicated in the regulation of critical biological processes, including metabolism, cell division, differentiation, survival, and senescence. These diverse functions reflect the ability of SIRTs to target and modify a broad spectrum of protein substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, signalling components, transcription factors, and histones. SIRTs are also implicated in tumorigenesis as well as in the response of the tumour to chemotherapy. In particular, SIRT1 has been found to be overexpressed in many drug resistant cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that the role of SIRTs in drug resistance may be foremost related to their ability to target and modulate the activity of tumour suppressors, including p53, p73, E2F1, and FOXO3a. In other words, while SIRT-dependent deacetylation of transcription factors is normally used to fine-tune gene expression, this function is hijacked by cancer cells to evade proliferative arrest and cell death in response to chemotherapy. Consequently, interventions predicated on disrupting the interactions between tumour suppressors and SIRTs may be effective in circumventing or reversing drug resistance in cancer.",

Unfortunately, their efficacy has been reduced by the surge and dissemination of resistance. In some cases the levels of resistance reached the point that rendered them virtually useless.

Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes catalyze the modification at different \u2013OH or \u2013NH2 groups of the 2-deoxystreptamine nucleus or the sugar moieties and can be nucleotidyltranferases, phosphotransferases, or acetyltransferases.

Aside from the development of new aminoglycosides refractory to as many as possible modifying enzymes there are currently two main strategies being pursued to overcome the action of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes.

More than 15 years of experimentation recognized E2F1 as the key player in apoptosis induced by DNA damage in all types of human cancer. This occurs by several mechanisms that affect RB-E2F1 interaction, E2F1 stability and its binding to promoters of E2F1-regulated genes. Recent progress has been made in revealing new proapoptotic genes regulated by E2F1 and it seems that many still remain to be discovered. However, whereas in the past one focused mainly on identifying E2F1 target genes translating cellular stress signals into cell death, today the DNA damage-induced regulatory network governing E2F1's ability to induce apoptosis is rapidly gaining attention as well. Notably, the lately uncovered role of pRB and E2F3 in triggering E2F1-dependent apoptosis through chemotherapy gains our understanding of the DNA damage response in normal and tumor cells. In this context a large body of evidence indicates that nuclear cofactors targeting E2F1 seem to have a major impact on its tumor suppressor function.

The canonical pathway involves the activation of JAK following ligand binding to cytokine receptors. The activated JAKs then phosphorylate STAT proteins, leading to their dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. In the nucleus, STATs act as transcription factors with pleiotropic downstream effects. STATs can be activated independently of JAKs, most notably by c-Src kinases. In cancer cells, STAT3 and STAT5 activation leads to the increased expression of downstream target genes, leading to increased cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and immune system evasion. STAT3 and STAT5 are expressed and activated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) where they contribute to cell survival and proliferation. In HNSCC, STATs can be activated by a number of signal transduction pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), \u03b17 nicotinic receptor, interleukin (IL) receptor, and erythropoietin receptor pathways. Activated STATs are also expressed in lung cancer, but the biological effects of JAK/STAT inhibition in this cancer are variable. In lung cancer, STAT3 can be activated by multiple pathways, including EGFR. Several approaches have been used to inhibit STAT3 in the hopes of developing an antitumor agent. Although several STAT3-specific agents are promising, none are in clinical development, mostly because of drug delivery and stability issues. In contrast, several JAK inhibitors are in clinical development. These orally available, ATP-competitive, small-molecule kinase inhibitors are being tested in myeloproliferative disorders. Future studies will determine whether JAK inhibitors are useful in the treatment of HNSCC or lung cancer.",

     "abstract": "Macroautophagy and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system are two complementary pathways for protein degradation. The former degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles while the later degrades short-lived proteins. Recent findings indicate that suppression of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system by proteasome inhibitors induces macroautophagy through multiple pathways, including (1) accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of HDAC6; (2) activation of the IRE1-JNK pathway; (3) proteasomal stabilization of ATF4; (4) inhibition of mTOR complex 1 signaling; (5) reduced proteasomal degradation of LC3. Induction of macroautophagy attenuates the antitumor effect of proteasome inhibitors in various types of cancer. These findings suggest that inhibition of macroautophagy may represent a novel strategy to enhance cellular sensitivity to proteasome inhibition.",

     "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and often fatal malignancy, diagnosed at an advanced stage in more than half of the cases. Chemo-resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of NSCLC patients with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore main research efforts are focused on the development of novel targeted agents. In this review we provide an overview on the use of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor targeting agents in NSCLC models and in early clinical studies. Different TRAIL receptor targeting agents are available which have been tested in NSCLC models and some were tested in the clinic. The efficacy of these drugs as single agents in NSCLC models is discussed as well as different mechanisms of resistance that are found in NSCLC cell lines. In order to maximize sensitivity to TRAIL receptor targeting drugs, combined use with other drugs is of interest. The current status of tested combinations of TRAIL receptor targeting agents with other therapeutics, such as classical cytotoxics, Bcl-2 family targeting agents, proteasome inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors as well as their mechanisms in preclinical studies are discussed. Clinical studies on TRAIL targeted therapies in which NSCLC patients were included are discussed and future perspectives are considered.",

     "abstract": "Within three decades, anti-angiogenic therapy has rapidly evolved into an integral component of current standard anti-cancer treatment. Anti-angiogenic therapy has fulfilled a number of its earlier proposed promises. The universality of this approach is demonstrated by the broad spectrum of malignant and benign tumor entities, as well as non-neoplastic diseases, that are currently treated with anti-angiogenic agents. In contrast to tumor cell targeting therapies, the development of acquired drug resistance (e.g., via mutations in growth factor receptor signaling genes) has not been described yet for the principal target of anti-angiogenic therapy\u2014the tumor endothelium. Moreover, the tumor endothelium has emerged as a critical target of conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The presumption that tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent implies that the number of potential targets of an anti-cancer therapy could be reduced to those that stimulate the angiogenesis process. Therefore, the set of endogenous angiogenesis stimulants might constitute an \u201cAchilles heel\u201d of cancer. Direct targeting of tumor endothelium via, e.g., endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors poses another promising but clinically less explored therapeutic strategy. Indeed, the majority of current anti-angiogenic approaches block the activity of a single or at most a few pro-angiogenic proteins secreted by tumor cells or the tumor stroma. Based on our systems biology work on the angiogenic switch, we predicted that the redundancy of angiogenic signals might limit the efficacy of anti-angiogenic monotherapies. In support of this hypothesis, emerging experimental evidence suggests that tumors may become refractory or even evade the inhibition of a single pro-angiogenic pathway via compensatory upregulation of alternative angiogenic factors. Here, we discuss current concepts and propose novel strategies to overcome tumor evasion of anti-angiogenic therapy. We believe that early detection of tumors, prediction of tumor evasive mechanisms and rational design of anti-angiogenic combinations will direct anti-angiogenic therapy towards its ultimate goal\u2014the conversion of cancer to a dormant, chronic, manageable disease.",

     "abstract": "Our increased understanding of the molecular processes underlying cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation has led to the identification of novel targets for intervention. New agents have become available for combined use to overcome radioresistance and enhance the clinical efficacy of radiotherapy. This rational selection of potential radiosensitizers contrasts with the empirical approach that has dominated the field of chemo-radiotherapy over the last decades. It allows the identification of those patients who will benefit most from a specific combination by exploiting new predictive biomarkers of response. In this review we present several approaches of targeted radiosensitization and discuss the available in vitro and in vivo results that support their translation into clinical trials. We focus on EGFR-inhibiting, anti-angiogenic, apoptosis-modulating and PARP-interfering strategies.",

     "abstract": "During the last 25 years, improvements in our understanding of signaling processes mediating tumor initiation, growth and dissemination have opened the door towards increasingly efficient, selective, but also complex therapeutic approaches. In parallel, the better characterization of altered signaling pathways in tumor cells, as well as the relationship between these alterations and the sensitivity of tumors to given compounds, have forced us to contemplate the use of biomarkers allowing patient selection and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Such biomarkers should become a corner stone for the success of a more rational and \u201cpersonalized\u201d clinical approach to colorectal cancer. Here we give an overview of the \u201csignaling pathway-selective\u201d compounds that are currently in use or under clinical development in the setting of colorectal cancer (CRC) and we discuss promising targets, based on our current knowledge of colorectal tumor cell biology, such as Src family, Wnt and Hegdehog signaling.",
