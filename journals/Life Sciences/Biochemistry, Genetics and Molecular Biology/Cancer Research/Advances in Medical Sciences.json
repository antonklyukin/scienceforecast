     "abstract": "It is estimated that in developed countries the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer (PC) will continue to rise and by 2020 will be the second most fatal cancer. The mortality of PC patients closely parallels the incidence rate, as this malignancy remains asymptomatic until it reaches an advanced stage of disease. Thus, novel biochemical markers that improve the management of PC patients are necessary. The aim of the work that follows is to investigate whether selected inflammatory mediators might be used in the diagnosis of PC, with the aim of improving the prognosis for PC patients.We performed a thorough search for literature pertaining to our investigation via the MEDLINE/PubMed database.It has been proved that certain in\ufb02ammatory mediators might be involved in tumor progression, such as growth, proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of tumor cells. In the present review, we summarized and referred to a number of original papers concerning the clinical significance of selected cytokines and specific inflammatory proteins such as C-reactive protein, as well as of various matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, as potential biomarkers for PC in comparison to well-established tumor markers for this malignancy.Presented proteins might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis and progression of PC.",

     "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of synthesis and folding of membrane and secretory proteins. The fraction of protein passing through the ER represents a large proportion of the total protein in the cell. Protein folding, glycosylation, sorting and transport are essential tasks of the ER and a compromised ER folding network has been recognized to be a key component in the disease pathogenicity of common neurodegenerative, metabolic and malignant diseases. On the other hand, the ER protein folding machinery also holds significant potential for therapeutic interventions. Many causes can lead to ER stress. A disturbed calcium homeostasis, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a persistent overload of misfolded proteins within the ER can drive the course of adisease. In this review the role of ER-stress in diseases of the liver and pancreas will be examined using pancreatitis and Wilson\u00b4s disease as examples. Potential therapeutic targets in ER-stress pathways will also be discussed.",

     "abstract": "Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a common and potentially serious complication of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In this study, we tested the hypothesis whether serum and urinary hepcidin could represent early biomarkers of CI-AKI in patients with normal serum creatinine undergoing PCI. In addition, we assessed serum and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C, eGFR and serum creatinine in these patients.Serum and urinary hepcidin and NGAL, serum cystatin C, were evaluated before, and after 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48\u2009h after PCI using commercially available kits. Serum creatinine was assessed before, 24 and 48\u2009h after PCI.We found a significant rise in serum hepcidin as early as after 4 and 8\u2009h when compared to the baseline values. Serum NGAL increased after 2, 4 and 8\u2009h, and in urinary NGAL after 4, 8 and 24\u2009h after PCI. We found a significant fall in urinary hepcidin after 8 and 24\u2009h after PCI. Serum cystatin C increased significantly 8\u2009h after PCI, reaching peak 24\u2009h after PCI and then decreased after 48\u2009h. The prevalence of CI-AKI was 8%. Urine hepcidin was significantly lower 8 and 24\u2009h after PCI in patients with CI-AKI, while serum and urine NGAL were significantly higher in patients with CI-AKI.Our findings suggest that serum hepcidin might be an early predictive biomarker of ruling out CI-AKI after PCI, thereby contributing to early patient risk stratification. However, our data needs to be validated in large cohorts with various stages of CKD.",

Inclusion criteria were as follows: histopathological examination confirming the diagnosis of primary breast cancer, without previous radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry evaluation of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Ki67 expression was made in all cases. In the EDTA-plasma, the concentrations of VEGF-A and its soluble receptors, sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, were measured applying immunoassay techniques. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were identified with the immune-phenotype CD45\u2212, CD34+, CD133+, CD31+ using flow cytometry.Older women with breast cancer had significantly higher concentrations of VEGF-A as well as sVEGFR2 compared with their younger counterparts. A significantly higher concentration of the soluble form of VEGF receptor type 1 in patients with T1 breast cancer in relation to T2 cases was noted. Also, negative correlations between circulating EPCs and histological grading as well as a soluble form of VEGFR2 with histological grading of breast cancer according to the Elston-Ellis classification were observed.Anti-angiogenic potential is divergent in relation to the clinicopathological determinants.",

After completing training almost all CPX parameters in the ICD-rehab group significantly improved, except for anaerobic threshold (AT). In the CRT group significant improvements were found in 2 parameters: peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and exercise tolerance (metabolic equivalents, METs). Significant reductions in left and right ventricle diameters and an increase in LVEF were observed in both groups after 6 months.Significant improvement in exercise tolerance capacity and increase of LVEF were observed in similar extent both in heart failure patients with CRT and with ICD undergoing the rehabilitation program. Regular, controlled exercise trainings provided additional, safe and easy to conduct therapeutic option for heart failure patients with no indications for CRT.",

Integrin \u03b15\u03b21 sialylation and the shift in relative masses of the enzymatically desialylated subunits were confirmed by confocal microscopy and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The ELISA assay was performed to evaluate sialic acid (SA) influence on integrin \u03b15\u03b21 binding to fibronectin (FN). Cell invasion was investigated by the Transwell invasion assay. The effect of neuraminidases treatment on melanoma cells was assessed by flow cytometry using Maackia amurensis and Sambucus nigra lectins.Both subunits of integrin \u03b15\u03b21 were found to be more abundantly sialylated in primary than in metastatic cells. The removal of SA had no effect on the purified integrin \u03b15\u03b21 binding to FN. Although metastatic cells underwent more pronounced desialylation than primary cells, invasion of primary WM115 cells was more dependent on the presence of \u03b12-3 linked SA than it was in the case of metastatic WM266-4 cells. In both melanoma cell lines not only integrin \u03b15\u03b21 was involved in invasion, however simultaneous desialylation and usage of anti-integrin \u03b15\u03b21 antibodies resulted in lower invasion abilities of primary WM115 cells.Our data suggest that in primary melanoma cells integrin \u03b15\u03b21 action is more likely dependent on its glycosylation profile, i.e. the presence of SA residues, which influence (decreased) their invasion properties and may facilitate malignant melanoma progression.",

     "abstract": "In vitro expansion is an invaluable method to obtain keratinocytes in amounts necessary for effective transplantation therapies. In vitro cell culturing provokes questions concerning potential epigenetic alterations occurring in expanded cells in the context of usefulness for transplantation and safety. The purpose of this study was to investigate as to whether keratinocyte expansion is associated with changes in the activity of genes responsible for the maintenance of epigenetic stability.We focussed on the transcriptional activity of genes involved in different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone modifications. We used quantitative real-time PCR to determine transcript levels of 16 epigenetic remodelling markers in 14 patients in the epidermal cells directly after collection and after in vitro expansion.We observed a remarkable decline in the transcriptional activity of the epigenetic remodelling genes following in vitro expansion, while no further fall of expression with passaging. In whole skin, we found even higher expression levels of the epigenetic markers.Transmission to in vitro environment challenges cellular signalling and metabolism. The regulation of epigenetic remodelling maintains the balance between cellular plasticity and phenotype deviation. This preliminary research demonstrated reduced activity of genes responsible for epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones in in vitro expanded epidermal cells. This observation indicates that epigenome re-patterning in cultured epidermal cells is significantly less intensive than in the skin. Also, this observation may imply that after adaptation to in vitro conditions, the epigenome does not undergo extensive transformation during further cultivation.",

The rate of misdiagnosis of FTD is very high, with patients often waiting for years without a firm diagnosis. This study investigates the current state of the misdiagnosis of FTD using a novel artificial intelligence-based algorithm.An artificial intelligence algorithm has been developed to retrospectively analyse the patient journeys of 47 individuals diagnosed with FTD (age range 52\u201380). The algorithm analysed the efficiency of patient pathways by utilizing a reward signal of \u20121 to +1 to assess the symptoms, imaging techniques, and clinical judgement in both behavioural and language variants of the disease.On average, every patient was subjected to 4.93 investigations, of which 67.4% were radiological scans.

The mean time between appointments was 204 days, and the average patient had their diagnosis altered 7.37 times during their journey. The algorithm proposed improvements by evaluating the interventions that resulted in a decreased reward signal to both the individual and the population as a whole.The study proves that the algorithm can efficiently guide clinical practice and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of FTD whilst making the process of auditing faster and more economically viable.",

Seventy five patients had COPD, of which 70.6% were men and 29.4% were women. Forty-eight subjects had asthma, comprised of 45.8% and 54.2%, men and women, respectively. Dyspnea was assessed with the use of modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Visual Analogue Scale VAS, and BORG scale. All patients underwent spirometry with a broncho-reversibility test.There were no differences in age for neither asthma patients, 56.5\u2009\u00b1\u200911.6 and 55.0\u2009\u00b1\u200912.7 (p\u2009=\u20090.5) for males and females, nor for COPD patients, 66.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.0 and 66.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7 (p\u2009=\u20090.7) for males and females, respectively.

The goal of this study was to assess the reliability of resting and exercise echo Doppler parameters with data obtained by right heart catheterization (RHC).We included 91 patients (84\u2009F, 53.3\u2009\u00b1\u200915.2 years) with SSc. Transthoracic echocardiography followed by exercise Doppler-echocardiography (EDE) were performed. A positive EDE was defined as a \u226520\u2009mmHg increase in tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient (TRPG). RHC with exercise was performed in positive EDE patients and/or in subjects with resting TRPG\u2009>\u200931\u2009mmHg.Finally, RHC was performed in 20 patients. The correlation for the echocardiography and invasive measurement of systolic (sPAP) and mean (mPAP) pulmonary artery pressure was r\u2009=\u20090.66 (p\u2009=\u20090.001) and r\u2009=\u20090.7 (p\u2009=\u20090.001), respectively.

Our results highlight that sPAP has the highest AUC (0.802, 95% CI 0.585\u20131).Doppler resting and exercise echocardiography may provide a reliable, noninvasive method for determining resting and exercise sPAP, mPAP, and PVR in SSc patients, although it may underestimate or overestimate these values in some individuals.

     "abstract": "Difference in the metabolism of normal and cancer cells inspires to search for new, more specific and less toxic therapies than those currently used.The development of tumors is conditioned by genetic changes in cancer-transformed cells, immunological tolerance and immunosuppression. At the initial stages of carcinogenesis, the immune system shows anti-tumor activity, however later, cancer disrupts the function of Th1/Th17/Th2 lymphocytes by regulatory T (Treg) cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and finally causes immunosuppression.Recently, much attention has been devoted to the influence of l-arginine metabolism disorders on both carcinogenesis and the immune system. l-Arginine is essential for the maturation of the T cell receptor zeta (TCR\u03b6), and its absence deprives T-cells of the ability to interact with tumor antigens. MDSCs deplete l-arginine due to a high expression of arginase 1 (ARG1) and their number increases 4\u201310 times depending on the type of the cancer.L-Arginine has been shown to be essential for the survival and progression of arginine auxotrophic tumors. However, the progression of arginine non-auxotrophic tumors is independent of exogenous l-arginine, because these tumors have arginine-succinate synthetase (ASS1) activity and are available to produce l-arginine from citrulline.Clinical studies have confirmed the high efficacy of arginine auxotrophic tumors therapy based on the elimination of l-arginine. However, l-arginine supplementation may improve the results of treatment of patients with arginine non-auxotrophic cancer.This review is an attempt to explain the seemingly contradictory results of oncological therapies based on the deprivation or supplementation of l-arginine.",

Apart from the known role of MCs in basic immunological processes and allergy, underlined is their importance in bone mineralization and in regulation of autoimmune reactions. Mast cell mediators, especially those released from mast cells in degranulation, but also those released constitutively, are important both in metabolic and immunological processes. Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by accumulation of MC in one or more organs. There are scientific data indicating that mastocytosis patients are at increased risk of osteoporosis in the systemic form of the disease and children with cutaneous mastocytosis have a higher rate of hypogammaglobulinemia. Moreover, the origin of osteoporosis in patients with allergy is no longer considered as linked to steroid therapy only, but to the mast cell mediators\u2019 activity as well. There are indications that osteoporosis symptoms in this group of patients may develop independently of the cumulative steroids\u2019 dose. Thus, the influence of mast cells on metabolic and immunologic processes in allergic patients should be investigated. The assessment of mast cell activity and burden in mastocytosis may be used to guide clinical management of patients with allergy.",

The biochemical parameters were assayed in the rat\u2019s livers.In the liver of SHRs an increase in endocannabinoids level, the activity of enzymes degrading them and expression of the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) receptor as well as a decrease in the expression of the CB1 and vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1) were shown. These changes were related to inflammatory conditions as well as oxidative stress resulting from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to enhanced activity of enzymes generating ROS accompanied by decrease in the effectiveness of transcription activity of nuclear factor erythroid 2 and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, as well as level of glutathione and vitamins. Chronic administration of URB597 to SHRs caused a decrease in FAAH activity and an increase in anandamide and N-arachidonoyl-dopamine level as well as a decrease in CB2 and an increase in TRPV1 receptor expression. The levels/activities of pro- and antioxidant and inflammatory factors tended to normalize, but phospholipid peroxidation and DNA modifications were increased.In conclusion, long-term chronic administration of URB597 to SHRs by altering interactions between endocannabinoid and redox systems enhances some liver metabolic disturbances observed in hypertension.",

     "abstract": "Cystatin C plays an important role in the course of neurodegenerative diseases and has a beneficial effect through inhibiting cysteine proteases and amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation. It also induces proliferation and autophagy. Cystatin isolated from chicken egg white, called ovocystatin, has been widely used in the medical and pharmaceutical research due to its structural and biological similarities to human cystatin C. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of administering ovocystatin on the development of dementia-specific cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice.The study was conducted on transgenic B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax mice. Ovocystatin was administered to four-month-old transgenic (AD) and wild type (NCAR) mice in drinking water for 24 weeks (at a dose of 40 and 4\u2009\u03bcg/ mouse). The locomotor activity and cognitive functions were determined using an actimeter and the Morris water maze test, respectively.The results of the study indicate that ovocystatin has a beneficial effect on the cognitive functions in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The strongest effects of ovocystatin were found in the group of AD mice, where ovocystatin was administered in drinking water at a dose of 40\u2009\u03bcg/mouse (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Mice from the AD group swam statistically significantly further in the target zone during the trial in the Morris water maze compared to the AD (vehiculum) group (p\u2009<\u20090.05).The obtained results encourage further research into the protective effect, which may be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of deteriorating cognitive functions.",

Here, we tried to assess the affinity and binding specificity of SLE autoantibodies against the 16 \u03b1-OHE1-H1 adduct. IgG was induced against this adduct and was also used as immunochemical probe for the estimation of 16 \u03b1-OHE1 in the serum of SLE patients.The affinity and binding specificities of SLE autoantibodies against 16 \u03b1-OHE1-H1 were determined by direct binding and inhibition ELISA as well as quantitative precipitation titration in 60 patients and 30 control subjects.Purified SLE autoantibodies showed greater recognition to 16 \u03b1-OHE1-H1 over H1 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) or 16 \u03b1-OHE1 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The relative affinity of SLE autoantibodies for 16 \u03b1-OHE1-H1, H1 and 16 \u03b1-OHE1 was 1.41\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127, 1.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, and 1.03\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, respectively.

Molecular analysis included the following genes: TP53 (c.743\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A, c.746\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A, c.749C\u2009>\u2009T), MSH2 (c.942\u2009+\u20093A\u2009>\u2009T), MLH1 (c.2041\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A), NOD2/CARD15 (c.3016_3017insC, c.802C\u2009>\u2009T), IL1A (c.-949C\u2009>\u2009T) and IL1B (c.315C\u2009>\u2009T). DNA variants were detected using PCR-RFLP, pyrosequencing and sequencing.Mutations of the analyzed genes were observed more frequently in patients with a higher degree of mucosal lesions (50.9%) than in patients with milder mucosal changes (27.6%). Single mutations and polymorphisms did not affect the course of the disease. Our analysis confirms the influence of the NOD2/CARD15 c.802C\u2009>\u2009T polymorphism on the development of mucosal changes. A correlation of the frequency of the CT genotype of the NOD2/CARD15 c.802C\u2009>\u2009T polymorphism with the NOD2/CARD15 c.3016_3017insC mutation was observed. The TT genotype frequency in the c.315C\u2009>\u2009T IL1B gene polymorphism was statistically significantly higher in patients with mucosa changes.Accumulation of molecular abnormalities may increase the susceptibility to inflammatory response of the gastric mucosa in H. pylori-infected patients and play an important role in the development of chronic active gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and the intestinal type of gastric cancer. The severity of gastric mucosal damage correlates with the presence of mutations in the gastric mucosa and the age of patients.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum levels of PTX-3 and relative PTX-3 gene expression in COPD patients and their correlations with cigarette smoking history and lung function.A total number of 34 participants were enrolled into this study. Only stable patients without comorbidities were recruited. After obtaining written informed consent all planned procedures were performed (pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, blood samples for PTX-3 serum levels and PTX-3 gene expression measurements, demographical data, medical history, COPD patients were also asked for CAT and MMRC questionnaires).PTX-3 serum levels were significantly higher in the COPD group (29.22 (5.47) ng/ml vs. 14.64 (3.64) ng/ml). PTX-3 gene relative quantification (RQ) values were also significantly higher in the COPD group (0.15 (1.33) vs. -2.80 (1.99)). No differences in CRP serum levels were found between the control group and the COPD group.Our study demonstrates that serum levels of PTX-3 and the relative expression values of its gene are elevated in COPD, and can be related to cigarette smoking history.",

Patients after the implantation of a scleralfixated PC-IOL were evaluated for the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure and occurrence of postoperative complications.The analysis included 29 eyes from 28 patients. Indications for the IOL implantation included ocular trauma (89.7%) and previous complicated cataract surgery (10.3%). A postoperative improvement of BCVA was observed in 25 eyes (86.2%). Mean follow-up time was 63.9 months (range 50\u201383 months). During this time, six patients (21.4%) were diagnosed with glaucoma (21.4%), and retinal detachment was found in one eye (3.4%). A total of six suture breakages were recorded in four eyes from four patients (13.8%); one breakage was precipitated by a trauma, and another five, involving three eyes from three patients, were spontaneous. Mean time to the spontaneous suture breakage was 40.8 months.Scleral fixation of the PC-IOL provides satisfactory visual outcomes. However, this procedure is associated with a considerable risk of postoperative complications. The incidence of postoperative suture breakage in our series was similar as in previous studies in which the PC-IOL was fixated with 10-0 polypropylene suture.

Evaluation of anethole impact on collagen, GAGs and MMP-2 in human skin fibroblasts was the aim of this study.For collagen assay the Sircol dye, 5-[3H]proline and real time-PCR were used. MMP-2 activity was detected by zymography. GAG concentration was determined using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB). Cell viability was assayed with MTT.In cells treated with 1 and 10\u2009\u03bcM anethole, a significant increase in collagen synthesis was demonstrated. In contrast, collagen synthesis was significantly decreased in cells exposed to 100\u2009\u03bcM anethole. Similar alterations were found in collagen type I expression. The concentration of collagen secreted into the medium was higher only in cells exposed to 1\u2009\u03bcM anethole, while it was lower under the influence of higher compound concentrations. It may be due to the lack of pro-MMP-2 activation at 1\u2009\u03bcM and a significant increase in the level of MMP-2 at 10 and 100\u2009\u03bcM anethole. GAG concentration was reduced under the influence of 100\u2009\u03bcM anethole, whereas anethole at lower concentrations revealed the ability to prevent H2O2-induced GAG increase. No significant cytotoxicity of anethole to fibroblasts was noted.Our findings demonstrate the concentration-dependent action of anethole on the crucial components of ECM in cultured skin fibroblasts, which may be somewhat beneficial and may possibly be developed towards a therapeutic use in some skin disorders.",

The migratory ability of the endothelial cells was also improved in the presence of Pleiotrophin with reference to the SDF-1 treatment. Moreover, Western Blot analysis showed how the treatment with Pleiotrophin can induce an increase in the expression of RPTP \u03b2/\u03b6, PCNA and Rac1 compared to SDF-1.Due to the significant effects exerted on viability, migration and repair ability of endothelial cells compared to SDF-1, Pleiotrophin can be considered as an interesting molecule to promote re-endothelialisation.",

We therefore checked: the association of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism with ADS, and functional impact of the polymorphism on progredience of ADS in Belarusian population.The study involved 499 Belarusian males: 377 subjects with ADS (AG), and a control group (CG) with 122 subjects without alcohol-related problems. The ADS group was further divided into two groups of individuals with rapid (AG (R)) and delayed (AG (D)) progression of ADS. Clinical diagnosis was carried-out using ICD-10 criteria, Belarusian Addiction Severity Index, \u201cB-ASI\u201d and Alcohol-Use-Disorders-Identification-Test (AUDIT). PCR-RFLP analysis was performed.There were no significant differences in the distribution of frequencies of either the 5-HTTLPR genotype or the short and long allele among AG and CG. However, the ADS 5-HTTLPR genotype and allele distribution frequencies differ significantly by the variation in progression of ADS.There is no significant association between polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene and risk of ADS. However, the polymorphism significantly determines progredience of ASD in subjects with pathological patterns of alcohol consumption. Findings from this study carry preliminary significance as a facility to effective alcohol addiction treatment, rehabilitation and preventive services in the Eastern Europe.",

Children with pes planovalgus underwent surgical intervention and were re-examined. Overall, 316 gait cycles have been used in analysis.The obtained results consist of a set of rules for all considered cases and show that the proposed method may be a useful tool of gait analysis on the basis of parameters that have a physical interpretation.The presented method for mining rules useful in this respect may be successfully used by persons with a typically medical knowledge and could improve the understanding of the human gait phenomenon.

An age-matched control group contained 54 healthy peers. Urinary levels of procollagen III aminoterminal propeptide and \u03b2-catenin were measured using a commercially available immunoassay kit.Results: The urinary values of PIIINP (UPIIINP) were significantly increased in patients with SFK versus controls (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Our analysis revealed no significant differences in urinary \u03b2-catenin levels between the SFK patients and control subjects (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Only urinary PIIINP levels were correlated to renal function tests, such as serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (p<0.05).Conclusions: An increased urinary level of PIIINP may indicate early kidney impairment in children with SFK. Urinary \u03b2-catenin does not seem to play any important role as a marker of renal function in children with SFK. Further long-term studies are required in order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of these markers and their predictive value of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.",

ELISA was used for detecting microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) level. Real time PCR was used to determine (NBR1) gene expression. Cell cycle analysis and quantitative detection of acid vesicular organelles (AVOs) was performed by flow cytometry. TOR and CQ were used as autophagy modulators for induction and suppression of autophagy, respectively.The half-maximal inhibition effect of TOR combination with DOX was revealed to the induction of autophagic cell death and apoptotic cell death. On the other hand, combination of CQ with DOX increased the growth inhibitory effect, induced accumulation of AVOs and suppressed apoptotic cell death. However, combination of CNC with DOX inhibited autophagy and induced cell cycle arrest.Doxorubicin drug based combinations either with TOR, CQ or CNC could positively affect DOX effectiveness and reduce DOX doses applied on HCC1806 cells through modulation of autophagy.",

Late diagnosis and, in some cases, the high aggressiveness of the tumour result in low overall five-year survival rates of 12% among men and 7% among women. The cure is most likely in early-stage disease. The poor outcomes of treatment in lung cancer resulting from the fact that most cases are diagnosed in the advanced stage of the disease justify the implementation of an optimal lung cancer prevention in the form of smoking cessation and screening programmes that would offer a chance to detect early stages of the disease, while fitting within specific economic constraints. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) \u2013 the largest and most expensive randomised, clinical trial in the USA demonstrated a 20% mortality rate reduction in patients who had undergone chest low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, as compared to patients screened with a conventional chest X-ray. Results of the NLST enabled the implementation of lung cancer screening programme among highrisk patients in the USA and parts of China. In 2017, recommendations of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons also strongly recommend an implementation of a screening programme in the EU. Further studies of improved lung cancer risk assessment scores and of effective molecular markers should intensify in order to reduce all potential harms to the high-risk group and to increase cost-effectiveness of the screening.",

Principal effects of the activation of IL-9 receptor on T-cells seem to be antiapoptotic and stimulatory which leads to enhanced defense against parasitic infection and cancer development but, from the other side, it perpetuate chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases and allergic processes. In the last years the role of IL-9 in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease gained importance since the increased expression of this cytokine has been observed in animal models of intestinal inflammation and in groups of patients with ulcerative colitis.

In this paper, we review the evidence that platelets through releasing a large variety of chemokines could actively impact the pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis and development. A recent publication revealed that not only an excess of platelet derived cytokines, but also a deficiency may be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension development and progression. Hence, a simple platelet blockade may not be a correct action to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension.

     "abstract": "Pharmacologic preconditioning, through activating several mechanisms and mediators, can increase the tolerance of different tissues against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recent studies have shown that morphine preconditioning has protective effects in different organs, especially in the heart. Nevertheless, its mechanisms are not well elucidated in the brain. The present study aimed to clarify whether the activation of mitochondrial KATP (mKATP) channels in chronic morphine (CM) preconditioning could decrease hippocampus damage following I/R injury.CM preconditioning was performed by the administration of additive doses of morphine for 5\u00a0days before I/R injury induction. I/R injury was induced by the occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. The possible role of mKATP channels was evaluated by the injection of 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) before I/R injury. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was performed to detect apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. The expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase (CAT) enzymes were assessed.CM attenuated apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 neurons (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 vs I/R), and mKATP channel blocking with 5-HD significantly increased apoptosis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 vs CM\u00a0+\u00a0I/R). CM increased CAT activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs I/R) and Bcl-2 protein expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 vs I/R), while it decreased MDA level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs I/R) and BAX protein expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs I/R). Pretreatment with 5-HD abolished all the above-mentioned effects of CM.These findings describe novel evidence whereby CM preconditioning in hippocampal CA1 neurons can improve oxidative stress and apoptosis through the activation of mKATP channels and eventually protect the hippocampal tissue against I/R injury.",

     "abstract": "During incremental atrial pacing in patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, the PR interval often exceeds the RR interval (PR\u202f>\u202fRR) during stable 1:1 AV conduction. However, the PR/RR ratio has never been evaluated in a large group of patients with pacing from the proximal coronary sinus and after isoproterenol challenge. Our study validates new site of pacing and easier method of identification of PR\u202f>\u202fRR.A prospective protocol of incremental atrial pacing from the proximal coronary sinus was carried out in 398 patients (AVNRT-228 and control-170). The maximum stimulus to the Q wave interval (S-Q\u202f=\u202fPR), SS interval (S-S), and Q-Q (RR) interval were measured at baseline and 10\u202fmin after successful slow pathway ablation and after isoproterenol challenge (obligatory).The mean maximum PR/RR ratios at baseline were 1.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.24 and 0.82\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13 (p\u202f<\u202f0.00001) in the AVNRT and controls respectively. There were no PR/RR ratios \u22651 at baseline and after isoproterenol challenge in 12.3% of the AVNRT group and in 95.9% of the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). PR/RR ratios \u22651 were absent in 98% of AVNRT cases after slow pathway ablation/modification in children and 99% of such cases in adults (P\u202f=\u202fNS). The diagnostic performance of PR/RR ratio evaluation before and after isoproterenol challenge had the highest diagnostic performance for AVNRT with PR/RR\u202f>\u202f=\u202f1 (sensitivity: 88%, specificity: 96%, PPV-97%, NPV-85%).The PR/RR ratio is a simple tool for slow pathway substrate and AVNRT evaluation. Eliminating PR/RR ratios \u22651 may serve as a surrogate endpoint for slow pathway ablation in children and adults with AVNRT.",

Positive samples (using two-stage algorithm), had CDI, confirmed by qPCR and toxigenic culture. C. difficile isolates were characterized by PCR-ribotyping. Hospitals were questioned about their methods and testing policy for CDI during the study period: September 2011 to August 2013.During the study period, participating hospitals reported a mean of 33.2 tests for CDI per 10 000 patient-days and a mean of 8.4 cases of CDI per 10 000 patient-days. The overall prevalence of positive CDI patients at NCL was 16.5%. Due to absence of clinical suspicion, 19.1% of these patients were not diagnosed by the local diagnostic laboratory. We identified 23 different PCR-ribotypes among 87C. difficile strains isolated from patients. PCR-ribotype 027 (48%) was the most prevalent.The incidence of CDI in Poland in study period was very high. It should be noted however, that there is a lack of clinical suspicion and underestimation of the need to perform diagnostic tests for CDI in hospitalized patients. This will have an impact on the reported epidemiological status of CDI in Poland.",

Endoscopic specimens of esophageal mucosa were obtained from 72 patients who underwent esophagectomy for Barrett\u2019s esophagus, metaplasia, dysplasia, or esophageal adenocarcinoma developed from Barrett\u2019s esophagus.Multilayer squamous epithelium showed only MUC-1 positivity in the EAC group while MUC-2 and MUC-5AC staining could not be detected in this group. Strong and diffused membranous or cytoplasmic staining of CK7 was observed at squamous, ductal, surface columnar and/or glandular epithelium. c-p27 staining was diffused and moderate in the cellular membranes observed in all groups except for esophageal epithelial metaplasia without intestinal metaplasia. Additionally, weakly focal cytoplasmic staining in squamous epithelium of p27 in EAC was detected.Barrett's esophagus, which has a heterogeneous epithelium, might yield different diagnosis based on endoscopic evaluation and immunohistological investigation. Thus, the use of MUC1, p27, and CK7 might strengthen the truthful diagnosis. MUC-1, CK7, and c-p27 immunostaining can be used as the predictive markers for esophageal cancer progression from Barrett\u2019s esophagus.",

Patients with and without vitamin E deficiency did not differ significantly with respect to age, standardized body weight and height, FEV1, albumin concentration and vitamin E supplementation dose. However, vitamin E deficiency appeared more frequently in participants without vitamin E supplementation. Moreover, in multiple linear regression analysis pancreatic insufficiency, severe CFTR gene mutation and vitamin E dose, were potentially defined as determinants of vitamin E concentration.Vitamin E deficiency in cystic fibrosis patients is rather rare nowadays. Excessive vitamin E levels seem to be more frequent. Vitamin E status wasn\u2019t documented to be strictly related to clinical determinants. Beyond vitamin E supplementation, exocrine pancreatic function and CFTR gene mutations may have had an impact on the vitamin E body resources in cystic fibrosis patients.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents an own proposal for the construction of a ball latch intended for use in prosthetic dentistry. Attention was paid to the existing commercial constructions of elements of the same type, indicating their advantages and disadvantages. Based on the analysis of the present solutions, own ones were proposed.The following materials were chosen for the tests: pure titanium, 316\u2009L\u2009V steel, Ti15Mo2.8Nb obtained using powder metallurgy and through mechanical alloying, 10 and 20% of titanium carbide \u2013 obtained using powder metallurgy, as well as 10 and 20% of graphite \u2013 obtained using powder metallurgy. For the prepared materials, tribological tests were performed using a friction simulator in a ring/shield system.Fairly extensive tests were performed to verify the suitability of the selected material for use in the specific conditions of the oral cavity. The performed tests showed that the proposed material is not only beneficial in relation to the existing commercial dental alloys but also meets the general criteria set for this type of elements.A more beneficial use of two\u2013part ball latches (two key parts \u2013 patrix, matrix) was noticed in comparison to latches consisting of three parts (patrix, insert, matrix). On the basis of the obtained test results, it can be concluded that the proposed own design of a ball latch is a good alternative for traditional constructional and material solutions of commercial ball latches.",

Eicosanoids are responsible for the progressive destruction of cartilage and bone, however neither steroids, nor the non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cannot slow down cartilage and bone destruction providing only symptomatic improvement. The current rheumatoid arthritis treatment options include mainly the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, the corticosteroids, the NSAIDs and biological agents.PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase electronic database were used as the main sources for extracting several articles, reviews, original papers in English for further review and analysis on the implication of arachidonic acid metabolites with rheumatoid arthritis and different strategies of targeting arachidonic acid metabolites, different enzymes or receptors for improving the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients.We first focused on the role of individual prostaglandins and leukotrienes, in the inflammatory process of arthritis, concluding with an outline of the current clinical situation of rheumatoid arthritis and novel treatment strategies targeting the arachidonic acid pathway.Extended research is necessary for the development of these novel compounds targeting the eicosanoid pathway, by increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGD2,15dPGJ2), by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (PGE2, LTB4, PGI2) involved in rheumatoid arthritis or also by developing dual compounds displaying both the COX-2 inhibitor/TP antagonist activity within a single compound.",

Both diseases share associated risk factors \u2013 hypertension, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, obesity and smoking. Moreover, inflammation plays a causative role in both diseases. The prevalence of CAD in patients with AF is from 17% to 46.5% while the prevalence of AF among patients with CAD is low and it is estimated from 0.2% to 5%. AF is a well-established factor of poor short- and long-term prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is associated with a marked increase in overall mortality.The arrhythmia is common after cardiac surgeries and occurs in about 20 to 40% of patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is predicted that between 5 and 15% of AF patients will require stenting at some point in their lives and will receive triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor and oral anticoagulation (OAC). This requires careful consideration of antithrombotic therapy, balancing bleeding risk, stroke risk, and in-stent thrombosis with subsequent acute coronary syndromes. Co-prescription of OAC with antiplatelet therapy, in particular triple therapy, increases the absolute risk of major bleeding. In addition, major bleeding is associated with an up to 5-fold increased risk of death following an acute coronary syndrome. Coexistence of AF and CAD worsens the prognosis even in carefully treated patients.",

Four of them applied the neuroimaging technology to investigate the sizes/volumes of the limbic brain structures of burnout patients. Six other studies were to investigate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of burnout patients. Based on the results of the studies on the HPA-axis and neuroimaging of the limbic brain structures, one can see great impact of the chronic occupational stress on the limbic structures in terms of HPA dysregulation, a decrease of BDNF, impaired neurogenesis and limbic structures atrophy. It can be concluded that chronic stress inhibits the feedback control pathway in the HPA axis, causes the decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), then impaired neurogenesis and eventually neuron atrophy.",

This resistance development reduces therapeutic options for infections caused by multidrug-resistance organisms. Because of the changing epidemiology of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBLs) and resistance to aminoglycosides, we investigated the prevalence of the aac(3)-Ia, aac(6\u2032)-Ib, ant(4\u2032)-IIa, ant(2\u201d)-Ia, and aph(3\u201d)-Ib genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) in ESBL-producing Escherichia coli as well as ESBL-non-producing isolates. To understand bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, we estimated resistance phenotypes and the presence of genes responsible for this resistance.The study was conducted on 44 E.coli strains originated from patients hospitalized at University Hospital of Bialystok. MIC values were obtained for gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, and tobramycin. Isolates were tested for the presence of the aac(3)-Ia, aac(6\u2032)-Ib, ant(4\u2032)-IIa, ant(2\u201d)-Ia, and aph(3\u201d)-Ib genes with the use of the PCR technique.Resistance to aminoglycosides was found in 79.5% of the isolates. The highest percentages of resistance were observed for tobramycin (70,5%) and gentamicin (59%), followed by netilmicin (43.2%) and amikacin (11.4%). PCR assays revealed the presence of aac(6\u2032)-Ib among 26 (59.2%) strains, aph(3\u201d)-Ib among 16 (36.2%), aac(3)-Ia among 7 (15.9%), and ant(2\u201d)-Ia among 2 (4.6%) strains.The enzymatic resistance against aminoglycosides in northeastern Poland among clinical isolates of E. coli is predominantly caused by aac(6\u2032)-Ib and aph(3\u201d)-Ib.

Genotoxic properties were calculated on the basis of the fold increase (FI) of SFI values normalized with control. Antioxidant potencies were established on the base of DPPH assay. Antimicrobial activity of chemicals were established on the value of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC).Obtained results indicated that lower concentrations of tested compounds exhibited stronger GFP fluorescence response after rosmarinic acids and their salts treatment. Genotoxic effects seemed to be independent of the salt ions. The caffeic acid salts with Li, Na and K showed reduced genotoxic effect in comparison to the caffeic acid while increased cytotoxic effect than that of caffeic acid. Moreover, caffeinate salts exhibited better antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC\u00a0=\u00a0250\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) than K caffeinate salt (MIC\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL).

Used salts ions Li, Na and K do not significantly affect the antioxidant effect of natural phenolic compounds and they do not have a significant impact on the biological parameters such as cyto- and genotoxicity.

Methyl jasmonate (MJ), a bioactive compound isolated from Jasminum grandiflorum has been shown to demonstrate antidepressant activity but its mechanism of action remains unknown. Thus, the role of monoaminergic systems in the antidepression-like activity of MJ was investigated in this study.Mice were given i.p. injection of MJ (5, 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg), imipramine (10\u00a0mg/kg) and vehicle (10\u00a0mL/kg) 30\u00a0min before the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were carried out. The involvement of monoaminergic systems in the anti-depressant-like effect of MJ (20\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), metergoline, yohimbine, prazosin, sulpiride and haloperidol in the TST.MJ significantly decrease the duration of immobility in the FST and TST relative to control suggesting antidepressant-like property. However, pretreatment with yohimbine (1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor antagonist) or prazosin (62.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.p., an \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist) attenuated the antidepressant-like activity of MJ. Also, pCPA; an inhibitor of serotonin biosynthesis (100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p) or metergoline (4\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) reversed the anti-immobility effect of MJ. Sulpiride (50\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., a D2 receptor antagonist) or haloperidol (0.2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine receptor antagonist) reversed the anti-immobility effect of MJ.The results of this study suggest that serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems may play a role in the antidepressant-like activity of MJ.",

The present study evaluated the possible effect(s) of TMAO on the expression of GRP94 and HSP70 at protein levels.J774A.1 murine macrophages were treated with different micromolar concentrations of TMAO and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), a chemical chaperone, for 8, 18, 24, and 48\u00a0h intervals. Tunicamycin was also used as a control for induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression of GRP94 and HSP70 in macrophages at protein levels.Tunicamycin greatly increased protein levels of GRP94. Similarly, but to a lesser extent compared to tunicamycin, TMAO also increased GRP94. In 24\u00a0h treated cells, only 300\u00a0\u03bcM of TMAO, and in cells treated for 48\u00a0h, all doses of TMAO produced a significant increase in relative HSP70 protein levels compared to the control. PBA failed to induce any changes in GRP94 or HSP70 protein levels.GRP94 and HSP70 are stress-inducible heat shock protein, so the elevation in J774A.1 murine macrophages can clearly define cells under stress and elucidate the contribution of stress induced by TMAO that may have a part in the abnormal activation of macrophages involved in foam cell formation.",

Contractility of arteries as a response to endothelin-1 and phenylephrine was measured after exposure to laser stimulation (10, 30 and 110\u00a0mW).Laser irradiation inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction induced by endothelin-1 and an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine proportionally to the laser power.

We aimed to determine the effect of exercise on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1ra, IL-10) and innate immunity protein (HSPA1, sCD14) levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and nasal secretions of competitive athletes, non-exercising asthmatics and healthy controls (HC).The study group consisted of 15 competitive athletes (five speed skaters and ten swimmers) aged 15\u201325. The control groups comprised 10 mild-to-moderate asthmatics (AC) and seven HC. Athletes were assessed in- and off-training while asthmatics and controls at one time point. Nasal lavages and EBC were collected before and after a treadmill exercise challenge. Protein levels were assessed using ELISA.TNF-\u03b1 levels in EBC were significantly higher in athletes than HC, but similar to asthmatic patients. In contrast, IL-1ra EBC concentrations were significantly lower in athletes than in HC, but again similar to asthmatics. Significant positive correlations were seen between baseline concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in EBC and fall in FEV1 following exercise challenge in athletes during training period (R\u00a0=\u00a00.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and in asthmatics (R\u00a0=\u00a00.64, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In nasal secretions, baseline IL-1ra levels were significantly higher in athletes and asthmatics than in HC. Exercise caused a slight, yet significant, increase in EBC HSPA1 in athletes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The exercise challenge did not considerably influence TNF-\u03b1, IL-1ra, HSPA1 and sCD14 in EBC or nasal secretions.Dysregulation of the TNF-\u03b1/IL-1ra balance in EBC and nasal secretions from athletes may reflect the presence of airway inflammation induced by repeated strenuous exercise.",

This study evaluates Iranian Noonan patients both clinically and genetically for the first time.Mutational analysis of PTPN11 gene was performed in 15 Iranian patients, using PCR and Sanger sequencing at phase one. Then, as phase two, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the form of targeted resequencing was utilized for analysis of exons from other related genes. Homology modelling for the novel founded mutations was performed as well. The genotype, phenotype correlation was done according to the molecular findings and clinical features.Previously reported mutation (p.N308D) in some patients and a novel mutation (p.D155N) in one of the patients were identified in phase one. After applying NGS methods, known and new variants were found in four patients in other genes, including: CBL (p. V904I), KRAS (p. L53W), SOS1 (p. I1302V), and SOS1 (p. R552G). Structural studies of two deduced novel mutations in related genes revealed deficiencies in the mutated proteins. Following genotype, phenotype correlation, a new pattern of the presence of intellectual disability in two patients was registered.NS shows strong variable expressivity along the high genetic heterogeneity especially in distinct populations and ethnic groups. Also possibly unknown other causative genes may be exist. Obviously, more comprehensive and new technologies like NGS methods are the best choice for detection of molecular defects in patients for genotype, phenotype correlation and disease management.",

Our observations have proven that the dysfunction of the growth plate is less frequent complication in those cases than misdiagnosed interposition of the periosteum. The aim of this paper is to familiarize the readers with the issue of treatment of physeal fractures of the distal tibia and fibula in the growing skeleton.We analyzed the group of 75 patients \u2013 children and adolescents \u2013 with surgically treated physeal fractures of the lower leg. The analysis included age, sex, circumstances of trauma infliction, type of sustained damage, employed therapeutic technique, timing of surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization, complications, duration of follow-up, radiological and functional results according to the AOFAS scale.The group consisted of 23 girls and 52 boys. The mean age was 13.6 years. The most frequent cause of trauma was same-level fall, usually during sports activities (35 cases). The most common type of damage was Salter-Harris type II fracture (35 cases). Among the employed surgical techniques, open reduction and stabilization with K-wires was the most often used (52 cases). A group of four patients attracted our attention, in whom after a closed reduction, signs of periosteum interposition were noted. These patients required a second procedure. In one patient, the growth plate arrest occurred; it was directly caused by local osteomyelitis.With adequately conducted treatment of distal tibia and distal fibula physeal fractures, the results are good. Misdiagnosed periosteum interposition poses a more serious clinical problem as opposed to the commonly anxiety-provoking post-traumatic growth plate dysfunction.",

The major objective of the research was to analyze the ultrastructural profile of activated HSCs in children with chronic hepatitis B (chB), with respect to fibrosis intensity.Ultrastructural investigations of HSCs were conducted on liver bioptates from 70 children with clinicopathologically diagnosed chB before antiviral treatment. Biopsy material, fixed in paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde solution, was routinely processed for electron-microscopic analysis.In children with intensive liver fibrosis (S-2 and S-3), the ultrastructural picture showed almost total replacement of quiescent HSCs (Q-HSCs) by activated, i.e. transitional HSCs (T-HSCs). Among T-HSCs, two types of cells were distinguished: cells exhibiting initiation of HSC activation (Ti-HSCs), never before described in chB, that were frequently accompanied by activated Kupffer cells, and cells with features of perpetuation of activation (Tp-HSCs). Tp-HSCs were elongated and characterized by substantial loss of cytoplasmic lipid material; they contained an increased number of cytoskeletal components, extremely dilated channels of granular endoplasmic reticulum and activated Golgi apparatus, which indicated their marked involvement in intensive synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. Many collagen fibers were found to adhere directly to Tp-HSCs.The current study showed T-HSCs to be an important link between Q-HSCs and myofibroblastic HSCs (Mf-HSCs). Transformation of HSCs into new morphological variations (Ti-HSCs; Tp-HSCs and Mf-HSCs), observed along with growing fibrosis, indicates their high plasticity and a key role in fibrogenesis in pediatric chB.",

Opportunistic infections which cause a lot of ulcer complications influence the worsening general condition of patients with AIDS, ultimately leading to death. The chronicity of the condition and poor results of conventional therapy have prompted the search for new methods of treatment.We have examined venous or arteriovenous insufficiency-related extensive crural ulcers in AIDS patients. Crural ulcer healing processes were evaluated with clinical observations and histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular examinations of tissue samples harvested from the wound edges before and on day 10 after L-PRP cover dressing.Clinical observations showed positive effects of L-PRP in all patients. However, complete wound closure was noted in 60% of cases. Statistical analysis of histological examination showed increased epidermal processes between samples, but the difference was nonsignificant. However, immunohistochemical investigations showed an increased healing process with strong statistical significance. The mean VEGF level before L-PRP usage was 114.3 vessels/mm2 and on day 10 118.9 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001523). The mean FLK level was 103.2 and 109.9 respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008241).

The review was conducted in line with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and the PRISMA statement.In only few studies, patients were qualified for hysteroscopic surgery based on the measurement of the defect depth and thickness of residual myometrium above the pouch.Two principal techniques were used for the hysteroscopic treatment: resection of one edge of the scar diverticulum, and resection of the inferior and superior edges of the defect. Additionally, most authors performed electrocauterization of the niche bottom.Resectoscopic treatment turned out to be highly effective in the case of women with AUB. No complications of the hysteroscopic procedure have been reported.Methodological value of the reviewed studies was relatively low due to non-unified selection/verification criteria and incomplete, non-systematic postoperative assessment.In conclusion, hysteroscopic treatment seems to be a promising option in the management of postcesarean scar defects, but still further research is needed on the problem in question.",

During that time several studies showed that IPC provided by brief ischaemic and reperfusion episodes prior to longer ischaemia can bestow a protective effect to both preconditioned and also remote organs. IPC affecting remote organs is called remote ischaemic preconditioning. Initially, most IPC studies were focused on enhancing myocardial resistance to subsequent ischaemia and reperfusion injury. However, preconditioning was found to be a universal phenomenon and was observed in various organs and tissues including the heart, liver, brain, retina, kidney, skeletal muscles and intestine. Currently, there are a lot of simultaneous studies are underway aiming at finding out whether IPC can be helpful in protecting these organs.The mechanism of local and remote IPC is complex and not well known. Several triggers, intracellular pathways and effectors, humoral, neural and induced by genetic changes may be considered potential pathways in the protective activity of local and remote IPC.Local and remote IPC mechanism may potentially serve as heart protection during cardiac surgery and may limit the infarct size of the myocardium, can be a strategy for preventing the development of acute kidney injury development and liver damage during transplantation, may protect the brain against ischaemic injury. In addition, the method is safe, non-invasive, cheap and easily applicable.The main purpose of this review article is to present new advances which would help to understand the potential mechanism of IPC.

     "abstract": "Infections are common among patients with liver cirrhosis. They occur more often in cirrhotic patient groups than in the general population and result in higher mortality. One reason for this phenomenon is bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen that occurs as a consequence of intestinal bacterial overgrowth, increased permeability and decreased motility. The most common infections in cirrhotic patients are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and urinary tract infections, followed by pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections. Intestinal bacterial overgrowth is also responsible for hyperammonemia, which leads to hepatic encephalopathy. All of these complications make this group of patients at high risk for mortality. The role of antibiotics in liver cirrhosis is to treat and in some cases to prevent the development of infectious complications. Based on our current knowledge, antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered to patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, low ascitic fluid protein concentration combined with liver or renal failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as a secondary prophylaxis, as well as after hepatic encephalopathy episodes (also as a secondary prophylaxis). In some cases, the use of non-antibiotic prophylaxis can also be considered. Current knowledge of the treatment of infections allows the choice of a preferred antibiotic for empiric therapy depending on the infection location and whether the source of the disease is nosocomial or community-acquired.",

Thus, the examination of the pathomechanisms responsible for TP post TAVI seems to be crucial.Several hypotheses have been raised. TP can be caused by insufficient production or impaired platelet renewal. On the other hand, increased platelet activation, consumption and destruction might also be responsible for TP.

Thus, the present study assessed the treatment effects of tangeretin using a rat model of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy.Separate groups of male Wistar rats received oral administrations of tangeretin at 50, 100, or 200\u00a0mg/kg for 10 days and then, on the 10th day, they received an intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine (30\u00a0mg/kg). Subsequently, neuronal degeneration and apoptosis were assessed using Nissl staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay procedures. Additionally, the expressions of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway proteins, cleaved caspase-3, Bad, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax were determined using Western blot analyses.Tangeretin reduced the seizure scores and latency to first seizure of the rats and effectively activated the pilocarpine-induced suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling. Additionally, tangeretin effectively regulated the levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in mitochondria as well as the expressions of apoptotic pathway proteins. Seizure-induced elevations in the activities and expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2 and -9 were also modulated.The present results indicate that tangeretin exerted potent neuroprotective effects against pilocarpine-induced seizures via the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling and the regulation of MMPs.",

The differentiation potential of these cells is generally impaired when culturing in vitro for cell expansion. The aim of this study is to speedily increase the numbers of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) with substantially maintaining their differentiation potential in vitro and improving bone formation in vivo.BM-MSCs isolated from rats were sequentially cultured in \u03b1-MEM containing basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and/or insulin to stimulate proliferation and osteogenic commitment, and in the medium with the addition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and/or bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) to arouse differentiation. The expression of genes markedly associating the commitment and differentiation were investigated in vitro using real-time PCR technique and mineralization assay, while the capacity of inducing bone formation by the established conditions was determined in vivo using a rat model.The BM-MSCs greatly proliferated with active transcription of runx2 and osterix genes when induced by FGF2 and insulin. The in vitro mineralization was enhanced by BMP2, but the extent was diminished when BMP2 was replaced or supplemented by BMP7. Formation of new small blood vessels was notably detected when the cells were respectively challenged by FGF2 plus insulin and BMP2.These data are valuable in choosing growth factors for proper bone repair. However, optimization of the established system would be essential when the cells of human source are applied.",

To investigate the functional changes on PM2.5 exposed cells, we carried out the viability assay for the cell counting, and the Boyden chamber assay for invasion.We found 143 genes that were expressed at least twice as much, or no more than half as much, in NSCLC cells exposed to PM2.5 than in unexposed cells. Results showed deregulated genes confronted PM2.5 exposure were significantly expressed, but commonly expressed in NSCLC cells. In addition, according to the viability assay and the Boyden chamber assay, PM2.5 exposed cells which have more competent on proliferation and invasion can keep the line with the results in RNA-Seq.Our data may provide a more specific understanding of the signaling patterns associated with pathogenesis, and lead to novel markers and therapeutic targets for NSCLC.",

The bioactive compounds (quercetin, ellagic acid and gallic acid) are well known to be not only antioxidants but also chemopreventive candidates against various types of cancers. To circumvent the low bioavailability and the short half-life time obstacles, we hypothesized a novel PLGA nano-platform functionalized with CS and PEG to encapsulate these phytochemicals. This encapsulation will protect the compounds from the phagocytic uptake and deliver PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototype with high biodegradability and biosafety.Three consequent types of PLGA-based nanocomposites were prepared and characterized. Furthermore, we investigated the newly synthesized nano-formulations against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal cancer (HCT 116) cell lines using cell growth inhibition assays, followed by apoptosis and necrosis assays using flow cytometry to detect the underlying mechanism of HepG2 cell death.Through Malvern Zeta Sizer, we recorded that the average diameters of the nano-prototypes ranged from 150 to 300\u00a0nm.

     "abstract": "Personalized and precision medicine is gaining recognition due to the limitations by standard diagnosis and treatment; many areas of medicine, from cancer to psychiatry, are moving towards tailored and individualized treatment for patients based on their clinical characteristics and genetic signatures as well as novel imaging techniques. Advances in whole genome sequencing have led to identification of genes involved in a variety of diseases. Moreover, biomarkers indicating severity of disease or susceptibility to treatment are increasingly being characterized. The continued identification of new genes and biomarkers specific to disease subtypes and individual patients is essential and inevitable for translation into personalized medicine, in estimating both, disease risk and response to therapy. Taking into consideration the mostly unsolved necessity of tailored therapy in oncology the innovative project MOBIT (molecular biomarkers for individualized therapy) was designed. The aims of the project are: (i) establishing integrative management of precise tumor diagnosis and therapy including systematic biobanking, novel imaging techniques, and advanced molecular analysis by collecting comprehensive tumor tissues, liquid biopsies (whole blood, serum, plasma), and urine specimens (supernatant; sediment) as well as (ii) developing personalized lung cancer diagnostics based on tumor heterogeneity and integrated genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and radiomics PET/MRI analysis. It will consist of 5 work packages. In this paper the rationale of the Polish MOBIT project as well as its design is presented. (iii) The project is to draw interest in and to invite national and international, private and public, preclinical and clinical initiatives to establish individualized and precise procedures for integrating novel targeted therapies and advanced imaging techniques.",

     "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that includes two major phenotypes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that are characterized by different clinical features and different course of the immune response. The exact aetiology of IBD still remains unknown, although it is thought that the diseases result from an excessive immune response directed against microbial or environmentally derived antigens which can be triggered by the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. In this review we present immune mechanisms and interactions between cells of the immune system and tissue environment that contribute to the development and progression of IBD in humans. Since dysregulation of the intestinal immune response is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory conditions, we characterize cells of the innate and adaptive immunity involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and their cross-talks. We describe various subclasses of recently discovered innate lymphoid cells, as well as dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells, including Th17, Th22 and T regulatory cells, present in the intestinal lamina propria and cytokine-mediated regulation of the immune response in IBD, highlighting the role of IL-22 and IL-17A/IL-23 axis. Insights into novel therapeutic modalities targeting certain elements of the immune pathways important for the pathogenesis of IBD have been also shortly presented.",

     "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), characterized by abdominal pain and a change in stool form that cannot be explained by structural abnormalities. Its prevalence ranges from 9 to 23% of the worldwide population. The pathophysiology of IBS is diverse and not well understood. Biopsychosocial concept assumes that the disease is a product of psychosocial factors and altered at multiple levels of gut physiology interactions. Some aetiological factors have been identified, yet. One of the most important is the disruption of brain-gut mutual communication that leads to visceral hypersensitivity. Also genetic and epigenetic factors are involved. Chronic stress may predispose to IBS as well as exacerbate its symptoms. Both quantitative and qualitative disorders of the gut microbiota are observed. There is also a relationship between the IBS symptoms and the intake of a specific type of food products. In the diarrhoea type of IBS the role of previous gastrointestinal infection is demonstrated. Recent studies have suggested that visceral hypersensitivity in patients with IBS may be secondary to the activation of the immune cells and low-grade inflammation. Clinical symptoms of IBS include abdominal pain and change in bowel habits as well as somatic and psychiatric comorbidities. IBS is diagnosed on the basis of Rome Diagnostic Criteria. Recently, their newest version (Rome IV) has been presented. The aim of this review is to summarize the past decade progress in IBS diagnosis, main pathophysiological aspects and therapeutic management strategy.",

     "abstract": "Amyloidosis is the general term describing the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of proteins. There are multiple different human protein precursors of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid deposits are stained using Congo Red and show typical apple-green birefringence in polarized microscopy. Nowadays, a novel technique LMD/MS technique or laser microdissection combined with mass spectrometry help to diagnose amyloidosis. Amyloidosis of the kidney is typically classified as being either one of two types: AL or AA. Less common is the hereditary amyloidosis. Clinical manifestations are usually determined by the type of precursor protein, the tissue distribution, and the amount of amyloid deposition. Renal manifestation is usually present as asymptomatic proteinuria or clinically apparent nephrotic syndrome. In some patients clinical presentation include impaired kidney function with no or mild proteinuria. Patients with renal amyloidosis who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be treated with either dialysis or renal transplantation. Diagnosis of amyloidosis is prerequisite to consider treatment options to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy. Treatment of amyloidosis is aimed at decreasing the precursors of fibrillary proteins and/or decrease in synthesis/deposition of amyloid fibrils. It depends upon the type of amyloidosis and cause of excess fibril production.",

Accumulating evidence over the past decade has challenged the hypothesis of close interaction between bone and VC what raises the possibility of a common underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Lately, bone regulatory proteins such as: osteoprotegerin (OPG) and Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor \u03baB Ligand (RANKL) has attracted attention of researchers as a possible key mediators of bone-vascular calcification imbalance. The literature search was carried out using the MEDLINE/PubMed database and a combination of keywords and MeSH terms, and only papers published since January 2005 to July 2016 were selected. The search resulted in 562 potential articles. After selection according to the eligibility criteria, 107 studies fulfilled were included (102 full texts and 5 was case reports). OPG and RANKL plays essential role in the regulation of bone metabolism and may be regarded as a possible link between VC, bone and mineral metabolism in CKD patients. Further studies are required to determine the diagnostic significance of these proteins in evaluation of progression and severity of VC process in CKD patients. Finally, the efficacy and safety, especially in regard to VC, of anti-RANKL therapy in CKD patients requires well-designed prospective, randomized trials.",

The aim of the study was to assess correlations between the parameters obtained in non-invasive testing and RHC in patients with PH of different etiologies.The study included 53 medical records of PH patients (32 women) aged 29\u201381 years. We analyzed correlations between RHC (systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), cardiac output (CO)) and echocardiographic (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), sPAP) and CPET parameters (end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures (PetO2, PetCO2), ventilation efficiency (VE/VCO2) slope).Echocardiographic estimation correlated well with RHC measurement of sPAP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.65, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The latter seems to be of vital importance, since previous works have shown its positive influence on lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis in the case of its counterpart \u2013 type 2 diabetes.The animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: C \u2013 control, M \u2013 myriocin (ceramide de novo synthesis inhibitor), D \u2013 diabetes (induced by streptozotocin injections); D\u00a0+\u00a0M \u2013 diabetes\u00a0+\u00a0myriocin. We have evaluated intracellular concentration of key sphingolipid species, via chromatography (GC and HPLC), and the activity of their most important enzymes, using radiometric approach. The aforementioned assessments were evaluated in respect to the three different types of muscle tissue representing different spectra of muscle metabolism (soleus \u2013 oxidative, red gastrocnemious \u2013 oxidative-glycolytic, white gastrocnemious \u2013 glycolytic).Interestingly, our therapeutic intervention not only lowered the level of ceramide, its precursors (sphinganine) and derivatives (sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate), but also reduced other lipid species (triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and free fatty acids) content, thus improving glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetic animals.In the light of the results ensuing from this study, it seems conceivable that the reduction of intramuscular ceramide production and accumulation could bestow an insulin-sensitizing effect. If so, then SPT inhibition could find potential future applications as a therapeutic intervention aimed to mitigate the effects of insulin resistance.",

Our results also indicated that three genes (CASP2, IGF1R,TNF) were up-regulated. The CFLAR gene was down-regulated in AGS, while it was inversely up-regulated in 5637 and U87MG cells.It may possibly be concluded that suppression of OCT4B1 can lead to apoptosis in tumor cell lines and this is at least facilitated via down-regulation of examined anti-apoptotic genes.

Several studies have shown that early detection and treatment of subclinical rejection episodes may be beneficial for the graft outcome. The role of protocol (surveillance) biopsies and the value of donor specific antibodies (DSA) monitoring are still debatable.This is a prospective observational study involving seventeen kidney recipients transplanted in north-eastern part of Poland who underwent \u201czero\u201d, 3-month and 12-month allograft biopsies as well as DSA assessment.Histologic analysis of the biopsies showed subclinical acute cellular rejection in 17.6% of patients (two tubulointerstitial, one vascular) at 3-months post transplantation, and additional case of borderline rejection at the 12-month point. Moreover, two cases (11.8%) of polyomavirus BK nephropathy were diagnosed (one at 3 and one at 12 month point). None of the patients developed de novo DSA.Our protocol biopsies allowed us to detect significant proportion of patients with subclinical, but histologically relevant acute cellular rejection and BK nephropathy. Early therapeutic intervention had beneficial effects in a 4-year follow up.",

Genes were divided into 5 subgroups according to their angiogenic potential: growth factors and their receptors; cytokines/chemokines; adhesion molecules and other matrix related proteins; transcriptions factors and signaling molecules; morphogenic factors, and angiogenesis inhibitors.Twenty-nine patients were involved in the study: 20 with serous ovarian cancer and 9 healthy controls. All neoplasms were confirmed by histopathological examination. Healthy ovarian control samples were obtained from women diagnosed with fibroids and had previously scheduled operations. Real-time PCR gene arrays were used to examine the expression of 84 human angiogenesis-related genes and expression of selected proteins was assessed with ELISA.Significantly higher expressions of 46 genes were found in the ovarian cancer group compared to the healthy control group. By the use of ELISA we confirmed the expression of three proteins i.e.: angiopoietin-2, angiopoietin-like protein 3, and angiopoietin receptor 2. Only angiopoietin-2 and angiopoietin receptor 2 showed significant differences between ovarian cancer and healthy controls.Changes in the expression of selected genes associated with angiogenesis may add new information to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Although the angiopoietin-2 signaling pathway may play an important role in neovascularization in ovarian cancer, the role of angiopoietin-like protein 3 is yet to be established.",

We administered the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT) to each child at yearly intervals for 2\u20134 years.

We calculated K-BIT change rates, and used rate of change in K-BIT to classify children into two groups: a decline group and a non-decline group. We then generated predictive models to predict K-BIT decline/non-decline based on regional gray-matter (GM) volumes computed from structural MR images.We identified six structures (the left median cingulate gyrus, the right middle occipital gyrus, the left inferior occipital gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right inferior temporal gyrus) that, when assessed for volume at baseline, are jointly predictive of whether a child would suffer subsequent K-BIT decline. Based on these six regional GM volumes and the baseline K-BIT, we built a prognostic model using the K* algorithm. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 0.84, 0.78 and 0.86, respectively.GM volumetric analysis predicts subsequent IQ decline for children with SCD.",

Moreover, MSCs, pulsed with nicotine at low to moderate concentrations, preserved the respiratory burst, triggered by opsonized yeast in neutrophils.

Insufflation of CO2 in the peritoneal cavity was used for the increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). A special catheter placed and fixed in the renal cortex at a depth of 3\u00a0mm from the renal capsule was used for the measurement of renal tissue oxygenation.Study parameters were recorded at the starting phase, at IAP of 15\u00a0mmHg and 30\u00a0mmHg and after decompression of the abdomen in the control group, and at the same intervals plus the induction of sepsis, prior to increasing abdominal pressure, in the study group. With the elevation of the IAP a reduction of renal tissue oxygenation presents itself, which is more pronounced in the presence of sepsis, especially for IAP over 15\u00a0mmHg. Like other parameters, after abdominal decompression the renal tissue oxygenation returns to the initial levels, independently of sepsis.The afferent arterioles vasoconstriction, which takes place during sepsis, and the intra-renal shunt, which occurs and leads to blood diversion to the medulla from the renal cortex due to the combination of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and sepsis, seem to explain this finding.",

This study was conducted to assess the genetic association between Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms and COPD in the Egyptian patients, and to analyze their impact on the clinical outcome and therapeutic response.The study population included 115 participants (61 COPD patients and 54 healthy controls) were genotyped for the Arg16Gly (rs1042713) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714) polymorphisms. Pulmonary function test was done and repeated in patients after salbutamol inhalation.The Gly16 and Gln27 alleles represented 57% and 70% of the whole study population, and only 3 haplotypes were detected; Arg16/Gln27, Gly16/Gln27, and Gly16/Glu27. Genotypes and haplotypes homozygous for Arg16 and Gln27 were more likely to develop COPD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, individuals carrying Glu27 allele conferred protection against COPD development (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

For each embryo, absolute (t2, t3, t4, t5) and relative (cc2 and s2) morphokinetic parameters were collected. Additionally, fragmentation levels assessed at t2, t3, t4 and t5 time-points, presence of multinucleation, evenness of blastomeres after the first and second division and women's age were included in the analysis.The created predictive model of implantation was constructed on the basis of two advanced data-mining methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve constructed for the created model demonstrated its good quality. The area under the ROC curve was AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.75 with a 95% confidence interval (0.70, 0.80).

APCA are present in 7.8\u201319.5% of the general healthy adult population. A fraction of these sero-positive people, will never develop AAG or PA. An interesting and not fully explained question is whether APCA presence is related to Helicobacter pylori infection. APCA are found in up to 20.7% of these patients.

There are three types of B. miyamotoi: Asian (Siberian), European, and American. B. miyamotoi is transmitted by the same Ixodes ricinus-persulcatus species complex, which also transmits B. burgdorferi s.l., the Lyme borreliosis group. Both Borrelia groups are mostly maintained in natural rodent populations. The aim of this review is to summarize the available literature on B. miyamotoi, with the focus of attention falling on Europe, as well as to describe its presence in ticks, reservoir hosts, and humans and discuss its potential impact on public health.",

     "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is one of the most potent risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. The high atherosclerotic risk in dyslipidemic patients is associated with endothelial dysfunction. During the last two decades, novel bioactive peptides have emerged as potential biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidemia-salusins and adropin. Salusin-alpha is likely to prevent atherosclerosis, while salusin-beta may act as a potential proatherogenic factor. Adropin was recently identified as important for energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Adropin is closely related to the inhibition of atherosclerosis by up-regulation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression through the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. These peptides represent a novel target to limit diseases characterized by endothelial dysfunction and may form the basis for the development of new therapeutic agents for treating metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis.",

     "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the most frequent causes of non-ischemic heart failure. Many factors including genetic disorders, infectious agents, toxins, drugs and autoimmune disorders might take part in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis of left ventricular dilatation is most often limited to performing echocardiography and excluding ischemic etiology (coronary angiography). Since many pathologies take place at the cellular and subcellular level the only way to clarify the etiology of the disease is to examine the myocardium itself (endomyocardial biopsy).A systematic literature search was conducted for studies published between September 2000 and September 2015 using the PubMed database.Of 7104 studies identified, 73 studies were included in this review. Controversies raised by opponents of the endomyocardial biopsy collide with the low percentage of serious complications confirmed in several single-center registries. Based on the available data the overall complication rate varies from 1% to about 3%, with 0.5% risk of serious complications. According to the current recommendations of the European and American scientific societies endomyocardial biopsy should be performed in most cases of left ventricular dilatation and heart failure of non-ischemic etiology. Endomyocardial biopsy allows for making the diagnosis and providing prognostic information especially in patients with familial dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy with dilated phenotype, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, iron overload cardiomyopathy, as well as inflammatory and viral cardiomyopathy. Iron overload cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, inflammatory and viral cardiomyopathy are potentially treatable and reversible.Targeted therapies are more effective when started early before myocardial injury becomes irreversible. Unfortunately, non-invasive techniques are not precise enough to decide if and which targeted therapy is required. Therefore endomyocardial biopsy should be mainly recognized as the essential diagnostic tool and should not be postponed.",

For galactose specificity Datura stramonium lectin (DSA), for sialic acid Sambucus nigra (SNA) and Maackia amurensis (MAA) and for fucose residue Areulia auranta (AAA) lectins were used.In RA-cases N-glycan galactosylation and sialylation of IgG before treatment were significantly lower than in healthy subjects (for DSA, MAA lectins p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and SNA p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Significant increase of IgG galactosylation and sialylation in RA patients after therapy (for DSA, MAA and SNA lectin p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was detected.

Memory disturbances may be related to the levels of thyroid hormones (TH) that are under the influence of different mechanisms and molecules, including deiodinase type 1(D1) \u2013 an important determinant of circulating triiodothyronine (T3). We investigated the relationship between two functionally known polymorphisms within the DIO1 gene, i.e. DIO1a-C/T and DIO1b-A/G, and cognitive functioning in patients diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder (rDD). In the planned analysis we mainly concentrated on the frontal function: working memory, executive functions and verbal fluency.Genetic variants were genotyped in 128 patients using a method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cognitive functions were assessed by the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test and the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT).No significant associations were found between DIO1 polymorphisms and cognitive functioning in rDD. Only the CT and TT genotypes of the DIO1a variant were significantly related to verbal fluency. There were no significant differences between the distribution of the genotypes and demographic/medical variables.Based on the study, the examined polymorphisms are not an important risk or protective factor for cognitive impairment in depressive patients. Functional variants within the DIO1 gene that affect triiodothyronine (T3) levels seem not to be associated with cognitive functions. Nevertheless, considering the fact that the DIO1 gene is related to the course and management of depression, further studies on a larger sample size might be suggested.",

Recently, circumferential strain (CS) of carotid arteries was postulated as novel indicator of vascular function. Our aim was to characterize and compare CS of carotid arteries in patients with advanced coronary artery disease and controls without significant coronary stenoses.We compared CS of both common carotid arteries (CCA) in the 25 patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD) (mean age 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years, 9 male) and in 16 age-matched subjects without significant coronary lesions (C) (69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years, 7 male). Additionally in 11 patients we estimated pulse wave velocity (PWV) and assessed the correlation between PWV and CS. Short-axis images of arteries were acquired for strain analysis with linear probe of echocardiograph. The assessment of CS was performed off-line by two observers.The intraobserver variability for the CS (coefficient of variation) were 4.9 and 5.4% for left and right CCA and interobserver variability were 11.7% and 12.5%, respectively. The mean CS for left and right CCA did not differ between compared groups. We did not find correlation between CS strain and PWV. The only difference was related to the more prevalent plaque presence and thicker intima-media complex (IMT) in 3VD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0039 for IMT of left CCA and p\u00a0=\u00a00.016 for IMT of right CCA).The global CS of CCA, contrary to IMT, did not allow for differentiation between 3VD and C subjects. Despite good feasibility and concordance of CS measurements its clinical significance remains to be established.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the caspase-3 and survivin expression in correlation with MIB-1 expression in gliomas of various grade to assess the apoptosis in gliomas and to determinate new possible targets for the future therapy.We identified 131 patients with a histopathological diagnosis of astrocytic tumors (diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma). The evaluation of caspase-3, survivin and MIB-1 expression was done using immunohistochemical methods.Caspase-3 and survivin expression was observed both in low- and high-grade astrocytomas. The differences in expression were the most evident in glioblastoma group. All primary glioblastomas (31 cases) expressed caspase-3. In secondary glioblastoma group only 17 out of 30 specimens were positive for caspase-3. Survivin expression was observed in 80.6% primary glioblastomas and in all examined secondary glioblastomas and the staining was strong and diffuse in all cases. MIB-1 expression was low in diffuse astrocytomas (DA) and ranged between 1 and 5%. In anaplastic astrocytoma group it was ranged between 5 and 10% and the highest percentage of the positive cells was observed in glioblastoma cases and ranged from 10% even to 30%. The most evident MIB-1 expression was observed in the cells surrounding the pathological blood vessels and necrosis.The high incidence of survivin and caspase-3 expression in diffuse and anaplastic astrocytoma cases may suggest, that the regulation between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins may play an important role in tumor growth and progression. The overexpression of survivin and MIB-1 expression in glioblastoma cases also may confirm the theory about the important role of anti-apoptotic and proliferation processes in glioblastoma progression and as such may be potential therapeutic targets.",

In CKD patients, cardiovascular dysfunction was assessed with aortic pulse wave velocity (AoPWV), carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) serum concentrations. Cardiovascular and overall mortality data were collected during a 7-years follow-up.OPG plasma concentrations were higher in CKD patients comparing to controls. Total soluble RANKL was lower and OPG/RANKL ratio higher in patients. Soluble TRAIL concentrations did not differ between the groups and OPG/TRAIL ratio was higher in CKD patients. OPG and OPG/TRAIL positively predicted long-term mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular) in CKD patients. OPG positively correlated with AoPWV, CCA-IMT and NT-proBNP whereas OPG/TRAIL with AoPWV and NT-proBNP. Described relationships were independent of classical and non-classical cardiovascular risk factors, with exception of age.Our study confirmed the role of OPG as a biomarker of cardiovascular dysfunction and a predictor of mortality in stage 5 CKD. OPG/TRAIL ratio can be proposed as a predictor of cardiovascular dysfunction and mortality.",

The patients were divided into two groups \u2013 those with significant ISR (n\u00a0=\u00a053) and those without ISR (n\u00a0=\u00a0212). The ACE polymorphism was assessed using the classical PCR method and the AGT polymorphism was determined using the TaqMan method for SNP genotyping.No difference in the frequency of angiographically significant ISR occurrence associated with the different ACE and AGT gene polymorphisms was observed. In a multivariable analysis, after correction for clinical variables, the relationship between the ACE and AGT genotypes within the scope of the analyzed polymorphisms and the process of restenosis was not found using a dominant, recessive and log-additive model. Late lumen loss was also independent of the genotypes of the polymorphisms before and after correction with angiographic variables.The rs1799752 polymorphism and the rs699 polymorphism had no relationship with the occurrence of angiographically significant ISR and late lumen loss in a group of Polish patients who underwent metal stent implantation.",

Presence of 14 high-risk HPV types DNA in frozen or paraffin-embedded tumour pathological samples was also assessed. To correlate gene expression with selected pathological features and clinical outcome we used different hierarchical clustering method.Hierarchical clustering demonstrated the association between gene expression within certain clusters and gender, tumour site, T stage, N stage, grade, pathological subtype or tumour recurrence.Despite some limitations we were able to identify gene clusters that allowed to classify patients according to selected clinical features and occurrence of tumour recurrence. The results of the analysis also confirm that the incidence of HPV infection among the patients from Upper Silesia is relatively low, whereas HPV negative tumours, likely associated with smoking, appeared dominant.",

All patients were treated with different regimens including protocols: for lymphoblastic lymphoma in 7 cases, for anaplastic large cell lymphoma in 1, CHOP in 1. Five of the 10 patients with PTCL were classified as stage II; 4 as stage III and 1 as stage IV due to extralymphatic organs (bone marrow) involvement. Four histological subtypes of PTCL were recognized: extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENTNT), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPL), Sezary syndrome (SS). After first-line therapy 9 patients initially achieved complete remission, 4 relapsed, 5 died. One patient achieved remission spontaneously. Three children (1 with stage IV and 2 in relapse) underwent high-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation and all of them are alive and in CR.The cumulative probability of 5-year overall survival (OS) for our whole group was 63.9% (95%CI: 35.2\u201388.2%) with a median follow-up time of 48.4 months (range 24\u201390+ months).

The aim of this study was to analyze the expression profile of tumor suppressor genes related to the cell cycle in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma across histological differentiation and to identify transcripts which differentiate endometrium into various pathomorphological grades.Gene expression analysis was completed for 19 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas and 5 normal specimens (obtained from women with diagnosed uterine fibroids, benign ovarian tumors and a prolapsed uterus with histopathologically confirmed endometrium in the proliferative phase) using Affymetrix HG-U133A oligonucleotide microarrays. The statistical analysis was performed using the GeneSpring13.0 software and PANTHER classification system.Significant changes in gene expression were observed across histological differentiation. The WT-1, CYR 61, TSPYL5 genes were statistically and biologically significant in all cancer grades, and were considered to be primary for the G1 grade in endometrial cancer. The G2 cancer specific genes were BCL2L2 and HNRNPA0, whereas in G3 there was only BAK.In conclusion, the WT-1, CYR61 and TSPYL5 gene expressions are potentially correlated with patient survival in all endometrial cancer grades. The TSGs identified are considered to be important in EEC pathogenesis and further research is needed to confirm this.",

In this paper, we discuss some detailed molecular mechanisms of inducing these effects, and wonder if they could be possibly mimicked without actually applying calorie restriction, through induction of sirtuin activity. It is known now that sirtuins, when adjusting the pattern of cellular metabolism to nutrient availability, can regulate many metabolic functions significant from the standpoint of aging research \u2013 including DNA repair, genome stability, inflammatory response, apoptosis, cell cycle, and mitochondrial functions. While carrying out these regulations, sirtuins cooperate with many transcription factors, including PGC-1a, NFKB, p53 and FoxO.

     "abstract": "The global control and management of tuberculosis (TB) is faced with the formidable challenge of worsening scenarios of drug-resistant disease. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an indispensable first-line drug used for the treatment of TB. It plays a key role in reducing TB relapse rates, shortening the course of the disease treatment from 9\u201312 months to 6 months, and the treatment of patients infected with bacillary strains that are resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. Additionally, it is the only first-line anti-TB drug most likely to be maintained in all new regimens, which are aimed at reducing the treatment period of susceptible, multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB. It has a preferential sterilizing activity against non-replicating persister bacilli with low metabolism at acid pH in vitro or in vivo during active inflammation where other drugs may not act so well. PZA seem to have a non-specific cellular target and instead, exerts its anti-mycobacterial effect by disrupting the membrane energetics, the trans-translation process, acidification of the cytoplasm and perhaps coenzyme A synthesis, which is required for survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) persisters. Indeed, the emergence of MTB strains resistant to PZA represents an important clinical and public health problem. The essential role of PZA in TB treatment underlines the need for accurate and rapid detection of its resistance. This article presents an updated review of the molecular mechanisms of drug action and resistance in MTB against PZA, commenting on the several research gaps and proposed drug targets for PZA.",

Hospital admission records were reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics. BMI-for-age and gender percentile charts were used to define overweight as \u226585th BMI percentile and obesity as \u226595th BMI percentile.675 patients were evaluated: 368 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 307 with ulcerative colitis (UC). Of these, 54.8% were boys and 45.2% were girls. There were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, height and disease activity between the CD and UC patients. The UC patients had higher BMI values than the CD patients. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in the UC than the CD patients (4.89% CI95 2.76\u20137.93 vs. 2.45% CI95 1.12\u20134.59 and 8.47% CI95 5.61\u201312.16 vs. 1.9% CI95 0.77\u20133.88, respectively); the differences were statistically significant (\u22122.44% CI95 \u22125.45 to 0.49 and \u22126.57% CI95 \u221210 to \u22123.1, respectively).

The goal of this work is to present a methodology for patient-specific hemodynamics study of the carotid artery bifurcation based on the use of ultrasound (US) morphological and blood flow velocity patient data.Subject-specific studies were performed for two patients, using a developed finite element code. Geometrical models were obtained from the acquisition of longitudinal and sequential cross-sectional ultrasound images and boundary conditions from Doppler velocity measurements at the common carotid artery.There was a good agreement between ultrasound imaging data and computational simulated results. For a normal and a stenosed carotid bifurcation the velocity, wall shear stress (WSS) and WSS descriptors analysis illustrated the extremely complex hemodynamic behavior along the cardiac cycle. Different patterns were found, associated with morphology and hemodynamic patient-specific conditions. High values of time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) were found at stenosis site and for both patients TAWSS fields presented low values within areas of high oscillating shear index and relative residence time values, corresponding to recirculation zones.Simulated hemodynamic parameters were able to capture the disturbed flow conditions in a normal and a stenosed carotid artery bifurcation, which play an important role in the development of local atherosclerotic plaques. Computational simulations based on clinic US might help improving diagnostic and treatment management of carotid atherosclerosis.",

IL4 and IL13 strongly influence bronchial hyperreactivity in response to allergen, airway remodeling, airway inflammation and airway smooth muscle proliferation. Both IL4 and IL13 exert biologic effect via interleukin 4 receptor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the polymorphisms within interleukin 4 (rs2243250, rs2227284), interleukin 4 receptor \u03b1 chain (rs1805010, rs1805011) and interleukin 13 (rs20541) genes on the incidence of allergic phenotype in Polish pediatric population.We compared 177 asthmatic pediatric patients with 194 healthy children. Five polymorphisms within IL4, IL13 and IL4R\u03b1 genes were analyzed. Genotypes of four polymorphisms (rs2243250, rs2227284, rs1805011, rs20541) were assigned by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems), whereas rs18050100 polymorphism was established using PCR-RFLP method.We observed an association of rs1805011 polymorphism of IL4R\u03b1 gene with allergy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), mild asthma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00005) and atopic dermatitis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0056).

Myriocin was used to inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase activity (the enzyme catalyzes the first step of ceramide de novo synthesis) and nicotinic acid was used to reduce the concentration of plasma free fatty acids (a substrate for the de novo ceramide synthesis). The sphingolipids were quantified by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.Myriocin reduced the level of each compound in plasma. It reduced the level of sphinganine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and total ceramide and elevated the level of sphingosine in erythrocytes. In platelets, myriocin reduced the total level of ceramide. Nicotinic acid reduced the plasma level of sphinganine, sphingosine and total ceramide. It increased the level of sphingosine-1-phosphate in erythrocytes.

Serum biochemical markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin \u2013 OC, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 5 \u2013 TRACP5b and osteoprotegerin \u2013 OPG) and mechanical properties of bones were analyzed.There was a significant decrease in the femur index value in groups receiving tazarotene and bexarotene on Day 14 (8% and 20% respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0039). On Day 28, 14 days after discontinuation of tazarotene and bexarotene, the difference in femur indexes was still significant (4% for T1\u20136 and B1\u20136, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0270). In the bexarotene group an increase in mean plasma osteocalcin level and mean plasma TRACP5b level was detected.

An increased yield stress was detected in groups receiving retinoids comparing to controls after 14 days of tazarotene and bexarotene administration.Although bexarotene and tazarotene administration caused decrease in the femur index, mechanisms responsible for that effect seem to be different. Our results suggest that bexaroten increases bone turnover. On the contrary, tazaroten seems to have inhibitory effect on bone turnover.

The mean gestational age and birth weight among infants with LO-PNEU were significantly lower. The VAP incidence was of 18.2/1000 NICU pds for mechanically ventilated (MV) infants, while the rates for those receiving only CPAP were as low as 7.7/1000 NICU pds. MV significantly increased the risk of PNEU, but MV or CPAP for <10 days did not increase the risk of LO-PNEU. Significantly associated with LO-PNEU was the use of central or peripheral venous catheters and total parenteral nutrition for longer periods.Microorganisms isolated in cases of LO-PNEU were Gram-positive cocci (53.5%) and Gram-negative rods, with predominating E. coli. Non fermentative bacilli were significantly more frequent in cases of VAP than in other cases.Observed incidence rates associated with VAP and CPAP-PNEU, were higher than in other national surveillance systems and expressing the feasibility of lowering the risk of LO-PNEU and increasing patient safety. The incidence of pneumonia was found to be lower when using CPAP as compared to using MV.",

Whole lung samples were used for isolation of RNA and evaluation of selected genes involved in eicosanoid metabolism, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), 12/15-LOX, 5-LOX and 5-LOX activated protein (FLAP).Allergen-induced airway inflammation was associated with significant (9-fold, 95% CI 8.068\u20139.932-fold; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up-regulation of 12/15-LOX in wild type but not in the 12/15-LOX knockout mice in which 12/15-LOX mRNA remained undetectable. Lack of 12/15-LOX was associated with significant attenuation of production of 15-HETE in response to allergen challenge. On the contrary, the greatest up-regulation of COX-2 after allergen exposure was demonstrated in the 12/15-LOX knockout mice (4.3-fold vs sham group) and was significantly greater than in the wild type counterparts (5.185-fold, 95% CI 4.723\u20136.309-fold; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs wild type mice). Also, allergen challenged 12/15-LOX knockout mice were characterized by greater production of PGE2 and cysLT.The 12/15-LOX plays an important role in the metabolism of eicosanoids in response to allergen-induced airway inflammation.",

Thus, it is crucial to keep alert in the diagnosis and treatment of anemia, especially in critically ill cardiac patients. The greatest groups of patients admitted to ICCU are those with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), severe arrhythmias as well as individuals after cardiac operations. However, patients suffering other critical cardiac illnesses quite often become anemic during hospitalization in ICCU. It is because anemia is typed in the clinical features of heavy diseases or may be the consequence of treatment. The current review focuses on the incidence, complex etiology and predictive role of anemia in a diverse group of ICCU patients.

Lipid profile, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leptin levels were measured. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were estimated. Micronutrients (Zn and Cu) concentrations in addition to insulin and fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels were also evaluated. Estimation of insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR)) was derived from FBS measurements.Significant elevations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, leptin, MDA, Cu and FBS levels and significant decreases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in GSH, Zn levels and SOD activity were detected among obese individuals as compared with control group. Insulin and triglyceride levels were significantly increased in obese male children and HDL-cholesterol level was increased significantly in obese adolescent females compared to controls. However, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly high in all obese cases as compared with controls. Insulin resistance was detected in 100% of the patients.We concluded that obesity with pro-inflammatory adipocytokines and hypozincemia together by many mechanisms participate in excessive oxidative stress and are highly associated with inflammation and the development of obesity-related complications.

With four patients, the catheter was implanted during a hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy-related laparotomy using the closed technique. Each case was categorized as to the number of cycles of IP therapy received.Seven catheter-related complications were noted. These were divided into two categories: six malfunctions (24%) and one infection (4%). Overall, of the patients who had IP catheters placed and received IP chemotherapy, 13 (54.2%) were able to complete the six regimens. Among the four (14.8%) patients who had the catheters planted directly following the HIPEC, one experienced a catheter leak, one an infection and one concluded the treatment successfully; one is still being treated.A subcutaneous single-lumen intravenous access port with a silicone catheter of a large size (9\u201310\u00a0Fr) is related to a lower rate of catheter-related complications than previously reported open-ended Tenckhoff catheter treatment. An additional advantage is the possibility of removing the catheter as an office procedure under local anesthesia.

In this work we investigated the role of oxidative damage in connection with particular polymorphisms of DNA repair genes and their repair capacity.Materials constitute the peripheral blood of patients with T2DM with and without DSPN and control subjects without disturbance of the carbohydrate fraction. The study of gene polymorphisms which products take part in base excision repair (BER) pathway: 726 Val/Ala adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase (ADPRT), 324 His/Glu MutYhomolog (MUTYH) and 148 Asp/Glu human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) was carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) method. The study of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and the efficiency of their repair was carried out using comet assay.None of the 3 polymorphisms were associated with the risk of DSPN. However, in group of patients together with T2DM and T2DM/DSPN 726 Ala ADPRT allele was significantly susceptible to increased risk of T2DM (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.59; 95% CI: 1.08\u20132.36). Investigation of DNA damage and repair revealed that T2DM patients have decreased ability to DNA repair. This capacity even drops down in the group of T2DM/DSPN patients compared to subjects with diabetes alone. ADPRT and APE polymorphisms were significantly associated with higher DNA damages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in heterozygous and mutant homozygous in correlation to homozygous wild type, but for MUTYH polymorphism relation was not confirmed.Pathogenesis of T2DM and development of DSPN may be related to oxidative stress connected with BER gene polymorphisms.",

The antazoline was administered at the rate of 30\u201350\u00a0mg/min (max. 500\u00a0mg) after the circumferential ablation in the ostia of pulmonary veins and before confirmation of isolation. Success was defined as restoration of sinus rhythm within 20\u00a0min after antazoline infusion.The efficacy of antazoline was 83.6% in paroxysmal and 31.1% in persistent AF patients. Clinical variables that were independently predictive of antazoline ineffectiveness were female (odds ratio [OR]: 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26\u201314.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and AF at the beginning of procedure (OR 28.4; 95% CI 3.89\u2013208.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Solid tumors modulate their environment to keep non-malignant stromal cells in a tumor-promoting state. The main cells in the stroma of epithelial derived tumors are cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) that are critical to tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. CAFs also supply the tumor cells with growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) degrading enzymes. They are thus essential for tumor initiation as well as tumor progression and metastasis, suggesting that they represent an ideal cellular target of an integrative tumor therapy.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a well-defined marker, expressed at high levels on the cell surface of CAFs. FAP, a constitutively active serine peptidase with both dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) and collagenase/gelatinase activity, promotes malignant and invasive behavior of epithelial cancers. High stromal expression levels of FAP correlate with poor prognosis. FAP is difficult to detect in non-diseased adult tissue, but it is generally expressed at sites of tissue remodeling.In our experiments, we aimed for a reduction of the pro-tumorigenic activities of CAFs by depleting FAP from fibroblasts growing in a composite environment with epithelial tumor cells.FAP depletion was achieved by two therapeutically relevant approaches: a novel internalizing anti-FAP IgG1 antibody and FAP gene knock-down by siRNA delivery. The antibody effectively removed FAP from the cell surface and was capable of reversing the FAP mediated migratory and invasive capacity. FAP RNA interference was equally effective when compared to the antibody.Thus, targeting FAP on CAF suppresses pro-tumorigenic activities and may result in a clinically effective reduction of tumor progression and dissemination.",

We here evaluated the effect of Pleiotrophin on endothelial cells (EC), monocytes and macrophages that have been shown as key cells promoting neovascularization.EA.hy926 endothelial cells, THP-1 monocytes and PMA-differentiated macrophages were treated with Pleiotrophin (10 and 100\u00a0ng/ml). VEGF, Flk-1, Nrp-1, COX-2, ICAM-1 and TGF\u03b2 expression were detected by Western Blot, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF\u03b1 levels by ELISA. Chemotaxis was performed in Boyden chambers. Wound healing was performed by scratch wound assay.Pleiotrophin induces in EC the expression of VEGF and its receptors Flk-1 and Nrp-1 and improves the migratory capacity.

Although liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, it is subject to sampling error, while ultrasound-based techniques, such as Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) and transient elastography, have gained popularity. However, no previous comparative study has performed these ultrasound techniques at the time of biopsy. The aim of this study was to compare the reliability of these techniques to define the severity of liver fibrosis in viral hepatitis patients.We compared liver transient elastography and Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse measurements, performed along the intended biopsy track, with liver biopsy results in 46 viral hepatitis patients, all measured on the same morning. Fibrosis was measured by histology using the Ishak fibrosis staging.The relative sensitivity and specificity of different incremental cut-off values for both techniques, and the predictive ability of pairwise comparison of the 3 tests (including APRI) and of their combined use with more severe grades of histology-measured liver fibrosis, show that the single variable with greatest sensitivity and specificity is TE with a cut-off of >10.0.Transient elastography has a better performance than ARFI, which has a lower sensitivity, in the diagnosis of severe stages of fibrosis. Also ARFI of the spleen is correlated with Ishak fibrosis staging, and could be a possible additional tool for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis.",

The control group included 35 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 35 pregnant women after childbirth.TAS activity and Cu concentration in serum in women who experienced a miscarriage were significantly lower, but Mn level \u2013 higher, than in women in the first trimester of pregnancy. The content of Se, Cu and Mn in placental tissue in patients who have had a miscarriage was significantly higher, while Zn content was lower than in pregnant women at full-term delivery.Our findings, provided in the research, enable us to claim that the total antioxidative status is significantly lower in women who have had a miscarriage. Low level of Zn but high of Mn in the examined biological material may be indicative to the incidence of miscarriage.",

     "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension are the leading cause of death in the developed countries. Diabetes and chronic kidney disease became also more prevalent reaching almost the level of epidemy. Researchers are looking eagerly for the new risk and/or pathogenetic factors, as well as therapeutic option in these disease. It has been suggested that human kidney releases a protein named renalase into the bloodstream. It is supposed to be an enzyme which breaks down catecholamines in the blood circulation and regulate blood pressure. However, there were several doubts whether renalase exerts monoaminooxidase activity, or if it is monoaminooxidase at all. Recently, a hypothesis that it is also a cytokine was postulated. Studies on renalase polymorphisms in hypertension, cardiovascular disease or diabetes are inconsistent. Similarly, there are several discrepancies in the animal on the possible role of renalase in hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Some studies report a protective role of renalase in acute kidney injury, whereas others showed that renalase levels were mainly dependent on kidney function, indicating rather a role of kidney in excretion of this substance. Moreover, validated assays are needed to evaluate renalase levels and activity. On one hand a deeper and more accurate link between renalase and cardiovascular diseases require further profound research, on the other hand whether or not renalase protein could be a new therapeutic target in these pathologies should also be considered. Whether renalase, discovered in 2005, might be a Holy Grail of hypertension, linking kidney and cardiovascular diseases, remains to be proven.",

Particularly important seems the role of the biomarkers in the early diagnosis of AD, as the first pathophysiologic events observable in the CSF and amyloid \u03b2-PET occur years and perhaps decades before the onset of the earliest clinical symptoms. Therefore, the NDD tools enable the diagnosis of AD already in the early preclinical stage.

Physiological microbiota are replaced by pathogenic bacteria mainly from large intestine, which is called dysbacteriosis. SIBO disturbs digestion and absorption in the alimentary tract, which seems to cause inflammation. SIBO affects the morphology and function of the digestive system and causes systemic complications (e.g. osteoporosis, macrocytic anemia). Inflammation interferes with gene expression responsible for producing and secreting mucus, therefore, a correlation between SIBO and cystic fibrosis, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic abdominal pain are postulated. All conditions leading to bacterial growth such as congenital and anatomical abnormalities in the digestive tract, motility disorder or immunological deficits are risk factors of SIBO. A typical clinical manifestation of SIBO comprises meteorism, enterectasia, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Diagnostic procedures such as glucose, lactulose, methane, 13C mixed triglyceride breath tests are being used in diagnosing SIBO.",

The relative risk of death was calculated as the ratio of the mortality rate in ESRD patients to the mortality rate in age-adjusted general population.The mortality rate of children with ESRD was 74-fold higher than that of the age- and gender-adjusted general pediatric population (4.05 vs. 0.05/100 person-years). The highest mortality rate (4.53/100 patient-years) was found in the youngest age group. Younger age and duration of dialysis therapy were identified as mortality risk factors. The major causes of death in ESRD patients were infections and cardiovascular complications, whereas deaths in general child population were mainly due to accidents or congenital defects.The mortality in Polish children with ESRD is 74-fold higher than that of the general pediatric population. Infections, followed by cardiovascular complications, constitute the main causes of mortality in children subjected to RRT. The risk of death is the highest among children who started RRT at a younger age and in those subjected to long-term dialysis treatment.",

Among the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, two out of 8 (25%) and 6 out of 8 (75%) were positive for blaSHV and blaCTX-M genes respectively.Ribotyping identified 30 distinct ribogroups among 52 isolates evaluated. Seven NICU outbreak isolates were divided into 2 ribotypes, as many as 6 belonged to one ribotype while one isolate which was isolated a week later was of a different ribotype, indicating the termination of the outbreak in the NICU. The outbreak in the NICU thus, was shown to have been caused by a single clone.A high discriminatory power, ease of interpretation coupled with excellent reproducibility and stability make ribotyping a very useful technique for investigating the molecular epidemiology of nosocomial infections caused by K. pneumoniae. A regular surveillance of hospital associated infections including monitoring antibiotic sensitivity pattern of K. pneumoniae, ESBL-production and molecular characterization is mandatory to control the spread of multidrug-resistant and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and for epidemiological purposes especially in outbreak situations.",

The blood samples were collected on admission in order to evaluate calcidiol, serum amyloid A (SAA), interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).Calcidiol, TNF\u03b1 and SAA levels were significantly lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 respectively), whereas hsCRP levels were significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in STEMI group as compared to USAP group. In the STEMI group, there were negative correlations between SAA and hsCRP (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.347; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and SAA and IL-6 (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.356; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

Plasma levels of immunoreactive cationic trypsinogen (IRCT), amylase, lipase, and diamine oxidase (DAO) activities were analyzed for 48 days after PDL, including 1 week of oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation (PES) with Creon\u00ae.PDL resulted in an arrested body growth and a rapid surge of pancreatic enzymes (IRCT, amylase and lipase) into the plasma. Nine days after PDL, the plasma levels of these pancreatic enzymes had decreased. IRCT then remained below the level in un-operated pigs while amylase only fell below control at 25 days. The intestinally derived marker DAO and plasma protein levels were unaffected by PDL but DAO decreased slightly with time in PEI pigs. One-week of oral PES restored body growth, but had little effect on pancreatic enzyme plasma levels, except for a tendency towards increased DAO.The study showed that PEI developed within 1\u20132 weeks after PDL and that only IRCT is a reliable plasma enzyme marker for this. The reduced plasma DAO indicated that PEI also affected the intestines, while PES therapy restored growth of the PDL pigs and slightly increased plasma DAO, suggesting an improved intestinal function.",

The authors compared their effect into the cytotoxic, apoptosis and DNA destruction approach. Their cytotoxic effect on the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells line was determined by WST-1 test. Next the cytotoxic way of tumor cells death was determined by caspase 3/7 test. The last point referred to the DNA destruction of A549 cells and test in situ DNA Assay Kit was applied. Two of the examined compounds (B2 and D2) show a very good correlation of the cytotoxic effect normoxia to hypoxia and they have been found as the potential agents of the DNA damage. The most cytotoxic feature possesses N-oxide benzimidazole derivatives (D and B groups). The screening test of the DNA damage established that N-oxide benzimidazole derivatives (D and B groups) can be more potent as the hypoxia-selective agents for tumor cells than benzimidazole derivatives (A and C groups). Additionally, the test of the caspase-dependent apoptosis proved that the exposure of benzimidazole-4,7-diones against A549 cells, especially in hypoxia, promotes apoptotic cell death.",

This study investigated the expression of NGAL in the kidney of diabetic rats.Sixty-four Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: non-diabetic control groups and diabetic groups. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Relevant indicators were separately evaluated 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after induction of diabetes.In the diabetic groups, urinary NGAL values were markedly increased even before the appearance of pathological albuminuria. Moreover, diabetic rats showed significant upregulation of NGAL mRNA expression starting at week 2 (1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 vs. 3.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40, NGAL/\u03b2-actin, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the increase of NGAL protein expression appeared subsequently (0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 vs. 0.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, NGAL/\u03b2-actin, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

We will discuss the concept that a population of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) could be a link between early-development stages and adult stem cell compartments and reside in a quiescent state in adult tissues. The epigenetic mechanism identified that changes expression of certain genes involved in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) in VSELs, on the one hand, keeps these cells quiescent in adult tissues and, on the other hand, provides a novel view of the stem cell compartment, IIS, tissue/organ rejuvenation, aging, and cancerogenesis.",

This refers to first-line induction therapy and maintenance therapy as well, but also to subsequent lines of therapy since anti-neoplastic drugs and regimens used upfront clinically influence the selection of agents/regimes considered for second-/third-line treatment. Consequently, therapy customization through tumour histology and molecular markers has significantly influenced the work of pathologists around the globe and the process of obtaining an extended therapeutically relevant tumour diagnosis. Not only histological sub-typing became standard but molecular information is also considered of increasing importance for treatment selection. Routine molecular testing in certified laboratories must be established, and the diagnostic process should ideally be performed under the guidance of evidence based recommendation. The process of investigating and implementing medical targeting in lung cancer therefore, requires advanced diagnostic techniques and expertise and because of its large dimension is costly and influenced by the limitation of financial and clinical resources.",

While platelet reactivity was not altered by HUVECs incubated with higher concentrations of GSE, HUVEC proliferation was significantly reduced by GSE of up to 10\u00a0\u03bcg gallic acid equivalent/ml.The results of the study show that low doses of GSE potentiate the inhibitory action of HUVECs on platelet reactivity, which may account, at least partially, for the protective effects of grape products against cardiovascular diseases.

As controls for each state, equal number of animals (of the same age and weight) were used. Morphological evaluation of rat testes was carried out. The spermatogenic epithelium state was estimated by four points system. CYP2E1 mRNA expression was rated by method of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Pearson correlation coefficients were used for describing relationships between variables.The presence of alcoholism and diabetes-mediated quantitative and qualitative changes in male rat spermatogenic epithelium in comparison with norm has been demonstrated. The increased levels of testes CYP2E1 have been fixed simultaneously. CYP2E1 mRNA content negatively strongly correlated with spermatogenic index value (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.99; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and positively strongly correlated with epithelium desquamation occurrence (r\u00a0=\u00a00.99; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in testes of rats with chronic alcoholism.

     "abstract": "We investigated the association between metabolic syndrome (MS), its components and the presence of subclinical organ damage in hypertensive perimenopausal women.152 women with newly diagnosed, untreated arterial hypertension (mean age 51.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5 years) were included in the study. In all subjects anthropometrical measurements, 24-hr blood pressure monitoring, echocardiographic examination, and carotid ultrasound were performed. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured to obtain data on vascular compliance. As the index of early kidney damage both glomerular filtration rate was calculated and albumin/creatinine ratio in the urine sample was measured. A fasting blood sample was taken to measure glucose and lipid concentration.MS was found in 41% of patients. Patients with MS exhibited elevated left ventricular mass index (LVMI 84.7 vs. 78.8\u00a0g/m2.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), higher intima-media thickness (IMT 0.67 vs. 0.62\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), greater prevalence of LV hypertrophy (30% vs. 13%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and carotid plaques (24% vs. 15%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The multivariate regression analysis revealed that components of MS (systolic blood pressure and waist circumference) are stronger predictors of LVM than MS itself. The relationship between MS and LVMI lost its significance when BMI was included in the model, and remained significant for IMT.In hypertensive perimenopausal women components of MS are stronger predictors of subclinical organ damage than MS itself. Left ventricular mass and hypertrophy are more strongly correlated with increasing body weight than with the presence of MS. MS, independently of BMI, influences the level of subclinical atherosclerosis in the study group.",

The efficacy of the decellularisation methods to completely remove the cells while preserving the ECM was evaluated by histological evaluation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), hydroxyproline analysis, tensile test, and DAPI staining.The detergent-based method completely removed the cells and left the ECM and collagen content in the valve and conduit sections relatively well preserved. The detergent and enzyme-based protocol did not completely remove the cells, but left the collagen content in both sections well preserved. ECM deterioration was observed in the aortic valves (AVs), but the ultrastructure of the conduits was well preserved, with no media distortion. The enzyme-based protocol removed the cells relatively well; however, mild structural distortion and poor collagen content was observed in the AVs. Incomplete cell removal (better than that observed with the detergent and enzyme-based protocol), poor collagen preservation, and mild structural distortion were observed in conduits treated with the enzyme-based method.The results suggested that the detergent-based methods are the most effective protocols for cell removal and ECM preservation of AVCs.

The aim of this review was to examine recent findings about CACS\u2019 pathophysiology and to describe the current pharmacological approaches. In recent years many efforts were made to improve our knowledge of CACS; currently we know that cachexia arises from a complex and multifactorial interaction between various mechanisms including inflammation, anorexia/malnutrition, alterations of protein and lipid metabolism; consequently its management requires multidisciplinary and multipharmacological approach that should address the different causes underlying this clinical event. On these premises, several drugs have been proposed starting from the first pharmacological treatment based on progestational agents or corticosteroids; most of them are in the preclinical phase, but some have already reached the clinical experimentation stage. In conclusion, to date, there is no standard effective treatment and further studies are needed to unravel the basic mechanisms underlying CACS and to develop newer therapeutic strategies with the hope to improve the quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients.",

The aim of this study was to build multidimensional models (artificial neural networks) to predict early outcomes of ESS in individual patients.The study group comprised of 115 patients operated for CRS in the Department of Otolaryngology, Jagiellonian University Collegium Medicum, Cracow. The neural models were created using the Statistica Neural Network computer software package. The models required only information easily achievable for every patient before surgery. Consequently, the models could be readily applicable in everyday clinical practice. To define the results of surgery three different mathematical descriptions were compared. The models\u2019 predictions were compared with the actual results of surgery 3\u20136 months postoperatively.The models were able to predict the early outcome of surgery in 90% of the patients but their quality depended on mathematical representation of the surgery result. The best models were characterized by 93% sensitivity and 86% specificity.The results of ESS depend on many factors, so reliable outcome prognoses can be produced only by multidimensional models. Artificial neural networks are a promising multidimensional tool facilitating clinical decision making in patients with CRS.",

The CRP was measured perioperatively in both groups. The CRP evaluation was the part of routine lab-tests during perioperative period, without any modification of the typical perioperative strategy. In the postoperative period CRP was measured after 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h in both groups.There were no differences between CRP levels between both groups of patients. The peak CRP values were observed after 48\u00a0h after the operation in ECC in both groups and decreased in the next postoperative days.In children with congenital heart defects undergoing cardiosurgical treatment with the use of ECC the assessing CRP values in the first postoperative day remains questionable. The maximum peak CRP value after operation with ECC can be much higher than the reference values without infection complications. Single CRP assessment in early postoperative period in these groups of children can lead to over-diagnosis of infections and antibiotics abuse.",

In this study the method of the individual setting of the power Doppler gain value was used. Only patients with entirely visualized placenta were included in the study.No statistically relevant difference in the values of placental vascular indices and placental volume between different localizations of the placenta was detected. No statistically significant changes to placental vascular indices depending on gestational age were found. It enabled to determine the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile values for the vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), vascularization-flow index (VFI), which are independent of gestational age. No correlation was found between placental volume and placental vascular indices.The values of placental vascular indices are constant between the 22nd and 41st week of a normal pregnancy. Placental volume measured with the use of the VOCAL program increases between 22nd and 41st week of a normal pregnancy. In a normal pregnancy the placental vasculature increases adequately to the increase of its volume.

The patients who had undergone surgical treatment for the first time because of chronic otitis media were taken into account.

The patients were divided into two groups (with and without cholesteatoma). A statistically significant hearing improvement was observed in the patients with cholesteatoma. In the group without cholesteatoma and with a prevalence of granulomatous lesions, no statistically significant hearing improvement was observed 6 and 12 months following the ear surgery.In the patients with cholesteatoma and a minor damage to the ossicular chain, a significant hearing improvement is observed after ossiculoplasty. An occurrence of granulomatous lesions is an unfavorable predictor.The Air-Bone Gap measured before the surgery often does not the actual advancement of the pathological process, and hearing improvement after the surgery cannot be prognosticated on the basis of that amount alone.",

     "abstract": "Glyburide has been used for managing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a number of countries. It is rather inexpensive. However, its efficacy and safety remain controversial. With this meta-analysis, we evaluated glyburide in comparison with insulin.With a systematic literature search strategy, a total of 93 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with insulin and glyburide comparison were identified. Based on the revised Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, five of them met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis.Six hundred and seventy four subjects were included in these five RCTs. When compared with insulin, glyburide had an increased relative risk (RR) for neonatal hypoglycemia (RR: 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17, 3.36). Estimation of standard mean differences (SMD) showed that both fetal birth weight and incidence of macrosomia were higher in subjects receiving glyburide than in those receiving insulin (SMD: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.36; RR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.07, 4.61 respectively). There were no significant differences in maternal glucose control, glycated hemoglobin, the rate of Cesarean section, large-for-gestational age, neonatal hypocalcemia, length of stay for neonatal ICU admissions, preterm birth, or congenital anomalies.Our study suggested that in women with GDM, glyburide is as effective as insulin, but the risks of neonatal hypoglycemia, high fetal birth weight, and macrosomia were higher.",

The absolute number of leukocytes was estimated by haematologic analyser. Surface neutrophils antigens (CD) were assayed by the direct fluorescence method for whole blood, using a flow cytometer.At the day 1, significant increase of ICAM-1 expression was found in patients with severe AP (S-AP) (7280\u00a0mm\u22123 vs 2850\u00a0mm\u22123 in healthy control; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the days 2, 3 and 5 it sharply decreased and peaked again to 4860\u00a0mm\u22123 at the day 10. In patients with mild AP (M-AP), not significant elevation of ICAM-1 quickly returned to normal level. In both forms of AP, neutrophil CD62L (L-selectin) expression reached the highest level at the day 1 (8800\u00a0mm\u22123 and 9020\u00a0mm\u22123, respectively in M-AP and S-AP, in comparison to 3400\u00a0mm\u22123 in control; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Expression of CD69 (neutrophils\u2019 marker of early activation) significantly increased in both M-AP and S-AP.We have found an early and significant increase of peripheral blood neutrophil CD54/ICAM-1 expression, specific for S-AP but not for M-AP.

The prevalence of intracranial stenosis, which raises the risk of stroke, is not known in these children. Here, we estimated the prevalence of stenosis and explored its association with silent cerebral infarcts determined based on Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans.We studied prospectively a cohort of 67 children with SCA without prior clinically overt stroke or TIA (median age 8.8 years; range limits 2.3\u201313.1 years; 33 females) and with TCD mean velocity <170\u00a0cm/s. They underwent MR imaging of the brain and MR angiography of intracranial arteries.In 7 children (10.5%, 95% CI: 4.9\u201320.3%) we found 10 stenoses, including 4 with isolated left tICA stenosis and 3 with multiple stenoses. We found silent infarcts in 26 children (37.7%, 95% CI: 27.2\u201349.5%).

CPI values of 0\u20132 and 3\u20134 were classified as non-periodontitis and periodontitis, respectively. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose, HbA1c, CRP, fibrinogen, interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1).Periodontitis was found in 15.0% of the controls and 57.9% of diabetic patients, including 40.0% of these with good metabolic control (GMC) and 59.5% of those with poor metabolic control (PMC). Severe periodontitis was more frequent in the PMC than in the GMC group and in the controls (26.0% vs. 20.0% vs. 5.0%). The PMC patients had lower number of sextants with CPI 0 and higher number of sextants with CPI 3 and CPI 4 as well as lower tooth number in comparison with the controls. The patients with periodontitis had higher TNF-\u03b1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and OHI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than the patients without periodontitis. The number of sextants with CPI 0 correlated negatively with fibrinogen and TNF-\u03b1 levels, whereas the number of sextants with CPI 3 correlated positively with TNF-\u03b1 and fasting glucose level.There is good evidence that type 1 diabetes increases the risk of periodontal disease. Our results suggest that poor metabolic control of diabetes together with smoking and inadequate oral hygiene increase the risk of severe periodontal destruction in patients with type 1 diabetes.",

Quality of surgical field was evaluated with Fromm-Boezaart scale at mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70\u201380\u00a0mmHg. If at this MAP surgical field quality was not satisfactory further reduction of hemodynamic parameters was performed until \u2018bloodless surgical field\u2019 (grade 2 or lower) was achieved. The rate of intraoperative bleeding was calculated from the ratio of total blood loss and the operative time. The extent of the disease was assessed according to computed tomography findings using Lund-Mackay staging system.Significant positive correlation (Spearman correlation test; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was found between CD34 antigen expression and quality of surgical field at MAP between 70 and 80\u00a0mmHg as well as the rate of intraoperative bleeding.

Willow herb was extracted using methanol/water mixture (75/25 v/v, %). Methanolic extracts were purified using solid-phase extraction. For determination of the radical scavenging activity of compounds the HPLC system with the on-line post-column DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical reaction detection was used.Five flavonoids were identified and their quantitative distribution and radical scavenging activity were evaluated.

The p53 tumor suppressor, the cell adhesion glycoprotein epithelial cadherin (CDH1) and the caudal-related homeobox transcription factor (CDX2) all of these have important roles in the aetiopathogenesis and/or progression of gastric cancer.After adjustments for TNM stage, tumor grade, histopathological characteristics (Lauren classification), we found significant differences in the expression of these proteins, particularly E-cadherin and CDX2 between young and elderly patients. However, these differences did not amount to a significant difference in survival.This study demonstrates that the protein expression of p53, CDH1 and CDX2 significantly discriminates young patients with gastric cancer who have a better prognostic outlook from older patients, but this difference in expression does not contribute to a survival benefit.",

The most investigated source of MSCs is bone marrow (BM). Yet, collection of BM is an invasive procedure associated with significant discomfort to the patient. The procedure results in a relatively low number of these cells, which can decrease with donor's age. Therefore, it seems to be very important to find other sources of mesenchymal stem cells nowadays. A human placenta, which is routinely discarded postpartum, in spite of its natural aging process, is still a rich source of stem cells capable to proliferate and in vitro differentiate in many directions. Besides homing and differentiation in the area of injury, MSCs there elicit strong paracrine effects stimulating the processes of repair.

Serum levels of all analyzed markers were evaluated by the immunological methods, while immunohistochemistry was used to assess the expression of these proteins in GC, interstitial inflammatory cells and normal tissues.The percentage of positive reactions of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was higher in GC and inflammatory cells compared to normal tissue, while serum levels of these proteins were statistically lower in GC patients in comparison to healthy subjects. There was a significant positive correlation between TIMP-2 immunoreactivity in inflammatory cells and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Area under ROC curve (AUC) for TIMP-2 was higher than MMP-2, while serum MMP-2 was an independent prognostic factor of GC patients' survival.Our findings suggest that TIMP-2 seems to be a predictor of tumor progression, especially for nodal involvement, whereas serum MMP-2 might be useful as an independent prognostic factor of patients' survival.",

Therefore our goal was to determine and apply microbiological quantitative methods (MQMs) for monitoring experimental PT.Samples from agar plates with growing bacteria were collected using dry and wet sterile compresses, or swabs. After shaking the sample in saline the amount of bacteria in suspension was determined. The method was standardized. The MQM using compress was applied for comparison of in vitro activity of phage preparations with other agents for wound rinsing. The usefulness of this swabbing method was tested in the Phage Therapy Unit for monitoring of experimental PT of patients with chronic wounds or purulent fistulas.Minimum, maximum and standard deviation values used for standardization of the studied method showed that data repeatability was good; thus the method was used for quantitation of bacteria taken both from plates in vitro and patients samples.Effectiveness of phage preparations was compared to gentamicin in vitro. Phages were as effective as antibiotics in reducing the amount of bacteria on agar plates, and this effect was not only due to simple mechanical removal of bacteria, but dependent on their antibacterial activity. We have also observed that the results of bacteria quantitation may correlate with the local status of a wound/fistula in a particular stage of PT.The standardized swabbing method of bacteria quantitation can be used for PT monitoring. Presented MQMs are simple and may help to monitor the therapy process and to decide on its duration, frequency and a kind of the phage applied. They can also be applied in other antibacterial treatment strategies.",

Isolated human PMN were incubated in the presence of NDMA. Selective MAP kinases inhibitors were used. The expression of proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was assessed using Western blot method.The results show that NDMA intensifies iNOS, c-Jun, NF-\u03baB p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 expression in the analyzed PMNs. The blocking of the p38 pathway led to lower iNOS expression, and higher expression of c-Jun and c-Fos in the cytoplasmic fraction, and also lower c-Jun expression in the nuclear fraction of PMNs exposed to NDMA. A decrease in iNOS expression in the cytoplasmic fraction, and also c-Jun in both fractions of the examined cells, was observed as a result of JNK pathway inhibition. The blocking of the ERK5 pathway led to higher iNOS, c-Jun and c-Fos expression in the cytoplasmic fraction, and higher c-Jun expression in the nuclear fraction of PMNs exposed to NDMA. The study also demonstrated that blocking of the p38 and JNK pathways resulted in higher expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 in the cytoplasmic fraction and their lower expression in the nuclear fraction of these cells.Our data indicate the role of MAP kinases p38 and JNK in the activation of c-Jun and NF-\u03baB p65 transcription factors engaged in the regulation of iNOS expression in human neutrophils exposed to NDMA.

The aim of the present study was to examine effect of aspirin on the level of selected sphingolipid intermediates in plasma, erythrocytes and platelets.Forty two healthy volunteers participated in the study. They were divided into two groups. In one group aspirin was given orally, daily, for one week in a dose of 75mg (n=25). The subjects from the second group received one 300mg dose of the drug (n=17). In both groups the blood was taken 4h after the last dose of aspirin. The following sphingolipid intermediates were quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography: sphinganine, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) and ceramide.It was found that lower dose of aspirin increased the level of S1P and ceramide in erythrocytes (by 23 and 37%, respectively) having no effect on plasma and platelet sphingolipid levels. Higher dose of the drug reduced S1P and SA1P concentration in the plasma (by 16 and 10%, respectively).We conclude that aspirin interferes with sphingolipid metabolism in blood and that this effect depends on a dose of the drug. Since S1P is a potent cardioprotectant, the reduction in its plasma concentration after the loading dose of aspirin could be undesired side effect of the drug.",

Such a situation is conducive to oxidative stress formation and oxidative modifications of cellular macromolecules and to increase in the expression of proapoptotic proteins. Pt2(isopropylamine)4(berenil)2 elicited the most damage, which resulted in oxidative modification of cellular components. The therapeutic use of this complex would cause considerable side effects in patients, therefore the agent lacks drug potential; however Pt2(piperazine)4(berenil)2 and Pt2(2-picoline)4(berenil)2 exhibited reduced redox and increased apoptotic profiles compared to cisplatin.Results of this paper and preliminary data show that Pt2(2-picoline)4(berenil)2 is less dangers than cisplatin to fibroblasts and more disruptive than cisplatin to breast cancer cell metabolism, and therefore it is a promising candidate for use in future anticancer drug strategies.",

Additionally, ex-vivo effect of the serum samples on in vitro function of the endothelial cells was studied.Infusion of sulodexide caused acute and transient peak of the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) concentration in blood and decrease of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) level, what, as we found in in vitro experiments, was due to adsorption of VEGF to endothelium. We found that HGF enhanced in vitro stimulating effect of VEGF on proliferation of the endothelial cells. Serum level of interleukin-6 was gradually decreased, whereas fibrinolytic activity of serum, reflected by t-PA/PAI-1 ratio, increased. Serum samples obtained from the studied patients suppressed oxidative stress and release of interleukin-6 in endothelial cells maintained in in vitro culture.Sulodexide reduces intravascular inflammation and suppresses inflammatory reaction in the endothelial cells; both effects are desirable in patients with peripheral vascular disease.",

RANTES significantly increased during both enoxaparin and UFH anticoagulated HD, while over-HD Endostatin and MCP-1 levels remained stable regardless of the heparin sort. About 25% RANTES increase after 10 min of HD positively correlated with the dose of both heparins and HD duration. The switch from enoxaparin to UFH treatment had no impact on the levels of parameters studied. Patients with ischemic heart disease had less RANTES increase after 180 min of HD especially during enoxaparin treatment.RANTES is dose-depended and transitory increased in response to both UFH and enoxaparin administration during HD.

The aim of this study was to assess whether neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) could represent sensitive markers of kidney function/injury in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes.The study comprised 121 consecutive patients with diabetes referred for coronary angiography due to coronary heart disease and a reference group consisting of 64 patients without diabetes.Cystatin C, serum and urinary NGAL values were significantly higher in diabetics than in non-diabetics. There was no significant difference in KIM-1 levels in both groups. Serum NGAL in diabetic group was associated with serum creatinine, fibrinogen, urinary NGAL, cystatin C and inversely related to kidney function assessed with 4 equations. After analysing levels of studied biomarkers in both groups, no significant difference in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 was found. The analysis of patients with eGFR over 60 ml/min/1.73m2 showed significant differences in cystatin C and urinary NGAL levels. The area under the curve for serum NGAL, urinary NGAL and cystatin C was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.69), 0.59 (95% CI, 0.5 to 0.68), 0.62 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.71), respectively, good cut-off values of studied biomarkers to detect diabetes were not found.NGAL, cystatin C and KIM-1 are not more useful than eGFR in the assessment of kidney function in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease.",

We aimed to identify predictors of increased serum NT-proBNP levels in patients with T2DM.The study included 185 patients with T2DM treated with either oral antidiabetic agents (49.7%) or insulin (17.8%), or both (32.5%). We divided the patients into two groups: with high (>200 pg/mL) and low (\u2264200 pg/mL) NT-proBNP concentrations.We found differences between the patients with high and low NT-proBNP levels including age, prevalence of dyslipidemia and HF, history of previous myocardial infarction (MI), heart rate, hemoglobin level, platelet count, creatinine, urea and uric acid concentrations, use of beta-blockers, loop diuretics, metformin and insulin. In a multivariate analysis metformin was a negative predictor of increased NT-proBNP concentration.

To date the exact pathogenesis of CGGN remains unclear. It has been suggested that macrophages may be significant contributors to the glomerular injury in this disease. In our study we attempt to characterize the macrophages in human CGGN using classical activation and regulatory macrophage markers.We searched our database for renal biopsy cases of CGGN. Macrophages were detected using a monoclonal anti-CD68 antibody. Two groups of macrophage markers were used: classical activation markers, including iNOS, CXCL9 and CCL20, and regulatory markers: SPHK1 and LIGHT. The stains were performed using immunohistochemical method.Five patients with CGGN were identified. Four patients had systemic cryoglobulinemia and two had a serological evidence of hepatitis C virus infection. In all cases the glomeruli contained numerous macrophages. Staining for activatory macrophage markers revealed a strong nuclear staining for CXCL9 in numerous cells, including those corresponding to the macrophage location. Staining for the other activatory markers, as well as staining for regulatory markers, was not significant.In this study of human CGGN we showed a striking expression of cytokine CXCL9, a classical macrophage activation marker, by the macrophages and possibly other cell types within the glomeruli. This observation points to the possible role of classically activated macrophages in the pathogenesis of MPGN. If this observation is confirmed on a larger group of patients, the cytokine CXCL9 could become a potential therapeutic target for human CGGN.",

From probands whose etiology of HL remained unknown, DNA analysis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and G-banded karyotype and/or chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were performed.In 110 (47%) cases, the etiology of HL was genetic and in 5 (2%) congenital CMV infection was diagnosed. We found mutations with clinical significance in GJB2 (100 children, 43%) and in 2 mitochondrial genes (2 patients, 1%). A single mutation in SLC26A4 gene was detected in 5 probands (2.2%) and was considered diagnostic. In 4 probands a heterozygous IVS2-2A>G change in the SLC26A5 gene was found. We did not find any instances of homozygosity for this splice variant in the probands. CMA identified in 4 probands chromosomal regions with the loss of one allele. In 2 of them we were able to conclude that the found abnormalities are definitely pathogenic (12q13.3-q14.2 and 17q22-23.2 microdeletion), but the pathogenity of 2 other findings (3p26.2 and 1p33 microdeletion) remained unknown.This practical diagnostic algorithm confirmed the etiology of early onset HL for 115 Estonian patients (49%).

     "abstract": "In recent years, exceptional progress has been observed in pharmacogenetics, i.e. investigations of inherited conditioning of the organism's response to drugs or xenobiotics. On the other hand, modern molecular biology techniques have been implemented, making it possible to perform studies determining the involvement of genetic factors in differing responses to agents employed in general anaesthesia. Unexpected and incorrect response of the organism to the administration of specific anaesthetics is most commonly associated with a genetic defect of the metabolic pathway of a given agent or its receptor.The majority of agents used in anaesthesia are metabolised in the liver by the cytochrome P450 superfamily enzymes (CYPs) and phase II drug-metabolising enzymes: glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), sulphotransferases (SULTs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Propofol is presently widely used for gastrointestinal (GI) and several other procedures. Among genes associated with metabolism of the most commonly applied anaesthetics such as propofol and sevoflurane, the following ones can be mentioned: CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, GSTP1, UGT1A9, SULT1A1 and NQO1. Moreover, the basic mechanism of propofol action involves its interaction with an ionotropic receptor GABAA inhibiting transfer of nerve impulses. Molecular studies have shown that polymorphic changes in GABRG2 receptor gene turn out to be important in the propofol anaesthesia.Planning of optimal anaesthesia can be considerably assisted by the determination of genetic factors of prognostic value taking advantage of genotyping and making it possible to select anaesthetics and reduce risk of side effects as well as undesirable actions.",

     "abstract": "Obesity and asthma are both important public health issues. Increasing number of studies suggest the association between obesity and asthma which may be causal or accidental. The studies on animal models show innate enhancement of airway hyper-responsiveness which suggest that chronic airway hyper-responsiveness may be related to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation occurring in obesity. These results are confirmed by studies on asthmatic patients which show that levels of inflammation markers were higher in obese asthma patients and are related to the parameters of obesity. However, adipokines secreted by adipose tissue have also been involved in the regulation of inflammation and allergic responses, and suggested to affect the risk of asthma, especially in obese female patients. The studies on the association between adiposity and atopy have conflicting results and the issue needs to be investigated in the future. Obesity also decreases lung volume and increases airway resistance inducing symptoms that could mimic asthma. Clinical studies suggest that asthma in obese subjects may differ from the classical phenotype of the disease. Obese patients referred for asthma exacerbation present a reduced response to standard asthma medications.The review indicates that mechanical and inflammatory effects of obesity may explain the influence on asthma. Further studies on the association between adiposity and atopy on airway inflammation may confirm the active role of fat tissue, not only simple mechanical impairment of the thorax movement. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the association between asthma, and obesity, which may open new therapeutic options for asthma treatment in obese patients.",

Two hundred twelve children (72.9%) outgrew their allergy to cow's milk at a mean age of 5 years after an average time of 16.4\u00b10.8 months on an elimination diet. Eighty percent of children below 3 years of age became milk tolerant. Milk-specific IgE (p=0.018) and history of paternal bronchial asthma and/or rhinitis (p=0.020) were associated with persistence of cow's milk allergy in regression analysis.An age above 3 years, as well as features of atopy, individual and familial, may be associated with a risk of delayed tolerance to milk in children.",

     "abstract": "Graves' disease (GD) is an organ-specific autoimmune thyroid disease, characterized by hyperthyroidism due to excessive production of thyroid hormone induced by thyrotropin receptor-specific stimulatory autoantibodies. In this study, we determined serum levels of the soluble forms of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, vWF, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, fibrinogen and CRP in patients with subclinical (SH) and overt hyperthyroidism (OH) caused by GD to elucidate a possible role of those parameters as markers of endothelium dysfunction (ED).The study included 96 patients: 52 with GD and 44 euthyroid controls, divided into 3 groups according to their thyroid function tests: SH, OH and controls (CG).The values of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-18 were significantly higher in GD than in CG patients (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001; p < 0.00001, respectively). Significant difference of sVCAM-1 values were found in the patients with GD compared to CG (p < 0.0001). Patients with GD had significantly higher levels of PAI-1 (p < 0.00001), vWF (p < 0.0001), fibrinogen (p < 0.0001) in comparison to CG. In patients with OH, we observed statistically higher values of fibrinogen compared to SH group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in serum concentration of other study parameters in patients with SH compared to the OH.ED occurs during subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism causing decreased fibrinolytic activity, hypercoagulability and increased levels of IL-6, Il-12 and IL-18. These results support the notion that serum cytokines could be used as a marker of GD activity. Results of this study support the opinion that GD might require treatment as early as in the phase of SH.",

Intensification of physical activity performed as part of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) increases the HRR60 value in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. In this context, the impact of endurance training intensity (ETI) on change in HRR60 intensity seems to be an interesting issue.The study group consisted of 251 patients who were subjected to a CR cycle. 45 patients of this group participated in CR twice. The control group consisted of 35 patients who were not subjected to any CR. ETI was estimated by the training work. In all patients an exertion test on a treadmill was performed twice within six months, analyzing the initial and final HRR60 value and \u0394HRR60.After a six-month observation, there was a statistically significant increase in the HRR60 value (17.98\u00b18.33/min vs. 22.72\u00b17.72/min, p<0.01) in the test group, which was not observed in the control group. Mean \u0394HRR60 value in the test group was statistically significantly greater than in the control group. In the subgroup subjected to the two CR cycles, only the first cycle led to a statistically significant increase in the mean HRR60 value.A six-month CR cycle significantly increased the HRR60 value, while cardiac training intensity did not affect the exertion-evoked change in its intensity. Continuation of the CR cycle beyond 6 months no longer significantly affected the change in the HRR60 value.",

Concurrent administration of DOX and PTX increased SOD activity and TBARS, decreased the amount of low molecular weight and total thiols, but did not cause any changes in the activity of catalase. Combination of DOX and DTX induced similar changes except for the activity of catalase, which decreased after the treatment. Of the three drugs only DTX significantly decreased the activity of SOD. However, both taxanes increased the activity of catalase. Although a decrease in concentration of \u2013SH groups, depletion of glutathione and an increase of TBARS were observed after treatment with single drugs, the changes were not statistically significant.Concurrent administration of DOX and taxane induced enhanced oxidative stress in comparison to single drugs, which suggests their synergistic prooxidant mode of action in liver.",

Eighteen SSc patients were subsequently followed for at least three years or until death whichever happened earlier. Disease progression was defined as death due to SSc-related organ complication, development of a new or progression of pre-existing SSc-related organ involvement.PBMC from SSc patients released significantly greater amounts of sCD163 as compared with HC (p<0.05). No significant associations between release of sCD163 by PBMC and baseline clinical or laboratory parameters of the disease could be found.

     "abstract": "Melatonin (MEL) is an effective antioxidant in numerous experimental models, both in vitro and in vivo. However, it should be stressed that there are also papers reporting limited antioxidative activity of MEL or even giving evidence for its pro-oxidative properties. In the present paper we investigated the influence of MEL on the oxidative damage of human erythrocytes during prolonged incubation.Human erythrocytes suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 were incubated at 37\u00b0C either in absence or presence of melatonin at concentration range 0.02 mM\u20133 mM for up to 96 hrs. The influence of MEL on erythrocyte damage was assessed on the basis of the intensity of intracellular oxidation processes (the oxidation of HbO2, GSH, fluorescent label DCFH2) as well as damage to the plasma membrane (lipid peroxidation, the potassium leakage) and the kinetics of hemolysis.The prolonged incubation of erythrocytes induced a progressive destruction of erythrocytes. Melatonin prevented lipid peroxidation and hemolysis whereas the oxidation of HbO2 and DCFH2 was enhanced by melatonin at concentrations higher than 0.6 mM. In the case of erythrocytes incubated with 3 mM of MEL, the hemolysis rate constant (0.0498\u00b10.0039 H%\u2022h\u22121) was 50% lower than that of the control while the HbO2 oxidation rate constants were about 1.4 and 1.5 times higher for 1.5 and 3 mM of MEL, respectively. Melatonin had no influence on the oxidation of GSH and the potassium leakage.Probably, MEL can stabilize the erythrocyte membrane due to interaction with lipids, thus prolonging the existence of cells. On the contrary, in the presence of MEL the accelerated oxidation of HbO2 and generally, increased oxidative stress was observed in erythrocytes. Pro- and antioxidative properties of melatonin depend on the type of cells, redox state, as well as experimental conditions.",

The effect of EPO dose on plasma VEGF-A level in hemodialysis (HD) patients was evaluated. The effect of EPO dose on plasma angiogenin level in HD patients was also evaluated, since angiogenin is necessary for angiogenesis induced by VEGF-A.Thirty two HD patients (10 diabetics) enrolled into the study. Patients were iron replete and did not suffer from infections, autoimmune diseases or malignancies. Plasma VEGF-A and angiogenin, as well as serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were measured by means of ELISA.Weekly EPO dose per kg of dry body weight was positively related to both VEGF-A and angiogenin, whereas no relation was detected among VEGF-A or angiogenin and hemoglobin, inflammation or presence of diabetes mellitus. These relations among EPO dose and VEGF-A or angiogenin remained after adjustment for hemoglobin concentration or inflammation or presence of diabetes mellitus.EPO dose may affect plasma VEGF-A and angiogenin concentrations in HD patients.",

The expression of genes for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cathepsin G was quantified by RT-PCR. The association of Mtb strains with Rab5 and Rab7 positive vacuoles was investigated applying confocal microscopy. IL-10 and IL-12 secretion by monocytes as well as the Mtb susceptibility to cathepsin G were investigated.Mutation-carried and wild type Mtb strains inhibited MHC class II expression on monocytes to a similar extent. Monocyte stimulation with mycobacteria led to the increased production of IL-10 but no detectable amounts of IL-12 or NO were observed. Expression of the gene for iNOS was not detected while that for cathepsin G was shown, however its intensity was not associated with MtrA mutation. Mtb mutant strains were more effectively enclosed in phagosomes containing the late endosome marker Rab7 as compared to the control.The results may confirm the importance of the MtrAB system in mycobacterial capacity for successful survival in phagocytes, especially in the context of high degree of colocalization of Mtb Rv-78 to mature phagosomes.",

In the early stage of this process, the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells is supported by an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) in endothelial cells. However, the main source of Ca2+ has been unclear. In this study, the changes in ionic transmittance and [Ca2+]i due to the adhesion of monocytes were continuously measured by an electrophysiological technique and fluorescent imaging. Especially, we focused on transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV1) as a Ca2+ channel that could influence the adhesion of monocytes.Whole-cell current was continuously recorded in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by a patch electrode.The adhesion of monocytes (THP-1) induced a transient inward current in HUVECs, as well as an elevation of [Ca2+]i. This inward element was abolished by the application of 100nM SB366,791, a selective antagonist of TRPV1 channel. Furthermore, SB366,791 significantly decreased the number of THP-1 cells that adhered to HUVECs (control: 231 \u00b1 38, SB366,791: 96 \u00b1 16 cells/mm2).These results suggest that an inward calcium current via the TRPV1 channels of endothelial cells correlates with a stronger adhesion between monocytes and endothelial cells.",

A factor which increases the risk of thrombosis is hyperhomocysteinemia, observed in patients with hypercortisolemia. Proinflammatory factors also affect the haemostatic balance. There has been an extensive research which estimates hemostatic system in patients with Cushing's syndrome. Undoubtedly, much fewer publications are available on thromboembolic complications in patients with Subclinical Cushing's Syndrome (SCS). The purpose of this study was to estimate of homocysteine (HCY) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (\u03b11ATp) concentrations in patients with SCS.We studied 35 patients (56.0 \u00b1 15.0 years) with SCS and 33 healthy volunteers (53.3 \u00b1 17.7 years). In all subjects the analysis of HCY and \u03b11ATp concentration in serum was determined with an immunonephelometric method. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.A comparison of HCY and \u03b11ATp mean concentrations in patients with SCS and healthy representatives indicated statistically higher values of both analysed parameters in the sera of patients than in the healthy controls (p values were 0.018 and 0.008, respectively). In the patients with SCS a negative correlation between \u03b11ATp and cortisol concentration in overnight dexamethasone test was found (p=0.017, R=\u20130.40). We did not reveal any statistically significant correlation between the concentrations of HCY and \u03b11ATp, and coagulation parameters such as INR, APTT, fibrinogen concentration in patients with SCS.On the basis of the obtained results, a slight increase in the concentration of homocysteine and \u03b11ATp is observed in patients with SCS, which may influence vascular complications.",

Previous reports have focused mainly on olfactory, reproductive, and some other features such as cleft lip/palate and dental agenesis. Given the ubiquitous expression of FGFR1 during development, other abnormal phenotypes might, however, have been overlooked in these patients. Here, we demonstrate skeletal phenotypic characterization of patients presented with KS and FGFR1 mutations.Using the Sanger DNA sequencing technique a cohort of 29 KS patients was screened.Here, we report on 5 KS patients who carry FGFR1 mutations (Gly270Asp, Gly97Ser, Met161Thr, Ser685Phe and Ala167Ser/Ala167Ser). Three patients presented with skeletal abnormalities, i.e. spine (hemivertebra and butterfly vertebra) and limb (oligodactyly of the feet, fusion of the 4th and 5th metacarpal bones) malformations in two patients and one patient, respectively. The hand phenotype found in the patient cannot be thought of as a counter-type of the hand phenotype resulting from FGFR1 gain-of-function mutations. The skeletal anomalies identified in the 3 KS patients are close to those observed in Fgfr1 conditional knockout mice.This study demonstrates that FGFR1 loss-of-function mutations can be associated with skeletal abnormalities also in humans. Further investigations in KS patients who carry FGFR1 mutations are needed to evaluate the prevalence of skeletal defects in this genetic form of KS. Conversely, the presence of bone malformations in a KS patient should direct the geneticist towards a search for mutations in FGFR1.",

Moreover, SDF-1 alpha is crucial in neoangiogenesis and in the mobilization and homing of endothelial progenitor cells to the ischemic coronary vessels. Numerous studies indicate that circulating sex hormones are associated with atherogenesis during male aging. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether there exists a relationship between SDF-1 alpha and endogenous sex hormones in aging men with stable coronary artery disease (CAD).Plasma concentrations of SDF-1 alpha, testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured and the E2/T ratio was calculated in a cross-sectional study of 82 men over 50 years of age with stable CAD.SDF-1 alpha was positively and significantly correlated with T (r = 0.233; p = 0.036) and with SHBG (r = 0.312; p = 0.004). There was a significant inverse correlation between SDF-1 alpha and the E2/T ratio (r = -0.463; p < 0.001). After adjustment for age, body mass index and smoking status, SHBG and E2/T ratio were the only factors associated with SDF-1 alpha.T and SHBG (directly) and the E2/T ratio (inversely) may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of CAD through their relationships to SDF-1 alpha.",

Demographics, established risk factors, myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) perfusion, index event data and MTWA were assessed. Composite cardiac events (CCE) defined as: death, recurrent MI, sustained ventricular tachycardia (sVT) or readmission for acute heart failure (HF) were recorded during follow-up.MTWA test was negative in 76, positive in 18 and undetermined in 7 patients. MTWA negative patients had significantly higher LVEF at 30 days. At 4 years, 26 patients experienced CCE (10 died, 2 reinfarcted and 14 HF events). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model maximum CKMB, non-negative MTWA and reduced LVEF made the best model to predict CCE. Four year CCE free survival was 77% and was significantly lower for non-negative MTWA (94% vs 50%, p<0.003).Non-negative MTWA with infarct size index and reduced LVEF could predict cardiac events in patients with anterior STEMI treated with primary PCI.

We studied by microarray analysis whether intact tissue and carotid plaque from the same patient differ in transcriptional profiling in response to arterial calcification.mRNA gene expression was measured by an Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using RNA prepared from 68 specimens of endarterectomy from 34 patients.Integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP) was found to be differentially expressed. IBSP mRNA is over expressed in atheroma plaque (3.74 fold, p = 1.41E-09) in an intraindividual comparison. Besides, Carbonic anhydrase II (CA2) which known to be a putative calcification inhibitory molecule is over expressed more than 1.7 fold in carotid plaque (p = 1.26E-06).Although further evidence is needed, our results support previously available data. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing gene expression between intact arterial tissue and carotid plaque using microarray analysis in order to identify calcification related genes.

In the neonatal period the greatest changes in brain oxygenation occurred in the right and left frontal regions of the brain. In preterm neonates constant values of HbO2 and Ox were observed in the first 28 days of life. In preterm newborn infants, as well as in full term newborn infants, similar Ox and HbO2 values were obtained on day 28 of life.NIRS is a safe method and can be used to evaluate brain oxygenation in newborn infants.

The collected data was analysed retrospectively.In the case histories of the forestry employees erythema migrans, polyneuropathy and large joint arthritis were mentioned in 128 (7.7%), 192 (11.5%), and 93 (5.6%) workers, respectively.

The frequency of seropositivity increased with age, number of registered tick bites, and erythema migrans in case history, as well as arthralgia. The frequency of polyneuropathy was somewhat more closely corresponding with age than seropositivity. Women gave account of a smaller number of tick bites, and were less likely seropositive while fewer of them were symptom-free. Since the 45% of seropositive forestry workers were symptom-free and they could not recall any symptoms suggestive for present or past Lyme borreliosis, the positive predictive value of Borrelia antibody testing in this high-risk group is surprisingly low, less than 5%.Positive Borrelia antibody test result may be especially misleading in a high-risk population.",

Purified genomic DNA was used with specific primers to amplify a fragment of the Babesia spp. 18S rRNA gene.Tick-drag indices for I. ricinus were high in both study areas, reaching somewhat higher values in Urwita\u0142t than in Biela\u0144ski Forest. The overall prevalence of Babesia spp. in examined ticks was 1.6%.

The cytotoxicity of the adhesives was assessed on the basis of a test of cell viability in a culture of human gingival fibroblasts, with the use of tetrazolic salt (MTT assay).The results showed that, among the adhesive/bonding systems tested, Xeno V was the least cytotoxic. There were statistically significant differences in cell survival between polymerized Xeno V, Adper Single Bond 2 and Heliobond in the amount of 5 \u03bcL as well as between the Xeno V and Adper Single Bond 2 in 10\u22125 dilutions. The tested adhesives were more toxic in the polymerized form than in the dilutions. Samples of 10 \u03bcL resulted in a lower survival percentage of fibroblasts compared to 5 \u03bcL.All the tested adhesives demonstrated cytopathic effects towards human gingival fibroblasts, but varied in their cytotoxicity. This has clinical implications. Dentists should follow the rules of adhesive application, precisely dose them and not allow direct contact with the gums as, even after polymerization, adhesive agents exhibit potential cytotoxic activity.",

Several groups of investigators employing i) various isolation protocols, ii) detection of surface markers, and iii) experimental in vitro and in vivo models, have reported the presence of cells that possess a pluripotent character in adult tissues. Such cells were assigned various operational abbreviations and names in the literature that added confusion to the field and raised the basic question of whether these are truly distinct or overlapping populations of the same primitive stem cells. Unfortunately, these cells were never characterized side-by-side to address this important issue. Nevertheless, taking into consideration their common features described in the literature, it is very likely that various investigators have described overlapping populations of developmentally early stem cells that are closely related. These different populations of stem cells will be reviewed in this paper.",

All of them depend on the cellular and molecular interactions called by neurobiologists \u201ccellular plasticity\u201d. The CNS is a flexible structure but its regeneration after damage is strongly limited. Better understanding of cellular and molecular basis of brain repair can open new way in the development of therapeutic tools for neurodegeneration. Among many molecules that participate in the formation of neuronal networks, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and its sialylated derivative seem to play crucial role in the life of brain. In particular, polysialylated cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is proposed to participate in the neuroprotective response in neurodegeneration by reducing of AMPA/NMDA receptors sensitivity to glutamate and facilitating disconnection of cell-cell interactions. These mechanisms protect from excitotoxic damage and promote dendritic/spine re-growth. This review briefly focuses on the expression and role of PSA-NCAM in neurodegenerative diseases and its potential application in therapy.",

     "abstract": "In mammalian testes, aromatase irreversibly converts androgens (C19 steroid) into estrogens (C18) and is present in the endoplasmic reticulum of numerous tissues. In purified adult rat germ cells (pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids) we have shown the presence of a functional aromatase (transcript, protein and biological activity) and the estrogen production is roughly identical to that of Leydig cells. In addition, transcripts of aromatase varied according to the germ cell type and the stages of seminiferous epithelium in an adult rat. In contrast with the androgen receptors mainly localized in somatic cells, estrogen receptors (ERs) are described in all testicular cells. Moreover, besides the presence of high affinity ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 a rapid membrane effects have been recently reported and we demonstrated that GPR30 (a transmembrane intracellular estrogen receptor) was expressed in adult rat pachytene spermatocytes and in round spermatids. Thus estrogens through both GPR30 and genomic effects are able to activate the rapid signaling cascade, which in turn triggers an apoptotic mitochondrial pathway (via an increase in Bax expression) and a concomitant decrease of cyclin A1 and B1 gene levels as well as in controlling apoptosis and maturation/differentiation of round spermatids. Hence, the role of estrogen (either intracrine, paracrine or autocrine) in spermatogenesis (proliferation, apoptosis, survival and maturation) is now obvious taking into account the simultaneous presence of a biologically active aromatase and the widespread distribution of estrogen receptors especially during the spermiogenesis steps.",

This method is founded on the basis of transcript individualized primers and probes, which were designed to detect specifically the different variants in both frozen and FFPE tissues.Our results show that the method is highly specific, sensitive, and superior to the widely used nested PCR approach, and is accurately able to differentiate the most common variants, as well as quantify copy numbers. Primer amplification and probe detection of FUS-CHOP from genomic DNA of human, mouse, cocker spaniel and chicken sources all resulted in completely negative results indicating this technique is specific for human RNA derived transcripts.This new method offers an additional tool in the investigation of liposarcoma that may impact considerably on missed diagnosis and it's accompanying clinical ramifications.",

Another group of mice from both genotypes received a three-day isoproterenol treatment (20 mg/kg every 8h). Activation of STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways were assessed after a single dose of isoproterenol by means of western blotting.After injection of placebo a significantly lower level of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in IL-6 KO animals. This difference was abolished after isoproterenol both at 1 and 24-hour time points. Isoproterenol produced potent and rapid activation of both STAT3 and MEK/ERK pathways that returned to the levels of placebo treated controls after 24 hours. Lack of IL-6 did not affect phosphorylation of ERKs. Three-day treatment with isoproterenol caused significant increase of indices of RV and LV hypertrophy in both WT and IL-6 KO animals with no significant differences between genotypes.IL-6 is not necessary for isoproterenol induced STAT3 phosphorylation, but may affect activation of this pathway by mild non-specific stimuli.

The aim of the present study was to examine plasma concentrations of major sphingolipids in patients with chronic heart failure (HF).The subjects were divided into two major groups: 1) with chronic systolic HF (n=47), and 2) healthy age-matched controls (n=15). Patients in the former group were further divided according to the underlying cause of HF (ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, n=29 and 18, respectively).Plasma concentrations of S1P, sphinganine-1-phosphate and ceramide observed in both groups of HF patients were very close to these noted in the healthy controls, and no statistically significant differences were found. However, the level of free sphingosine and sphinganine in the plasma of patients with HF decreased by 25 and 27%, respectively, as compared to the control subjects. This effect was independent from the underlying cause of HF as the mean concentrations of these sphingoid bases in patients with ischemic and idiopathic HF were virtually the same.We conclude that chronic heart failure is associated with decreased concentration of free sphingoid bases in the plasma. However, despite lower availability of substrates required for synthesis of cardioprotective sphingoid base-1 phosphates, their plasma level remains stable.",

IMT measurements may help to select high risk patients and evaluate the efficacy of the therapy used.The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of ultrasonographic measurement of IMT in atherosclerosis progress monitoring in patients after myocardial infarction (MI).70 men (mean age 52.8 \u00b1 8.4) treated with PCI due to acute myocardial infarction, were enrolled in the study. All subjects underwent ultrasound examination of the IMT complex of: common carotid artery (CCA), carotid bulb and common femoral artery (CFA) during hospitalization and follow-up period (3.83 \u00b1 1.29 years).During the follow-up 3 patients (4.3%) were not on any medications, 8 pts (11.4%) were on reduced doses of \u03b2-blocker, statin or ACE-I (non-compliant pts.). The others (compliant) \u2013 59 pts (84.3%) received standard pharmacological treatment after MI. Nevertheless, an increase of IMT complex value after follow-up compared to initial IMT values of all examined peripheral arteries was observed (respectively: IMT CCA \u2013 0.91\u00b10.26 vs 1.10\u00b10.36, p=0.002, IMT of carotid bulb \u2013 1.31\u00b10.55 vs 1.82\u00b10.69, p=0.012, IMT CFA \u2013 1.38\u00b10.64 vs 1.97\u00b10.75, p=0.014). Non-compliant patients had statistically significant higher IMT values after follow-up when compared to compliant subjects (1.62 vs 1.20, p= 0.017). Patients with higher IMT values were reported to have cardiac events more frequently during the follow-up (p<0.05).Our results provide evidence that ultrasonographic IMT complex assessment of peripheral arteries in everyday clinical practice allows monitoring efficacy of pharmacological therapy in CAD patients after MI. They also suggest treatment intensification if necessary.",

The cohort was divided into two groups depending on the administered ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. Conditioning regimens did not differ significantly among the groups. Multiple myeloma was the main indication for ASCT in both groups.Ciprofloxacin prophylaxis resulted in a statistically significant reduction of duration of intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment in the group with prophylaxis (p=0.01). The trend has been observed towards lower prevalence of infectious episodes in the prophylaxis group. Positive blood cultures were similar in both groups with no significant resistance to ciprofloxacin.These data demonstrate that ciprofloxacin prophylaxis is beneficial for patients treated with ASCT following high dose chemotherapy regimen, in terms of the intravenous antibiotics usage. This advantage directly translates into economic benefit and may also induce less bacterial resistance due to less exposure to antibiotics.",

In the investigated group, the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 concentrations in the CSF samples collected on the day of admission were assessed. Furthermore, the NO concentrations were assessed in 23 patients.The results revealed that the measurement of proinflammatory cytokines in CSF can aid in a differential diagnosis. In particular, a high concentration of TNF-\u03b1 may be a sensitive and specific marker of a bacterial aetiology of the neuroinfection. In the present study, TNF-\u03b1 concentrations greater than 75.8 pg/ml differentiated between bacterial and viral meningitis with 100% sensitivity and specificity. The NO concentration in the CSF was also significantly greater in patients with bacterial meningitis than in those with viral meningitis.The assessment of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 concentrations in the CSF is useful in the differential diagnosis of neuroinfection. Because many factors may influence NO production in the central nervous system (CNS), it is not clear whether NO values can be used for the differential diagnosis of meningitis, and further studies are required",

Real advances in CP management can be expected once the pathophysiology of the disease is elucidated and individual stages of its development are properly managed. A key role in the CP pathogenesis is played by activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) that cooperate with the remaining pancreatic cells. All these cells produce cytokines, growth factors, angiotensin and other substances, which paracrinally or autocrinally induce further, persistent activation of PSCs. The activated PSCs are capable of producing and modifying the extracellular matrix. An optimal therapeutic preparation should exert beneficial effects on all the above-mentioned phenomena observed in CP. The most promising treatment modalities include blocking of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-\u03b3), influence on the remaining PSC signaling pathways, blocking of substances produced by activated PSCs, and antioxidants. The findings of many recent experimental studies are highly encouraging; however, their efficacy should be confirmed in well-designed clinical trials.",

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the ultrastructure of the population of liver progenitor/oval cells in the biopsy material from children with previously clinocopathologically diagnosed NASH.Electron-microscopic examinations were conducted on fresh tissue samples collected from 10 children with NASH (aged 2\u201314 years), which were fixed with a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer.Ultrastructural examinations of the liver progenitor/oval cells in children with NASH show a quite prominent number of these cells, especially their two types, hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) and intermediate hepatocyte-like cells (IHCs), with intermediate bile-like cells being the least frequent. They were found to occur single or in clusters of two, seldom of three, and frequently in the areas of advanced liver fibrosis or close to them. Many times, these cells were accompanied by hepatocytes showing a varying degree of death, to total cell disintegration. Interesting was the presence of activated nonparenchymal liver cells, i.e. Kupffer cells/macrophages and hepatic stellate cells, frequently found to adhere to the hepatic oval cells.The current study suggests a marked involvement of the population of liver progenitor/oval cells, mainly HPCs and IHCs, in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in pediatric patients, especially in fibrosis progression.",

The aim of the study was to assess lipid and carbohydrate parameters in children with chronic HCV-related hepatitis.The study comprised 41 children with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) aged between 7 and 18 years, and 30 healthy controls. The anthropometric measurements of the subjects were taken, and, after overnight fasting, serum glucose, insulin, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels were investigated. The HOMA IR insulin resistance index was also calculated.The values for mean body mass index (BMI), glucose, insulin, bilirubin, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL/C index and HOMA IR levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. AST and ALT were significantly higher in the control group. The serum levels of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol showed a tendency toward lower values in the control group. We found positive correlation between serum levels of insulin and HOMA IR with staging (respectively r=0.336, P < 0.04 and r=0.386, P < 0.02).In children with CHC and a relatively short duration of the disease, lipid and glucose disorders are not observed. Correlations between insulin and HOMA IR with staging suggest the ability of HCV to contribute to fibrosis through interference with glucose metabolism.",

Regression analysis with IGF-1 as a dependent parameter showed that only BMI and insulin remained as predictors, explaining 32% of plasma IGF-1 variation. Re-evaluation after delivery revealed impaired glucose tolerance in 9% of the population studied.Increased IGF-1 concentrations in pregnancy complicated with GDM may partly reflect metabolic disturbances, especially insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and may be one of possible compensatory reactions of the organism in response to these disturbances.",

Since 2009 routine radial approach has been introduced for both coronary angiography and angioplasty. In patients with symptoms suggesting entry site complications Doppler ultrasound was performed.Femoral access site complications requiring additional procedures were observed in 63 patients (3.4%): in 56 femoral pseudoaneurysms (88.8%) and in 7 arteriovenous fistulas (11.1%) were diagnosed (all appeared after coronary angioplasty). The patients were treated in following ways: standard compression with an elastic bandage prolonged to 12 hours - in 14 cases (25%), ultrasound guided compression - in 13 patients (23.2%), finger compression followed by standard compression with an elastic bandage prolonged to 12 hours or ice compress - in 10 patients (17.8%), surgical treatment - in 3 patients (5.3%). Only 2 patients required thrombin injection (3.6%). Since the time routine radial approach was introduced extreme reduction in the rate of local complications was registered.Although iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysms following invasive percutaneous coronary interventions are still important complications, most of them can be treated conservatively.

We proved that overweight and obesity did not result in significantly greater damage to the myocardium and left ventricular dysfunction, both in the acute phase and 6 months after myocardial infarction treated with primary coronary intervention, as compared to those with normal body weight.

The cells with EGFR mutation were more sensitive than those with EGFR wild-type, except PC9/AB2 cells. LY294002 and U0126 can inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis in all five cell lines. The sensitivity to gefitinib was restored partially in the resistant cell lines by combining gefitinib with LY294002 or U0126. The effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis were stronger in cells with EGFR mutation when PI3K/AKT pathway was blocked, however, for cells with EGFR wild-type, the effects were stronger when the MEK pathway was blocked. When the PI3K and MEK pathways were blocked together, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis level in NSCLC cells was similar to that in cells treated with EGFR TKI. There were some differences according to EGFR mutation type, suggesting that EGFR mutations may result in alterations of downstream signaling pathways.The sensitivity of gefitinib resistant cell lines can be restored partially when the two downstream signaling pathways are blocked. However, these cells were still drug resistant, suggesting that the activation of PI3K and MEK pathways is not the only mechanism of EGFR-resistance.",

The impact of various factors as well as the impact of different chemotherapy regimens on survival was evaluated.The overall survival of breast cancer patients was 97.0% (95% CI 90.9\u201399.0), 84.9% (95% CI 76.1\u201390.6) and 66.5% (95% CI 55.5\u201375.3) 10, 30 and 60 months after diagnosis, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the following were significant risk factors for breast cancer patients survival: patient's age, stage of disease, tumour size, lymph node status, type of surgery and chemotherapy. Better survival was related to younger patients\u2019 age, smaller tumour size, lower stage of disease, no lymph nodes involvement. Survival rates were higher among patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and underwent quadrantectomy. In the multivariate statistical analysis the significant independent prognostic variables influencing survival were lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy. Survival rates of the patients, who received adjuvant anthracycline containing chemotherapy were higher, than those in non-anthracycline containing treatment group, but the difference was not statistically significant.Patients who had lymph node status N2\u20133 and those who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy showed worse prognosis and survival than other patients. The impact of chemotherapy type (anthracycline containing or non-anthracycline containing) on patients survival was not statistically significant.",

A diagnostic value of cervical and abdominal US in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value after a neoadjuvant treatment were determined.The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the US assessment of cervical lymph node metastases were 100%, 96%, 81% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the US assessment of abdominal lymph node metastases were 82%, 94%, 91.5% and 87%, respectively.The high sensitivity and specificity of cervical US make this investigational method sufficient in the assessment of cervical nodal involvement. In esophageal cancer patients with negative cervical lymph nodes on US, three-field lymph node dissection could be avoided. In patients with positive cervical lymph nodes on US one should consider to extend lymph node dissection about lymph nodes of the neck to achieve a curative resection. In patients with negative abdominal US this investigation should be supplemented by more detailed diagnostic methods.",

The presence of vanA \u2013 vanG resistance and virulence genes (agg, esp, gelE and cylA, cylB, cylM) was investigated using PCR. The ability to form biofilm and the activity of gelatinase, hemolysins, lipase and DNase were tested.All the GRE strains were susceptible to linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline and resistant to norfloxacin. In the Enterococcus faecium group, 17 strains carried the vanA gene and 20 the vanB gene. In the Enterococcu faecalis group, 4 strains carried the vanA gene and 1 the vanB gene. There were differences in tetracycline susceptibility between the VanA (70%) and the VanB (55%) phenotypes. Only linezolid had high activity against both the VanA and the VanB phenotypes. The esp gene was present in most of the GRE strains, but only 3 E. faecalis strains produced biofilm. Lipase was produced by 10/42 examined strains, gelatinase by 4/42 and hemolysin by 3/42 isolates.Linezolid seems to be the optimal option in empirical therapy of infections caused by GRE strains because of the relationship between its activity (MIC value) and susceptibility breakpoint.

     "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, of which Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are subtypes. Our goal is: 1) to determine whether a diagnostic model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), brain regional thickness measurements, or brain regional volume measurements can distinguish Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism; and 2) to compare the SNP, thickness, and volume-based diagnostic models.Our study included 18 children with ASD: 13 subjects with high-functioning autism and 5 subjects with Asperger syndrome. For each child, we obtained 25 SNPs for 8 ASD-related genes; we also computed regional cortical thicknesses and volumes for 66 brain structures, based on structural magnetic resonance (MR) examination. To generate diagnostic models, we employed five machine-learning techniques: decision stump, alternating decision trees, multi-class alternating decision trees, logistic model trees, and support vector machines.For SNP-based classification, three decision-tree-based models performed better than the other two machine-learning models. The performance metrics for three decision-tree-based models were similar: decision stump was modestly better than the other two methods, with accuracy = 90%, sensitivity = 0.95 and specificity = 0.75. All thickness and volume-based diagnostic models performed poorly. The SNP-based diagnostic models were superior to those based on thickness and volume. For SNP-based classification, rs878960 in GABRB3 (gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, beta 3) was selected by all tree-based models.Our analysis demonstrated that SNP-based classification was more accurate than morphometry-based classification in ASD subtype classification. Also, we found that one SNP\u2014rs878960 in GABRB3\u2014distinguishes Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism.",

The diagnosis of dysphonia was based on the Voice Rating Scale GRBAS, and endoscopic and stroboscopic assessment of the vocal folds. Acoustic assessment was carried out using following parameters: fundamental frequency, Jitter, Shimmer, Noise to Harmonic Rate and Yanagihara (YG) scale. In order to evaluate the morphology of the vocal fold mucosa transmission electron microscopy was performed using postoperative material obtained from the larynx. Results of clinical and morphological analysis were compared with the reference group. The morphological material was obtained from patients with hypopharyngeal cancer without pathological changes of the vocal folds.The psychoacoustic assessment using the perceptual GRBAS scale enables the appropriate diagnostics of hyperfunctional dysphonia, which was confirmed by evaluation of acoustic parameters and YG scale analysis. In 40 patients with voice quality disorders causing by hyperfunctional dysphonia, in morphological assessment of the laryngeal mucosa, 4 (10%) patients demonstrated the presence of oedema and signs of intensive dysphonia in psychoacoustic and stroboscopic examination.Oedema of the laryngeal mucosa confirmed by stroboscopic and ultramorphological examination may coexist with hyperfunctional dysphonia. The presence of the laryngeal oedema in patients with hyperfunctional dysphonia has the negative impact on voice quality in psychoacoustic assessment with the use of the GRBAS and YG scales.",

Aim of study was to determine the risk factors for SC, NS, as well as for both entities (SC/NS) in geriatric inpatients reporting these events within the last year, irrespectively of the reason of admission to hospital.The retrospective study covered 250 patients, consecutively admitted to the geriatric ward. Patients were assigned to the three models: SC and/or NS in total, n=106; isolated NS, n=72; SC with co-existing NS, if any, n=34, and compared with patients without any such events (n=144). The patients underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment and complete clinical investigation. The binary logistic regression was applied to predict risk factors for each of the models.Falls were most predictive for NS model (OR 35.4; 95% CI 10.3-121.1), and systemic hypotension for SC model (OR 92.9; 95% CI 6.1-1421.0).

The SGA newborns were divided into two groups: those weighing less than the 5th centile: 35 infants (16 females and 19 males) and those between the 5th and 10th centiles: 26 infants (15 females and 11 males). Platelet indices were estimated in blood samples collected from the umbilical artery.SGA demonstrated a decreased count of blood platelets (238\u00d7103/\u03bc) as compared with AGA (286\u00d7103/\u00b5L), p=0.0001. Platelet hematocrit (PTC) also showed differences in both groups (SGA=0.19% vs. AGA=0.22%; p=0.0005). Mean platelet volume (MPV) was higher in SGA (8.25fl) as compared with AGA (7.84fl); p=0.008.

Therapy of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is based on the oral administration of pancreatic enzymes aiming at providing the duodenal lumen with sufficient amount of active lipase at the time of gastric emptying of nutrients. Administration of enzymes in form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres avoids acid-mediated lipase inactivation and ensures gastric emptying of enzymes in parallel with nutrients.

     "abstract": "The objective of the modern surgery is not only to perform surgical procedures aiming to improve the health condition of the patient, but whenever possible to use minimally invasive approach and to ensure the satisfying cosmetic result. During the last years we can observe an intense development of surgical technique minimizing the access to peritoneal cavity to just one small incision, most frequently localized in the umbilicus.Between October 2009 and May 2010 an overall number of 34 laparoscopic procedures through a single abdominal wall incision were performed at the 2nd Department of Surgery, Jagiellonian University, Medical College in Krakow. There were 28 women and 6 men in the study group ranging in age from 19 \u2013 76 years. Among indications for surgery there were: symptomatic gallbladder stones (21 patients), adrenal gland tumours (8 patients), ITP \u2013 Immune Thromocytopenic Purpura (2 patients), appendicitis (2 patients) and splenic cyst (one patient).There were 31 out of 34 procedures completed with pure Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) technique as intended preoperatively without any intraoperative complications. In 3 patients additional trocars were needed for safe continuation of the procedure. There were no intraoperative complications. The mean operating time was 82 minutes ranging from 25 minutes (appendectomy) to 180 minutes (right adrenalectomy). Mean intraoperative blood loss was 0 \u2013 30 ccm.SILS surgical procedures constitute the next step in the development of minimally invasive surgery. In the hands of experienced surgeon this particular technique may constitute a safe alternative for classical laparoscopy.",

Patients were asked to record the severity of their headache and the number of vomiting episodes on a visual analogue scale (VAS) on days 1, 2, 3 and 4. The pain scale consisted of a 10 cm horizontal line marked from 0 (denoting no pain) to 10 (denoting worst possible imaginable pain) Emesis was scored as 0 = no emetic symptoms, 1 = nausea or 2 = vomiting.Demographic and anesthetic variables were similar between the groups. Gabapentin group had less pain, nausea and vomiting compared to the Cafergot group. No patients withdrew, gabapentin and Cafergot were well tolerated, and adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, tremor, and ataxia) did not occur.Gabapentin significantly reduced pain, nausea and vomiting compared to Cafergot in patients with PDPH. Lastly, we hypothesize that the gabaergic action of gabapentin, perhaps combined with other mechanisms, such as calcium channel blockade, may be responsible for its remarkable effects on PDPH.",

The findings indicate that cancer cells obtain this protein already in the early stages of metastasizing. PRL-3 is present not only in metastases to local lymph nodes but also to distant organs. It is likely that PRL-3 protein takes part in the initiation of metastasizing of cancer cells. Also the presence of lymph and blood vessel invasion was found only to correlate with increased percentage of patients with strong PRL-3 expression in tumor buds (p=0.046).Our results may suggests the participation of PRL-3 protein as a marker of the presence of colorectal cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes and distant metastases, which is independent of parameters such as gender and age of the patients, tumor location, histological type and grade of histological malignancy and stage of tumor.",

The main object of the study was the determination of N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-hexosaminidase activity in women with GDM and 3 months postpartum in comparison with control groups of non-pregnant and healthy pregnant women.Twenty-five blood serum samples from women with GDM and women 3 months postpartum; 20 blood serum samples from non-pregnant and healthy pregnant women (control groups) were enrolled into the study. Serum was prepared from all blood samples and HEX activity was measured by the method of Chateriee et al. (modified by Zwierz et al).A statistically significantly increase in the activity of HEX in the GDM blood serum was found as compared to the control groups (p<0.05). Further analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in the activity of HEX among postpartum women, but the level of enzyme activity was still above the normal control level in comparison to the control group of nonpregnant healthy women (p<0.05).Changes in the activity of HEX appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus. Determination of HEX activity may have prognostic significance as an early indicator of diabetes mellitus among GDM women in the future.",

All children were invited to our clinic in order to analyze course of the allergy after period of minimum 5 years since diagnosis.The results of the study revealed that food tolerance was acquired by high percentage of examined children (87.9%) among 83 children with food allergy. However among 32 children with initial inhalant allergy there were still no food sensitizations. The frequency of this process increased with age of examined children. The study revealed that such factors as lack of family history of atopy, clinical manifestation limited to one system, lack of inhalant allergy, type of allergen, good social conditions, have positive impact on tolerance development.High percentage of children with food allergy is able to develop the status of food immunotolerance. Factors which predispose to development of food allergy have also negative impact on ability to acquiring tolerance to harmful food. The study indicates the need of constant and wide education about decreasing exposure to allergy predisposing factors which could increase chance of food tolerance development.",

Material/Methods: 6-hydroxydopamine was used to lesion dopamine terminals within the core and shell accumbens. Experiment 1 assessed conditioning to a tone conditioned stimulus that had previously been paired with footshock (unconditioned stimulus) at a 30s trace interval. Experiment 2 subsequently assessed contiguous conditioning (at 0s trace) using a light conditioned stimulus directly followed by the unconditioned stimulus.Both sham and shell-lesioned animals showed the normal trace effect of reduced conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus but 6-hydroxydopamine injections targeted on the core subregion of the nucleus accumbens abolished this effect and enhanced conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus. However, the depletion produced by this lesion placement extended to the shell. In Experiment 2 (at 0s trace), there was no effect of either lesion placement as all animals showed comparable levels of conditioning to the light conditioned stimulus. Neurochemical analysis across core, shell and comparison regions showed some effects on noradrenalin as well as dopamine.The pattern of changes in noradrenalin did not systematically relate to the observed behavioural changes after core injections. The pattern of changes in dopamine suggested that depletion in core mediated the increased conditioning to the trace conditioned stimulus seen in the present study. However, the comparison depletion restricted to the shell subregion was less substantial, and a role for secondarily affected brain regions cannot be excluded.",

Patients with the highest hs-CRP and NE concentrations had the highest systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values. Similar relation was found in subgroup of patients with suboptimal blood pressure values (SPB \u0142 130mmHg, DBP \u0142 80mmHg). In a group of optimal treated patients, elevated levels of ET-1 and NE related to increased blood pressure values.

     "abstract": "Calcium ions are vital in many biologic processes including a variety of enzymatic reactions, activation of excitable cells, coupling of electrical activation to cellular secretion, haemostasis, bone metabolism and sperm functions. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) appear to have a reversible anti-fertility effect on male rats which does not occur through inhibition of the pituitary-gonadal axis. While the effects of CCB on male reproductive function have been investigated, less information is available regarding other reproductive indices and the underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of male reproductive dysfunction. Therefore, the involvement of oxidative mechanisms in the adverse manifestation induced by CCB on male reproductive functions is investigated in this study.For this purpose, lipid peroxidation; enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reduced; epididymal sperm count, motility; histopathology of the testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle, prostate glands; and reproductive performance were determined.CCB administration in rats causes significant oxidative stress in the male reproductive milieu in term of increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level and a concomitant decrease in catalase, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione enzyme activities in the testes. In addition, CCB treatment significantly decreased the sperm count, sperm motility, fertility index, implantation count, and litter size in this study.There is substantial evidence that CCB induces significant oxidative stress in the testes, which appears to be responsible for the adverse effects of decreased sperm count and motility ultimately leading to reduced fertility in rats.",

Ischemic strokes are more common in younger children while hemorrhagic strokes are more frequent in adults. The goal of neuroimaging in acute stroke is to document whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, to assess the extent of parenchymal abnormalities and to determine the presence of other cerebrovascular lesions. Computed Tomography (CT) is the primary modality for the assessment of acute stroke patients because of its 24/7 availability and ability to exclude hemorrhagic causes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA) are recommended to determine precisely extent of infarction and detect cerebrovascular abnormalities. The goal of neuroimaging in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is to identify an arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm(s) amenable to surgery or catheter intervention.The risk of first stroke is very high in asymptomatic children with intracranial arterial mean velocities over 200 cm/s on transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination. The risk can be substantially reduced if chronic blood transfusions are timely implemented. Large cerebral vessel disease detected by TCD can be confirmed or excluded by MRI/MRA. Those with evidence of parenchymal and/or cerebrovascular lesions should be followed by preventive therapy. In patients with neurologic symptoms and negative MRI/MRA findings Positron Emission Tomography or single photon emission CT is recommended. There are no specific neuroimaging findings that suggest that blood transfusions can be safely halted in children with SCD.",

Almost all patients presenting with chronic hyperamylasemia undergo expensive, long, difficult, and often unnecessarily repeated diagnostic procedures. This is in conjunction with the poor knowledge of the fact that besides hyperenzymemia secondary to pancreatic diseases and systemic illnesses, various non-pathological forms of chronic hyperamylasemia without relevant pathologic consequence can occur in clinical practice.Data of all patients with CHUPD were retrospectively reviewed (June 1997- December 2009). Fifty one patients were included in the study; median follow up was 48 months (range 8\u2013112 months). Their pre-enrolment diagnoses were: chronic pancreatitis in 31 cases (60.7%) and recurrent pancreatitis in 13 cases (25.4%); the remaining 7 patients (13.7%) were without a specific diagnosis.Our observations, supported by diagnostic procedures (Ca19-9 serum levels, abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and endoscopic ultrasonography) revealed that CHUPD was secondary to: a) benign pancreatic hyperamylasemia, 20 patients (39.2%); b) macroamylasemia, 18 patients (35.2 %) and c) salivary hyperamylasemia, 13 patients (25.4%).Due to the poor familiarity with CHUPD, the occurrence of this condition quite frequently leads to unnecessarily repeated diagnostic procedures.",

The aim of the study was to analyze some of the factors that may affect the outcome of H. pylori culture from endoscopic gastric mucosal specimens.The study was conducted in a group of 265 subjects. The culture of gastric mucosal specimens was verified by urease test and histological examination. If the culture result was not consistent with one or two verifying tests, an additional two tests were used, i.e. H. pylori antigens in stool samples and anti-H. pylori antibodies in blood serum.In patients infected with H. pylori (at least two positive diagnostic tests), the analysis of factors that may affect the culture outcome revealed that neither age, gender, smoking, history of eradication, endoscopic diagnosis, use of proton pump inhibitors, ultrasonography of the abdomen or chest radiology performed the day before or on the day of gastroscopy, nor preparation for colonoscopy using osmotic fluids 1\u20132 days prior to gastroscopy had an effect on the culture outcome. Only high activity of gastritis (neutrophil infiltration) and low bacterial load in gastric mucosal specimens as well as drinking alcohol and the use of histamine H2 receptor blockers reduced culture efficacy in infected subjects.High activity of gastritis, low bacterial load, drinking alcohol and the use of histamine H2 receptor blockers can be the cause of failed H. pylori culture from gastric mucosa in the infected subjects. These factors should be taken into consideration when qualifying patients for the test and interpreting the results.",

Using the food consumption frequency method (by a FIVeQ questionnaire), the weekly intake of 63 groups of products was assessed (yes, no). Food intake variety was assessed with the use of food intake variety index (FIsVeI), which was calculated as the total number of products eaten per week in the amounts exceeding trace quantities. Four models of food intake were established: \u201cordinary\u201d (S1), \u201crich varied\u201d (S2), \u201cordinary with a tendency to vary\u201d (S3) and \u201cmoderate connoisseur\u201d (S4).

It has been also suggested that kynurenine pathway activation may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.This is a cross-sectional study in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients (n=106; 60 Males). The plasma markers of endothelial dysfunction and kynurenine (KYN), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HKYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), anthranilic acid (AA) and quinolinic acid (QA) were measured in relation to an early indicator of the systemic atherosclerosis \u2013 intima-media thickness (IMT).Kynurenines, von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombomodulin (TM), soluble adhesion molecules (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) and IMT in each uraemic group were significantly higher than in healthy people. In contrast, no significant differences in sE-selectin and sP-selectin concentrations were observed between CKD patients and controls. Kynurenines were positively associated with vWF, TM, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, whereas sP-selectin was inversely associated with the most of kynurenines. IMT was positively correlated both with kynurenines: KYN, 3-HKYN, QA as well as with endothelial markers: TM, vWF, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 (all p<0.01). Finally, multiple regression analysis identified age, vWF, sVCAM-1 and QA levels as the independent variables significantly associated with increased IMT in this population (adjusted r2 = 0.51).This study suggests a relationship between kynurenine pathway activation, endothelial dysfunction and the progression of atherosclerosis in CKD patients. It opens a new idea that the inhibition of kynurenine pathway may provide an effective strategy to slow down endothelial dysfunction and thereby the prevalence of atherosclerosis in this population.",

We searched for a correlation between dysphagia severity and ICP type, mental development and occurrence of epilepsy.A total of 67 children with a pyramidal form of infantile cerebral palsy were studied. Data were obtained based on case history elicited from the mothers, analysis of medical and psychological documentation, and logopaedic examination, including an examination of the action of swallowing.Dysphagia symptoms were found in 41 (61%) studied children, most frequently referring only to the oral phase (25 children), with concomitant mild and moderate dysarthria. Oral and pharyngeal dysfunctions were observed in 14 children and coexisted with more pronounced dysarthria symptoms.

Many types of cells, including lymphocytes, dendritics APCs (antigen presenting cells), NKT (natural killer T) cells, neutrophils, keratinocytes and fibroblasts are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.The aim of our study was to assess in psoriatic patients the production of IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines by neutrophils, fibroblasts and fibroblasts \u2013 neutrophils interaction.The production of IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines was evaluated in supernatants after cells incubation for 21 h in culture medium alone and in medium in the presence of IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1. Concentrations of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using commercially available kits.Our results demonstrate that fibroblasts are not able to produce IL-10 and IL-12 but they generate IL-8. The amount of IL-8 depends on the site of derivation of fibroblasts and on the stimuli. Neutrophils released IL-8, IL-12 (at a lower level in psoriatic patients) and IL-10 but only in the case of healthy donors and at a very low concentration. Moreover, we observed higher concentrations of IL-12 and IL-8 in supernatants as a result of fibroblasts-neutrophils interaction in psoriatic patients.Our results suggest that fibroblasts take part in the inflammatory reaction in psoriasis via cytokines or direct interaction with neutrophils. Fibroblasts probably do not exert any anti-inflammatory effect.",

The aim of this study was to investigate if bone metabolism markers can be clinically useful for monitoring of treatment in children and adolescents with osteosarcoma.The study consisted of 55 patients (median age 15 years) with osteosarcoma and 60 healthy age matched counterparts. Serum bone turnover markers (bone alkaline phosphatase \u2013 BALP, osteocalcin \u2013 OC and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen \u2013 CTX) were analyzed by immunoenzymatic methods in patients at time of diagnosis, during treatment and after therapy.We observed that before treatment the concentration of OC in patients with osteosarcoma was significantly lower (p<0.05) compared to that obtained in healthy children, however, BALP and CTX were at a similar level. During chemotherapy the values of bone formation and resorption markers significantly decreased by about 20\u201330%. After therapy we observed different concentrations of all bone turnover markers in patients with favorable and unfavorable prognosis. Median values of OC and BALP were over twofold higher in patients with progression as compared to patients with remission of disease (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Patients with poor prognosis had also higher serum concentration of bone resorption marker in comparison to patients with remission (p<0.01).Presented results suggest that bone turnover markers identify changes in bone metabolism in patients with osteosarcoma during anticancer therapy.

Further, we were interested to know whether this lesion would result in neuronal oxidative stress and also if there is a correlation between the behavioral response to this lesion and brain oxidative stress.Behavioral tests included elevated plus maze, used to assess exploration/anxiety status and radial arm-maze, used for determining spatial short-term and reference memory errors. Regarding the oxidative stress, we measured the extent of some lipid peroxidation products like malondialdehyde and defense enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase.5,7-DHT lesioned rats spent more time in the open arms of the elevated maze compared to sham-operated rats, suggesting that the lesion significantly diminished anxiety-like behavior. Also, short-term memory was significantly impaired, as shown by the working memory errors in radial arm-maze task. Further analyses revealed that the 5,7-DHT lesion did not result in a significant change of reference memory errors. Regarding the oxidative stress, no significant modification of both superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase specific activities from the temporal lobe were observed. However, the malondiadehyde level was significantly increased, suggesting pro-oxidant effects. Also, the linear regression between the working memory errors vs. malondiadehyde resulted in significant correlations.5,7 DHT lesion of the PVN affects behavioral performance via interactions with systems governing novel and/or fear-evoking situations and also by increasing neuronal oxidative stress.",

Moreover, the recent evidences showing the clinical efficacy of next-generation multitargeted antifolate drugs, in NSCLC, have highlighted the role of the determination of thymidylate synthase (TS) expression levels. Here is presented a brief overview of the literature regarding these two genes that are currently under prospective investigation as predictive markers of treatment efficacy in NSCLC.",

Each group received local intramuscular injection of indicated NTFs according to the treatment protocol. The sciatic nerve function index (SFI), nerve conduction velocity and wet weight recovery rate of gastrocnemius muscle were tested to evaluate the functional recovery in vivo. A 2 (presence or absence of NGF) \u00d7 2 (presence or absence of CNTF) \u00d7 2 (presence or absence of GDNF) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine the main effects and interactions among NGF, CNTF and GDNF, and one-way ANOVA was calculated for multiple comparison.NGF and GDNF acted significantly on the survival of sensory neuron and motoneuron, respectively. CNTF was a dominant factor promoting cell body development, and GDNF had the most powerful effect on neurite outgrowth and elongation of sensory neurons and motoneurons. Combined administration of the three factors resulted in optimal functional recovery following sciatic nerve injury in rats.It is demonstrated that differential and complementary biological effects of various neurotrophic factors contribute to synergistic promotion of nervous function recovery.",

Potential adverse-effect profiles of interaction of PGB with CBZ at the fixed-ratio of 1:1 in the MES test with respect to motor performance, long-term memory, skeletal muscular strength and antinociceptive activity were measured along with total brain CBZ concentrations.In the mouse MES model, PGB administered singly had its DRRC non-parallel to that for CBZ. With type I isobolographic analysis for non-parallel DRRCs, the combination of PGB with CBZ at the fixed-ratio of 1:1 exerted additive interaction. In the combination, neither motor coordination, long-term memory nor muscular strength were affected. PGB administered alone and in combination with CBZ exerted antinociceptive effects, whereas CBZ administered alone produced no antinociceptive activity in mice subjected to the acute thermal pain model. Pharmacokinetic estimation of total brain antiepileptic drug concentrations revealed that PGB had no impact on total brain concentrations of CBZ in experimental animals.In conclusion, the additive interaction between PGB and CBZ is worthy of consideration while extrapolating the results from this study to clinical settings.",
