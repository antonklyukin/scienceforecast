     "abstract": "Therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) is a rare but devastating consequence of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy used for the treatment of solid cancers and various hematologic malignancies. Our current understanding of the etiology is that hematopoietic clones that are contemporaneous with the primary cancer and resistant to the cytotoxic exposure have the potential to undergo selective expansion and transformation to t-MN. Consequently, a large proportion of cases are associated with adverse risk factors, resulting in limited effective treatment options. Despite the emergence of some therapies with promising activity in t-MN, most effects are short-lived and allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative option for eligible patients. This review summarizes the current literature on t-AML and t-MDS, with the aim of providing practical recommendations on the clinical evaluation and management of these conditions.",

     "abstract": "Clonal Hematopoiesis is defined as the presence of mutations in peripheral blood in the absence of myeloid malignancies and is thought to occur as a normal part of ageing due to the fitness advantage conferred by these mutations in an ageing hematopoietic compartment. Therapy related myeloid neoplasms are malignancies that occur after exposure to chemotherapy/radiation and are associated with poor survival. Clonal hematopoiesis mutations represent a pre malignant state that can be triggered by exposure to cytotoxic damage and rapid hematopoietic stem cell expansion. We discuss in this review clinical evidence of association of clonal hematopoiesis with risk of therapy related myeloid neoplasms, the underlying mechanisms of clonal expansion under different cellular stresses and recommendations on clinical follow up of patients with clonal hematopoiesis including possible strategies for prevention of therapy related myeloid neoplasms.",

     "abstract": "Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs) are one of the lethal complications from cytotoxic chemotherapy/radiation therapy. There is substantial variability in the risk of developing t-MNs among individuals who receive the same level of exposures and it has been widely suspected that germline polymorphisms may influence the risk and account for the variability. As the number of cancer survivors increases, effectively identifying an individual with a high risk of developing t-MNs is crucial. Here, we review the previous studies that investigated the association between germline polymorphisms and the risk of t-MNs. Through this process, we also discuss inconsistencies among the results that stem from the difficulties in conducting an appropriate study to link germline polymorphisms with a disease like t-MN that is rare and has a strong association with external exposures.",

This includes discussion of known mechanisms by which cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation induce genetic mutations and promote evolution and expansion of malignant hematopoietic clones. Mechanisms by which the hematopoietic stem and progenitor microenvironment may be injured during the course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy will also be presented.

Unfortunately, exposure to chemotherapy or radiation as a part of these treatments exposes patients to the risk of subsequent myeloid malignancies. Therapy related myeloid malignancies have certain characteristic findings. They typically arise within 10 years of treatment exposure, they are seen in younger patients, and the greatest risk is in patients who receive therapy with alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors. Solid tumours whose therapies utilize these agents at higher doses, namely bone/soft tissue cancers, testicular cancer, anal cancer, and brain tumours, appear to be the groups at highest risk for T-MN. Beyond these patients, emerging populations diagnosed with T-MN include prior platinum exposure, and patients requiring G-CSF support with chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Treatment for Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has changed dramatically in the last fifty years. While there are increasing numbers of long-term survivors, there has been increasing recognition of the long-term toxicities of treatments, particularly therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML). The survival for t-MDS/AML is extremely poor. Multiple heterogeneous retrospective studies have reported risk factors for the development of t-MDS/AML. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been most closely examined as possible t-MDS/AML risk factors. In this paper, we will review the risks of t-MDS/AML for HL and NHL patients as reported in the literature and assess for any changes over time. In HL patients, the incidence of t-MDS/AML has decreased with a reduction in alkylating agents. In indolent NHL patients, we anticipate decreased incidence of t-MDS/AML as targeted therapies begin to replace cytotoxic chemotherapy.",

Both patient-specific and treatment-specific factors likely impact the risk of t-MN development after diagnosis and treatment of PCD. Alkylating chemotherapy, especially melphalan, has been strongly tied to the risk of t-MN. More recently, there has been a shift away from long-term alkylating therapies to immunomodulatory agents and high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HD-ASCT). This shift has led to improved survival and long-term outcomes for most MM patients. However, the risks of t-MN remain despite the improved efficacy of these treatments, and patients who develop t-MN have a poor prognosis. Understanding the risk factors predisposing MM patients to t-MN can thus help to tailor individualized therapy to maximize anti-myeloma efficacy and minimize the risks of t-MN.",

Lastly, we discuss emerging studies on the association between ruxolitinib and high grade B-cell lymphomas. We conclude that statistical associations have not implicated hydroxyurea monotherapy as leukemogenic. However, it is difficult to definitely disprove an association, as large prospective, controlled studies with decades of follow-up would be needed to draw conclusions. Overall, the concept of therapy-related neoplasms remains important to the field, and mandates judicious selection and sequencing of therapies for MPN patients.",

     "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases (ADs) are associated with an increased risk not only of lymphoproliferative disorders but also of myeloid malignancies. The excess risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and/or acute myeloid leukemia is observed across several AD types, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disorders, multiple sclerosis, among others. The risk of developing myeloid neoplasms (MNs) is dependent on several variables, including the specific AD type, chronicity and severity of the AD, type and duration of exposure of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or cytotoxics/immunosuppressives, and genetic predisposition risk. Putative triggering factors linking AD to elevated MN risk include AD-directed medications, shared genetic susceptibilities between the two disease entities, and chronic immune stimulation or bone marrow infiltration by the AD. Molecular mechanisms underpinning leukemogenesis remain largely speculative and warrant further investigation. Leukemias arising in patients with AD are not always \u2018therapy-related\u2019 in that MNs may develop in certain AD subtypes even among patients with no prior therapy exposure. Only a few studies have attempted to determine factors associated with MN development in AD but failed to demonstrate consistent characteristic clinical or paraclinical features. These reports have failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between individual agent exposure and subsequent leukemia development due to the low rates of therapy exposure compounded by the rarity of MN occurrence. Notwithstanding, the leukemogenic potential is best documented with agents such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone; this risk of MN development does not appear to be shared by biologic approaches such as anti-tumor necrosis factors-alpha inhibitors. In this article, we discuss plausible biologic mechanisms underlying MN pathogenesis in AD and review the data available on the development of MNs in patients with AD.",

Treatment of patients with tAML is challenging. The key initial clinical decision is whether a patient is a candidate for or likely to benefit from intensive induction chemotherapy, a determination which we argue should not be predicated on chronologic age alone. For those determined likely to tolerate intensive induction chemotherapy, CPX-351 is likely superior to conventional induction with cytarabine and daunorubicin. For those deemed inappropriate for intensive induction, hypomethylating agents have the strongest evidence base in elderly adults with AML, and are an attractive option in tAML. This is particularly true in patients with TP53 mutations who are less likely to respond to conventional induction chemotherapy. Exciting options on the therapeutic horizon for tAML include combination therapies incorporating BCL2 inhibitors, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, and isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors.",

Emerging data has begun to elucidate who may be at highest risk of developing t-MNs, which ideally will enable us to develop preventative strategies for this devastating disease. As t-MNs may not be avoidable, novel therapies are urgently needed for this patient group and are underway as exemplified by recent investigation in restoring wild-type p53 function as well as directly targeting TP53 mutant variants.

Mechanisms for the development of t-MN include direct genotoxic damage from prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy exposure and the selection of pre-existing clones with malignant potential that are able to evolve with time and manifest as new cancers. Patients with t-MN are generally considered high-risk at the time of diagnosis and are commonly referred for consideration of an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, however, this patient population poses unique challenges, and little is known about the ideal sequence and timing of treatment.

     "abstract": "Transformation of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) into secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) is defined by an arbitrary boundary of \u226520% bone marrow blasts but does not necessarily reflect a defined biological transition. The more obvious distinction lies between MDS patients that have an isolated bone marrow failure phenotype and those with excess blasts. Subtyping of MDS might be more accurately stratified into clonal cytopenias and oligoblastic leukemias, using the degree of dysplasia and blast percentage as risk features, respectively, rather than as diagnostic criteria. Transformation from MDS to sAML often involves clonal evolution or expansion of existing subclones that can be assessed by changes in variant allele frequencies of the somatic mutations that define them. There are a number of predictors for transformation that have been identified: these include mutations of genes in growth signaling pathways (NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, FLT3), mutations in genes more commonly observed in AML (NPM1, WT1, IDH2), certain cytogenetic abnormalities (monosomy 7, complex karyotype, loss of 17p). Gene expression profiles that divide MDS into two major categories identify a progenitor gene signature subtype associated with a high risk of AML transformation. Assessing for these genetic abnormalities may better identify MDS patients at greatest risk of transformation.",

The one-size-fits-all-ages approach has been replaced with adaptation of pediatric-inspired treatment protocols for younger adults. Yet different treatment strategies for older patients are needed due to chemotherapy-related toxicities. A new era of immunotherapy has arrived, offering opportunities for targeted treatments for ALL subtypes. While CD20 targeting with rituximab has been demonstrated to improve survival when combined with chemotherapy, it has little activity as a single agent in ALL. In contrast, antibody targeting of CD19 and CD22 with blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin, respectively, has had remarkable single-agent activity in the relapsed setting. Studies are now underway to test these agents in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting. The goal of these studies is to improve event-free survival and overall survival by using these approaches in the frontline to eradicate minimal residual disease and, particularly in older adults with ALL, to reduce treatment-related toxicity by limiting the exposure to traditional multi-agent chemotherapy with its attendant toxicities. This review focuses on new immunotherapeutic treatment options and strategies for frontline treatment, including a brief discussion of the use of true immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, for relapsed B-cell ALL, the potential for targeting CD38 in T-cell ALL, and how these approaches are facilitating the next steps to improve survival for adult patients with ALL.",

Characterization of the influence of germline mutations on the development of myeloid malignancies is ongoing by utilization of next generation sequencing data and prognostic panels. Here, we propose modifications to the utilization and analysis of genetic results, specifically to have a high index of clinical suspicion for germline predisposition, to use assays that are comprehensive for detection of these variants, and a few caveats to interpreting sequencing data. Presented are the benefits and shortcomings of prognostic panels and clinical examples of the utilization of the prognostic panel used within the Department of Pathology at The University of Chicago. The examples demonstrate that panels performed for prognostication on DNA derived from malignant cells are able to identify patients with germline syndromes, but they can lack coverage for genes that confer inherited susceptibility. Furthermore, the panels are often not designed to find duplication and deletion mutations, which calls for a need to improve assay design and bioinformatic approaches to interpret such variants using these data.",

Recent data support survival times that can reach several decades, even if periodic treatment is needed to manage symptoms or stabilize disease. However, all indolent lymphomas have the potential to undergo transformation to an aggressive phenotype, clinically characterized by a rapid progression of adenopathy, new-onset constitutional symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities, and the immediate need for therapeutic intervention. The most common scenario is transformation of follicular lymphoma to either diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations; however, other indolent subtypes such as marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or even nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, can undergo similar histologic transformation. The prognosis of transformed lymphomas has historically been quite poor, but there is ample evidence this is changing in the rituximab era. This article will provide a review of transformed lymphomas with an emphasis on treatment and the nuances of diagnosis and clinical management. Unless otherwise specified, all discussion in this review pertains to transformed follicular lymphoma which is the more common scenario and the subtype with the most robust data. In many cases, this information can be extrapolated and applied to other indolent histologies (i.e. transformed marginal zone lymphoma); however, several other clinical scenarios, such as Richter's transformation and \u201cdouble hit\u201d transformations, warrant a distinct discussion and will be reviewed separately.",

Healthy donor T cells can provide a source for production of universal CAR-T cells when combined with gene editing to prevent expression of endogenous TCRs and avoid generation of GvHD in HLA mismatched recipients. Additional gene edits can be included to impart resistance to immunosuppression or improve trafficking to tumor sites.

Although infrequent, transformation of follicular lymphoma to a more aggressive behaving subtype \u2013 prototypically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \u2013 confers a substantially adverse prognosis.

Historically considered a distinct clinical event, this review highlights the multiple subclinical transformational events that either variably or cumulatively result in clinical recognition of transformed follicular lymphoma. Known and suspected events include genetic and epigenetic perturbations, metabolomic changes, and alterations in the microenvironment. This diverse spectrum of pathways leads to heterogeneous clinical presentations and outcomes of transformed follicular lymphoma. Current options for prevention of transformation are limited to known strategies of managing follicular lymphoma before the transformation is recognized. Although most retrospectively analyzed studies suggest an association of lower transformation rates with early systemic therapy, specific components of therapy such as anti-CD20 antibodies, anthracyclines, or purine analogues are less strongly associated with \u201cpreventative\u2019 value. Thus, the goal of preventing transformation is of limited value among all factors that go into decisions on early management of follicular lymphoma.

     "abstract": "SMZL is a relatively rare low grade B-cell lymphoma, characterized usually by an indolent clinical behavior. Since there is no prospective randomized trials to establish the best treatment approach, decision on therapeutic management should be based on the available retrospective series. Based on these data, rituximab and splenectomy appear to be the most effective. Splenectomy represented the standard treatment modality until early 2000s. More than 90% of the patients present quick amelioration of splenomegaly related symptoms along with improvement of cytopenias related to hypersplenism. The median progression free survival was 8.25 years in the largest series of patients published so far, while the median 5- and 10- year OS were 84% and 67%, respectively. Responses to splenectomy are not complete since extrasplenic disease persists. Patients with heavy bone marrow infiltration, lymphadenopathy or other disease localization besides the spleen are not good candidates for splenectomy. Furthermore splenectomy is a major surgical procedure accompanied by acute perioperative complications as well as late toxicities mainly due to infections. For that reasons splenectomy is not appropriate for elderly patients or patients with comorbidities with a high surgical risk. On the other hand rituximab monotherapy displays high efficacy with minimal toxicity. Several published series have shown an ORR more than 90%, with high CR rates (\u223c50%). The 10-year PFS and OS were 63% and 85%, respectively in a series of 104 SMZL patients. The role of rituximab maintenance has been investigated by only one group. Based on these data, maintenance with rituximab further improved the quality of responses by increasing significantly the CR rates (from 42% at the end of induction to 71% at the end of maintenance treatment), as well as the duration of responses: 7-year PFS was 75% for those patients who received maintenance vs 39% for those who did not (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0004). However no difference in OS has been noticed between the two groups, so far. Summarizing the above data, it is obvious that Rituximab monotherapy is associated with high response rates, long response duration and favorable safety profile, rendering it as the treatment of choice in SMZL.",

     "abstract": "Improving long-term outcomes of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients remains a challenge. Major scientific and clinical advances have led to a better understanding of the disease biology, and the majority of patients achieve a complete remission (CR) after induction therapy. Relapse risk, however, remains considerable and is the leading cause of death in this patient population. Significant efforts to improve outcomes emphasize use of post-remission therapies such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), an increasingly utilized modality. Improvement in transplantation techniques, understanding of donor:recipient histocompatibility, and increased availability of alternative donors have resulted in greater use of allogeneic HCT. Despite a graft-versus-leukemia effect and lower post-HCT relapse rates, allogeneic HCT continues to be plagued by treatment-related mortality (TRM) and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Better understanding of AML risk stratification and issues relating to minimal residual disease (MRD) as well as extremely low TRM rates with autografts have prompted clinicians to re-explore use of autologous HCT in subsets of favorable and intermediate-risk CR1 AML patients. Herein, we highlight the evolving literature and treatment outcomes for autologous HCT in AML. We provide recommendations for considering this therapeutic modality for treatment intensification in AML.",

Yet, several independent lines of experimental evidence strongly suggested that intracellular proteolysis is largely non-lysosomal, but the mechanisms involved remained obscure. The discovery of the ubiquitin-proteasome system resolved the enigma. We now recognize that degradation of intracellular proteins is involved in regulation of a broad array of cellular processes, such as cell cycle and division, regulation of transcription factors, and assurance of the cellular quality control. Not surprisingly, aberrations in the system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease, such as malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders, which led subsequently to an increasing effort to develop mechanism-based drugs.",

Approximately 16 percent of patients with newly diagnosed Ph- B-cell ALL are aged 60 years or older [1]. The five-year overall survival for this older cohort of patients is approximately 20 percent, and there has been no improvement in their survival in decades [2]. The challenge in managing older patients with ALL is achieving balance between efficacy of treatment and the toxicity of multi-agent chemotherapy. The latter approach is highly effective in younger adults, but greatly limited by toxicity in older adults. New classes of agents, bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) monoclonal antibody and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been introduced into the treatment of ALL, and these agents have achieved therapeutic responses and manageable toxicity in patients of all ages with relapsed refractory ALL. These newer immunotherapy agents may improve the treatment of older adults. This review focuses on the new approaches to treatment of Ph- B-cell ALL in older patients.

Based on the immunophenotypic findings, MBL cases are sub-categorized into chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)-like, atypical CLL and non-CLL MBL. The latter corresponds to cases with immunophenotypic features suggestive of post germinal center derivation and still represents a diagnostic conundrum. Recent studies are starting to shed light on the true biological nature and clinical significance of this entity and have led to the introduction of the novel term clonal B lymphocytosis of marginal-zone origin (CBL-MZ); as well as the acknowledgement of CBL-MZ in the latest (2016) update of the WHO classification for lymphoid malignancies. Here we provide an overview of relevant research concerning non-CLL MBL and discuss clinico-biological implications and considerations.",

Treatment is not standardized, since there are no prospective randomized trials in large series of SMZL patients. Splenectomy and rituximab represent the most effective treatment strategies used so far. The addition of chemotherapy to rituximab has not further improved the outcome, although this issue requires further investigation. Rituximab monotherapy has been associated with high response rates (\u223c90%), with approximately half of these responses being complete, even at the molecular level. More importantly, many of these responses are long-lasting, with a reported 7-year progression-free survival (PFS) at the rate of 69%. Maintenance rituximab treatment has been associated with further improvement of the quality of response as well as longer response duration in studies derived from one group of investigators. Based on its high efficacy and the good safety profile, rituximab represent one of the best treatment options for SMZL patients. Moreover, rituximab retains its efficacy in the relapse setting in most cases. Splenectomy is a meaningful alternative to rituximab in patients with bulky splenomegaly and cytopenias, without extensive bone marrow infiltration, who are fit for surgery. However splenectomy cannot completely eradicate the disease and it is also associated with greater morbidity or even mortality compared to rituximab. The choice of one of these two treatment approaches (rituximab or splenectomy) should mainly be based on patient's characteristics and on the disease burden. Novel agents are currently testing in low grade lymphomas including a small number of SMZL patients with promising results.",

The major concern is the occurrence of secondary malignancies possibly related to total-body irradiation.

     "abstract": "The majority of patients presenting with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) initially respond to chemotherapy but post-remission therapy is required to consolidate this response and achieve long-term disease-free survival. The most effective form of post-remission therapy relies on T cell immunotherapy in the form of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, patients with active disease cannot usually expect to be cured with HCT. This inherent dichotomy implies that traditional T cell-based immunotherapy in the form of allogeneic HCT stops being efficacious somewhere between the measurable residual disease (MRD) and the morphologically obvious range. This is in part because the full power of T cells must be restrained in order to avoid lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and partly because only a sub-population of donor T cells are expected to be able to recognize AML cells via their T cell receptor. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, most advanced in the treatment of patients with B-cell malignancies, may circumvent some of these limitations. However, major challenges remain to be overcome before CAR T cell therapy can be safely applied to AML.",

Efforts to control relapse by promoting donor T-cell alloreactivity, such as withdrawal of immune suppression or donor lymphocyte infusions, are limited by the propensity to induce graft versus host disease (GVHD) and by inadequate efficacy. Therefore, options for AML patients who have relapsed AML after allo HCT are few and outcomes are poor. Similar to T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells have potent anti-leukemia effector capacity, and yet unlike T-cells, NK cells do not mediate GVHD. Furthermore, their function does not require matching of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) between donor and recipient. Maximizing donor NK alloreactivity thus holds the exciting possibility to induce the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect without engendering GVHD. Among the array of activating and inhibitory NK cell surface receptors, the killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) play a central role in modulating NK effector function. Here we will review how KIR mediates donor alloreactivity, discuss the role of KIR gene and allele typing to optimize allo HCT donor selection, and discuss how KIR may aid adoptive NK and other cell therapies.",

Reduced intensity conditioning for second allografts may be preferable and little data exists to suggest that a new donor will improve disease control by inducing a stronger graft-versus-leukemia effect.

Mutations led the way to the discovery of many of the molecular elements of innate immune sensing and signaling pathways. In turn, the need for a faster way to find the molecular causes of mutation-induced phenotypes triggered a huge transformation in forward genetics. During the 1980s and 1990s, many heritable phenotypes were ascribed to mutations through positional cloning. In mice, this required three steps. First, a genetic mapping step was used to show that a given phenotype emanated from a circumscribed region of the genome. Second, a physical mapping step was undertaken, in which all of the region was cloned and its gene content determined. Finally, a concerted search for the mutation was performed. Such projects usually lasted for several years, but could produce breakthroughs in our understanding of biological processes. Publication of the annotated mouse genome sequence in 2002 made physical mapping unnecessary. More recently we devised a new technology for automated genetic mapping, which eliminated both genetic mapping and the search for mutations among candidate genes. The cause of phenotype can now be determined instantaneously. We have created more than 100,000 coding/splicing mutations. And by screening for defects of innate and adaptive immunity we have discovered many \u201cnew\u201d proteins needed for innate immune function.",

Auto-SCT can be safely performed in WM and is recommended as second-line treatment or beyond in eligible patients. It is associated with extremely low transplant-related mortality. Allo-SCT is effective in WM with incremental benefit due to graft-versus-WM effect, but is associated with high non-relapse mortality of 30%, hence should be preferably considered investigational as part of clinical trials in selected patients who have exhausted other treatment options.",

In addition, these models are useful for treatment decisions, as they can identify patients that could be treated with clinical trials vs. standard of care therapies. This chapter will review the most important prognostic markers that have been described in CLL and their application in clinical practice.",

     "abstract": "Despite the availability of novel targeted agents, TP53 defects remain the most important adverse prognostic factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Detection of deletion of TP53 locus (17p deletion) by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) has become standard and performed prior to every line of treatment as the incidence dramatically increases as relapses occur. As monoallelic mutations of TP53 equally affect outcome, novel methods are being developed to improve detection of TP53 defects and include next-generation sequencing (NGS) and functional assays. TP53 defects highly affect outcome of immunochemotherapy but also alter response durations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although BCR-targeting agents and Bcl-2-inhibitos have achieved durable responses in some patients with TP53 defects, long-term follow-up is currently lacking. In this review biological and clinical consequences of TP53 dysfunction as well as applicability of currently available methods to detect TP53 defects are described. In addition, proposed novel therapeutic strategies specifically for patients with TP53 dysfunction are discussed.In summary, the only curative treatment option for TP53-defective CLL is still allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Other treatment strategies such as rationale combinations of agents with different (TP53 independent) targets, including kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic molecules but also immunomodulatory agents need to be further explored.",

     "abstract": "Hairy cell leukaemia is a rare chronic neoplastic B-cell lymphoproliferation that characteristically involves blood, bone marrow and spleen with liver, lymph node and skin less commonly involved. Histologically, the cells have a characteristic appearance with pale/clear cytoplasm and round or reniform nuclei. In the spleen, the infiltrate involves the red pulp and is frequently associated with areas of haemorrhage (blood lakes). The cells stain for B-cell related antigens as well as with antibodies against tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, DBA44 (CD72), CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123, cyclin D1 and annexin A1. Mutation of BRAF \u2013V600E is present and antibody to the mutant protein can be used as a specific marker.Bone marrow biopsy is essential in the initial assessment of disease as the bone marrow may be inaspirable or unrepresentative of degree of marrow infiltration as a result of the tumour associated fibrosis preventing aspiration of the tumour cell component.Bone marrow biopsy is important in the assessment of therapy response but in this context staining for CD11c and Annexin A1 is not helpful as they are also markers of myeloid lineage and identification of low level infiltration may be obscured. In this context staining for CD20 may be used in conjunction with morphological assessment and staining of serial sections for cyclin D1 and DBA44 to identify subtle residual infiltration. Staining for CD79a and CD19 is not recommended as these antibodies will identify plasma cells and can lead to over-estimation of disease. Staining for CD20 should not be used in patients following with anti-CD20 based treatments. Down regulation of cyclin D1 and CD25 has been reported in patients following BRAF inhibitor therapy and assessment of these antigens should not be used in this context.Histologically, hairy cell leukaemia needs to be distinguished from other B-cell lymphoproliferations associated with splenomegaly including splenic marginal zone lymphoma, splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma and hairy cell leukaemia variant. This can be done by assessment of the spleen but as this is now rarely performed in this disorder distinction is almost always possible by a combination of morphological and immunophenotypic studies on bone marrow trephine biopsy, which can be supplemented by assessment of BRAF-V600E mutation assessment in borderline cases.",

Complete remission to single-agent purine analog is often accompanied by minimal residual disease (MRD), residual HCL cells detectable by immunologic methods, considered a risk factor for eventual relapse. Several different non-chemotherapy approaches are being used to target relapsed and refractory HCL, including inhibitors of BRAF, but so far only monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based approaches have been reported to eliminate MRD in a high percentage of patients. One of the MAb-based options for HCL currently under clinical investigation involves recombinant immunotoxins, containing a fragment of a MAb and a bacterial toxin. The bacterial toxin, a highly potent fragment from Pseudomonas exotoxin, catalytically ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF2), resulting in protein synthesis inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Recombinant immunotoxins tested in HCL patients include LMB-2, targeting CD25, and BL22, targeting CD22. An affinity matured version of BL22, termed moxetumomab pasudotox (formerly HA22 or CAT-8015) achieved high CR rates in phase I, and is currently undergoing multicenter Phase 3 testing. Phase I testing was without dose-limiting toxicity, although 2 patients had grade 2 hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) with transient grade 1 abnormalities in platelets and creatinine.

Therefore, this review will also aim to explore some of the current understanding of AML relapse biology in order to identify the gaps in our knowledge and translation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the root of relapse evolves even before the time of diagnosis, meaning that the complex clonal structure of AML is created before patients present to the clinic.

Here, we review the biological characteristics of the most common mutations underlying CN-AML and outline their clinical impact in the following settings: (i) definition of new molecular leukemia entities in the WHO classification; (ii) risk stratification of CN-AML patients according to mutational profile; and (iii) monitoring of minimal residual disease by specific quantitative molecular assays.",

     "abstract": "The prognostic power of minimal residual disease after therapy for acute leukemias is not in question. It is only logical that the finding of leukemic blast cells after therapy predicts for impending relapse or at least the need for additional treatment. Which level of what is called minimal residual disease (MRD) is clinically relevant, however, depends on the efficacy of the initial treatment as well as the treatment strategies available to target MRD. There are a multitude of additional factors that can alter the clinical significance of MRD, including the genotype of the patient's leukemic cells. The fact that methodologies of MRD detection are not standardized and thresholds for defining MRD positivity vary depending upon MRD detection method and the operator's skills or convictions only add to the complexity of MRD interpretation. While enormous efforts are devoted to enhancing the sensitivity of MRD detection, eg, by next-generation sequencing, improvements of methods for detecting MRD per se will not automatically lead to a more reliable estimation of total tumor burden. Most importantly, even the best assay will yield accurate MRD results only if the tissue source for MRD determination is of good quality. Another aspect of potentially crucial importance is the heterogenous distribution of leukemic cells throughout the skeleton after treatment, recently demonstrated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by bone marrow imaging. Once technical difficulties of MRD measurement are resolved and better MRD-targeting drugs are developed, we still need to learn about alternate proposed mechanisms to explain MRD-independent prognostication, well described in acute lymphoid leukemia, before MRD can be included routinely in the guidance of therapy in AML.",

Nonetheless it was tested in a wide variety of thrombocytopenic conditions and showed unequivocal efficacy in increasing the number of platelets in certain ones. As a result of lessons learned with MGDF, second-generation TPO-R agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag were initially tested and have been approved for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), thrombocytopenia in hepatitis C, and recently aplastic anemia.

However, chromatin modifying agents, anti-fibrosing agents, and other signaling pathway inhibitors have also demonstrated activity and offer the potential to improve upon the clinical success of JAK2 inhibition. Due to the complex pathobiological mechanisms underlying MF, it is likely that a combination of biologically active therapies will be required to target the MF hematopoietic stem cell in order to achieve significant disease course modification. Ruxolitinib in partnership with panobinostat, decitabine, and LDE225 are being evaluated in current combination therapy trials based on pre-clinical studies that provide strong scientific rationale. The rationale of combination of danazol or lenalidomide with ruxolitinib is mainly based on mitigation of anti-JAK2-mediated myelosuppression. Combination trials of ruxolitinib and novel anti-fibrosing agents such as PRM-151 represent an attempt to address therapeutic limitations of JAK2 inhibitors such as reversal of bone marrow fibrosis. Ruxolitinib is also being incorporated in novel treatment strategies in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MF. As the pathogenetic mechanisms are better understood, potential drug combinations in MF will increase dramatically and demonstration of biologic activity in effective preclinical models will be required to efficiently evaluate the most active combinations with least toxicity in future trials. This manuscript will address the proposed goals of combination therapy approach and review the state of the art in combination experimental therapy for MF.",

     "abstract": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with peculiar biologic and clinical features and requiring specific management. At the genetic level, APL is featured by a unique chromosome translocation t(15;17) which results in the PML\u2013RAR\u03b1 gene fusion and chimeric protein. APL is the first example of differentiation therapy targeted to a defined genetic target i.e. PML\u2013RAR\u03b1. PML\u2013RAR\u03b1 behaves as an altered retinoic acid receptor with an ability of transmitting oncogenic signaling leading to accumulation of undifferentiated promyelocytes. All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces disease remission in APL patients by triggering terminal differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes. More recently, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to contribute degradation of the PML\u2013RAR\u03b1 oncoprotein through bonding the PML moiety and has shown excellent synergism with ATRA in clinical trials. Elucidating the oncogenic signaling of PML\u2013RAR\u03b1 through various transcription factors and the study of APL mouse models have greatly helped to understand the molecular pathogenesis of APL. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which t(15;17) is formed and initiates leukemia remains unknown. While transforming oncogenic potential of PML\u2013RAR\u03b1 has been described extensively, the mechanistic events important for the formation of t(15;17) have been taken from the model of Therapy-related APL (t-APL).",

This raises questions about the relevance of post-remission monitoring for PML-RARA transcripts, which has been widely used to predict relapse, guiding early intervention to prevent disease progression and the inherent risk of fatal bleeding. Given the treatability of haematological relapse, survival benefits would only be seen if monitoring could identify patients who could be salvaged if treated early but not later on, although it could be argued that early deployment of arsenic trioxide (ATO) can avoid inducing hyperleucocytosis and the associated differentiation syndrome, which frequently complicate treatment of frank relapse. However, given the low rates of relapse now observed in patients presenting with standard risk disease (i.e. presenting WBC <10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/l) who achieve early molecular remission, subsequent sequential minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring confers only a marginal benefit, so could be avoided in this group. However, sequential MRD monitoring may still be of value in patients with high risk APL, although evidence tends to come from historically controlled studies. Therefore, there may remain a role for MRD monitoring in the most clinically challenging subsets of APL, but the continuing debate highlights the need for robust evidence in developing a more individualized approach to management of other subtypes of acute leukaemia.",

It seems likely that low penetrance genetic variants may influence predisposition, and these may include pathways for xenobiotic metabolism, DNA repair and other quantitative trait loci.",

AD accompanying MDS and CMML include vasculitis, seronegative polyarthritis and neutrophilic dermatosis. Rare AD including relapsing polychondritis is strongly associated with MDS as in a high proportion of those patients MDS is diagnosed during disease course. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are frequently found among MDS patients without clinical manifestation of AD. In a subset of patients, MDS and resulting cytopenias appear to be the consequence of auto reactive immunologic activity and may respond to immunosuppressive treatment (IST). Increased release of inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IF)-\u03b3 triggers apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells leading to cytopenias. Impaired function of immune cells including cytotoxic, regulatory (Treg), helper (Th17) T cells and NK cells also appears to predict response to IST, outcome and occurrence of AD.",

Cytomorphological alterations in peripheral blood films as well as bone marrow aspirates and histological findings in trephine biopsies result from cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, epigenetic dysregulation and immune dysfunction and are key elements for setting the diagnosis of MDS. Whereas diagnosis can be made quite easily in advanced MDS this is much more difficult in early MDS, especially in cases with cytopenias or dysplasias of uncertain significance (ICUS and IDUS). Recommendations, illustrated by case reports for a stepwise annealing to the final diagnosis and exclusion of differential diagnoses are given. Furthermore, the problem of correct counting and identification of blasts is covered and features defining dysplasia in all three cell lineages are recapitulated thoroughly. Histopathology is not mandatory but has a distinct diagnostic and prognostic value especially in cases with hypoplasia or fibrosis and when the TP53 mutational status is of relevance.In up to 70% of patients with MDS clonal chromosome abnormalities can be identified which have a high impact on setting the correct diagnosis and estimation of prognosis. Incidence, type, molecular background and clinical relevance of distinct anomalies as well as cytogenetic subgroups are presented in detail and the development of the new cytogenetic prognostic scoring system as part of the IPSS-R is explained. The value of FISH-Analysis as a complementary tool for chromosome analysis in MDS is demonstrated with special emphasis on the possibility to perform frequent cytogenetic monitoring by CD34-FISH examination of peripheral blood.Finally the evolution of MDS-classification systems from FAB to WHO with a critical discussion of their shortcomings like degree of dysplasia, blast thresholds, inclusion/exclusion of CMML, and the lack of dynamic information is presented.",

Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75\u201380% of MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i.e. cytokine signaling (RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications (ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with mutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes. Most of those mutations, except SF3B1 and TET2 mutations, are associated with an overall poorer prognosis, while some gene mutations (mainly TET2 mutation), may be associated to better response to hypomethylating agents.The frequent mutations of epigenetic modulators in MDS appear to largely contribute to the importance of epigenetic deregulation (in particular gene hypermethylation and histone deacetylation) in MDS progression, and may account at least partially for the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in the treatment of MDS.",

No genes on chromosome 5q undergo recurrent homozygous inactivation in MDS patients.

Haploinsufficiency for the RPS14 gene leads to activation of the p53 pathway and the macrocytic anemia characteristic of this disorder, and loss of p53 rescues erythropoiesis and facilitates clonal progression. Other genes, as well as miR-145 and miR-146a, contribute to aberrant megakaryopoiesis and a selective advantage for the del(5q) clone.

     "abstract": "Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) characterized by 15% or more ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow according to the WHO classification. After Perls staining, ring sideroblasts are defined as erythroblasts in which there are 5 or more siderotic granules covering at least a third of the nuclear circumference. The iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of mitochondrial ferritin. The molecular basis of MDS with ring sideroblasts has remained unknown until recently. In 2011, whole exome sequencing studies revealed somatic mutations of SF3B1, a gene encoding a core component of RNA splicing machinery, in myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts. The close relationship between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts is consistent with a causal relationship, and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be associated with a specific morphological feature in MDS. RARS is mainly characterized by isolated anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and its clinical course is generally benign, although there is a tendency to worsening of anemia in most patients over time. By contrast, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) is characterized by pancytopenia and dysplasia in two or more myeloid cell lineages. More importantly, patients with RCMD-RS have a higher risk of developing bone marrow failure\u00a0or progressing to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS-T) associated with marked thrombocytosis is a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with both SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations. RARS-T may develop from an SF3B1 mutated RARS through the acquisition of a JAK2 or MPL mutations in a subclone of hematopoietic cells.",

ASXL1 is the only gene whose mutation predicts outcome and can be included within a prognostic score. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is possibly curative but rarely feasible.

Iron deposition in tissues can now be detected with non-invasive techniques such as T2* MRI. Iron toxicity in MDS may not only depend on the degree of tissue iron accumulation but also on the extent of chronic exposure to non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), including labile plasma iron (LPI) and intracellular labile iron pools, which increase the level of oxidative stress. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) can rapidly lower NTBI and LPI and more slowly mobilizes tissue iron stores. Further studies, including the ongoing TELESTO controlled trial, will more clearly define the role of ICT in MDS, including any effect on specific morbidities or mortality in the MDS setting.",

Second, the 1 millionth hematopoietic cell transplant was recorded this year. Stem cell transplant, the first reported by Dr E. Donnall Thomas in 1957, had been considered a rare procedure until about a decade ago. Today, it has become a proven and often life-saving therapy for patients with acute leukemia. Advances in the treatment of patients with AML continue to take place, many of which relate to an increased understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of known subtypes.Forty years ago, the regimen that has come to be known as 7+3 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was born [1], [2]. Cytosine arabinoside, or arabinosylcytosine as it was then called, was given as a continuous intravenous infusion of 100\u00a0mg/m2 for 7 days, and the anthracycline, daunorubicin, was administered at 45\u00a0mg/m2 intravenously for 3 days. Sixteen patients were originally treated on this protocol, and 5 of 8 previously untreated and 2 of 8 previously treated patients achieved a complete response (CR). This regimen has withstood the test of time. Attempts to add or substitute other agents have not yielded superior results. The only major contemporary change is that a higher dose of daunorubicin is safe and has become the standard of care [3].",

A decision to advise oral anticoagulation should be based upon the individual absolute risks of stroke and bleeding, and almost all AF patients with \u22651 stroke risk factors have a positive net clinical benefit of oral anticoagulation.The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are more convenient, and are at least equally effective and safer (regarding bleeding complications) for stroke prevention compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Availability of NOACs and improved stroke and bleeding risks assessment should increase the number of AF patients who receive adequate thromboprophylaxis.In this review article, we present an overview of the clinical phase III trials with NOACs for stroke prevention and discuss the contemporary principles of thromboprophylaxis in AF patients with various stroke and bleeding risk profiles, as well as practical aspects of NOACs therapy.",

Vitamin-K antagonists have a number of well documented shortcomings. Recently the results of randomised trials for three new oral anticoagulants that do not exhibit the limitations of vitamin-K antagonists have been published. These include direct factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran). The studies (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, AVERROES) provide promising results for the new agents, including higher efficacy and a significantly lower incidence of intracranial bleeds compared with warfarin or aspirin. The new drugs show similar results in secondary as well as in primary stroke prevention in patients with AF. Apixaban was demonstrated to be clearly superior to aspirin and had the same rate of major bleeding complications. Meta-analyses show that the novel anticoagulants are superior to warfarin for the reduction of stroke, major bleeding and intracranial bleeds. New anticoagulants add to the therapeutic options for patients with AF, and offer a number of advantages over warfarin, for both the clinician and patient, including a favorable bleeding profile and convenience of use. Aspirin is no longer an option in secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Consideration of these new anticoagulants will improve clinical decision making.",

However in populations of medical patients although prolonged anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis has been shown to be efficacious it also results in more bleeding and the risk benefit is not clear.

The three major routes of HTLV-1 transmission are mother-to-child infections via breast milk, sexual intercourse, and blood transfusions. A HTLV-1 infection early in life, presumably from breast feeding, is crucial to the development of ATL. The estimated cumulative risk of developing ATL among HTLV-1-positive individuals is about 3% after transmission from the mother. The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subtype-classification into acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types defined by organ involvement, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and calcium values. For the acute, lymphoma and unfavorable chronic subtypes (aggressive ATL), and the favorable chronic and smoldering subtypes (indolent ATL), intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation and watchful waiting until disease progression has been recommended, respectively, in Japan. A retrospective analysis suggested that the combination of interferon alpha and zidovudine was promising for the treatment of ATL, especially for leukemic subtypes.

They predominantly occur in extranodal sites, including the nasal or paranasal areas, and less frequently in the localized nodal lesion. Most of the tumor cells exhibit a cytotoxic phenotype, characterized primarily by the expression of granzyme B and perforin. EBV is usually detected in tumor cells by using EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization (EBER), suggesting that EBV plays an important role in lymphomagenesis. In this chapter, we have described 2 diseases: 1) extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL), representative of extranodal EBV-associated NK/T-cell lymphoma; and 2) nodal cytotoxic molecule-positive EBV-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not specified type (CM\u00a0+\u00a0EBV\u00a0+\u00a0PTCL-N), representative of nodal lymphoma. Both ENKL and nodal CM\u00a0+\u00a0EBV\u00a0+\u00a0PTCL-N are intractable to standard chemotherapy. Although ENKL is sensitive to radiotherapy, it shows a poorer response to chemotherapeutic agents than other lymphomas because of P-glycoprotein expression. P-glycoprotein is a product of the multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene, which is a major cause of the refractoriness of malignant lymphomas to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens containing anthracycline. l-asparaginase-containing regimens such as SMILE (steroid, methotrexate, ifosfamide, l-asparaginase, and etoposide) are effective for ENKL.

There is no consensus on the best front line therapy or management of relapsed/refractory disease. The use of autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been studied in both settings to improve outcomes. Multiple retrospective and several prospective trials were reported. While at first sight the outcomes in the relapsed/refractory setting appear similar in B-cell and T-cell lymphomas when treated with high dose therapy (HDT) and autologous HCT, it is becoming obvious that only specific subtypes of PTCL benefit from this approach (i.e. anaplastic large cell lymphoma [ALCL] and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma [AITL] in second CR). In less favorable histologies, HDT seems to provide limited benefit, with the majority of patients experiencing post-transplant relapse. The use of autologous HCT to consolidate first remission has been evaluated in several prospective trials. Again, the best results were observed in ALCL, but the superiority of this approach over chemotherapy alone needs confirmation in randomized trials. In less favorable histologies, high-dose consolidation resulted in low survival rates comparable to those obtained with chemotherapy alone, and without randomized trials it is hard to recommend this strategy to all patients with newly diagnosed PT/NKCL. Allogeneic HCT might provide potent and potentially curative graft-vs-lymphoma effect and overcome chemotherapy resistance. Only a few studies have been reported to date on allogeneic HCT in PT/NKCL. Based on available data, eligible patients benefit significantly from this approach, with 50% or more patients achieving long-term disease control or cure, although at the expense of significant treatment related mortality (TRM). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens appear to have lower TRM and might extend this approach to older patients. With the recent approval of several novel agents for relapsed/refractory PT/NKCL and their impact on survival of patients after relapse, it is becoming even more difficult to assess the benefit of HCT on overall survival and apply the results of non-randomized studies to clinical practice. Development of effective clinico-pathologic prognostic models might provide the opportunity to better define the role of HCT for patients with various subtypes of PT/NKCL. The first randomized trial comparing upfront autologous and allogeneic HCT was initiated by the German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group, and the results of this study might help answer some of the controversies for the first time.",

These include targeting stem-cell properties, such as self-renewal, inducing cycling of quiescent LSCs to sensitize them to conventional agents, employing or inducing immune-based mechanisms, and targeting tumor-specific physiology. Agents such as parthenolide inhibit the ability of leukemic stem cells to respond to oxidative stress and make leukemic stem cells and bulk leukemic cells susceptible to cell death, while normal stem cells remain relatively unharmed by these agents. The major mechanism of action of these small molecules appears to revolve around the aberrant glutathione metabolism pathway found in leukemic cells.",

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease, with biologically and prognostically different subtypes distinguished by cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis, as recognised in the latest (2008) WHO classification system. However, since the publication of this schema, application of various high throughout technologies including whole genome and exome sequencing of AML cases has revealed a plethora of recurrent mutational targets, including a number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, not previously implicated in leukaemogenesis. Deciphering the combinations of mutations that cooperate to induce AML and determining which particular alterations (or\u00a0combinations) confer independent prognostic information represent major ongoing challenges, which will necessitate analysis of large cohort sizes involving international cooperation. However, the uncertainty concerning optimal risk-stratification of AML based on the rapidly evolving picture emerging from molecular genetic profiling provides a strong rationale for evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection as a tool to refine outcome prediction. This modality may not only capture differences in treatment response that reflect the underlying molecular heterogeneity, but also inter-patient variability in drug availability and metabolism, which may also significantly influence outcome. Developments in leukaemia diagnostics coupled with the possibility that MRD may be tracked using molecular and/or flow cytometry-based methods in the majority of patients hold considerable promise to inform more personalised approaches to therapy.",

Accordingly, several groups asked the question of whether the outcome of allogeneic HCT has improved, and if so, why. Four large studies including a total of more than 10,000 patients have been performed and have reached very similar conclusions. Compared to transplants performed in the 1990s, the hazard ratio for nonrelapse mortality for transplants performed in the 2000s was roughly 0.5. This remarkable improvement was seen when the analyses were restricted to myeloablative transplants, to recipients of marrow rather than peripheral blood, or to transplants from matched siblings, and persisted after analyses were adjusted for patient risk. Likely explanations for this improvement include the avoidance of the most toxic preparative regimens, use of agents that spare hepatic and renal function, and improved methods for control of infections.",

GVHD of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is closely associated with non-relapse mortality (NRM) following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Using an unbiased, large-scale, quantitative proteomic discovery approach, we identified candidate biomarkers that were increased in plasma from HCT patients with GI GVHD. We then validated the lead candidate, REG3\u03b1, by ELISA in samples from more than 1000 HCT patients from three transplant centers. Plasma REG3\u03b1 concentrations were 3-fold higher in patients at GI GVHD onset than in all other patients. REG3\u03b1 concentrations correlated most closely with lower GI GVHD at GVHD onset and predicted response to therapy at 4 weeks, 1-year NRM, and 1-year survival (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Multivariate analysis showed that advanced clinical stage, severe histologic damage, and high REG3\u03b1 concentrations at the diagnosis of GVHD independently predicted 1-year NRM, which progressively increased with higher numbers of onset risk factors present. We conclude that REG3\u03b1 is a plasma biomarker of GI GVHD that can be combined with clinical stage and histologic grade to improve risk stratification of patients, perhaps providing a platform for advances in the treatment of high-risk GVHD.",

Then I will extend these findings to the focus of the Acute Leukemia Forum to address potentially new approaches to therapies of acute leukemias. Somatic and germline mutations of acute leukemias are unfortunately caused by arrays of somatic and germline mutations. Simultaneous targeting of so many mutations makes it not possible to efficiently target\u00a0all for cure. Albeit we should be aware that we should not in the near future ignore targeted therapy of those functionally important genetic and epigenetic events that are either initiating or contributing to aggressivity of acute leukemia, as these may be ameliorated by targeted intervention against one, or even a few together, of these defined molecular lesions.

Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of children and neonates with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are mostly extrapolated from adult data, despite the uniqueness of their hemostatic system.

Follow-up data for VTE recurrence in children suggest a recurrence rate between 3% (neonates) and 21% (idiopathic VTE). Apart from underlying medical conditions, recently reported systematic reviews on pediatric VTE and stroke have shown significant associations between thrombosis and presence of factor V G1691A, factor II G20210A, protein C-, protein S- and antithrombin deficiency, even more pronounced when combined IT were involved. The pooled odds ratios (OR: single IT) for VTE onset ranged from 2.4 for the factor II G20210A mutation (cerebrovascular occlusion) to 9.4 in children with antithrombin deficiency (venous VTE).

Due to a lack of evidence, counselling air travellers on their venous thrombosis risk is not immediately straightforward, and advice will have to be based mostly on theoretical grounds. In this review a basis for these considerations is given.First of all it needs to be recognized that venous thrombosis is a multicausal disease, i.e. several risk factors have to be present before an event occurs. This is reflected in the literature where clearly increased risks have been described for certain groups, such as subjects with factor V Leiden, those who use oral contraceptives or are obese. Also, an increased risk for tall and short people has been reported. So, for subjects with a known risk factor who plan to travel, benefits and risks of thrombosis prophylaxis, (pharmacological or other), need to be weighed. This review provides some theoretical examples. For all other travellers, the advice to move and exercise as much as possible is likely to be sufficient.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 10% of all patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) die within the first three months after diagnosis. However, PE is not universally life-threatening, but covers a wide spectrum of clinical severity and death risk. Thrombolytic treatment is indicated patients with acute massive PE who are at high risk for early death, i.e. those patients who present with arterial hypotension and shock. On the other hand, low molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is adequate treatment for most normotensive patients with PE. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, given as 100 mg infusion over 2 h, is the treatment of choice for patients with PE, although older regimens using urokinase or streptokinase are also efficacious. Beyond the relatively small numbers of patients with massive, high-risk PE as a target population for thrombolysis, there is increasing awareness of the need for risk stratification of normotensive patients and the search for an intermediate-risk group (also called submassive PE). Recent meta-analyses of cohort studies suggest that imaging of the right ventricle or biomarkers of myocardial injury alone may be insufficient for guiding therapeutic decisions. Instead, accumulating evidence appears to support strategies which combine the information provided by an imaging procedure with a biomarker test. These data provide the rationale for a large multinational randomized trial which has set out to determine whether normotensive patients with right ventricular dysfunction, detected by echocardiography or computed tomography, plus evidence of myocardial injury as indicated by a positive troponin test, may benefit from early thrombolytic treatment. This study, which is underway in 13 European countries, will enroll a total of 1000 patients and will be completed in 2012. Together with a parallel trial currently being conducted in the United States, it will hopefully answer the question whether thrombolysis is indicated in submassive PE, thus terminating a 40-year-old debate and filling an important gap in our management concept for acute pulmonary embolism.",

While autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) can provide lengthy disease-free survival in select patients, cure generally is not an expected outcome with this approach. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), which can exploit the potential benefits of graft-versus-lymphoma (GVL) effect, has been shown in multiple studies to yield a small but reproducible portion of patients with long-term remission more suggestive of cure. Historically, alloHCT for MCL was administered after myeloablative conditioning, but this approach was limited by early non-relapse mortality. Development of reduced-intensity (RI)-alloHCT has abrogated some of the early post-transplant risks, allowing this potentially effective therapy to be offered to a larger number of affected individuals. The trends in published data reflect a preference toward using RI-alloHCT for MCL, often because patients in whom alloHCT is being considered have relapsed disease following myeloablative autoHCT. Further efforts to spare the effects of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) while still evoking GVL remain a focus of investigation in this area. In this review, we will discuss the application of alloHCT in the management of MCL, the factors associated with outcome, the different methods in which it can be performed, and the strategies that can be employed in post-alloHCT relapse.",

However, only a portion of patients respond and durability is limited. Numerous resistance mechanisms have been identified, including paradoxical Akt activation. Currently, several ongoing trials are combining mTOR inhibitors with other agents that either block upstream components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis or that inhibit complementary signaling pathways, with hopes of improving outcomes. Dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 using small molecule catalytic site inhibitors against the mTOR kinase may also prove to be superior to first generation agents, but clinical data remains nascent.

     "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is considered an aggressive and incurable B-cell malignancy despite current available treatments that include the incorporation of rituximab, bortezomib, high-dose cytarabine, and for those eligible, high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplant (HDC-ASCT). Patients with relapsed/refractory MCL represent a challenge for the treating physician stressing the need to develop therapeutic agents. Lenalidomide, a novel inmmunomodulatory drug (IMiD), is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma. Biologically, the mechanisms responsible for lenalidomide activity are yet to be clearly defined. Based on pre-clinical models and early correlative studies conducted parallel to clinical trials, lenalidomide has been found to enhance NK-cell and T-cell activity against tumor cells, alter the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the tumor bed, inhibit angiogenesis, and to a lesser degree, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. Together, all these biological effects appear to play a role in the activity observed in lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide. Given the effect in NK- and T-cell function, lenalidomide is an alternative strategy to enhance the anti-tumor activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).Clinical responses have been observed in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and MCL. The favorable toxicity profile and route of administration made the use of lenalidomide an attractive therapy for certain types of patients (i.e. elderly, chemotherapy unfit, etc.). The erratic but serious incidence of tumor lysis syndrome and/or tumor flare reactions provides challenges in the incorporation of lenalidomide in the management of previously untreated lymphoma patients with bulky adenopathy.Early studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of lenalidomide in combination with steroids or rituximab/bendamustine in MCL are promising and warrant further study. In addition, the evaluation of lenalidomide in the maintenance setting (i.e. post HDC-ASCT) or in combination with other target specific agents (i.e. proteasome inhibitors) in MCL is being addressed in ongoing clinical trials. We provide a general overview of the clinical development of lenalidomide in MCL. Future translational and clinical studies will further define the role of lenalidomide in the management of de novo or relapsed/refractory MCL and may assist in the identification of subset of MCL patients most likely to gain clinical benefit from this exiting agent.",

Infusional regimens like dose adjusted EPOCH-R appear to be highly effective first-line therapy and for relapsed patients high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support is well-tolerated and effective. However, it should be recognized that there are unique risks associated with management of lymphoma in this patient population. While opportunistic infections are no longer a significant cause of death, antiretroviral agents used for management of HIV infection may interact with chemotherapeutic agents and other adjunctive therapies making communication between the treating Oncologist and the patient's primary HIV treatment provider of prime importance.",

     "abstract": "Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive brain tumor with an unsatisfactory outcome. Therapeutic progress in this field is strongly conditioned by the limited biology and the molecular knowledge about this disease, which hamperizes the identification of new targeted therapies and the poor clinical conditions and performance status of patients, rendering very difficult their enrollment in prospective trials.Chemoradiation therapy is the most commonly used strategy for patients with PCNSL, which is associated with better efficacy rates, but also with high incidence of severe neurotoxicity. As a consequence, a dilemma in PCNSL treatment is the choice between strategies designed to intensify therapy to improve the cure rate, versus strategies of treatment de-escalation to avoid severe neurotoxicity. The efficacy of chemotherapy is strongly limited by the special functional and microenvironmental characteristics of the CNS, which is variably protected by the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and includes extensive chemotherapy sanctuaries where tumor cells grow undisturbed. Drugs exhibiting a good capability to cross the BBB and drugs that can be safely administered at high doses to obtain therapeutic concentrations in the CNS are the most commonly used in the treatment of PCNSL.Consolidation after chemotherapy represents the best role for radiotherapy. Since this tumor has an infiltrative nature, the whole brain should be irradiated, with increased risk of severe neurotoxicity. Some authorities are investigating in randomized trials the impact on outcome and neurotolerability of replacing consolidation radiotherapy with other strategies, like high dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell transplantation. The rationale for the use of this strategy is the administration of high doses of cytostatics to achieve therapeutic concentrations in sanctuaries, CNS organs and lymphoma tissues and to overcome drug resistance mechanisms.Future therapeutic progresses in PCNSL will be based on the expansion of molecular and biological knowledge, the improvement of therapeutic efficacy and the prevention of iatrogenic neurotoxicity.",

Although most older patients receive only supportive care, the principal prognostic factor among the presumably healthier treated patients is cytogenetics, with a monosomal karyotype conferring a particularly poor prognosis. However other factors are also informative and several systems incorporating multiple factors have been devised to help guide the fundamental decision as to whether a patient should receive standard therapy or, much more frequently, investigational therapy. Although physicians may be reluctant to await results of cytogenetic analysis and molecular markers (NPM, FLT3), data suggest no harm is done by waiting for these results to become available; certainly the risk of delaying therapy is less than the risk of giving a patient 3\u00a0+\u00a07 when the risk of treatment-related mortality (TRM) is greater than the chance of a beneficial response. Nonetheless, in general the risk of TRM is less than that of resistance to therapy, even in patients aged \u226575 years. Perhaps, however, focusing on the former, there is an increasing tendency to administer azacitidine or decitabine to older patients. However there is little to suggest that on average these drugs by themselves convey what many patients would consider medically meaningful improvements in survival. Hence these drugs should not reduce the imperative of putting older patients on trials involving new drugs. Finally, confirming everyday observation, age alone is a very inadequate predictor of outcome and is likely a surrogate for other covariates. Accordingly, the common practice of assigning patients to treatment protocols based solely on age leaves much to be desired.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation provides the only potential curative option in many patients with hematological malignancies. Finding a suitably matched donor in a timely manner is often difficult. However, most patients have a partially HLA-mismatched (HLA-haploidentical) first-degree relative readily available. Historically, HLA-haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been considered extremely high risk due to high rates of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Modifications of the stem cell graft, such as T-cell depletion, have resulted in poor rates of engraftment. We have recently completed a phase II clinical trial of nonmyeloablative HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic BMT followed by post-transplantation high-cyclophosphamide. High-dose cyclophosphamide has been shown to create immunogenic tolerance by specifically killing activated mature T-cells. As a result, alloreactive T-cells in the donor graft are selectively destroyed thereby decreasing the incidence of severe GVHD. As well, host-versus-graft reactive T-cells are also selectively eliminated thereby increasing rates of engraftment. Among 210 patients with hematological malignancies receiving nonmyeloablative, HLA-haploidentical BMT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, the rate of sustained donor cell engraftment has been 87%. The cumulative incidence of grade 2\u20134 acute GVHD is 27%, grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD is 5% and chronic GVHD is 15%. Interestingly, increasing HLA disparity between donor and recipient was not associated with increasing incidence of GVHD or decreased event-free survival. Nonmyeloablative haploidentical stem cell transplantation with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide seems to be a promising, potentially curative, option for patients with hematological malignancies who either lack an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or in whom a myeloablative preparative regimen is contraindicated due to significant co-morbidities or history of extensive pre-treatment.",

Historically, more emphasis was given to the intensity of conditioning. Over the last decade the pendulum turned more towards induction of GvL as the primary goal. A plethora of non-myeloablative (NMA) and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) were introduced trying to reduce transplant-related toxicities and allow SCT in elderly and medically infirm patients. In addition, reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimens (RTC) based on fludarabine and myeloablative alkylating-agent doses were designed to allow safer administration of dose-intensive therapy. Conditioning dose-intensity is highly correlated with outcome after SCT. Increased dose-intensity is associated with reduced relapse risk, but also with higher non-relapse mortality. Overall outcome is determined by the net effect of these opposing effects as may be predicted by patient age, comorbidities and disease status at transplantation. Retrospective comparative trials showed that while outcome may be similar with the various regimens in patients given SCT in remission, NMA/RIC are inferior when SCT is given in advanced disease, due to high relapse risk. RTC regimens may be more effective in this setting yet better tolerated by patients not eligible for myeloablative conditioning. Randomized studies are needed to define the role of different regimens. Future studies will also focus on the design of more accurate models to select the best regimen in each setting. A search for novel regimens or post-transplant approaches with more intensive anti-leukemic activity, but limited toxicity will also be of marked benefit.",

Furthermore, the incidence of relapse post transplant is not increased in patients transplanted for AML, MDS or ALL. In our series, the incidence of severe infections in HLA-matched recipients of such T-cell depleted grafts also does not differ from that detected following similarly matched unmodified grafts. However, in recipients of HLA-haplotype disparate T-cell depleted grafts, the risk of lethal viral infections is increased and prolonged. In many cases, this risk is closely correlated with failures of immunodominant virus-specific donor T-cells transferred in the graft to recognize infected host cells because they are restricted by HLA alleles not shared by the host. To address this limitation, we have developed a panel of artificial antigen presenting cells, each expressing a single prevalent HLA-allele. Using this panel, we are able to selectively generate virus-specific cytotoxic T-cells of desired HLA restriction, to insure their effectiveness in HLA haplotype-disparate transplant recipients. We have also shown that partially HLA-matched, third party-derived EBV-specific T-cells, selected from our bank of previously generated and characterized GMP-grade cell lines on the basis of their HLA restriction, can induce durable remissions of rituximab-refractory EBV lymphomas.

Therefore, combining a \u2018megadose\u2019 of CD34+ HSCT with other tolerizing cells could potentially support and promote successful engraftment of haploidentical purified stem cell transplantation under a safer RIC. One approach to address this challenge could be afforded by using Donor CD8 T cells directed against 3rd-party stimulators, bearing an ex-vivo induced central memory phenotype (Tcm). These Tcm cells,depleted of GVH reactivity, were shown to be highly efficient in overcoming host T cells mediated rejection and in promoting fully mismatched bone-marrow (BM) engraftment, in HSCT murine models. This is likely due to the marked lymph node homing of the Tcm, their strong proliferative capacity and prolonged persistence in BM transplant recipients. Thus, combining anti 3rd-party Tcm cell therapy with a \u2018megadose\u2019 of purified CD34+ stem cells, could offer a safer RIC protocol for attaining hematopoietic chimerism in patients with hematological diseases and as a platform for organ transplantation or cell therapy in cancer patients.",

CD34\u00a0+\u00a0selection with magnetic microbeads resulted in 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/kg residual T cells. No post-transplant immune suppression was given. NK cells recovered rapidly after transplantation (300 CD56+/\u03bcL at day 30, median), whereas T cell recovery was delayed (median: 12 CD3+/\u03bcL at day 90). NK activity was measured as specific lysis of K 562 targets several times (mean: 3 assays per patient). Four temporal patterns of lytic activity could be differentiated: consistently low, consistently high, decreasing and increasing activity. Patients with consistently high or increasing activity had significantly lower relapse probability than patients with consistently low or decreasing levels (0.18 vs 0.73 at 2 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The subgroup of patients with ALL showed similar results (0.75 vs 0.14 at 2 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Speed of T cell recovery had no influence. These data suggest that both achieving and maintaining a high level of NK activity may contribute to prevent relapse. Since NK activity could be markedly increased by in\u00a0vitro stimulation with Interleukin 2\u00a0(IL-2), in\u00a0vivo administration should be considered.",

In addition, the ability to confer a suppressive phenotype to CD4 cells or to engineer a susceptibility gene into effector cells provides new therapeutic avenues for graft versus host disease (GVHD), the most challenging adverse effect arising post ASCT.Within this review, mechanisms of GVL and GVHD are discussed and we consider how they may be separated through T cell gene engineering.

We\u00a0studied 11 patients with acute leukemias/myelodysplastic syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (active disease and/or second stem cell transplantation, n\u00a0=\u00a08; \u2265CR 2, n\u00a0=\u00a02) and relapsed or progressive Ewings sarcoma (n\u00a0=\u00a02) who received prophylactic IL-2 treatment for a high probability of disease recurrence after allo-HSCT. Toxicities from IL-2 were transient fever, fatigue and local inflammation. In one patient GvHD grade III with no clear association to IL-2 administration occurred. IL-2 administration was started at median day 57 (range 13\u2013154) post-transplant for a mean duration of 28 days (range 15\u2013250). IL-2 administration clearly increased NK cell activity. 3 of 11 patients (ALL, AML, multifocal Ewings sarcoma) survived with a follow-up of ten years. In conclusion, long-term low-dose IL-2 subcutaneous application is feasible in children due to a low side effect profile even after HLA mismatched transplantation and may be a strategy to prevent relapse in pediatric malignancies with extremely high risk of relapse.",

Post-transplant immune depletion is particularly striking within the T cell compartment which is exquisitely sensitive to negative regulation, evidenced by the profound decline in thymic function with age. As a consequence, regeneration of the immune system remains a significant unmet clinical need. Over the past decade studies have revealed several promising therapeutic strategies to address ineffective lymphopoiesis and post-transplant immune deficiency. These include the use of cytokines such as IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15; growth factors and hormones like keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and growth hormone (GH); adoptive transfer of ex vivo-generated precursor T cells (pre-T) and sex steroid ablation (SSA). Moreover, recently several novel approaches have been proposed to generate whole thymii ex vivo using stem cell technologies and bioscaffolds. Increasingly, however, when transferred to the clinic, these strategies alone are not sufficient to restore thymopoiesis in all patients leading to the potential of combination strategies as a way to reign in non-responders. Synergistic enhancement in combination may be due to differential targets may therefore be effective in improving clinical outcomes in the transplant settings as well as in other lymphopenic states induced by high dose chemotherapy/radiation therapy or HIV, and may also be useful in improving responses to vaccination and augmenting anti-tumor immunotherapy.",

Recent data have demonstrated that fractionated radioimmunotherapy targeting CD22 with 90Y-epratuzumab tetraxetan achieved a high degree of durable complete responses in relapsed/refractory NHL. Despite the fact that these RIT agents clearly have unique non-cross reactive mechanisms of action with proven high clinical efficacy in patients resistant to both chemotherapy and rituximab, they have not been widely adopted by haemato-oncology community to date. This chapter reviews the progress that has been made in the development of clinical radioimmunotherapy in follicular lymphoma and suggest some guidelines to use it appropriately in first-line but also in the increasing number of patients emerging who are rituximab-refractory.",

Early stage clinical studies revealed that vaccination consisting of keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated lymphoma idiotype protein in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induced tumor-specific immune responses and molecular remission in patients with follicular lymphoma. Three double-blind, randomized, Phase III trials were conducted to further determine the clinical benefit of this vaccine therapy. Compared to the placebo, prolonged disease-free survival in vaccinated patients was concluded only in one study where all the patients enrolled in the trial already had complete remission from induction chemotherapy. Next generation idiotype vaccines are being developed with the focus on simplifying vaccine formulation and potentiating tumor-specific immunity. This category includes genetically modified idiotype single-chain DNA vaccine, liposome-encapsulated idiotype vaccine and dendritic cell vaccine. Although preclinical data supported the immunogenicity and therapeutic advantage of these new vaccines, their clinical benefits remain to be tested. Optimizing new generation idiotype vaccines may require combination with immune adjuvants that potentiate vaccine-induced antitumor immunity, have direct effects against tumor or block immune regulatory checkpoints. Moreover, identification of a universal follicular lymphoma antigen is important for future development of vaccine therapy against this disease.",

Nevertheless, follicular lymphoma remains incurable and characterized by recurrent relapses requiring additional treatment. An increasing number of effective drugs are now being evaluated either alone or in combinations including the chemotherapy drugs bendamustine and bortezomib. More targeted agents include monoclonal antibodies and their derivatives such as drug-antibody conjugates and small modular immunopharmaceuticals. Other agents inhibit various cellular pathways including those triggered by the B-cell receptor, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, and other intracellular pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PI3-kinase, and apoptosis, and drugs that target the tumor microenvironment, notably the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide.

Early removal of non-adherent cells may result in the elimination of a late adhering MSC subsets and late removal increases the influence of undesired cells on the growth and differentiation of MSC. Finally, in conventional protocols MSC are co-expanded together with macrophages, endothelial cells and other adherent cells. To circumvent these limitations, several strategies have been developed to facilitate the prospective isolation of MSC based on the selective expression or absence of surface markers.

However, the processes involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases are more complicated and treatment cannot be administered before disease induction. In autoimmune diseases persistent antigenic stimulation recruits endogenous MSC to the site of lesion that contribute to the fibrotic evolution.

In fact, MSC are not constitutively immunosuppressive but require a \u2018licensing\u2019 step provided by molecules of acute phase inflammation, like IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, or toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.

A\u00a0significant rescue of neural cells has been achieved also when MSC were administered in experimental brain ischemia and in animals undergoing brain or spinal cord injury.

Heterozygous deletions may contain a tumor suppressor gene that undergoes homozygous inactivation or may contain one or more genes that alter the disease phenotype through haploinsufficiency. The most common karyotypic abnormality in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is deletion of chromosome 5q. A subset of patients with del(5q) as a sole cytogenetic abnormality has a consistent set of clinical features, termed the 5q- syndrome. While no tumor suppressor genes have been identified on 5q that are homozygously inactivated, recent studies have highlighted several genes and micro RNAs (miRNAs) that cause the phenotype of the 5q- syndrome through allelic insufficiency. For example, deletion of one allele of the RPS14 gene causes a severe defect in erythropoiesis, analogous to the congenital syndrome Diamond Blackfan anemia, which is itself caused by mutations that inactivate one allele of a ribosomal gene. Loss of one allele of miR-145 and miR-146a causes an increase in megakaryocyte production and may contribute to the clonal advantage of cells with del(5q).

The association of these subgroups with the expression of specific immunophenotypic markers reflecting arrest at specific T-cell developmental stages will be reviewed. These strong associations urge the need to extensively study oncogenic rearrangements and immunophenotypic markers in relation to outcome for future treatment protocols, both for paediatric as well as adult T-ALL patients.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, the presence of specific genetic aberrations is progressively used for classification and treatment stratification, because acute leukemias with the same oncogenetic aberration generally form a clinically and diagnostically homogenous disease entity with comparable prognosis. Many oncogenetic aberrations in acute leukemias result in a fusion gene, which is transcribed into fusion transcripts and translated into fusion proteins, which are assumed to play a critical role in the oncogenetic process. Fusion gene aberrations are detected by karyotyping, FISH, or RT-PCR analysis. However, these molecular genetic techniques are laborious and time consuming, which is in contrast to flow cytometric techniques. Therefore we developed a flow cytometric immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins in lysates of leukemia cell samples by use of a bead-bound catching antibody against one side of the fusion protein and fluorochrome-conjugated detection antibody. So far, we have been able to design such fusion protein immunobead assays for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA, TEL-AML1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11. The immunobead assay for detection of fusion proteins can be performed within 3 to 4 hours in a routine diagnostic setting, without the need of special equipment other than a flow cytometer. The novel immunobead assay will enable fast and easy classification of acute leukemia patients that express fusion proteins. Such patients can be included at an early stage in the right treatment protocols, much faster than by use of current molecular techniques. The immunobead assay can be run in parallel to routine immunophenotyping and is particularly attractive for clinical settings without direct access to molecular diagnostics.",

This advance was accompanied by an increasingly greater understanding of the immunophenotypic features of leukemic and normal lymphoid cells, and of the antigenic differences that make MRD studies possible. In parallel, molecular methods for MRD detection were established. The systematic application of immunologic and molecular techniques to study MRD in clinical samples has demonstrated the clinical significance of MRD in patients, leading to the use of MRD to regulate treatment intensity in many contemporary protocols. In this article, we discuss methodologic issues related to the immunologic monitoring of MRD and the evidence supporting its clinical significance, and compare the advantages and limitations of this approach to those of molecular monitoring of MRD.",

However, increasingly, phenotypes are delineated which can serve as surrogates for underlying genetic aberrations of clinical importance.

This chapter will focus on established surrogate marker profiles, such as those for PML/RAR\u03b1, AML1/ETO, FLT3-gene mutated acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and BCR/ABLPOS ALL.

     "abstract": "Mast cells (MC) are specialized immune cells that play a key role in anaphylactic reactions. Growth, differentiation, and function of these cells are regulated by a complex network of cytokines, surface receptors, signaling molecules, the microenvironment, and the genetic background. A number of previous and more recent data suggest that MC are heterogeneous in terms of cytokine-regulation, expression of cytoplasmic and cell surface antigens, and response to ligands. MC heterogeneity is often organ-specific and is considered to be related to MC plasticity, disease-associated factors, and the maturation stage of the cells. The stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT (CD117) is expressed on all types of MC independent of maturation and activation-status. In systemic mastocytosis (SM), KIT is often expressed in MC in a mutated and constitutively activated form. In these patients, MC aberrantly display CD2 and CD25, diagnostic markers of neoplastic MC in all SM variants. In advanced SM, MC co-express substantial amounts of CD30, whereas CD2 expression on MC may be decreased compared to indolent SM. Other surface molecules, such as CD63 or CD203c, are overexpressed on neoplastic MC in SM, and are further upregulated upon cross-linking of the IgE receptor. Some of the cell surface antigens expressed on MC or their progenitors may serve as therapeutic targets in the future. These targets include CD25, CD30, CD33, CD44, and CD117/KIT. The current article provides an overview on cell surface antigens and target receptors expressed by MC in physiologic and reactive tissues, and in patients with SM, with special reference to phenotypic heterogeneity and clinical implications.",

Quantitative real-time and nested PCR guarantee highest sensitivities, but suitable markers for follow-up are available for \u223c60% of patients only: e.g. for those with reciprocal gene rearrangements or those with NPM1 mutations. On the other hand, for most AML patients, multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) represents a good option for MRD monitoring. In virtually all AML patients, leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) are detectable with MFC. These can be targeted with high sensitivity ranging up to 10\u22124 during the course of disease. Numerous studies demonstrated the prognostic power of the MRD levels determined by MFC at post-induction as well as post-consolidation time points in adults and children considered to be in hematologic remission of AML. The post-consolidation MRD status seems to have more prognostic power than post-induction levels. Thus, MFC can significantly contribute to risk assessment of patients with AML during and after treatment and allows clinicians to consider alternative strategies (e.g. allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) earlier. Clinical studies need to focus on a standardization of these approaches to facilitate the translation of MFC-based MRD assessment into therapeutic decisions in patients with AML.",

The transplant programs rely on the cord blood banks for all aspects of collection, screening, testing, processing and storage. Additionally the intermediary registries that are responsible for coordinating communications between the banks and transplant programs are important partners in a comprehensive approach to cord blood quality management.

Development of innovative strategies to improve the post-transplant recovery of T cells function is currently the main challenge to further improving the possibilities of unrelated cord blood transplantation.",

However, despite significant improvements, an appreciable proportion of patients (especially adults) receiving UCBT will still face some form of severe acute and/or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Moreover, poor engraftment and delayed immune recovery are still challenging issues. Therefore, in terms of both GVHD and engraftment kinetics, the immunosuppressive potency of the conditioning regimen prior to UCBT may play an important role. Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin\u2122) provides multifaceted immunomodulation suggesting that the use of ATG may be of interest towards improving engraftment and GVHD outcome. However, the role of ATG in UCBT is still under debate. This report will review the incidence and severity of GVHD after UCBT, and will discuss the potential role of ATG towards improving outcome (GVHD and engraftment) when used as part of the conditioning regimen prior to UCBT.",

However, review of all published studies of allogeneic HLA-matched or mismatched stem cell transplantation shows that the results on the relationship between donor\u2013recipient KIR(-ligand) (in)compatibility and outcomes are highly variable, ranging from highly beneficial to detrimental. Reasons for these differences may include the methodology to determine KIR(-ligand) incompatibility, the disease distribution and the transplant protocol or donor type. Two retrospective studies on the effects of KIR-ligand incompatibility in unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) for haematological malignancies have resulted in conflicting results. The Eurocord study showed a favourable effect of KIR-ligand mismatching on relapse incidence and leukaemia-free survival, whereas the Minneapolis study showed no effect on these end points and a detrimental effect on incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). In patients with non-malignant disorders, KIR-ligand (in)compatibility between donor and recipient was not associated with outcomes in a recent Eurocord analysis. Therefore, the role of natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity in UCBT is far from clear. It is too early to use a donor\u2013recipient KIR(-ligand) algorithm for selection of a cord blood donor.",

A scoring system compounding the results with a set of markers allows firming up the diagnosis. Other immunological markers such as CD38 and ZAP-70 have an important prognostic impact. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, chiefly by detecting 17p (TP53 locus) and 11q (ATM) deletions and mutational status of the IgVH gene, also provides prognostic information and may determine the type of therapy.

Genetic defects and stimuli originating from the microenvironment concur to the selection and expansion of the malignant clone. Several lines of evidence, including molecular and functional analysis of the monoclonal immunoglobulin, support the hypothesis that stimulation through the B-cell receptor affects life and death of leukaemic cells. The microenvironment also has a critical role in the survival and accumulation of leukaemic cells within lymphoid organs where signals delivered from the surrounding cells are likely crucial in inducing proliferation. Nevertheless, several major biological issues still remain to be solved including regulation of the balance between proliferation and survival of leukaemic cells and the links between emerging gene abnormalities and microenvironment.

However, in vivo labelling of CLL cells indicates a much more active rate of cell birth than originally estimated, suggesting that CLL is a dynamic disease.Here we review the observations that have led to these altered views of the activation state and proliferative capacities of CLL cells and also provide our interpretation of these observations in light of their potential impact on patients.",

The most common autoimmune complication is autoimmune haemolytic anaemia with a lower frequency of immune thrombocytopaenia and pure red blood cell aplasia and only rarely, autoimmune granulocytopaenia (AIG). Autoimmune cytopaenia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of cytopaenia in patients with CLL. Patients with CLL can also have more than one form of autoimmune cytopaenia, which can occur together with bone-marrow failure. Treatment is usually effective but rarely curative for autoimmune cytopaenia complicating CLL.

MRD can be assessed by either allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or four-colour cytofluorometry. Importantly, methods to determine MRD in CLL have been standardised. Nevertheless, MRD status should not be used as a goal of therapy outside clinical studies.
