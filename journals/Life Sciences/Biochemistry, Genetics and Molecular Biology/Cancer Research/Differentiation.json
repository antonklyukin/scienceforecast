     "abstract": "Androgen signaling is essential for prostate development, morphogenesis, and regeneration. Emerging evidence also indicates a regulatory role of Notch signaling in prostate development, differentiation, and growth. However, the collaborative regulatory mechanisms of androgen and Notch signaling during prostate development, growth, and regeneration are largely unknown. Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling pathways, and its expression is responsive to Notch signaling. Hes1-expressing cells have been shown to possess the regenerative capability to repopulate a variety of adult tissues. In this study, we developed new mouse models to directly assess the role of the androgen receptor in prostatic Hes1-expressing cells. Selective deletion of AR expression in embryonic Hes1-expressing cells impeded early prostate development both in vivo and in tissue xenograft experiments. Prepubescent deletion of AR expression in Hes1-expressing cells resulted in prostate glands containing abnormalities in cell morphology and gland architecture. A population of castration-resistant Hes1-expressing cells was revealed in the adult prostate, with the ability to repopulate prostate epithelium following androgen supplementation. Deletion of AR in Hes1-expressing cells diminishes their regenerative ability. These lines of evidence demonstrate a critical role for the AR in Notch-responsive cells during the course of prostate development, morphogenesis, and regeneration, and implicate a mechanism underlying interaction between the androgen and Notch signaling pathways in the mouse prostate.",

     "abstract": "Fish axial muscle consists of a series of W-shaped muscle blocks, called myomeres, that are composed primarily of multinucleated contractile muscle cells (myofibres) gathered together by an intricate network of connective tissue that transmits forces generated by myofibre contraction to the axial skeleton. This review summarises current knowledge on the successive and overlapping myogenic waves contributing to axial musculature formation and growth in fish. Additionally, this review presents recent insights into muscle connective tissue development in fish, focusing on the early formation of collagenous myosepta separating adjacent myomeres and the late formation of intramuscular connective sheaths (i.e. endomysium and perimysium) that is completed only at the fry stage when connective fibroblasts expressing collagens arise inside myomeres. Finally, this review considers the possibility that somites produce not only myogenic, chondrogenic and myoseptal progenitor cells as previously reported, but also mesenchymal cells giving rise to muscle resident fibroblasts.",

Furthermore, optimizing an in-vitro model of adipogenesis, which would help in understanding the possible effects and/or side effects of fat-soluble drugs and anti-obesity remedies, in addition to the developmental studies. Epigenetic is an important factor that is involved in cellular differentiation and commitment. This study aimed at investigating the effect of DNA methylation and histone deactylases inhibitors, 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) and Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), on the adipogenic differentiation process. The two modifiers were applied according to our previously published protocol, followed by three cycles of a classical, two-step adipogenesis protocol. The cells pretreated with SAHA showed enhanced expression of the many adipogenic genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 as well as the accumulation of intracytoplasmic fat as shown by oil red and Nile red staining and the secretion of adipokines, such as MCP-1 and IP-10. On contrary, 5-Aza-dC inhibited all these markers. In conclusion, adding the reported step with SAHA to the differentiation protocols could have an impact on the progress of the in-vitro fat regenerative approach. The possible role of 5-Aza-dC in the inhibition of adipogenesis can be of clinical interest and will need further characterization in the future.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins play an important role in the establishment of the sex-dependent structure of developing gonads. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the major players in the regulation of ECM. Our hypothesis was that the MMPs-dependent regulation of EMC is crucial for the establishment of the correct, either testis or ovary, structure of developing gonad. We cultured developing mouse gonads in vitro in the presence of the MMPs inhibitors (\u03b1-2-macroglobulin, leupeptin, phosphoramidon) or the MMPs activator, APMA (4-aminophenylmercuric acetate). These inhibitors and activator inhibit/activate, to a different degree, matrix metalloproteinases, but the exact mechanism of inhibition/activation remains unknown. We found that the MMP inhibitors increased accumulation of ECM in the developing gonads. The \u03b1-2-macroglobulin had the weakest, and the phosphoramidon the strongest effect on the ECM and the structure of the gonads. The \u03b1-2-macroglobulin caused a slight increase of ECM and did not disrupt the gonad structure. Leupeptin led to the strong accumulation of ECM, resulted in the formation of the structures resembling testis cords in both testes and ovaries, and caused increase of apoptosis and complete loss of germ cells. Phosphoramidon caused the strongest accumulation of ECM, which separated individual cells and completely prevented intercellular adhesion both in the testes and in the ovaries. As a result of aberrant morphology, the sex of the phosphoramidon-treated gonads was morphologically unrecognizable. The APMA - the activator of MMP caused ECM loss, which led to the loss of cell adhesion, cell dispersion and an aberrant morphology of the gonads. These results indicate that the ECM accumulation is MMPs-dependent and that the correct amount and distribution of ECM during gonad development plays a key role in the formation of the gonad structure.",

To date, there are not many findings published in the field, and the aim of this review is to cover all current publications in this area. The liver is the main site of hematopoiesis during fetal development. However, little is known about how hepatic and other non-hematopoietic progenitors potentially influence hematopoiesis and vice versa. The concurrent peaks of hepatic and hematopoietic progenitor proliferation during development indicate interactions that could possibly be mediated through cell-cell contact, extracellular matrices, cytokines and growth factors, or other signaling molecules. For example, hepatic progenitors, such as hepatic stem cells and hepatoblasts, possess characteristic surface markers that can be cleaved, giving rise to fragments of various lengths. A surface molecule of hepatoblasts has been demonstrated to play an essential role in hematopoiesis. Particularly, these effects on hematopoiesis were distinct, depending on whether it was membrane-bound or cleaved. In this review, the various hepatic and hematopoietic progenitor cell types are concisely described, and the current findings of their potential interactions are summarized.",

Current preclinical drug testing does not predict hepatotoxicity which highlights the importance of developing highly predictive cell-based models.

HLCs derived from both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have been used to accurately predict hepatotoxicity as well as to test individual-specific toxicity. Although there are still many limitations, mainly related to the lack of fully maturity of the HLCs derived from pluripotent stem cells, they could provide a relative unlimited and consistent supply of cells with stable phenotype, that could be obtained from different donors, enabling the generation of a library of HLCs representative of the variability of human population.",

     "abstract": "The unique microenvironment found within the liver in vivo plays a key role in the induction of functional maturation in the developing hepatocyte. During organogenesis, hepatocytes acquire a polar phenotype that allows them to perform their functions of bile production and transport, protein synthesis, metabolism, and detoxification simultaneously, independently, and efficiently. It is thought that the induction of polarity and functional maturation in hepatocytes is dependent on the complex interplay of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. While this process is highly efficient in the human liver, it has been shown that hepatocytes rapidly lose their functions when placed in cell culture. This poses a challenge for the development of a bioartificial liver (BAL) support system, which utilizes a live cellular source to perform hepatic functions in the event of acute liver failure or primary nonfunction. However, once the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of hepatocyte polarity are fully identified, it will be possible to develop highly functional hepatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). This new cell line would be an ideal cellular source for a BAL system, as it would have both the functionality and longevity to support a patient through the entire clinical course of treatment. In this review, we explore the literature that has examined the potential mechanisms that induce polarity in the developing hepatocyte and discuss the future implications of this knowledge in a clinical setting from a bioengineering perspective.",

     "abstract": "Mid-gestation mouse ventricles (E11.5) contain a larger number of Nkx2.5+ cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). The proliferation rates are consistently higher in CPCs compared to myocyte population of developing ventricles. Recent studies suggested that CPCs are an ideal donor cell type for replacing damaged tissue in diseased hearts. Thus, the ability to isolate and expand CPCs from embryos or stem cell cultures could be useful for cell fate studies and regenerative therapies. Since embryonic CPCs possess fewer mitochondria compared to cardiomyocytes, we reasoned that CPCs can be fractionated using a fluorescent mitochondrial membrane potential dye (TMRM) and these cells may retain cardiomyogenic potential even in the absence of cardiomyocytes (CMs). FACS sorting of TMRM stained embryonic ventricular cells indicated that over 99% of cells in TMRM high fraction stained positive for sarcomeric myosin (MF20) and all of them expressed Nkx2.5. Although majority of cells present in TMRM low fraction expressed Nkx2.5, very few cells (~1%) stained positive for MF20. Further culturing of TMRM low cells over a period of 48\u202fh showed a progressive increase in MF20 positive cells. Additional analyses revealed that MF20 negative cells in TMRM low fraction do not express markers for endothelial cells (vWF, CD31) or smooth muscle cells (SM myosin). Treatment of TMRM low cells with known cardiogenic factors DMSO and dynorphin B significantly increased the percentage of MF20+ cells compared to untreated cultures. Collectively, these studies suggest that embryonic CPCs can be separated as a TMRM low fraction and their differentiation potential can be enhanced by exogenous addition of known cardiomyogenic factors.",

     "abstract": "Horse serum is commonly used as an additive to support the maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells in culture. However, the wide variability in the performance of different lots calls for parallel testing of multiple batches over extended periods of culture. Identification of the serum components that determine hematopoietic support would therefore save considerable time and effort and would help to standardize culture procedures. We report here that the ability of horse serum to support the self-renewal of multipotent murine hematopoietic progenitor FDCP-Mix cells is correlated to the concentration of specific fatty acid products of phospholipase A2 and more closely to the spectrum of eicosanoids generated by their further processing through cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Supportive sera have low levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and inflammatory eicosanoids. This links known markers of inflammation, infection and platelet activation to the ability of serum to maintain progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state, providing a means for prospective identification of suitable sera as well as quality control of the production process.",

It was down-regulated upon spontaneously differentiation by embryoid body formation and induced differentiation along ectoderm, mesoderm and extraembryonic lineages, but up-regulated along endoderm differentiation. The knockdown of Cx43 and GJIC had no effect on the maintenance of hESC, as demonstrated by no morphological changes and similar expression levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA-3 and SSEA-4) and early differentiation markers (KRT8 and KRT18). Meanwhile, Cx43 knock down had no effect on endodermal markers (SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4) expression when hESC were differentiating into definitive endoderm lineage. On the contrary, it led to lower levels of mesodermal markers (CD56, CD34 and PDGFR-\u03b1) when cells were undergoing mesoderm differentiation. When compared to control, Cx43 knockdown led to higher attachment rate, HCG secretion and cell invasion of the hESC derived trophoblastic cells. Cx43 knockdown also resulted in up-regulated expressions of placental hormone (\u03b2-hCG) and implantation related genes (LIFR, CDH5, LEP, PGF, TGFBR2).

     "publication date": "02-2019",
     "abstract": "Considerable work has gone into creating cell therapies from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) since their discovery just over a decade ago. However, comparatively little research has been done concerning the safety of iPSCs and their progeny and specifically the mechanisms governing teratogenicity. The aim of this study was to ascertain at what developmental phase iPSCs undergoing differentiation to an alveolar-like phenotype lose their capacity to form a teratoma and uncover potential mechanisms responsible. iPSCs were differentiated using a previously published directed differentiation protocol mirroring alveolar embryogenesis. At each developmental phase cell phenotype was assessed and cells mixed with Matrigel and injected subcutaneously above the hind limbs of NSG mice to determine teratogenicity. A genetic screen of 42 genes commonly associated with teratoma formation was conducted on all the cells and any resulting teratoma. It was found that neither NKX2-1 lung progenitors nor terminally differentiated alveolar-like cells formed teratomas. As expected the expression of pluripotency markers was diminished over differentiation. However, the expression of two proteoglycans, decorin and lumican, was increased more than 3000x during differentiation. Both decorin and lumican are putative tumor suppressors with additional functions in angiogenesis, fibrosis, inflammation and autophagy. We hypothesize that the increasing expression of these proteoglycans by iPSCs as they differentiate may act to inhibit host endothelial cell recruitment when implanted resulting in the inhibition of any teratoma formation by any remaining undifferentiated iPSCs.",

     "abstract": "Endogenous cell signals regulate tissue homeostasis and are significant for directing the fate of stem cells. During liver development, cytokines released from various cell types are critical for stem/progenitor cell differentiation and lineage expansions. To determine mechanisms in these stage-specific lineage interactions, we modeled potential effects of soluble signals derived from immortalized human fetal liver parenchymal cells on stem cells, including embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. For identifying lineage conversion and maturation, we utilized conventional assays of cell morphology, gene expression analysis and lineage markers. Molecular pathway analysis used functional genomics approaches. Metabolic properties were analyzed to determine the extent of hepatic differentiation. Cell transplantation studies were performed in mice with drug-induced acute liver failure to elicit benefits in hepatic support and tissue regeneration. These studies showed signals emanating from fetal liver cells induced hepatic differentiation in stem cells. Gene expression profiling and comparison of regulatory networks in immature and mature hepatocytes revealed stem cell-derived hepatocytes represented early fetal-like stage. Unexpectedly, differentiation-inducing soluble signals constituted metabolomics products and not proteins. In stem cells exposed to signals from fetal cells, mechanistic gene networks of upstream regulators decreased pluripotency, while simultaneously inducing mesenchymal and epithelial properties. The extent of metabolic and synthetic functions in stem cell-derived hepatocytes was sufficient for providing hepatic support along with promotion of tissue repair to rescue mice in acute liver failure. During this rescue, paracrine factors from transplanted cells contributed in stimulating liver regeneration. We concluded that hepatic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells with metabolomics products will be significant for developing therapies. The differentiation mechanisms involving metabolomics products could have an impact on advancing recruitment of stem/progenitor cells during tissue homeostasis.",

The extracellular cAMP gradient is believed to cause cells to form a slug-shaped multicellular structure and fruiting body. The cAMP receptor, cAR1, was not expressed at the cell surface during these stages, correlating with reduced chemotactic activity. G\u03b2-null cells expressing temperature sensitive G\u03b2 are unable to generate extracellular cAMP (Jin et al., 1998) and thus unable to aggregate and exhibit proper morphogenesis under restrictive temperature. However, when mixed with wild type cells ts-G\u03b2 expressing g\u03b2-null cells normally aggregated and exhibited normal morphogenesis under restrictive temperature. Furthermore, cells migrated after aggregation in a mixture containing wild-type cells. KI-5 cells, which do not show aggregation or morphogenesis, spontaneously migrated to a transplanted wild-type tip and underwent normal morphogenesis and cell differentiation; this was not observed in cells lacking tgrB1and tgrC1 cells adhesion molecules.

The cells shared a similar phenotype to that of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), including plastic adherence, antigen expression profile, and in vitro multilineage differentiation potential. Fetal liver (FL)-MSCs expressed the albumin gene, and harbored a subpopulation of CK18+ cells (20\u201340%), which defined their hepatic origin. However, when subjected to in vitro hepatic differentiation, FL-MSCs did not acquire significant liver functions. Quantitative analysis of conditioned medium (CM) collected from cultured cells revealed the presence of growth factors and chemokines with potential liver regenerative properties, the most relevant of which (concentration \u22653000\u202fpg/ml) were SDF-1 alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1 beta, VEGF-A, Gro-alpha, and HGF. Culturing of FL-MSCs as spheroids significantly enhanced the secretion of HGF and bFGF (approximately 5-fold) compared with culture monolayers. Moreover, CM assessed in vitro induced capillary-like organization and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts as target cells. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from CM induced similar cellular responses in vitro with high efficiency and in a dose-dependent manner.FL-MSCs underwent several in vitro subcultivations, and did not stimulate allogenic T-cell proliferation thus suggesting a low immunogenicity. Furthermore, 5-year cryopreservation did not affect cell viability (approximately 90% of viable post-thawed FL-MSCs).

     "abstract": "Human skin organ culture (hSOC) is a simple but highly instructive and clinically relevant skin research method. It has been used for decades to study the development, differentiation, and function as well as the response to wounding or test agents of intact human skin in the presence of its appendages and all resident cell populations. hSOC has also proven useful in toxicological and oncological studies and studies of skin aging (both chronological aging and photoaging), skin energy metabolism, skin immunology, pigmentation biology, and cutaneous (neuro-)endocrinology and neurobiology. The pathobiology and treatment of various dermatoses can also be assessed ex vivo by organ-culturing intact lesional human skin. In addition to morphological analyses by routine histochemistry, quantitative (immuno)histomorphometry has proven to be an excellent tool for quantitating and localizing protein expression patterns in defined skin compartments and distinct cell populations using a relatively small amount of precious human tissue. Finally, more recent technological advances, such as siRNA-mediated gene silencing and sensory reinnervation of hSOCs, have further extended the range of methodological applications for the ex vivo study of human skin; it has emerged as the ultimate preclinical assay system for investigative dermatology, including the testing of drugs, cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals and more, and is just one step below human skin xenotransplant in vivo mouse models and clinical trials. Here, we critically review the renaissance and variety of hSOC assays, their applications and limitations, and we critically compare them with 3D skin \u201cequivalent\u201d assays. The review closes with perspectives on how this ancient but highly informative and physiologically relevant ex vivo skin research method may be further developed in the future.",

Recently, various culture methods for human iPS cell maintenance have been developed. However, it is not well known whether human iPS cell maintenance method affects hepatic differentiation potency. In this study, we cultured human iPS cells using four maintenance methods: ReproStem medium with feeder cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), AK02N medium with iMatrix-511 (E8 fragments of laminin511), Essential 8 medium with Vitronectin N (N-terminal domain of vitronectin), TeSR-E8 medium with Vitronectin XF (xeno-free vitronectin). Then, these human iPS cells were differentiated into the hepatocyte-like cells. Interestingly, the gene expression levels of definitive endoderm markers in the definitive endoderm cells generated from human iPS cells cultured with ReproStem or TeSR-E8 medium were higher than those in other groups. The gene expression level of foregut marker, HHEX, in the definitive endoderm cells generated from human iPS cells cultured with ReproStem medium was higher than that in other groups. Consistently, the expression levels of hepatocyte markers, albumin and urea secretion capacity, and CYP3A4 activity in the hepatocyte-like cells generated from human iPS cells cultured with ReproStem medium were higher than those in the other groups. Our data indicated that the most suitable human iPS cell maintenance method for efficient hepatic differentiation was the on-feeder method which uses mouse embryonic fibroblasts, but not feeder-free methods. In conclusion, human iPS cell maintenance method largely affects hepatic differentiation potency.",

     "abstract": "Endochondral ossification is the process by which long bones are formed; the process of long bone formation is regulated by numerous factors such as transcription factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix molecules. Human hormone Nuclear receptors (hHNR) are a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that are activated by steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, and various lipid-soluble signals, including retinoic acid, oxysterols, and thyroid hormone. Whole genome microarray data from our previous study revealed that most hHNR's are up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation in hMSCS. NR2F1 was among the highest expressed hHNR during osteogenesis, NR2F1 belongs to the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily. NR2F1 is designated as an orphan nuclear receptor because its ligands are unknown. NR2F1 plays a wide range of roles, including cell differentiation, cancer progression, and central and peripheral neurogenesis. Identifying signaling networks involved in osteoblast differentiation is important in orchestrating new therapeutic and clinical applications in bone biology. This study aimed to identify alterations in signaling networks mediated by NR2F1 in osteoblast differentiation. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of NR2F1 leads to impairment in the differentiation of hBMSC-TERT to osteoblast; gene-expression results confirmed the down-regulation of osteoblast markers such as RUNX2, ALPL, OSC, and BSP. Global whole gene expression analysis revealed that most down-regulated genes were associated with osteoblast differentiation (DDIT3, BMP2). Pathway analysis revealed prominent signaling pathways that were down-regulated, including the TGF\u03b2 pathway and MAPK pathway. Functional studies on NR2F1 transfected cells, during osteoblast differentiation in combination with TGF\u03b21 and BMP-2, showed that TGF\u03b21 does not recover osteoblast differentiation, whereas BMP-2 rescues osteoblast differentiation in NR2F1 siRNA transfected cells. Thus, our results showed that BMP-2 could intervene in NR2F1 down-regulated signaling pathways to recover osteoblast differentiation.",

Despite increasingly sophisticated methods for in vitro macrophage isolation, expansion and activation over the past three decades, these have largely been restricted to modelling bone-marrow or blood-derived cells. The in vitro derivation of macrophages from human pluripotent stem cells provides new opportunities to study macrophage biology, including the factors that impact human myeloid development and those that induce macrophage activation. While sharing many of the functional characteristics of monocyte-derived macrophages, stem cell-derived macrophages may offer new opportunities to understand the role of development or tissue context in innate immune cell function. Immune responsiveness to pathogenic challenge is known to be impacted by a macrophage's history of prior exposure, as well as ontogeny and tissue context. Therefore, we explore the factors of in vitro derivation likely to influence macrophage phenotype and function.",

The penis, prostate and testis developed in males and the clitoris, uterus and ovary in females.

In this regard, we report a new model of de novo DHT-induction of prostatic development from xenografts of human fetal female urethras, which emphasizes the utility of the xenograft approach for investigation of initiation of human prostatic development. These studies raise the possibility of molecular mechanistic studies on human prostatic development through the use of tissue recombinants composed of mutant mouse UGM combined with human fetal prostatic epithelium. Our compilation of human prostatic developmental processes is likely to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer as the neoformation of ductal-acinar architecture during normal development is shared during the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.",

Recent immunohistochemical studies for PAX2 (reactive with M\u00fcllerian epithelium) and FOXA1 (reactive with urogenital sinus epithelium and its known pelvic derivatives) shed light on an age-old debate on the derivation of vaginal epithelium supporting the idea that human vaginal epithelium derives solely from urogenital sinus epithelium.

Epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation markers are described during human female reproductive tract development (keratins, homeobox proteins (HOXA11 and ISL1), steroid receptors (estrogen receptor alpha and progesterone receptor), transcription factors and signaling molecules (TP63 and RUNX1), which are expressed in a temporally and spatially dynamic fashion.

     "abstract": "The urinary bladder collects urine from the kidneys and stores it until the appropriate moment for voiding. The trigone and ureterovesical junctions are key to bladder function, by allowing one-way passage of urine into the bladder without obstruction. Embryological development of these structures has been studied in multiple animal models as well as humans. In this report we review the existing literature on bladder development and cellular signalling with particular focus on bladder development in humans.The bladder and ureterovesical junction form primarily during the fourth to eighth weeks of gestation, and arise from the primitive urogenital sinus following subdivision of the cloaca. The bladder develops through mesenchymal-epithelial interactions between the endoderm of the urogenital sinus and mesodermal mesenchyme. Key signalling factors in bladder development include shh, TGF-\u03b2, Bmp4, and Fgfr2. A concentration gradient of shh is particularly important in development of bladder musculature, which is vital to bladder function. The ureterovesical junction forms from the interaction between the Wolffian duct and the bladder. The ureteric bud arises from the Wolffian duct and is incorporated into the developing bladder at the trigone. It was previously thought that the trigonal musculature developed primarily from the Wolffian duct, but it has been shown to develop primarily from bladder mesenchyme. Following emergence of the ureters from the Wolffian ducts, extensive epithelial remodelling brings the ureters to their final trigonal positions via vitamin A-induced apoptosis. Perturbation of this process is implicated in clinical obstruction or urine reflux. Congenital malformations include ureteric duplication and bladder exstrophy.",

In contrast, in females, without the influence of androgens, the vestibular plate (homologue of the urethral plate) undergoes canalization to form a wide vestibular groove whose edges (vestibular folds) remain unfused, ultimately forming the labia minora defining the vaginal vestibule.

Herein, we extend our knowledge by describing formation of the human urethra within the glans penis as well as development of the prepuce. Forty-eight normal human fetal penile specimens were examined using scanning electron microscopy and optical projection tomography. Serial histologic sections were evaluated for morphology and immunohistochemical localization for epithelial differentiation markers: Cytokeratins 6, 7, 10, FoxA1, uroplakin and the androgen receptor. As the closing zipper completes fusion of the urethral folds within the penile shaft to form a tubular urethra (~ 13 weeks), canalization of the urethral plate continues in proximal to distal fashion into the glans penis to directly form the urethra within the glans without forming an open urethral groove. Initially, the urethral plate is attached ventrally to the epidermis via an epithelial seam, which is remodeled and eliminated, thus establishing mesenchymal confluence ventral to the glanular urethra. The morphogenetic remodeling involves the strategic expression of cytokeratin 7, FoxA1 and uroplakin in endodermal epithelial cells as the tubular glanular urethra forms. The most ventral epithelial cells of the urethral plate are pinched off from the glanular urethra and are reabsorbed into the epidermis ultimately losing expression of their markers, a process undoubtedly regulated by androgens. The prepuce initially forms on the dorsal aspect of the glans at approximately 12 weeks of gestation. After sequential proximal to distal remodeling of the ventral urethral plate along the ventral aspect of glans, the prepuce of epidermal origin fuses in the ventral midline.",

     "abstract": "The rodent pancreatic AR42J-B13 (B-13) cell line differentiates into non-replicative hepatocyte-like cells in response to glucocorticoid mediated via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The aims of this study were to identify a human cell line that responds similarly and investigate the mechanisms underpinning any alteration in differentiation. Exposing the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma (HPAC) cell line to 1\u201310\u202f\u00b5M concentrations of dexamethasone (DEX) resulted an inhibition of proliferation, suppressed carcinoembryonic antigen expression, limited expression of pancreatic acinar and hepatic gene expression and significant induction of the constitutively-expressed hepatic CYP3A5 mRNA transcript. These changes were associated with a pulse of genomic DNA methylation and suppressed notch signalling activity. HPAC cells expressed high levels of GR transcript in contrast to other nuclear receptors \u2013 such as the glucocorticoid-activated pregnane X receptor (PXR) \u2013 and GR transcriptional function was activated by DEX in HPAC cells. Expression of selected hepatocyte transcripts in response to DEX was blocked by co-treatment with the GR antagonist RU486. These data indicate that the HPAC response to glucocorticoid exposure includes an inhibition in proliferation, alterations in notch signalling and a limited change in the expression of genes associated with an acinar and hepatic phenotype. This is the first demonstration of a human cell responding to similarly to the rodent B-13 cell regarding formation of hepatocyte-like cells in response to glucocorticoid. Identifying and modulating the ablating factor(s) may enhance the hepatocyte-like forming capacity of HPAC cells after exposure to glucocorticoid and generate an unlimited in vitro supply of human hepatocytes for toxicology studies and a variety of clinical applications.",

To date the comparison of phenotypes and transcriptomes of mouse SKPs (mSKPs) and dMSCs has never been reported. Here we characterized and compared the biological properties and transcriptomes of mSKP and dMSCs from the same mouse dermis sample. Firstly, we analyzed mSKPs and dMSCs by use of immunocytochemistry, cell cycle analysis, and CD antigen expression. Then we conducted the osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic induced differentiation for both cell types. Lastly, we compared their genomic profiles by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), and verified the results of RNA-Seq by quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The results suggested that mSKPs and dMSCs shared similarities in certain positive stem cells markers expression, but demonstrated difference in Nanog and Oct4 expression. mSKPs and dMSCs demonstrated similar cell cycle distribution and CD antigen expression. Both types of cells could be induced differentiated into osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. However, RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR results indicated that mSKPs and dMSCs had distinct transcriptome profiles. The majority of enriched differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from mSKPs was immune-related, while the majority of enriched DEGs from dMSCs was differentiation/development/disease-related. Transcriptome profiles suggested that mSKPs and dMSCs might have potential usage in the relevant morbidity management.

     "abstract": "Presenilins (Psen1 and Psen2 in mice) are polytopic transmembrane proteins that act in the \u03b3-secretase complex to make intra-membrane cleavages of their substrates, including the well-studied Notch receptors. Such processing releases the Notch intracellular domain, allowing it to physically relocate from the cell membrane to the nucleus where it acts in a transcriptional activating complex to regulate downstream genes in the signal-receiving cell. Previous studies of Notch pathway mutants for Jagged1, Notch2, and Rbpj demonstrated that canonical signaling is a necessary component of normal mouse lens development. However, the central role of Psens within the \u03b3-secretase complex has never been explored in any developing eye tissue or cell type. By directly comparing Psen single and double mutant phenotypes during mouse lens development, we found a stronger requirement for Psen1, although both genes are needed for progenitor cell growth and to prevent apoptosis. We also uncovered a novel genetic interaction between Psen1 and Jagged1. By quantifying protein and mRNA levels of key Notch pathway genes in Psen1/2 or Jagged1 mutant lenses, we identified multiple points in the overall signaling cascade where feedback regulation can occur. Our data are consistent with the loss of particular genes indirectly influencing the transcription level of another. However, we conclude that regulating Notch2 protein levels is particularly important during normal signaling, supporting the importance of post-translational regulatory mechanisms in this tissue.",

One mechanism that protects telomeres from premature degradation is the formation of structures called\u00a0t-loops, in which the single-stranded 3\u2032 overhang present at the terminal end of telomeres loops back and invades medial double-stranded telomeric DNA. We identified looped structures formed between terminal chromosome ends and interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs), which are found throughout the human genome, that we have termed interstitial telomeric loops (ITLs). While they form in a TRF2-dependent manner similar to t-loops, ITLs further require the physical interaction of TRF2 with the nuclear intermediate filament protein lamin A/C. Our findings suggest that interactions between telomeres and the nucleoskeleton broadly impact genomic integrity, including telomere stability, chromosome structure, and chromosome fragility.

To examine SDIA competence for retinal cells differentiation, we co-cultured SCAP with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In comparison with Matrigel-cultured hPSCs, SCAP significantly induces hPSCs to differentiate into rostral neural cells as demonstrated by upregulation of OTX2 and PAX6 and down-regulation of EN1, HOXB4 and HOXC8. Furthermore, the differentiated cells on SCAP significantly expressed eye-field markers, RAX, PAX6, LHX2 and SIX3 and showed five folds pigmented colonies. The generated hPSC-retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) was hexagonal and highly expressed related markers, ZO-1, RPE65, BEST, CRALBP and MITF. They were able to phagocytose latex beads. Moreover, the assessment of the isolated neural tube-like structures on SCAP showed the expression of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) - SIX3, RAX, and PAX6. SCAP highly expressed DKK3 and SFRP2, Wnt inhibitor factors and their target genes, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc were down-regulated significantly on SCAP. These results showed SCAP promoted the differentiation of hPSCs into retinal cells (RPE and RPCs) possibly through inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway.

Undifferentiated gonads of Spix cavy develop into ovaries in females after 25 days of gestation (DG), exhibiting P450arom immunoreactivity. After 25 DG, paramesonephric ducts develop and form oviducts, uterine horns and cranial portion of the vagina. The caudal portion of the vagina originates from the urogenital sinus, and a vaginal closure membrane is present at the end of gestation. Partial channeling of the urethra into the clitoris occurs after 40 DG, but complete channeling never occurs. A preputial meatus emerges near the tip of organ. In males, undifferentiated gonads develop into testes at 25 DG and develop immunoreactivity for P450c17, which is required for androgens synthesis and likely maintenance of mesonephric ducts. Mesonephric ducts develop subsequently, forming the epididymis and ductus deferens. The pelvic urethra develops after 25 DG with channeling into the penis occurring around 30 DG. This is the first morphological study describing the process of sexual differentiation during gestation in a hystricomorph rodent and one of the most comprehensive analyses conducted in any mammal. Male genital organ development follows the general pattern described in other domestic mammals, but does not include formation of the baculum as occurs in mice and rats. In females, clitoral development includes partial canalization by the urethra and development of a preputial meatus. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms involved in the differentiative processes described.",

The tissue recombinants were grown in DES-treated ovariectomized athymic mice. After 2\u20134 weeks of in vivo growth, several vaginal specific features were expressed in the human tubal epithelium. The mesenchyme-induced effects included morphological change as well as expression of several immunohistochemical markers. Although the mesenchyme-induced shift in vaginal differentiation in the human tubal epithelium was not complete, the partial induction of vaginal markers in human tubal epithelium verifies the importance of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in development of the human female reproductive tract.In a separate experiment, DES-induction of uterine epithelial progesterone receptor (PGR) and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) was explored in tissue recombinants composed of wild-type or Esr1KO mouse uterine mesenchyme + human fetal uterine epithelium (wt UtM+hUtE and Esr1KO UtM+hUtE). The rationale of this experiment was to determine whether DES-induction of PGR and ESR1 is mediated directly via epithelial ESR1 or indirectly (paracrine mechanism) via mesenchymal ESR1. DES-induction of uterine epithelial ESR1 and PGR in Esr1KO UtM+hUtE tissue recombinants (devoid of mesenchymal ESR1) formally eliminates the paracrine mechanism and demonstrates that DES induction of human uterine epithelial ESR1 and PGR is directly mediated via epithelial ESR1.",

     "abstract": "This paper addresses the developmental mechanisms of formation of the mouse and human penile urethra and the possibility that two disparate mechanisms are at play. It has been suggested that the entire penile urethra of the mouse forms via direct canalization of the endodermal urethral plate. While this mechanism surely accounts for development of the proximal portion of the mouse penile urethra, we suggest that the distal portion of the mouse penile urethra forms via a series of epithelial fusion events. Through review of the recent literature in combination with new data, it is unlikely that the entire mouse urethra is formed from the endodermal urethral plate due in part to the fact that from E14 onward the urethral plate is not present in the distal aspect of the genital tubercle. Formation of the distal portion of the mouse urethra receives substantial contribution from the preputial swellings that form the preputial-urethral groove and subsequently the preputial-urethral canal, the later of which is subdivided by a fusion event to form the distal portion of the mouse penile urethra. Examination of human penile development also reveals comparable dual morphogenetic mechanisms. However, in the case of human, direct canalization of the urethral plate occurs in the glans, while fusion events are involved in formation of the urethra within the penile shaft, a pattern exactly opposite to that of the mouse. The highest incidence of hypospadias in humans occurs at the junction of these two different developmental mechanisms. The relevance of the mouse as a model of human hypospadias is discussed.",

To counteract telomere attrition, pluripotent stem cells are equipped with telomere elongation mechanisms that ensure prolonged proliferation capacity and self-renewal capacity. Excessive telomere elongation can also be deleterious and is counteracted by a rapid telomere deletion mechanism termed telomere trimming.

Positioned at the ends of chromosomes, telomeres are DNA repeats which serve as protective caps that shorten with each cell division in proliferative tissues. Cardiomyocytes are an anomaly, as they are largely non-proliferative post-birth and retain relatively stable telomere lengths throughout life in healthy individuals. However, there is mounting evidence that in disease states, cardiomyocyte telomeres significantly shorten. Moreover, this shortening may play an active role in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction central to the etiology of dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. Elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie the telomere-mitochondrial signaling axis in the heart will provide fresh insights into our understanding of genetic cardiomyopathies, and could lead to the identification of previously uncharacterized modes of therapeutic intervention.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells activate telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) to bypass replicative senescence and achieve immortality by either upregulating telomerase or promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) at chromosome ends to maintain telomere length, the latter being referred to as ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres). In yeast telomerase mutants, the HDR-based repair of telomeres leads to the generation of \u2018survivors\u2019 that escape senescence and divide indefinitely. So far, yeast has proven to provide an accurate model to study the generation and maintenance of telomeres via HDR. Recently, it has been established that up-regulation of the lncRNA, TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA), is a novel hallmark of ALT cells. Moreover, RNA-DNA hybrids are thought to trigger HDR at telomeres in ALT cells to maintain telomere length and function. Here we show that, also in established yeast type II survivors, TERRA levels are increased in an analogous\u00a0manner to human ALT cells. The elevated TERRA levels are independent of yeast-specific subtelomeric structures, i.e. the presence or absence of Y\u2019 repetitive elements. Furthermore, we show that RNase H1 overexpression, which degrades the RNA moiety in RNA-DNA hybrids, impairs the growth of yeast survivors. We suggest that even in terms of TERRA regulation, yeast survivors serve as an accurate model that recapitulates many key features of human ALT cells.",

In this work, we evaluated the role of IL-1 in wound repair, and examined whether TNF-\u03b1 administration impaired scarless wound repair. First, we characterised wound repair in outbred CD-1 mice according to age and sex in an ear punch wound model. Then, we examined the effects of Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and TNF-\u03b1 placement inside ear wounds by means of loaded Heparin beads in young and middle-aged male and female mice. Wounds in middle-aged females repaired with scarless characteristics, whereas those in young males showed fibrotic scarring. Rather than improving wound repair in young males, IL-1 signalling blockade increased epithelial thickness and IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression, and diminished epidermal apoptosis. TNF-\u03b1 impaired wound repair in middle-aged females, which exhibited acanthosis and overexpression of IL-1, but no change in apoptosis. These findings suggest that this mechanism of epidermal thickening differs from that observed in IL1-ra\u2013treated animals.",

     "abstract": "During vertebrate brain development, the gastrulation brain homeobox 2 gene (gbx2) is expressed in the forebrain, but its precise roles are still unknown. In this study, we addressed this issue in zebrafish (Danio rerio) first by carefully examining gbx2 expression in the developing forebrain. We showed that gbx2 was expressed in the telencephalon during late somitogenesis, from 18\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf, and in the thalamic primordium after 26 hpf. In contrast, another gbx gene, gbx1, was expressed in the anterior-most ventral telencephalon after 36 hpf. Thus, the expression patterns of these two gbx genes did not overlap, arguing against their redundant function in the forebrain. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed close relationships between the telencephalic expression of gbx2 and other forebrain-forming genes, suggesting that their interactions contribute to the regionalization of the telencephalon. FISH further revealed that gbx2 is expressed in the ventricular region of the telencephalon. By using transgenic fish in which gbx2 can be induced by heat shock, we found that gbx2 induction at 16 hpf repressed the expression of emx3, dlx2a, and six3b in the ventral telencephalon. Among secreted factor genes, bmp2b and wnt1 were repressed in the vicinity of the gbx2 domain in the telencephalon. The expression of forebrain-forming genes was examined in mutant embryos lacking gbx2, showing emx3 and dlx2a to be upregulated in the subpallium at 24 hpf. Taken together, these findings indicate that gbx2 contributes to the development of the subpallium through its repressive activities against other telencephalon-forming genes. We further showed that inhibiting FGF signaling and activating Wnt signaling repressed gbx2 and affected the regionalization of the telencephalon, supporting a functional link between gbx2, intracellular signaling, and telencephalon development.",

     "abstract": "Maintenance of the intestinal mucosa is driven by local signals that coordinate epithelial proliferation, differentiation, and turnover in order to separate antigenic luminal contents from the host's immune system. Breaches in this barrier promote gastrointestinal pathologies ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to cancer. The ubiquitin ligase ITCH is known to regulate immune responses, and loss of function of ITCH has been associated with gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, particularly in the colon. However, the small intestine appears to be spared from this pathology. Here we explored the physiological mechanism that underlies the preservation of mucosal homeostasis in the small intestine in mice lacking ITCH (Itcha18H/a18H). Histological analysis of the small intestines from young adult mice revealed architectural changes in animals deficient for ITCH, including villus blunting with cell crowding, crypt expansion, and thickening of the muscularis propria relative to age-matched mice sufficient for ITCH. These differences were more prominent in the distal part of the small intestine and were not dependent upon lymphoid cells. Underlying the observed changes in the epithelium were expansion of the Ki67+ proliferating transit amplifying progenitor population and increased numbers of terminally differentiated mucus-secreting goblet and anti-microbial producing Paneth cells, which are both important in controlling local inflammation in the small intestine and are known to be dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease. Homeostasis in the small intestine of Itcha18H/a18H animals was maintained by increased cell turnover, including accelerated migration of epithelial cells along the crypt-villus axis and increased apoptosis of epithelial cells at the crypt-villus junction. Consistent with this enhanced turnover, Itcha18H/a18H mice carrying the Min mutation (Itcha18H/a18H; ApcMin\u00a0/+) displayed a 76% reduction in tumor burden as compared to ApcMin\u00a0/+ littermates with normal levels of ITCH. These findings highlight the role of ITCH as an important modulator of intestinal epithelial homeostasis.",

However, a detailed understanding of how to differentiate clinically relevant cell types from stem cells is fundamentally required.Periocular mesenchyme (POM), a subtype of cranial neural crest, is vital for development of multiple cell types in the cornea, including clinically relevant cells such as corneal endothelium and stromal keratocytes. Herein, we describe protocols for differentiation of POM from pluripotent stem cells. Using defined media containing inhibitors of TGF\u03b2 and WNT signalling, we generated neural crest cells that express high levels of the POM transcription factors PITX2 and FOXC1. Furthermore, we identified cells resembling POM in the adult cornea, located in a niche between the trabecular meshwork and peripheral endothelium. The generation and expansion of POM is an important step in the generation of a number of cells types that could prove to be clinically useful for a number of diseases of the cornea.",

     "abstract": "The human cellular reverse transcriptase, telomerase, is very tightly regulated in large long-lived species. Telomerase is expressed during early human fetal development, is turned off in most adult tissues, and then becomes reactivated in almost all human cancers. However, the exact mechanism regulating these switches in expression are not known. We recently described a phenomenon where genes are regulated by telomere length dependent loops (telomere position effects over long distances; TPE-OLD). The hTERT gene is ~ 1.2\u00a0Mb from the human chromosome 5p end. We observed that when telomeres are long hTERT gene expression is repressed and a probe next to the 5p telomere and the hTERT locus are spatially co-localized. When telomeres are short at least one of the hTERT alleles is spatially separated from the telomere, developing more active histone marks and changes in DNA methylation in the hTERT promoter region. These findings have implications for how cells turn off telomerase when telomeres are long during fetal development and how cancer cells reactivate telomerase in cells that have short telomeres. In addition to TPE-OLD, in proliferating stem cells such as activated T-lymphocytes, telomerase can be reversibly activated and silenced by telomere looping. In telomerase positive cancer cells that are induced to differentiate and downregulate telomerase, telomere looping correlates with silencing of the hTERT gene. These studies and others support a role of telomeres in regulating gene expression via telomere looping that may involve interactions with internal telomeric sequences (ITS). In addition to telomere looping, TPE-OLD may be one mechanism of how cells time changes in physiology without initiating a DNA damage response.",

     "abstract": "Telomere shortening as a consequence of cell divisions during aging and chronic diseases associates with an increased cancer risk. Experimental data revealed that telomere shortening results in telomere dysfunction, which in turn affects tumorigenesis in two ways. First, telomere dysfunction suppresses tumor progression by the activation of DNA damage checkpoints, which induce cell cycle arrest (senescence) or apoptosis, as well as by inducing metabolic compromise and activation of immune responses directed against senescent cells. Second, telomere dysfunction promotes tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal instability in tumor initiating cells, by inhibiting proliferative competition of non-transformed cells, and possibly, also by influencing tumor cell plasticity. The tumor promoting effects of telomere dysfunction are context dependent and require the loss of p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoints or other genetic modifiers that attenuate DNA damage responses possibly involving complex interactions of different genes. The activation of telomere stabilizing mechanisms appears as a subsequent step, which is required to enable immortal grotwh of emerging cancer cells. Here, we conceptually discuss our current knowledge and new, unpublished experimental data on telomere dependent influences on tumor initiation and progression.",

     "abstract": "Embryonic Stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells that can be induced to differentiate into cells of all three lineages: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. In culture, ES cells can be differentiated into mature neurons by treatment with Retinoic Acid (RA) and this effect is mediated mainly through the activation of the RA nuclear receptors (RAR \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), and their isoforms. However, little is known about the role played by specific RAR types on ES cell differentiation. Here, we found that treatment of ES cells with AC55649, an RAR\u03b22 agonist, increased endodermal marker gene expression. On the other hand, we found that the inhibition of RAR\u03b2 with 5\u00a0\u03bcM LE135, together with RA treatment, increased the efficiency of mouse ES cell differentiation into neurons by more than 4-fold as compared to cells treated with RA only. Finally, we performed proteomic analyses on ES cells treated with RA vs RA plus AC55649 in order to identify the signaling pathways activated by the RAR\u03b2 agonist. Our proteomic analyses using antibody microarrays indicated that proteins such as p38 and AKT were upregulated in cells treated with RA plus the agonist, as compared to cells treated with RA alone. Our results indicate that RAR\u03b2 may function as a repressor of neuronal differentiation through the activation of major cell signaling pathways, and that the pharmacological inhibition of this nuclear receptor may constitute a novel method to increase the efficiency of ES to neuronal differentiation in culture.",

Cells isolated from the calvaria of these mice showed a greater osteoblast differentiation potential as evidenced by the abundance of mineralized bone nodules and higher expression levels of osteogenic markers than wild-type cells.

Xenograft models are particularly useful and sought after due to the lack of clinically relevant animal models in predicting drug effectiveness in humans. Such predictions could in turn boost the process of drug discovery, since novel drug compounds have an estimated 8% chance of FDA approval despite years of rigorous preclinical testing and evaluation, albeit mostly in non-human models.In the case of skin research, the mouse persists as the most popular animal model of choice, despite its well-known anatomical differences with human skin. Differences in skin biology are especially evident when trying to dissect more complex skin conditions, such as psoriasis and eczema, where interactions between the immune system, epidermis and the environment likely occur. While the use of animal models are still considered the gold standard for systemic toxicity studies under controlled environments, there are now alternative models that have been approved for certain applications. To overcome the biological limitations of the mouse model, research efforts have also focused on \u201chumanizing\u201d the mice model to better recapitulate human skin physiology.In this review, we outline the different approaches undertaken thus far to study skin biology using human tissue xenografts in mice and the technical challenges involved.

     "abstract": "The human endometrium undergoes extensive morphological, biochemical and molecular changes under the influence of female sex steroid hormones. Besides the fact that estrogen stimulates endometrial cell proliferation and progesterone inhibits this proliferation and induces differentiation, there is limited knowledge about precise molecular mechanisms underlying human endometrial biology. The importance of paracrine signaling in endometrial physiology explains why in vitro culture of endometrial cells has been challenging. Researchers, therefore, have developed alternative experimental in vivo models for the study of endometrial biology. The objective of this review is to summarize the recent developments and work on these in vivo endometrial research models. The in vivo recombinant tissue models in which wild-type endometrial cells are combined with endometrial cells from a gene-targeted mouse strain followed by xenografting to host mice have been critical in confirming the significance of paracrine signaling between the epithelium and stroma in the growth regulation of the endometrium. Additionally, these studies have uncovered differences between the mouse and human, emphasizing the need for the development of experimental models specifically of the human endometrium. Recently, xenotransplants of human endometrial fragments into the subcutaneous space of host mice and endometrial xenografts of dissociated and recombined epithelial and stromal cells beneath the kidney capsule of immunodeficient host mice have proven to be highly promising tools for in vivo research of endometrial functions. For the first time, the latter approach provides an immense opportunity for the application of genome engineering, such as targeted ablation of endometrial genes for example by using CRISPR/CAS9 system. This research will begin to elucidate the functional role of specific genes in this complex tissue. Another advantage of xenotransplantation and xenograft models of the human endometrium is their use to investigate endometrial effects of new compounds and drugs without needing to give them to women.

     "abstract": "Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease that leads to progressive destruction of periodontal tissue. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are the most favorable candidate for the reconstruction of tissues destroyed by periodontal diseases. PDLSCs derived from inflammatory microenvironment show attenuated differentiation potential, however the mechanism is still unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered class of posttranscriptional regulators, and they play key roles in regulating cell differentiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines could regulate miRNAs and contribute to some inflammatory diseases. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) is a potent negative regulator of cell differentiation. Elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1 were confirmed to be associated with the severity of periodontal disease. Here, we found TNF-\u03b1 inhibited the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Based on this, we hypothesized that TNF-\u03b1 could participate in PDLSC differentiation by regulating miRNA signal pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-21 was suppressed by TNF-\u03b1 in impaired adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Upregulating miR-21 can partly rescue TNF-\u03b1-impaired adipogenesis and osteogenesis by repressing its target gene Spry1, suggested that miR-21/Spry1 functional axis plays critical role in PDLSC differentiation under inflammatory microenvironment. During adipogenesis and osteogenesis, TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased Spry1 levels and overexpression of miR-21 dramatically decreased Spry1 levels in the presence of TNF-\u03b1, indicated important roles of miR-21 in modulating link between TNF-\u03b1 and Spry1. Our findings introduce a molecular mechanism in which TNF-\u03b1 suppresses adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs by inhibiting miR-21/Spry1 functional axis. This study may indicate a molecular basis for novel therapeutic strategies against periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases.",

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as well as immunohistochemical stains were used to study the development of the human uterine tube, endometrium, myometrium, uterine cervix and vagina. Our study revisits and updates the classical reports of Koff (1933) and Bulmer (1957) and presents new data on development of human vaginal epithelium. Koff proposed that the upper 4/5ths of the vagina is derived from M\u00fcllerian epithelium and the lower 1/5th derived from urogenital sinus epithelium, while Bulmer proposed that vaginal epithelium derives solely from urogenital sinus epithelium. These conclusions were based entirely upon H&E stained sections. A central player in human vaginal epithelial development is the solid vaginal plate, which arises from the uterovaginal canal (fused M\u00fcllerian ducts) cranially and squamous epithelium of urogenital sinus caudally. Since M\u00fcllerian and urogenital sinus epithelium cannot be unequivocally identified in H&E stained sections, we used immunostaining for PAX2 (reactive with M\u00fcllerian epithelium) and FOXA1 (reactive with urogenital sinus epithelium). By this technique, the PAX2/FOXA1 boundary was located at the extreme caudal aspect of the vaginal plate at 12 weeks. During the ensuing weeks, the PAX2/FOXA1 boundary progressively extended cranially such that by 21 weeks the entire vaginal epithelium was FOXA1-reactive and PAX2-negative. This observation supports Bulmer's proposal that human vaginal epithelium derives solely from urogenital sinus epithelium. Clearly, the development of the human vagina is far more complex than previously envisioned and appears to be distinctly different in many respects from mouse vaginal development.",

     "abstract": "Human female reproductive tract development rests mostly upon hematoxilyn and eosin stained sections despite recent advances on molecular mechanisms in mouse studies. We report application of immunohistochemical methods to explore the ontogeny of epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation markers (keratins, homobox proteins, steroid receptors), transcription factors and signaling molecules (TP63 and RUNX1) during human female reproductive tract development. Keratins 6, 7, 8, 10, 14 and 19 (KRT6, KRT7, KRT8, KRT10, KRT14, KRT19) were expressed in a temporally and spatially dynamic fashion. The undifferentiated M\u00fcllerian duct and uterovaginal canal, lined by simple columnar epithelia, expressed KRT7, KRT8 and KRT19. Glandular derivatives of the M\u00fcllerian duct (uterine tube, uterine corpus and endocervix) maintained expression of these keratins, while tissues that undergo stratified squamous differentiation (exocervix and vagina) expressed KRT6, KRT14 and KRT10 during development in an age-dependent fashion. TP63 and RUNX1 were expressed prior to KRT14, as these two transcription factors are known to be upstream from KRT14 in developing M\u00fcllerian epithelium. In the vagina, KRT10, a marker of terminal differentiation, appeared after endogenous estrogens transformed the epithelium to a thick glycogenated squamous epithelium. Uroplakin, a protein unique to urothelium, was expressed only in the bladder, urethra and vaginal introitus, but not in the female reproductive tract itself. Mesenchymal differentiation was examined through immunostaining for HOXA11 (expressed in uterine mesenchyme) and ISL1 (expressed in vaginal mesenchyme). A detailed ontogeny of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), progesterone receptor (PGR) and the androgen receptor (AR) provides the mechanistic underpinning for the teratogenicity of estrogens, progestins and androgens on female reproductive tract development. Immunohistochemical analysis of differentiation markers and signaling molecules advance our understanding of normal development of the human female reproductive tract.

     "abstract": "Embryonic stem cells (ES-cells) provide a good model system to study lineage-specific differentiation. Though, the differentiation of ES-cells to cardiomyocytes is documented, a clear understanding of the molecular mechanism of differentiation and improved functional-differentiation efficiency are yet to be achieved. In this regard, ascorbic acid (Aa) is shown to be one of the effective cardiac inducers in ES-cells. But, its mechanism is poorly understood. We therefore, investigated the mechanism of Aa-mediated cardiomyocyte differentiation of ES-cells. Here, we describe the potential involvement of epigenetic (DNA methylation) as well as integrin- and Erk- signaling systems during cardiomyocyte differentiation. Transgenic GS-2 ES-cells and wild-type D3 ES-cells were differentiated to cardiomyocytes, in the presence or absence of Aa and with or without inhibitors of Erk-, collagen- and integrin- pathways. At specific time points, differentiated states of ES-cells were scored by gene expression analyses and the proportion of functional cTnI+ cardiomyocytes. DNA methylation changes of Isl-1, BMP-2, GATA-4 and \u03b1-MHC in cardiogenic cells, following stimulation with Aa, were analyzed by using methylation specific PCR (MSP). We observed that Aa, when applied in initial phase of ES-cell differentiation, consistently enhanced cardiac differentiation (99%) over that observed during spontaneous differentiation (70%). This was associated with enhanced expressions of cardiogenesis-associated genes. A two-fold increase in cTnI+ cells was observed, with appropriate myofibril arrangement. The observed effect of Aa was due to enhanced collagen and integrin signaling, coupled with a high p-ERK1/2 expression, downstream. Besides, the involvement of DNA methylation in regulating the expression of cardiac genes i.e., Isl-1 and \u03b1-MHC was also observed. Overall, this study, for the first time, demonstrates that Aa-mediated cardiac enhancement is brought about, mechanistically, through the interplay of epigenetic changes in DNA methylation of cardiac genes (Isl-1 and \u03b1-MHC) and integrin signaling system.",

Both plasma membrane channel activity and kinase function are implicated in these roles. Channel activity is greater in less differentiated hepatoma cells compared with non-dividing, terminally differentiated adult hepatocytes, suggesting differences in protein expression and/or localization. We used electrophysiological and immunofluorescence approaches to establish whether hepatocellular differentiation is associated with altered TRPM7 expression. Mean outward current decreased by 44% in WIF-B hepatoma cells incubated with the established hepatic differentiating factors oncostatin M/dexamethasone for 1\u20138 days. Pre-incubation with pyridone 6, a pan-JAK inhibitor, blocked the current reduction. An antibody targeted to the C-terminus of TRPM7 labelled the cytoplasm in WIF-B cells and intact rat liver. Significant label also localized to the nuclear envelope (NE), with relatively more detected in adult hepatocytes compared with WIF-B cells. Hepatoma cells also exhibited nucleoplasmic labelling with intense signal in the nucleolus. The endogenous labelling pattern closely resembles that of HEK293T cells heterologously expressing a TRPM7 kinase construct containing a putative nucleolar localization sequence. These results suggest that TRPM7 form and distribution between the plasma membrane and nucleus, rather than expression, is altered in parallel with differentiation status in rat hepatic cells.",

Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that the soft matrix promoted adipogenic differentiation, with higher expression levels of adipocytic markers like PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 (*P<0.05). In contrast, cells tended to differentiate into muscle when cultured on the 48\u201353 kPa matrix, which was validated by increased expression of myogenic makers like desminand MOYG (*P<0.05).

However, current protocols result in a relatively low yield of the desired alveolar cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether depleting uncommitted cells after AFE induction would have a beneficial effect on alveolar cell yield.iPSCs were differentiated on Matrigel-coated plates for 25\u00a0days. At each stage, phenotype was assessed using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and qRT-PCR. Additionally, samples were dissociated in trypsin following AFE induction to improve the purity of the cells for the subsequent lung differentiation phase. Finally, the efficacy of dissociating the samples was confirmed comparing the expression of markers indicative of pluripotency and apoptosis.The ability to differentiate iPSCs to DE was 96% and to AFE was 97% utilizing our current protocol. After depletion of uncommitted cells and 12 days in culture, the purity of lung bud progenitors was 99%. Finally, the percentage of alveolar types I and II at the end of differentiation was 74% as compared to 31% in control cultures that had not been depleted of uncommitted cells after AFE induction.In conclusion, depletion of uncommitted cells after AFE induction, improves terminal differentiation of alveolar cells from 31% to 74%.",

Lastly, we determined how culture surface coating matrices and different supplements would influence terminal differentiation. While both Matrigel and laminin coatings showed comparable effects on muscle differentiation, B27 serum-free supplement in the differentiation medium significantly enhanced myogenesis compared to horse serum.

In our study, we evaluated the influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hydrocortisone (HC), often supplemented in endothelial cell (EC) specific media, on the co-culture of adipogenic differentiated adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and microvascular endothelial cells (mvECs). In ASCs, EGF and HC are thought to inhibit adipogenic differentiation and have lipolytic activities. Our results showed that in indirect co-culture for 14 days, adipogenic differentiated ASCs further incorporated lipids and partly gained an univacuolar morphology when kept in media with low levels of EGF and HC. In media with high EGF and HC levels, cells did not incorporate further lipids, on the contrary, cells without lipid droplets appeared. Glycerol release, to measure lipolysis, also increased with elevated amounts of EGF and HC in the culture medium. Adipogenic differentiated ASCs were able to release leptin in all setups. MvECs were functional and expressed the cell specific markers, CD31 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), independent of the EGF and HC content as long as further EC specific factors were present. Taken together, our study demonstrates that adipogenic differentiated ASCs can be successfully co-cultured with mvECs in a culture medium containing low or no amounts of EGF and HC, as long as further endothelial cell and adipocyte specific factors are available.",

Arf6 remodels cytoskeletal actin and mediates membrane protein trafficking between the plasma membrane in its active form and endosomal compartments in its inactive form. While a rich knowledge exists for the cellular functions of Arf6, relatively little is known about its physiological role in development. This study examines the function of Arf6 in mediating cellular morphogenesis in early development. We dissect the function of Arf6 with a loss-of-function morpholino and constitutively active Arf6-Q67L construct. We focus on the two cell types that undergo active directed migration: the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) that give rise to the sea urchin skeleton and endodermal cells that form the gut. Our results indicate that Arf6 plays an important role in skeleton formation and PMC migration, in part due to its ability to remodel actin. We also found that embryos injected with Arf6 morpholino have gastrulation defects and embryos injected with constitutively active Arf6 have endodermal cells detached from the gut epithelium with decreased junctional cadherin staining, indicating that Arf6 may mediate the recycling of cadherin. Thus, Arf6 impacts cells that undergo coordinated movement to form embryonic structures in the developing embryo.",

To date, the association of various growth factors to induce the in vitro tenogenic differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells is poorly investigated. This study aimed to investigate the tenogenic differentiation of rabbit BMSCs by testing the combination of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-12 and 14) with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) both in 2D and 3D cultures within fibrin-based constructs. After 7 and 14 days, the tenogenic differentiation was assessed by analyzing cell metabolism and collagen content, the gene expression of tenogenic markers and the histological cell distribution and collagen deposition within 3D constructs.Our results demonstrated that the association of BMP-14 with TGF-\u03b23 and VEGF enhanced the BMSC tenogenic differentiation both in 2D and 3D cultures.

     "abstract": "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) has been recognized as an important signaling molecule that modulates chondrocyte maturation and cartilage mineralization. However, conclusive experimental evidence for its involvement in early chondrogenesis is still lacking. Here, using high-density monolayer (2D) and pellet (3D) culture models of chondrogenic ATDC5 cells, we demonstrate that the cell response to Pi does not correlate with the Pi concentration in the culture medium but is better predicted by the availability of Pi on a per cell basis (Pi abundance). Both culture models were treated with ITS+, 10mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate (\u03b2GP), or ITS+/10mM \u03b2GP, which resulted in three levels of Pi abundance in cultures: basal (Pi/DNA <10\u00a0ng/\u00b5g), moderate (Pi/DNA=25.3 \u2013 32.3\u00a0ng/\u00b5g), and high abundance (Pi/DNA >60\u00a0ng/\u00b5g). In chondrogenic medium alone, the abundance levels were at the basal level in 2D culture and moderate in 3D cultures. The addition of 10\u00a0mM \u03b2GP resulted in moderate abundance in 2D and high abundance in 3D cultures. Moderate Pi abundance enhanced early chondrogenesis and production of aggrecan and type II collagen whereas high Pi abundance inhibited chondrogenic differentiation and induced rapid mineralization. Inhibition of sodium phosphate transporters reduced phosphate-induced expression of chondrogenic markers. When 3D ITS+/\u03b2GP cultures were treated with levamisole to reduce ALP activity, Pi abundance was decreased to moderate levels, which resulted in significant upregulation of chondrogenic markers, similar to the response in 2D cultures. Delay of phosphate delivery until after early chondrogenesis occurs (7 days) no longer enhanced chondrogenesis, but instead accelerated hypertrophy and mineralization. Together, our data highlights the dependence of chondroprogenitor cell response to Pi on its availability to individual cells and the chondrogenic maturation stage of these cells and suggest that appropriate temporal delivery of phosphate to ATDC5 cells in 3D cultures represents a rapid model for mechanistic studies into the effects of exogenous cues on chondrogenic differentiation, chondrocyte maturation, and matrix mineralization.",

These proteins are involved in the biogenesis, morphology and function of caveolae, minute bulb-shaped domains of the plasma membrane that play a crucial role in the adipose tissue by controlling hormone-dependent uptake of nutrients and contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity.

We previously reported that ablation of Wnt5a in nascent mesoderm causes duplex kidney formation as a result of aberrant development of the nephric duct and abnormal extension of intermediate mesoderm. However, these mice also display a loss of the medullary region late in gestation. We have now genetically isolated duplex kidney formation from the medullary defect by specifically targeting the progenitors for both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme. The conditional mutants fail to form a normal renal medulla but no longer exhibit duplex kidney formation. Approximately 1/3 of the mutants develop hydronephrosis in the kidneys either uni- or bilaterally when using Dll1Cre. The abnormal kidney phenotype becomes prominent at E16.5, which approximates the time when urine production begins in the mouse embryonic kidney, and is associated with a dramatic increase in apoptosis only in mutant kidneys with hydronephrosis. Methylene blue dye injection and histologic examination reveal that aberrant cell death likely results from urine toxicity due to an abnormal ureter-bladder connection. This study shows that Wnt5a is not required for development of the renal medulla and that loss of the renal medullary region in the Wnt5a-deleted kidney is caused by an abnormal ureter-bladder connection.",

Here we focus on the phenotype of Rlf null mutant mice generated via an ENU mutagenesis screen, to identify genes required for epigenetic regulation.RLF is expressed in a range of fetal mouse tissues, including the fetal heart. Comprehensive timed-mating studies are consistent with our previously reported findings that Rlf homozygous mutant mice rarely survive to adulthood, with the majority dying shortly after birth. Histological analysis of two independent Rlf ENU mutant lines at E11.5\u2013E14.5 showed heart defects resembling those present in humans with Left Ventricular Non-Compaction (LVNC). In situ hybridisation analysis localized expression of Rlf to the endocardium and epicardium of embryonic and postnatal hearts, and transiently to cardiomyocytes during heart looping and early chamber formation stages. RNA-seq analysis of Rlf mutant hearts highlighted defective NOTCH pathway signalling, recently describe as one cause of LVNC.This study provides the first evidence that RLF is required for normal heart development in the mouse. The heart morphological defects present at high penetrance in Rlf mutants are consistent with features of LVNC in humans, and molecular analysis identified attenuated JAGGED 1 expression and NOTCH signalling as likely contributors to these defects. Our study highlights the importance of RLF-dependent epigenetic modifications to DNA for maintaining correct gene regulatory network and intercellular signalling interactions during heart chamber and septal development. Further investigations are needed to define the biochemical role of RLF in the developing heart, and whether RLF mutations are a cause of heart defects in humans.",

Disruption of the hbx9 gene in Ax2 cells delay initiation of development and also slows cell proliferation. There was decreased cadA expression during the development of hbx9- cells, which results in inappropriate cell contacts, altered cell motility and patterning properties. ecmA and ecmB were mis-expressed in the pstO and pstA regions resulting in an effectively smaller pstO region. Surprisingly, the total ecmAO expression in pstAO cells was comparable to the wild type, suggesting that in hbx9- cells, ecmA was expressed in the pstO region. In hbx9-, proportioning and patterning was altered in favour of pstA cell-type. Moreover, precocious expression of ecmB and pspA was also observed in the vegetative cells. Expression profiling of components of cAMP signalling suggest that Hbx9 controls cell proportioning of prestalk cells by modulating cAMP signalling during growth-to-development transition.",

The penile malformations elicited by this potent anti-androgen include a substantial proximal shift in the urethral meatus that clearly conforms to the definition of hypospadias based upon specific morphological criteria for this malformation. Through examination of the normal penile development and flutamide-induced abnormal penile development observed in prenatally oil- and flutamide-treated rats, our analysis provides insights into the morphogenetic mechanism of development of hypospadias. In this regard, a common theme in normal penile development is midline fusion of epithelia followed by removal of the epithelial seam and establishment of midline mesenchymal confluence during development of the penile urethra and prepuce, processes which are impaired as a result of prenatal flutamide treatment. The developmental processes occurring in normal penile development, through comparison with development of female external genitalia and those impaired due to prenatal flutamide treatment, are consistent with critical role of androgen receptors in normal penile development in the rat, and the specific penile abnormalities embodied in flutamide-induced rat hypospadias.",

The A-tether includes lamins A/C and additional unknown components presumably INM protein(s) interacting with both lamins A/C and chromatin. The B-tether includes the inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein Lamin B-receptor, which binds B-type lamins and chromatin. Generally, at least one of the tethers is always present in the nuclear envelope of mammalian cells. Deletion of both causes the loss of peripheral heterochromatin and consequently inversion of the entire nuclear architecture, with this occurring naturally in rod photoreceptors of nocturnal mammals. The tethers are differentially utilized during development, regulate gene expression in opposite manners, and play an important role during cell differentiation. Here we aimed to identify the unknown chromatin binding component(s) of the A-tether. We analyzed 10 mouse tissues by immunostaining with antibodies against 7 INM proteins and found that every cell type has specific, although differentially and developmentally regulated, sets of these proteins. In particular, we found that INM protein LEMD2 is concomitantly expressed with A-type lamins in various cell types but is lacking in inverted nuclei of rod cells. Truncation or deletion of Lmna resulted in the downregulation and mislocalization of LEMD2, suggesting that the two proteins interact and pointing at LEMD2 as a potential chromatin binding mediator of the A-tether. Using nuclei of mouse rods as an experimental model lacking peripheral heterochromatin, we expressed a LEMD2 transgene alone or in combination with lamin C in these cells and observed no restoration of peripheral heterochromatin in either case. We conclude that in contrary to the B-tether, the A-tether has a more intricate composition and consists of multiple components that presumably vary, at differing degrees of redundancy, between cell types and differentiation stages.",

Here we show that Nemo-like kinase 1 (Nlk1), an atypical mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, physically associates with the C-terminus of PAPC. This interaction mutually stabilizes both proteins by inhibiting polyubiquitination. The Nlk1 mediated stabilization of PAPC is essential for Wnt/PCP signaling, tissue separation and gastrulation movements. We identified two conserved putative phosphorylation sites in the PAPC C-terminus that are critical for Nlk1 mediated PAPC stabilization and Wnt/PCP regulation. Intriguingly, the kinase activity of Nlk1 itself was not essential for its cooperation with PAPC, suggesting an indirect regulation for example by impeding a different kinase that promotes protein degradation.

Biopsy samples from cases of human Barrett's metaplasia were analysed for the presence of CDX2 and HNF4\u03b1. A new organ culture system for adult murine oesophagus is described. Using this, Cdx2 and HNF4\u03b1 were ectopically expressed by adenoviral infection.

Our oesophageal organ culture system expressed markers characteristic of the normal SSQE: p63, K14, K4 and loricrin. Ectopic expression of HNF4\u03b1, but not of Cdx2 induced expression of Tff3, villin, K8 and E-cadherin. HNF4\u03b1 is sufficient to induce a columnar-like phenotype in adult mouse oesophageal epithelium and is present in the human condition.

Here we show that it is possible to take skeletal muscle satellite cells from jaw muscles of the adult mouse and to direct their differentiation to become heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes). This is done by exposing the cells to extracellular factors similar to those which heart progenitors would experience during normal embryonic development. By contrast, cardiac differentiation does not occur at all from satellite cells isolated from trunk and limb muscles, which originate from the somites of the embryo. The cardiomyocytes arising from jaw muscle satellite cells express a range of specific marker proteins, beat spontaneously, display long action potentials with appropriate responses to nifedipine, norepinephrine and carbachol, and show synchronized calcium transients. Our results show the existence of a persistent cardiac developmental competence in satellite cells of the adult jaw muscles, associated with their origin from the second heart field of the embryo, and suggest a possible method of obtaining cardiomyocytes from individual patients without the need for a heart biopsy.",

We previously found that androgens induce CTNNB1 signaling in mouse urogenital sinus (UGS) epithelium from which prostatic ductal epithelium derives. Others have shown that low estradiol concentrations induce UGS epithelial proliferative growth. Here, we found that CTNNB1 signaling overlaps cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in prostatic buds and we used a genetic approach to test whether CTNNB1 signaling induces CCND1 expression. We observed an unexpected sexually dimorphic response to hyperactive CCNTB1 signaling: in male mouse UGS it increased Ccnd1 mRNA abundance without increasing its protein abundance but in female UGS it increased Ccnd1 mRNA and protein abundance, suggesting a potential role for estrogens in stabilizing CCND1 protein. Treating wild type male UGS explants with androgen and either 17\u03b2-estradiol or a proteasome inhibitor increased CCND1 protein and KI67 labeling in prostatic bud epithelium. Together, our results are consistent with an epithelial proliferative growth mechanism linking CTNNB1-driven Ccnd1 transcription and estrogen-mediated CCND1 protein stabilization.",

The expression of mRNAs that control these events are well described, but little is known about the in vivo roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including both microRNAs (miRNAs) and the lesser-studied long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). We analysed expression patterns for a broad range of lncRNAs (including Neat1, Malat1, Sra, Meg3, LncMyoD and linc-MD1), miRNAs and mRNAs in muscles of normal male C57Bl/6J mice at 2 days and 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks after birth. These post-natal patterns were compared with expression of these RNAs during classic C2C12 myogenesis and differentiation in tissue culture. This overview of RNAs during post-natal skeletal muscle growth provides a novel focus on ncRNAs during this often overlooked growth period, with many potential applications to normal muscle growth in humans and livestock, and to childhood muscle disorders.",

Pancreatic differentiation has remained an important challenge in large part because of the need to differentiate uncommitted pluripotent stem cells into highly specialized hormone-secreting cells, which has been shown to require a developmentally informed step-by-step induction procedure. Here, in the framework of using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate pancreatic cells for pancreatic diseases, we have generated and characterized iPSCs from Pdx1-GFP transgenic mice. The use of a GFP reporter knocked into the endogenous Pdx1 promoter allowed us to monitor pancreatic induction based on the expression of Pdx1, a pancreatic master transcription factor, and to isolate a pure Pdx1-GFP+ population for downstream applications. Differentiated cultures timely expressed markers specific to each stage and end-stage progenies acquired a rather immature beta-cell phenotype, characterized by polyhormonal expression even among cells highly expressing the Pdx1-GFP reporter. Our findings highlight the utility of employing a fluorescent protein reporter under the control of a master developmental gene in order to devise novel differentiation protocols for relevant cell types for degenerative diseases such as pancreatic beta cells for diabetes.",

Differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization, and mRNA expression for marker genes. To examine the osteogenic potential to regenerate bone, the critical-sized mouse calvarial defect model was utilized. Incubation of PDLCs and osteoblasts with STP and SHMP resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in growth, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization and mRNA expression for marker genes. STP and SHMP increased phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, attenuatted STP- and SHMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Micro-CT and histologic analysis showed that STP significantly increased new bone formation in calvarial defects, compared with SHMP and control group. Collectively, this is the first study to demonstrate that STP and SHMP promotes the osteoblastic differentiation in vitro, whereas STP only stimulated bone repair in vivo.

Thus, MSCs are promising candidates for cell-based medicine. However, classifications of MSCs have been defined retrospectively; moreover, this conventional criterion may be inaccurate due to contamination with other hematopoietic lineage cells. Human MSCs can be enriched by selection for LNGFR and THY-1, and this population may be analogous to murine PDGFR\u03b1+Sca-1+ cells, which are developmentally derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). Murine NCCs were labeled by fluorescence, which provided definitive proof of neural crest lineage, however, technical considerations prevent the use of a similar approach to determine the origin of human LNGFR+THY-1+ MSCs. To further clarify the origin of human MSCs, human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used in this study. Under culture conditions required for the induction of neural crest cells, human ESCs and iPSCs-derived cells highly expressed LNGFR and THY-1. These LNGFR+THY-1+ neural crest-like cells, designated as LT-NCLCs, showed a strong potential to differentiate into both mesenchymal and neural crest lineages. LT-NCLCs proliferated to form colonies and actively migrated in response to serum concentration. Furthermore, we transplanted LT-NCLCs into chick embryos, and traced their potential for survival, migration and differentiation in the host environment. These results suggest that LNGFR+THY-1+ cells identified following NCLC induction from ESCs/iPSCs shared similar potentials with multipotent MSCs.",

This uncertainty is due to the different developmental stages that give rise to anterior and posterior DE from anterior primitive streak (APS). Therefore, these DE cell populations might be generated from the different stages of APS cells, which affect the DE cell differentiation potential. Here, we succeeded in selectively differentiating early and late APS cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using different concentrations of CHIR99021, a small molecule Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activator. We also established novel differentiation systems from hiPSCs into three types of DE cells: anterior and posterior domains of anterior DE cells through early APS cells and posterior DE cells through late APS cells. These different DE cell populations could differentiate into distinct endodermal lineages in vitro, such as lung, liver or small intestine progenitors. These results indicate that different APS cells can produce distinct types of DE cells that have proper developmental potency and suggest a method to evaluate the quality of endodermal cell induction from hPSCs.",

Here we studied the effects of 10 and 100\u00a0nM E2 on ASC and BMSC vitality, proliferation and differentiation towards osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. E2 did not modulate ASC and BMSC vitality and growth rate, while the hormone produced a pro-adipogenic effect on both mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). In particular, the synergy between 7-day pre-treatment and 100\u00a0nM E2 led to the most evident result, increasing lipid vacuoles formation in ASCs and BMSCs of +44% and +82%, respectively. Despite the fact that E2 did not alter collagen deposition of osteo-induced MSCs, we observed a different modulation of ASC and BMSC alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Indeed, this osteogenic marker was always enhanced by 17 \u03b2-estradiol in BMSCs, and 7-day pre-treatment with 100\u00a0nM E2 increased it of about 70%. In contrast, E2 weakened ASC osteogenic potential, reducing their ALP activity of about 20%, with the most evident effect on ASCs isolated from pre-menopausal women (\u221230%).Finally, we identified an estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) variant of about 37\u00a0kDa expressed in both MSCs. Interestingly, adipogenic stimuli drastically reduced its expression, while osteogenic ones mildly increased this isoform in BMSCs only.In conclusion, E2 positively affected the adipogenic process of both MSCs while it favored osteogenic induction in BMSCs only, and both mesenchymal progenitors expressed a novel 37\u00a0kDa ER-\u03b1 variant whose expression was modulated during differentiation.",

     "abstract": "Current cartilage repair therapies focus on the delivery of chondrocytes differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells, and thus understanding the factors that promote chondrogenesis may lead to improved therapies. Several bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been implicated in chondrogenic differentiation and/or chondrocyte function. Although the signaling pathways downstream of BMPs have been studied in other systems, their role in chondrogenesis is less well characterized. Here, we investigated the effects of BMP-9 in chondroprogenitor cells. Compared to BMP-2 and BMP-6, we showed that BMP-9 was significantly more potent in inducing chondrogenic differentiation in mouse C3H10T1/2 and ATDC5 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that BMP-9 induces the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 in a dose and time dependent manner. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrated an accumulation of phosphorylated SMAD1/5 in the nuclei of BMP-9 treated cells. Consistent with activation of the SMAD signaling pathway, we also observed an up-regulation of Id1 and PAI-I expression. Importantly, we demonstrated that the simultaneous knockdown of SMAD1 and SMAD5 was able to inhibit chondrogenesis. Additionally, we also observed activation of p38 by BMP-9, and pharmacological inhibition of this pathway blocked chondrogenesis. In contrast, inhibition of p44/42 ERK had no effect. Finally, we tested the ability of Noggin to block the actions of BMP-9. While Noggin potently inhibited the ability of BMP-2 to mediate differentiation, it had no significant effect on BMP-9. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of the cellular pathways utilized by BMP-9 for chondrogenesis that may help improve current therapies for regenerative cartilage repair.",

The mouse has been previously used as a model of hypospadias, despite an unacceptably wide range of definitions for this malformation. The current paper presents objective criteria and a definition of mouse hypospadias. Accordingly, diethylstilbestrol (DES) induced penile malformations were examined at 60 days postnatal (P60) in mice treated with DES over the age range of 12 days embryonic to 20 days postnatal (E12\u2013P20). DES-induced hypospadias involves malformation of the urethral meatus, which is most severe in DES E12\u2013P10, DES P0\u2013P10 and DES P5\u2013P15 groups, and less so or absent in the other treatment groups. A frenulum-like ventral tether between the penis and the prepuce was seen in the most severely affected DES-treated mice. Internal penile morphology was also altered in the DES E12\u2013P10, DES P0\u2013P10 and DES P5\u2013P15 groups (with little effect in the other DES treatment groups). Thus, adverse effects of DES are a function of the period of DES treatment and most severe in the P0\u2013P10 period. In \u201cestrogen mutant mice\u201d (NERKI, \u03b2ERKO, \u03b1ERKO and AROM+) hypospadias was only seen in AROM+ male mice having genetically-engineered elevation is serum estrogen. Significantly, mouse hypospadias was only seen distally at and near the urethral meatus where epithelial fusion events are known to take place and never in the penile midshaft, where urethral formation occurs via an entirely different morphogenetic process.",

Aberrant RA levels due to genetic variations in RA metabolism pathways contribute to congenital malformations in these structures. In vitro and in vivo studies provide considerable evidence on the effects of RA and its possible role in the development of the epidermis, the limbs and the secondary palate. In conjunction with other regulatory factors, RA seems to stimulate the development of the epidermis by inducing proliferation and differentiation of ectodermal cells into epidermal cells. In the limbs, the exact timing of RA location and level is crucial to initiate limb bud formation and to allow chondrogenesis and subsequent osteogenesis. In the secondary palate, the correct RA concentration is a key factor for mesenchymal cell proliferation during palatal shelf outgrowth, elevation and adhesion, and finally to allow bone formation in the hard palate. These findings are highly relevant to understanding the mechanism of RA signalling in development and in the aetiology of specific congenital diseases.",

     "abstract": "We recently described a two-step process of urethral plate canalization and urethral fold fusion to form the human penile urethra. Canalization (\u201copening zipper\u201d) opens the solid urethral plate into a groove, and fusion (\u201cclosing zipper\u201d) closes the urethral groove to form the penile urethra. We hypothesize that failure of canalization and/or fusion during human urethral formation can lead to hypospadias. Herein, we use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and analysis of transverse serial sections to better characterize development of the human fetal penile urethra as contrasted to the development of the human fetal clitoris.Eighteen 7\u201313 week human fetal external genitalia specimens were analyzed by SEM, and fifteen additional human fetal specimens were sectioned for histologic analysis. SEM images demonstrate canalization of the urethral/vestibular plate in the developing male and female external genitalia, respectively, followed by proximal to distal fusion of the urethral folds in males only. The fusion process during penile development occurs sequentially in multiple layers and through the interlacing of epidermal \u201ccords\u201d. Complex epithelial organization is also noted at the site of active canalization. The demarcation between the epidermis of the shaft and the glans becomes distinct during development, and the epithelial tag at the distal tip of the penile and clitoral glans regresses as development progresses.In summary, SEM analysis of human fetal specimens supports the two-zipper hypothesis of formation of the penile urethra. The opening zipper progresses from proximal to distal along the shaft of the penis and clitoris into the glans in identical fashion in both sexes. The closing zipper mechanism is active only in males and is not a single process but rather a series of layered fusion events, uniquely different from the simple fusion of two epithelial surfaces as occurs in formation of the palate and neural tube.",

     "abstract": "Distraction osteogenesis (DO) remains a major challenge in orthopedic and craniofacial surgery. The transplantion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could reduce the treatment period and the associated complications by increasing new bone formation during long-bone DO. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) encodes a nuclear protein that is a pivotal regulator of osteoblast differentiation. It significantly stimulates calcium accumulation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of gene therapy using Runx2 on new bone formation during tibia DO of rabbits. The distraction gap of the rabbits was injected with adenovirus (Adv)-Runx2-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected DPSCs (overexpression group, Group OE) or Adv-GFP-transfected DPSCs (negative control group, Group NC). Rabbits in the control group (Groups CON) were injected with physiologic saline. The generation of new bone tissue in the distraction gap was studied by radiographic examination, micro-computed tomography (CT) evaluation, histological analyze, and Mechanical testing at weeks 8 in the consolidation period. Excellent bone formation in the distracted callus was observed in Group OE and Group NC. Moreover, the OE group showed better bone formation and the highest bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). Group CON animals showed inadequate bone formation in the distracted callus compared to the other groups. The results suggest that gene therapy using Runx2-modi\ufb01ed DPSCs was more effective during bone deposition and new bone formation in tibia DO.",

SOX9 has also been linked to colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer. We found that SOX9 is expressed in the epithelium of the adult mouse and human uterus, predominantly marking the uterine glands. To determine if SOX9 plays a role in the development of endometrial cancer we overexpressed Sox9 in the uterine epithelium using a progesterone receptor-Cre mouse model. Sox9 overexpression in the uterine epithelium led to the formation of simple and complex cystic glandular structures in the endometrium of aged-females. Histological analysis revealed that these structures appeared morphologically similar to structures present in patients with endometrial hyperplastic lesions and endometrial polyps that are thought to be precursors of endometrial cancer. The molecular mechanisms that cause the glandular epithelium to become hyperplastic, leading to endometrial cancer are still poorly understood. These findings indicate that chronic overexpression of Sox9 in the uterine epithelium can induce the development of endometrial hyperplastic lesions. Thus, SOX9 expression may be a factor in the formation of endometrial cancer.",

     "abstract": "Salivary gland (SG) defects have a wide range of health implications, including xerostomia, bacterial infections, and oral health issues. Branching morphogenesis is critical for SG development. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process will accelerate SG regeneration studies. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) interacts with multiple fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which promote development. FGFR2 consists of two isoforms, FGFR2b and FGFR2c. FGFR2b is critical for SG development, but little is known about the expression and function of FGFR2c. We investigated the expression of all FGFR family members in fetal SGs between embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and E18.5. Based on RT-PCR, we observed an increase in the expression of not only Fgfr2b, but also Fgfr2c in early-stage embryonic mouse SGs, suggesting that FGFR2c is related to SG development. The branch number decreased in response to exogenous FGF2 stimulation, and this effect was suppressed by a mouse anti-FGFR2c neutralizing antibody (NA) and siRNA targeting FGFR2c, whereas FGFR2b signaling was not inhibited. Moreover, the expression of marker genes related to EMT was induced by FGF2, and this expression was suppressed by the NA. These results suggested that branching morphogenesis in SGs is regulated by FGFR2c, in addition to FGFR2b. Interestingly, FGFR2c signaling also led to increased fgf10 expression, and this increase was suppressed by the NA. FGFR2c signaling regulates branching morphogenesis through the activation of FGFR2b signaling via increased FGF10 autocrine. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms by which crosstalk between FGFR2b and FGFR2c results in efficient branching morphogenesis.",

The possibilities include activation of liver resident cells including portal fibroblasts, hepatic stellate cells, mesenchymal progenitor cells, and fibrocytes recruited from the bone marrow. It is considered that hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts are the major source of hepatic myofibroblasts. In fact, the origin of myofibroblasts differs significantly for chronic liver diseases of different etiologies, such as cholestatic liver disease or hepatotoxic liver disease. Depending on etiology of hepatic injury, the fibrogenic foci might initiate within the hepatic lobule as seen in chronic hepatitis, or primarily affect the portal areas as in most biliary diseases.

     "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a common characteristic of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aberrant and excessive depositions of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in both glomeruli and interstitial regions are typical hallmarks of renal fibrosis and amplify the severity of kidney injury. To date, an approved therapy specifically targeted to renal fibrosis is needed to mitigate or even retard renal fibrosis. Recent findings have identified a unique population of myofibroblasts as a primary source of ECM in scar tissue formation. However, the origin of myofibroblasts in renal fibrosis remains the subject of controversial debates. The advancement in lineage tracing and immunofluorescent microscopy technologies have suggested that myofibroblasts may arise from a number of sources such as activated renal fibroblasts, pericytes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), bone marrow derived cells and fibrocytes. Recent studies also indicate that multiple ligands of TGF-\u03b2/Smads are the direct mediators for renal fibrosis. Consistently, inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/Smads signaling pathway using various strategies significantly reduce renal fibrotic lesions and ameliorate kidney injury, suggesting that targeting the TGF-\u03b2/Smads signaling pathway could be a new strategy for effective therapies. In this review, we will briefly discuss the diverse origins of myofibroblasts and molecular pathways triggering renal fibrosis. Prospective therapeutic approaches based on those molecular mechanisms will hopefully offer exciting insights in the development of new therapeutic interventions for patients in the near future.",

Surprisingly these cells expressed certain markers characteristic of both neuronal and glial cells.

The present study has been undertaken to understand the role of PARP-1 in growth and development of a unicellular eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum. In silico analysis demonstrates ADPRT1A as the ortholog of human PARP-1 in D. discoideum. The present study shows that ADPRT1A overexpression (A OE) led to slow growth of D. discoideum and significant population of AOE cells were in S and G2/M phase. Also, AOE cells exhibited high endogenous PARP activity, significant NAD+ depletion and also significantly lower ADPRT1B and ADPRT2 transcript levels. Moreover, AOE cells are intrinsically stressed and also exhibited susceptibility to oxidative stress. AOE also affected development of D. discoideum predominantly streaming, aggregation and formation of early culminant which are concomitant with reports on PARP's role in D. discoideum development. In addition, under developmental stimuli, increased PARP activity was seen along with developmentally regulated transcript levels of ADPRT1A during D. discoideum multicellularity. Thus the present study suggests that PARP-1 regulates growth as well as the developmental morphogenesis of D. discoideum, thereby opening new avenues to understand the same in higher eukaryotes.",

SLPI's expression is well-documented in the reproductive tract, but it remains unclear whether it is active during early embryonic development. In this study, the expression and role of Slpi in the early embryo were evaluated. In vitro embryo cultures in chemically defined simple medium resulted in a reduction in developmental speed from the 8-cell stage, as well as implantation rate compared with in vivo embryos. SLPI protein was localized to the membrane or submembrane cytoplasm in an embryonic stage-dependent manner. In vitro cultured embryos exhibited lower levels of Slpi mRNA expression than in vivo embryos. Slpi knockdown by antisense oligonucleotides attenuated the developmental speed and implantation rate compared with Slpi sense oligonucleotide-transfected embryos and in vitro controls. The critical period for the attenuation of developmental speed occurred after the 8-cell stage. SLPI treatment accelerated development, increased implantation rate, and ameliorated the suppressive effects of Slpi knockdown. Slpi knockdown did not induce changes in the total cell number or inner cell number in blastocysts. Meanwhile, SLPI upregulated the expression of the developmental factors matrix metalloproteinase-14, neutrophil elastase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Together, these results suggest that SLPI is an effective regulator of developmental speed and implantation competence in an autocrine and paracrine manner, respectively, and plays a role in controlling the expression of embryonic development factors, such as MMP family members.",

Interestingly, an important point is that how much products of the reprogramming, transdifferentiation and differentiation (programming) are identical to their in vivo counterparts. There is evidence that shows that direct fate conversions of somatic cells are not complete, with target cell identity not fully achieved. Manipulation of core TFs provides a powerful tool for engineering cell fate in terms of extinguishment of native GRNs, the establishment of a new GRN, and preventing installation of aberrant GRNs. Conventionally, core TFs are selected to convert one cell type into another mostly based on literature and the experimental identification of genes that are differentially expressed in one cell type compared to the specific cell types. Currently, there is not a universal standard strategy for identifying candidate core TFs. Remarkably, several biological computational platforms are developed, which are capable of evaluating the fidelity of reprogramming methods and refining existing protocols. The current review discusses some deficiencies of reprogramming technologies in the production of a pure population of authentic target cells. Furthermore, it reviews the role of computational approaches (e.g. CellNet, KeyGenes, Mogrify, etc.) in improving (re)programming methods and consequently in regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics.",

MSCs are capable of osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic differentiation. Efficacy of differentiated MSCs to regenerate cells in the injured tissues requires the ability to maintain the differentiation toward the desired cell fate. Since MSCs represent an attractive source for autologous transplantation, cellular and molecular signaling pathways and micro-environmental changes have been studied in order to understand the role of cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors on the differentiation of MSCs. The differentiation of MSC into a mesenchymal lineage is genetically manipulated and promoted by specific transcription factors associated with a particular cell lineage. Recent studies have explored the integration of transcription factors, including Runx2, Sox9, PPAR\u03b3, MyoD, GATA4, and GATA6 in the differentiation of MSCs. Therefore, the overexpression of a single transcription factor in MSCs may promote trans-differentiation into specific cell lineage, which can be used for treatment of some diseases. In this review, we critically discussed and evaluated the role of transcription factors and related signaling pathways that affect the differentiation of MSCs toward adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes, skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and smooth muscle cells.",

While the majority of PDXs are grafted under the skin of immunodeficient mice, the Living Tumor Laboratory (LTL), using unique subrenal capsule grafting techniques, has successfully established more than 200 transplantable PDX models of various low to high grade human cancers. The LTL PDX models retain key biological properties of the original malignancies, including histopathological and molecular characteristics, tumor heterogeneity, metastatic ability, and response to treatment. The PDXs are stored frozen at early transplant generations in a resurrectable form, which eliminates continuous passaging in mice, thus ensuring maintenance of the high biologic and molecular fidelity and reproducibility of the models. The PDX models have been demonstrated to be powerful tools for (i) studies of cancer progression, metastasis and drug resistance, (ii) evidenced-based precision cancer therapy, (iii) preclinical drug efficacy testing and discovery of new anti-cancer drug candidates. To better provide resources for the research community, an LTL website (www.livingtumorlab.com) has been designed as a publicly accessible database which allows researchers to identify PDX models suitable for translational/preclinical cancer research. In summary, subrenal capsule grafting technology maximizes both tumor engraftment rate and retention of human cancer heterogeneity. Moreover, the method makes possible the recovery of PDXs from frozen stocks for further applications, thus providing a powerful platform for translational cancer research.",

This method results in good embryonic organ morphology. Filter culture has been used to culture a number of different embryonic organs and there are a variety of filter choices available. The key disadvantage of agar-block and filter based culture is that the large amount of media required can make the approach expensive, especially if biologicals such as growth factors are necessary; in addition, using these methods it can be difficult to track particular samples. Hanging drop culture is most commonly used to enable the aggregation of embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies but it has also been employed for ex vivo organ culture. This method requires only 40\u00a0\u03bcL of media per drop and isolates every organ to a trackable unit.

Over the past decades, tissue and organ-like culture methods have been developed with the intention of reproducing in vivo situations. Developing accessible and simple techniques to study and manipulate embryos is an everlasting challenge. Herein, we describe a reliable and quick technique to culture mid-gestation explanted mouse embryos on top of a floating membrane filter in a defined medium. Viability of the cultured tissues was assessed by apoptosis and proliferation analysis showing that cell proliferation is normal and there is only a slight increase in apoptosis after 12\u00a0h of culture compared to embryos developing in utero. Moreover, differentiation and morphogenesis proceed normally as assessed by 3D imaging of the transformation of the myotome into deep back muscles. Not only does muscle cell differentiation occur as expected, but so do extracellular matrix organization and the characteristic splitting of the myotome into the three epaxial muscle groups. Our culture method allows for the culture and manipulation of mammalian embryo explants in a very efficient way, and it permits the manipulation of in vivo developmental events in a controlled environment. Explants grown under these ex utero conditions simulate real developmental events that occur in utero.",

The development of sexually dimorphic tissues starts with an ambisexual structure. It is followed by sex-specific organogenesis as guided by different signaling pathways that occur from late embryonic stages. The measurement of the anogenital distance (AGD), and the observation of the external genitalia are practical ways to distinguish male and female pups at birth and thereafter. Careful observation of the morphological or histological features and the molecular signatures of the external genitalia and perineum enable identification of sex or feminization/masculinization of embryos. Aberrations in hormone signaling via castration or treatment with hormones or hormone disruptors result in dysmorphogenesis of reproductive tissues. Several hormone disruptors have been used to modulate different aspects of hormone action through competitive inhibition and exogenous hormone treatment. Concomitantly, the vast advancement of conditional mutant mouse analysis leads to the frequent utilization of Cre recombination technology in the study of reproductive/urogenital tissue development. Mouse Cre-lines that are tissue-specific and cell-specific are also effective tools in identifying the molecular mechanisms during sexually dimorphic development. Cre-lines applicable to different cell populations in the prostate, seminal vesicles, testis and ovaries, and mammary glands are currently being utilized. In the external genitalia and perineum, Cre lines that examine the signaling pathways of cells of endodermal, ectodermal, and mesenchymal origin reveal the roles of these tissues in the development of the external genitalia. The interaction of hormones and growth factors can be examined further through a variety of techniques available for researchers.

Established methods to generate CMs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) include the Spin-embryoid body (Spin-EB) and monolayer-based differentiation protocol. In the presence of an optimized cocktail of growth factors under defined conditions, hPSCs differentiate efficiently into functional contracting CMs within 10 days. Nevertheless, despite high efficiencies, cardiac-directed differentiations of hPSCs typically result in heterogeneous populations comprised of both CMs and uncharacterized non-cardiac cell-types. Therefore, generation of pure populations of stem cell-derived CMs is of fundamental importance for basic cardiac research and pre-clinical and possible clinical applications. For the purification of CMs from heterogeneous populations, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) is a widely appreciated method. Nonetheless, FACS-based isolation of CMs comes along with several disadvantages, such as undesired contaminations and low viability of target cells. Here, we describe a convenient and rapid procedure for the purification of hPSCs-derived CMs under sterile culture conditions, resulting in high purity and viability of sorted CMs. Purification with VCAMI-coupled magnetic Dynabeads led to robust enrichment of CMs, which will especially be important for cardiac differentiations of cell lines with poor differentiation efficiencies. In addition, this will also be beneficial for the standardization and reproducibility of human stem cell-derived assays in the fields of cardiac disease modeling, drug discovery and disease modeling.",

     "abstract": "Differentiation during hematopoiesis leads to the generation of many cell types with specific functions. At various stages of maturation, the cells may change pathologically, leading to diseases including acute leukemias (ALs). Expression levels of regulatory molecules (such as the IKZF, GATA, HOX, FOX, NOTCH and CEBP families, as well as SPI-1/PU1 and PAX5) and lineage-specific molecules (including CD2, CD14, CD79A, and BLNK) may be compared between pathological and physiological cells. Although the key steps of differentiation are known, the available databases focus mainly on fully differentiated cells as a reference. Precursor cells may be a more appropriate reference point for diseases that evolve at immature stages. Therefore, we developed a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array to investigate 90 genes that are characteristic of the lymphoid or myeloid lineages and/or are thought to be involved in their regulation. Using this array, sorted cells of granulocytic, monocytic, T and B lineages were analyzed. For each of these lineages, 3\u20135 differentiation stages were selected (17 stages total), and cells were sorted from 3 different donors per stage. The qPCR results were compared to similarly processed AL cells of lymphoblastic (n=18) or myeloid (n=6) origins and biphenotypic AL cells of B cell origin with myeloid involvement (n=5). Molecules characteristic of each lineage were found. In addition, cells of a newly discovered switching lymphoblastic AL (swALL) were sorted at various phases during the supposed transdifferentiation from an immature B cell to a monocytic phenotype. As demonstrated previously, gene expression changed along with the immunophenotype. The qPCR data are publicly available in the LeukoStage Database in which gene expression in malignant and non-malignant cells of different lineages can be explored graphically and differentially expressed genes can be identified. In addition, the LeukoStage Database can aid the functional analyses of next-generation sequencing data.",

This transcription factor has been previously associated with a suite of cardiac congenital malformations and impairment of electrical activity. When disease causative mutations in transcription factors are considered, NKX2-5 gene dysfunction is the most common abnormality found in patients. Here we describe a novel mouse model and subsequent implications of Nkx2-5 loss for aspects of myocardial electrical activity. In this work we have engineered a new Nkx2-5 conditional knockout mouse in which flox sites flank the entire Nkx2-5 locus, and validated this line for the study of heart development, differentiation and disease using a full deletion strategy. While our homozygous knockout mice show typical embryonic malformations previously described for the lack of the Nkx2-5 gene, hearts of heterozygous adult mice show moderate morphological and functional abnormalities that are sufficient to sustain blood supply demands under homeostatic conditions. This study further reveals intriguing aspects of Nkx2-5 function in the control of cardiac electrical activity. Using a combination of mouse genetics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, we demonstrate that Nkx2-5 regulates the gene encoding Kcnh2 channel and others, shedding light on potential mechanisms generating electrical abnormalities observed in patients bearing NKX2-5 dysfunction and opening opportunities to the study of novel therapeutic targets for anti-arrhythmogenic therapies.",

Here we used stage-specific in vivo gain- and loss-of-function approaches, as well as lineage tracing experiments in the mouse, to first demonstrate that \u03b2-catenin is dispensable for differentiation of liver precursor cells (hepatoblasts) to cholangiocyte precursors. Second, when \u03b2-catenin was depleted in the latter, maturation of cholangiocytes, bile duct morphogenesis and differentiation of periportal hepatocytes from cholangiocyte precursors was normal. In contrast, stabilization of \u03b2-catenin in cholangiocyte precursors perturbed duct development and cholangiocyte differentiation. We conclude that \u03b2-catenin is dispensable for biliary development but that its activity must be kept within tight limits. Our work is expected to significantly impact on in vitro differentiation of stem cells to cholangiocytes for toxicology studies and disease modeling.",

     "abstract": "Transdifferentiation as a new approach for obtaining the ideal cells for transplantation has gradually become a hot research topic. Compared with the induced pluripotent stem cells technique, transdifferentiation may have better efficiency and safety. Although the mechanism of transdifferentiation is still unknown, many studies have achieved transformation of one cell type to another through transcription factors or microRNA. The current major strategy for transdifferentiation is via transcription factors; however, there are some safety issues with the use of transcription factors. In contrast, microRNA as a novel tool for inducing transdifferentiation through post-transcriptional regulation may be more safe and efficient. In addition, the present transdifferentiation strategies involve obtaining the terminal cell directly, so the amount of cells produced may not be sufficient and they may have low capacity for cell immigration and integration. Therefore, an indirect transdifferentiation strategy for producing unipotent cells is ideal as it can preserve the proliferation capacity and differentiation pathway.",

     "abstract": "Regeneration of \u03b2-cells in diabetic patients is an important goal of diabetes research. Islet Neogenesis Associated Protein (INGAP) was discovered in the partially duct-obstructed hamster pancreas. Its bioactive fragment, pentadecapeptide 104\u2013118 (INGAP-P), has been shown to reverse diabetes in animal models and to improve glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes in clinical trials. Further development of INGAP as a therapy for diabetes requires identification of target cells in the pancreas and characterization of the mechanisms of action. We hypothesized that adult human pancreatic ductal cells retain morphogenetic plasticity and can be induced by INGAP to undergo endocrine differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we treated the normal human pancreatic ductal cell line (HPDE) with either INGAP-P or full-length recombinant protein (rINGAP) for short-term periods. Our data show that this single drug treatment induces both proliferation and transdifferentiation of HPDE cells, the latter being characterized by the rapid sequential activation of endocrine developmental transcription factors Pdx-1, Ngn3, NeuroD, IA-1, and MafA and subsequently the expression of insulin at both the mRNA and the protein levels. After 7 days, C-peptide was detected in the supernatant of INGAP-treated cells, reflecting their ability to secrete insulin. The magnitude of differentiation was enhanced by embedding the cells in Matrigel, which led to islet-like cluster formation. The islet-like clusters cells stained positive for nuclear Pdx-1 and Glut 2 proteins, and were expressing Insulin mRNA.These new data suggest that human adult pancreatic ductal cells retain morphogenetic plasticity and demonstrate that a short exposure to INGAP triggers their differentiation into insulin-expressing cells in vitro. In the context of the urgent search for a regenerative and/or cellular therapy for diabetes, these results make INGAP a promising therapeutic candidate.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical in the maintenance, differentiation, and lineage commitment of stem cells. Stem cells have the unique property to differentiate into tissue-specific cell types (lineage commitment) during cell division (self-renewal). In this study, we investigated whether miR-34a, a cell cycle-regulating microRNA, could control the stem cell properties of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). First, we found that the expression level of miR-34a was increased as the cell passage number was increased. This finding, however, was inversely correlated with our finding that the overexpression of miR-34a induced the decrease of cell proliferation. In addition, miR-34a overexpression decreased the expression of various cell cycle regulators such as CDKs (\u22122, \u22124, \u22126) and cyclins (\u2013E, \u2013D), but not p21 and p53. The cell cycle analysis showed accumulation of dividing cells at S phase by miR-34a, which was reversible by co-treatment with anti-miR-34a. The potential of adipogenesis and osteogenesis of ADSCs was also decreased by miR-34a overexpression, which was recovered by co-treatment with anti-miR-34a. The surface expression of stem cell markers including CD44 was also down-regulated by miR-34a overexpression as similar to that elicited by cell cycle inhibitors. miR-34a also caused a significant decrease in mRNA expression of stem cell transcription factors as well as STAT-3 expression and phosphorylation. Cytokine profiling revealed that miR-34a significantly modulated IL-6 and -8 production, which was strongly related to cellular senescence. These data suggest the importance of miR-34a for the fate of ADSCs toward senescence rather than differentiation.",

     "abstract": "In the past decade, various strategies for cardiac reparative medicine involving stem cells from multiple sources have been investigated. However, the intra-cardiac implantation of cells with contractile ability may seriously disrupt the cardiac syncytium and de-synchronize cardiac rhythm. For this reason, bioactive cardiac implants, consisting of stem cells embedded in biomaterials that act like band aids, have been exploited to repair the cardiac wall after myocardial infarction. For such bioactive implants to function properly after transplantation, the choice of biomaterial is equally important as the selection of the stem cell source. While adult stem cells have shown promising results, they have various disadvantages including low proliferative potential in vitro, which make their successful usage in human transplants difficult.As a first step towards the development of a bioactive cardiac patch, we investigate here the cardiac differentiation properties of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) when cultured with and without ascorbic acid (AA) and when embedded in RAD16-I, a biomaterial commonly used to develop cardiac implants. In adherent cultures and in the absence of RAD16-I, AA promotes the cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs by enhancing the expression of specific cardiac genes and proteins and by increasing the number of contracting clusters. In turn, embedding in peptide hydrogel based on RAD16-I interferes with the normal cardiac differentiation progression. Embedded hiPSCs up-regulate genes associated with early cardiogenesis by up to 105 times independently of the presence of AA. However, neither connexin 43 nor troponin I proteins, which are related with mature cardiomyocytes, were detected and no contraction was noted in the constructs. Future experiments will need to focus on characterizing the mature cardiac phenotype of these cells when implanted into infarcted myocardia and assess their regenerative potential in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are an attractive cell source for tissue regeneration, given their self-renewal and multilineage potential. However, they are present in only small percentages in human bone marrow, and are generally propagated in vitro prior to downstream use. Previous work has shown that hMSC propagation can lead to alterations in cell behavior and differentiation potency, yet optimization of differentiation based on starting cell elastic modulus is an area still under investigation. To further advance the knowledge in this field, hMSCs were cultured and routinely passaged on tissue-culture polystyrene to investigate the correlation between cell stiffening and differentiation potency during in vitro aging. Local cell elastic modulus was measured at every passage using atomic force microscopy indentation. At each passage, cells were induced to differentiate down myogenic and osteogenic paths. Cells induced to differentiate, as well as undifferentiated cells were assessed for gene and protein expression using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining, respectively, for osteogenic and myogenic markers. Myogenic and osteogenic cell potential are highly reliant on the elastic modulus of the starting cell population (of undifferentiated cells), and this potential appears to peak when the innate cell elastic modulus is close to that of differentiated tissue. However, the latent expression of the same markers in undifferentiated cells also appears to undergo a correlative relationship with cell elastic modulus, indicating some endogenous effects of cell elastic modulus and gene/protein expression. Overall, this study correlates age-related changes with regards to innate cell stiffening and gene/protein expression in commercial hMSCs, providing some guidance as to maintenance and future use of hMSCs in future tissue engineering applications.",

     "abstract": "A recent report showed that thymosin beta-4 (T\u03b24) is expressed during the development of tooth germ, but its effect on osteoblastic/cementoblastic differentiation is a controversial topic. Furthermore, the precise expression and function of T\u03b24 in periodontal tissue remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the immunolocalization of T\u03b24 in the developing periodontium of mouse, the function of T\u03b24 in osteoblastic/cementoblastic differentiation, and the underlying mechanism regulating periodontal regeneration in human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), cementoblasts, and osteoblasts.T\u03b24 expression was observed in differentiating hPDLCs, osteoblasts of the periodontium during development, as well as in mature tissue. Higher T\u03b24 expression was observed in hPDLCs than in cementoblasts and osteoblasts in the developing periodontium. The expression of T\u03b24 mRNA and protein gradually increased during PDL cell differentiation. The downregulation of T\u03b24 expression by T\u03b24 siRNA transfection inhibited osteoblastic differentiation by decreasing calcium nodule formation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mRNA expression of differentiation markers in hPDLCs, cementoblasts, and osteoblasts. In contrast, T\u03b24 activation using a T\u03b24 peptide, promoted these processes by activation of Akt, p38, ERK MAPKs, and the NF-\u03baB pathway. The expression of nuclear NFATc1 was upregulated by T\u03b24 peptide in hPDLCs. Inhibition of the calcineurin/NFATc1 pathway by cyclosporin A and FK506, attenuated T\u03b24-induced osteoblastic differentiation and activation of Wnt-related genes, as well as nuclear \u03b2-catenin in hPDLCs. In conclusion, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that T\u03b24 is expressed in developing periodontal tissue and that its expression is associated with osteoblastic/cementoblastic differentiation. These results suggests that T\u03b24 is a potential therapeutic target for periodontal regeneration or bone disease.",

The potential of T-MSCs to trans-differentiate into pancreatic progenitor cells or insulin-secreting cells has not yet been investigated. We examined the potential of human T-MSCs to trans-differentiate into pancreatic islet cells using two different methods based on \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and insulin\u2013transferin\u2013selenium, respectively. First, we compared the efficacy of the two methods for inducing differentiation into insulin-producing cells. We demonstrated that the insulin\u2013transferin\u2013selenium method is more efficient for inducing differentiation into insulin-secreting cells regardless of the source of the MSCs. Second, we compared the differentiation potential of two different MSC types: T-MSCs and adipose-derived MSCs (A-MSCs). T-MSCs had a differentiation capacity similar to that of A-MSCs and were capable of secreting insulin in response to glucose concentration. Islet-like clusters differentiated from T-MSCs had lower synaptotagmin-3, -5, -7, and -8 levels, and consequently lower secreted insulin levels than cells differentiated from A-MSCs. These results imply that T-MSCs can differentiate into functional pancreatic islet-like cells and could provide a novel, alternative cell therapy for diabetes mellitus.",

The goals of the present study were to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of stem cells from fresh and cryopreserved dental follicles (fDFCs and cDFCs, respectively) and to analyze in vivo osteogenesis after transplantation of these DFCs into experimental animals. Third passage fDFCs and cDFCs showed similar expression levels of interferon-\u03b3 receptor (CD119) and major histocompatibility complex class I and II (MHC I and MHC II, respectively), with high levels of CD119 and MHC I and nearly no expression of MHC II. Both fresh and cryopreserved human DFCs (hDFCs) were in vivo transplanted along with a demineralized bone matrix scaffold into mandibular defects in miniature pigs and subcutaneous tissues of mice. Radiological and histological evaluations of in vivo osteogenesis in hDFC-transplanted sites revealed significantly enhanced new bone formation activities compared with those in scaffold-only implanted control sites. Interestingly, at 8 weeks post-hDFC transplantation, the newly generated bones were overgrown compared to the original size of the mandibular defects, and strong expression of osteocalcin and vascular endothelial growth factor were detected in the hDFCs-transplanted tissues of both animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD3, CD4, and CD8 in the ectopic bone formation sites of mice showed significantly decreased CD4 expression in DFCs-implanted tissues compared with those in control sites. These findings indicate that hDFCs possess immunomodulatory properties that involved inhibition of the adaptive immune response mediated by CD4 and MHC II, which highlights the usefulness of hDFCs in tissue engineering. In particular, long-term preserved dental follicles could serve as an excellent autologous or allogenic stem cell source for bone tissue regeneration as well as a valuable therapeutic agent for immune diseases.",

     "abstract": "Primary hepatocytes are a versatile tool to investigate all aspects of liver function, and frequently used in drug development and testing. Upon TGF-\u03b2 challenge, hepatocytes either undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) or apoptosis: culture on stiff collagen (monolayer) results in EMT whereas hepatocytes in a soft collagen matrix (sandwich) undergo programmed cell death. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional programs triggered by TGF-\u03b2 under different culture conditions.Our results indicate that TGF-\u03b2 initiates an identical transcription profile in hepatocytes irrespective of the cellular environment. The fact that we nevertheless observe two vastly different phenotypes indicates that the matrix environment rather than the TGF-\u03b2 induced expression signature is the major determinant of the hepatocellular response.To confirm the impact of the surrounding matrix environment on the hepatocytes\u05f3 phenotype in response to TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we studied the effect of Snail overexpression and knockout in both culture conditions. Neither genetic manipulation showed an impact on hepatocytes\u2019 fate upon TGF-\u03b2 treatment, confirming the crucial role of the surrounding matrix. Our findings provide novel insights into the hepatocellular basis of the fate decision between EMT and apoptotic cell death, and might explain why liver cells can react in very different manners to identical stimuli when tissue remodeling has changed the matrix environment, as occurs in a fibrotic liver.",

Cardiac abnormalities in early life can be lethal in mammals but not in the zebrafish embryo which has been widely used to study the developing heart. While early cardiac development in the zebrafish has been well characterized, functional changes during development and how these relate to architectural, cellular and molecular aspects of development have not been well described previously. To address this we have carefully characterised cardiac structure, function, cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac-specific gene expression between 48 and 120\u00a0hpf in the zebrafish. We show that the zebrafish heart increases in volume and changes shape significantly between 48 and 72\u00a0hpf accompanied by a 40% increase in cardiomyocyte number. Between 96 and 120\u00a0hpf, while external heart expansion slows, there is rapid formation of a mature and extensive trabecular network within the ventricle chamber. While ejection fraction does not change during the course of development other determinants of contractile function increase significantly particularly between 72 and 96\u00a0hpf leading to an increase in cardinal vein blood flow. This study has revealed a number of novel aspects of cardiac developmental dynamics with striking temporal orchestration of structure and function within the first few days of development. These changes are associated with changes in expression of developmental and maturational genes. This study provides important insights into the complex temporal relationship between structure and function of the developing zebrafish heart.",

Our data indicated that increased expression of AGS3 would inhibit osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs exposed to inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) via cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling.

In recent years, several lines of evidence suggested that certain nutrients, vitamins and flavonoids may have important roles in controlling the stem cell fate decision by maintaining their self-renewal or stimulating the lineage-specific differentiation. In this study, main olive leaf phytochemicals oleuropein (Olp), apigenin 7-glucoside (Api7G) and luteolin 7-glucoside (Lut7G) were investigated for their potential effects on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation using both phenotypic and molecular analysis. Oleuropein and the combination of the three compounds enhanced the differentiation of CD34+ cells into myelomonocytic cells and lymphocytes progenitors and inhibited the commitment to megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages. Treatment with Lut7G stimulated both the erythroid and the myeloid differentiation, while treatment with Api7G specifically induced the differentiation of CD34+ cells towards the erythroid lineage and inhibited the myeloid differentiation. Erythroid differentiation induced by Api7G and Lut7G treatments was confirmed by the increase in hemoglobin genes expressions (\u03b1-hemoglobin, \u03b2-hemoglobin and \u03b3-hemoglobin) and erythroid transcription factor GATA1 expression. As revealed by microarray analysis, the mechanisms underlying the erythroid differentiation-inducing effect of Api7G on hematopoietic stem cells involves the activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These findings prove the differentiation-inducing effects of olive leaf compounds on hematopoietic stem cells and highlight their potential use in the ex vivo generation of blood cells.",

Furthermore, treatment options are limited, and diagnostic methods often lack the sensitivity to detect disease in its early stages. Disrupted oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) that inhibits ATP production is a common phenotype of mitochondrial disorders that can be induced in zebrafish by exposure to 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a FDA-banned weight-loss agent and EPA-regulated environmental toxicant, traditionally used in research labs as an uncoupler of OXPHOS. Despite the DNP-induced OXPHOS inhibition we observed using in vivo respirometry, the development of the DNP-treated and control zebrafish were largely similar during the first half of embryogenesis. During this period, DNP-treated embryos induced gene expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes that stimulated the production of new mitochondria and increased glycolysis to yield normal levels of ATP. DNP-treated embryos were incapable of sustaining this mitochondrial biogenic response past mid-embryogenesis, as shown by significantly lowered ATP production and ATP levels, decreased gene expression, and the onset of developmental defects. Examining neural tissues commonly affected by mitochondrial disease, we found that DNP exposure also inhibited motor neuron axon arbor outgrowth and the proper formation of the retina. We observed and quantified the molecular and physiological progression of mitochondrial dysfunction during development with this new model of OXPHOS dysfunction, which has great potential for use in diagnostics and therapies for mitochondrial disease.",

Loss of function of the Prdm1a transcription factor disrupts the polarisation and migration of adaxial cells, reflecting a role that is independent of its repression of sox6 expression. Expression of the M- and N-cadherins, previously implicated in driving adaxial cell migration, is largely unaffected by loss of Prdm1a function, suggesting that differential cadherin expression is not sufficient for adaxial cell migration.",

The goal of the current study was to decipher the molecular pathways and mechanisms that control MSC differentiation into ECs. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-165) treatment is known to enhance in vitro differentiation of MSCs into ECs. We tested the possible involvement of the Sry-type HMG box (Sox) family of transcription factors in this process.MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of Yucatan microswine and underwent a 10 day differentiation protocol. VEGF-165 (50\u00a0ng/ml) treatment of MSCs in vitro induced a significant increase in the protein expression of VEGFR-2, Sox9 and Sox18, in addition to the EC markers PECAM-1, VE-cadherin and vWF, as determined by Western blot or flow cytometry. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sox18, as opposed to Sox9, in MSCs prevented VEGF-165-mediated induction of EC markers and capillary tube formation. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 signaling (SC-202850) reduced Sox18 and reduced VEGF-165-induced differentiation of MSCs to ECs.Here we demonstrate that VEGF-165 mediates MSC differentiation into ECs via VEGFR-2-dependent induction of Sox18, which ultimately coordinates the transcriptional upregulation of specific markers of the EC phenotype.",

Yet, the identification of chemical inducers that improve differentiation output to a particular lineage is highly valuable to the development of such cells for the cell-based treatment of osteo-degenerative diseases. This study aimed at investigating the instructive role of nitric oxide (NO) and its synthesizing enzymes on embryonic stem cell (ESC) osteogenic differentiation. Our findings showed that NO levels may support osteogenesis, but that the effect of nitric oxide on osteoblast differentiation may be specific to a particular time phase during the development of osteoblasts in vitro. Endogenously, nitric oxide was specifically secreted by osteogenic cultures during the calcification period. Simultaneously, messenger RNAs for both the endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase isoforms (eNOS and iNOS) were upregulated during this late phase development. However, the specific eNOS inhibitor L-N5-(1-Iminoethyl)ornithine dihydrochloride attenuated calcification more so than the specific iNOS inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium. Exogenous stage-specific supplementation of culture medium with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine increased the percentage of cells differentiating into osteoblasts and enhanced calcification. Our results point to a primary role for eNOS as a pro-osteogenic trigger in ESC differentiation and expand on the variety of supplements that may be used to direct ESC fate to the osteogenic lineage, which will be important in the development of cell-based therapies for osteo-degenerative diseases.",

To circumvent early lethality, and determine the role of the A-type lamins in specific tissues in older mice we derived a conditional allele of LmnaFL/FL (floxed).

We present an extensive set of studies that define a brief period when high temperature specifies, and then determines, ovarian fate in a northern population of snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina. We shifted embryos from male to female temperatures, or vice versa, at various stages of development. Gonads in embryos incubated at female temperatures commit to ovarian fate earlier (by stage 18) than gonads in embryos incubated at male temperatures commit to testicular fate (by stages 19\u201321). In double shift studies, embryos were incubated at a female temperature, exposed to a male temperature for set times, and shifted back to the original temperature, or vice versa. The time required to induce ovarian development (\u22646 days at female temperatures) was much shorter than the time required to induce testicular formation (>20 days at male temperatures). Differentiation of the gonads at the histological level occurred after the sex-determining period. Nevertheless, we found that a change in temperature rapidly (within 24\u00a0h) influenced expression and splicing of WT1 mRNA: the absolute abundance of WT1 mRNA, the relative abundance of +KTS versus \u2013KTS isoforms, as well as the ratio of +KTS:\u2013KTS isoforms was higher in gonads at a male versus a female temperature.

Such an understanding is important in the potential application of stem cells to cell therapy for disease, and thus there is an interest in understanding the cell cycle regulation, pluripotency, and differentiation of ESCs. The regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family consists of over 20 members. Rgs19, one such protein, specifically interacts with G\u03b1i to enhance its GTPase activity. Growth factor receptors use Gi proteins for signal transduction, and Rgs19 may thus be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.

Gene Ontology annotation and protein network analysis by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 9.0 (IPA) software suggested that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in 33 kinds of physiological activities including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, etc. Among these proteins, 407 proteins participated in cell differentiation with 212 proteins in the differentiation of skin cell, myocyte, neurocyte, chondrocyte and osteocyte, and 37 proteins participated in signaling pathways of BCC, CRH, CXCR4, GnRH, GPCR and IL1 which regulated cell differentiation and redifferentiation. On the other hand, the signal transduction activity and cell differentiation activity were analyzed by IPA based on the changes in the expression of these proteins. The results showed that BCC, CRH, CXCR4, GnRH, GPCR and IL1 signaling pathways played an important role in regulating the differentiation of skin cell, myocyte, neurocyte, chondrocyte and osteocyte during CNLR.",

     "abstract": "Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) is the most favorable candidate for the reconstruction of tissues destroyed by periodontal diseases. However, pathological alterations caused by inflammatory insults might impact the regenerative capacities of these cells. Bone-marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) would accelerate alveolar bone regeneration by transplantation, compared to PDLSCs. Therefore, a better understanding of the osteogenic differentiation between PDLSCs and BMSCs in inflammatory microenviroments is therefore warranted. In this study, human PDLSCs were investigated for their stem cell characteristics via analysis of cell surface marker expression, colony forming unit efficiency, osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation, and compared to BMSCs. To determine the impact of both inflammation and the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 signal pathway on osteogenic differentiation, cells were challenged with TNF-\u03b1 under osteogenic induction conditions and investigated for mineralization, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, cell proliferation and relative genes expression. Results showed that PDLSCs exhibit weaker mineralization and ALP activity compared to BMSCs. TNF-\u03b1 inhibited genes expression of osteogenic differentiation in PDLSCs, while, it stimulates gene expressions (BSP and Runx2) in BMSCs. Enhanced NF-\u03ba\u03b2 activity in PDLSCs decreases expression of Runx2 but it does not impede the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Taken together, these results may suggest that the BMSCs owned the stronger immunomodulation in local microenvironment via anti-inflammatory functions, compared to PDLSCs.",

Embryos deficient in akap12 exhibited reduced spontaneous coiling, touch response, and free swimming. Akap12-depleted slow but not fast muscle cells were misaligned, suggesting that the behavioral abnormalities resulted from specific defects in slow muscle patterning; indeed, slow muscle cells and muscle pioneers in these embryos showed abnormal migration in a cell-autonomous manner.

In this study muscle stem cells have been isolated from two muscles, the diaphragm (DIA) and the semimembranosus (SM), from young and old pigs. The levels of three micro-RNAs (miRNAs) were measured when cells were in a proliferative phase and after 24 and 72\u00a0h in differentiation medium. All three miRNAs are abundant in skeletal muscle with miR-1 and miR-206 known to regulate myogenic differentiation and miR-24 is involved in cell cycle regulation. The levels of expression of Pax7 and the myogenic regulatory factors MyoD and myogenin were also measured. There were marked differences in expression of all three miRNAs between the two age groups. Both miR-1 and miR-206 were reduced in the cells from the older animals. In contrast miR-24 expression was significantly higher in cells from older animals under differentiation conditions. There were also significant differences in the relative expression of all three miRNAs between cells from the SM and DIA in both young and old animals. The changes in miRNA expression described in this study that relate to age, may play a role in the impaired differentiation capacity of older muscle stem cells.",

Recently, many members of the TNF superfamily have been shown to be key regulators of neurite growth during development. The founder member of this family, TNF\u03b1 can both promote and inhibit neurite growth depending on the cellular context. Specifically, transmembrane TNF\u03b1 promotes neurite growth, while soluble TNF\u03b1 inhibits it. While the growth promoting effects of TNF\u03b1 are restricted to a defined developmental window of early postnatal development, whether the growth inhibitory effects of soluble TNF\u03b1 occur throughout development is unknown. In this study we used the extensively studied, well characterised neurons of the superior cervical ganglion to show that the growth inhibitory effects of soluble TNF\u03b1 are restricted to a specific period of late embryonic and early postnatal development. Furthermore, we show that this growth inhibitory effect of soluble TNF\u03b1 requires NF-\u03baB signalling at all developmental stages at which soluble TNF\u03b1 inhibits neurite growth. These findings raise the possibility that increases in the amount of soluble TNF\u03b1 in vivo, for example as a result of maternal inflammation, could negatively affect neurite growth in developing neurons at specific stages of development.",

The cold-EDTA protocol removes intact cells from ECM, with minimal ECM damage and contamination.

     "abstract": "The periodontal ligament is a multifunctional soft connective tissue, which functions not only as a cushion supporting the teeth against occlusal force, but is also a source of osteogenic cells that can regenerate neighboring hard tissues. Periodontal ligament cells (PDL cells) contain heterogeneous cell populations, including osteogenic cell progenitors. However, the precise mechanism underlying the differentiation process remains elusive. Cell differentiation is regulated by the local biochemical and mechanical microenvironment that can modulate gene expression and cell morphology by altering actin cytoskeletal organization mediated by Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK). To determine its role in PDL cell differentiation, we examined the effects of ROCK on cytoskeletal changes and kinetics of gene expression during osteogenic differentiation. PDL cells were isolated from human periodontal ligament on extracted teeth and cultured in osteogenic medium for 14 days. Y-27632 was used for ROCK inhibition assay. Osteogenic phenotype was determined by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition by Alizarin Red staining. ROCK-induced cytoskeletal changes were examined by immunofluorescence analysis of F-actin and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) expression. Real-time PCR was performed to examine the kinetics of osteogenic gene expression. F-actin and phospho-MLC2 were markedly induced during osteogenic differentiation, which coincided with upregulation of ALP activity and mineralization. Subsequent inhibition assay indicated that Y-27632 significantly inhibited F-actin and phospho-MLC2 expression in a dose-dependent manner with concomitant partial reversal of the PDL cell osteogenic phenotype. PCR array analysis of osteogenic gene expression indicated that extracellular matrix genes, such as fibronectin 1, collagen type I and III, and biglycan, were significantly downregulated by Y27632. These findings indicated crucial effects of ROCK in cytoskeletal reorganization and differentiation of PDL cells toward osteogenic cells. ROCK contributes to induction of osteogenic differentiation by synergistic increases in extracellular matrix gene expression in PDL cells.",

     "abstract": "The anterior neural fold (ANF) is the only region of the neural tube that does not produce neural crest cells. Instead, ANF cells contribute to the olfactory and lens placodes, as well as to the forebrain and epidermis. Here, we test the ability of the ANF to form neural crest by performing heterotopic transplantation experiments in the chick embryo. We find that, at the neurula stage (HH stage 7), the chick ANF retains the ability to form migrating neural crest cells when transplanted caudally to rostral hindbrain levels. This ability is gradually lost, such that by HH9, this tissue appears to no longer have the potential to form neural crest. In contrast to the ANF, hindbrain dorsal neural folds transplanted rostrally fail to contribute to the olfactory placode but instead continue to generate neural crest cells. The transcription factor GANF is expressed in the ANF and its morpholino-mediated knock-down expands the neural crest domain rostrally and results in the production of migratory cells emerging from the ANF; however, these cells fail to express the HNK1 neural crest marker, suggesting only partial conversion. Our results show that environmental factors can imbue the chick anterior neural folds to assume a neural crest cell fate via a mechanism that partially involves loss of GANF.",

Accordingly, we examined the trans-generational influence of DES on development of external genitalia (ExG) and compared effects of in utero DES exposure in CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice injected with oil or DES every other day from gestational days 12 to 18. Mice were examined at birth, and on 5\u2013120 days postnatal to evaluate ExG malformations. Of 23 adult ( > 60 days) prenatally DES-exposed males, features indicative of urethral meatal hypospadias (see text for definitions) ranged from 18% to 100% in prenatally DES-exposed CD-1 males and 31% to 100% in prenatally DES-exposed C57BL/6 males. Thus, the strains differed only slightly in the incidence of male urethral hypospadias. Ninety-one percent of DES-exposed CD-1 females and 100% of DES-exposed C57BL/6 females had urethral\u2013vaginal fistula. All DES-exposed CD-1 and C57BL/6 females lacked an os clitoris. None of the prenatally oil-treated CD-1 and C57BL/6 male and female mice had ExG malformations. For the second-generation study, 10 adult CD-1 males and females, from oil- and DES-exposed groups, respectively, were paired with untreated CD-1 mice for 30 days, and their offspring evaluated for ExG malformations. None of the F1 DES-treated females were fertile. Nine of 10 prenatally DES-exposed CD-1 males sired offspring with untreated females, producing 55 male and 42 female pups. Of the F2 DES-lineage adult males, 20% had exposed urethral flaps, a criterion of urethral meatal hypospadias. Five of 42 (11.9%) F2 DES lineage females had urethral\u2013vaginal fistula. In contrast, all F2 oil-lineage males and all oil-lineage females were normal. Thus, prenatal DES exposure induces malformations of ExG in both sexes and strains of mice, and certain malformations are transmitted to the second-generation.",

Syntabulin is an adapter protein that binds to kinesin KIF5B and to the transmembrane protein Syntaxin1. In zebrafish, a mutation in Syntabulin causes complete embryo ventralization. It is unknown whether Syntabulin plays an analogous role during early development of other species, a question addressed here in Xenopus laevis. in situ hybridization of syntabulin mRNA was carried out at different stages of Xenopus development. In oocytes, syntabulin transcripts were localized to the vegetal cortex of large oocytes and the mitochondrial cloud of very young oocytes. We extended the zebrafish data by finding that during cleavage Xenopus syntabulin mRNA localized to the germ plasm and was later expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs). This new finding suggested a role for Syntabulin during germ cell differentiation. The functional role of maternal syntabulin mRNA was investigated by knock-down with phosphorothioate DNA antisense oligos followed by oocyte transfer. The results showed that syntabulin mRNA depletion caused the complete loss of dorso-anterior axis formation in frog embryos. Consistent with the ventralized phenotype, syntabulin-depleted embryos displayed severe reduction of dorsal markers and ubiquitous transcription of the ventral marker sizzled. Syntabulin was required for the maternal Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signal, since ventralization could be completely rescued by injection of \u03b2-catenin (or syntabulin) mRNA. The data suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for Syntabulin, a protein that bridges microtubule motors and membrane vesicles, during dorso-ventral axis formation in the vertebrates.",

Granulocytes, on the other hand, are easily obtainable, their developmental pathway has been extensively studied and fluorescence activated cell sorting allows for the isolation of these cells at high purity; thus iPSCs derivation from granulocytes could provide an alternative to fibroblast-derived iPSCs. Previous studies succeeded in producing iPSC colonies from mouse granulocytes but with the use of a mitotically inactivated feeder layer, restricting their use for studying reprogramming mechanistics. As granulocytes display poor survival under culture conditions, we investigated the influence of haematopoietic cytokines to stabilise this cell type in vitro and allow for reprogramming in the absence of a feeder layer. Our results show that treatment with MEF-conditioned media and/or initial exposure to GM-CSF allows for reprogramming of granulocytes under feeder-free conditions. This work can serve as a basis for future work aimed at dissecting the reprogramming mechanism as well as obtaining large numbers of iPSCs from a clinically relevant cell source.",

     "abstract": "Numerous studies have sought to identify diabetes mellitus treatment strategies with fewer side effects. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy was previously considered as a promising therapy; however, it requires the cells to be trans-differentiated into cells of the pancreatic-endocrine lineage before transplantation. Previous studies have shown that PDX-1 expression can facilitate MSC differentiation into insulin-producing cells (IPCs), but the methods employed to date use viral or DNA-based tools to express PDX-1, with the associated risks of insertional mutation and immunogenicity. Thus, this study aimed to establish a new method to induce PDX-1 expression in MSCs by mRNA transfection. MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and expanded in vitro, with stemness confirmed by surface markers and multipotentiality. MSCs were transfected with PDX-1 mRNA by nucleofection and chemically induced to differentiate into IPCs (combinatorial group). This IPC differentiation was then compared with that of untransfected chemically induced cells (inducer group) and uninduced cells (control group). We found that PDX-1 mRNA transfection significantly improved the differentiation of MSCs into IPCs, with 8.3\u00b12.5% IPCs in the combinatorial group, 3.21\u00b12.11% in the inducer group and 0% in the control. Cells in the combinatorial group also strongly expressed several genes related to beta cells (Pdx-1, Ngn3, Nkx6.1 and insulin) and could produce C-peptide in the cytoplasm and insulin in the supernatant, which was dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration. These results indicate that PDX-1 mRNA may offer a promising approach to produce safe IPCs for clinical diabetes mellitus treatment.",

Wnt inhibition is achieved through the IGF pathway, which is up-regulated during differentiation.

In the normal course of events, both autophagy flux and the mRNA expression of autophagy related genes (Atg5, Atg12, Atg16, beclin 1) is most intensive at the beginning of differentiation (days 0\u20134) and then declines.The initiation of differentiation is associated with a 50% reduction of the mitochondrial copy number on day 2 followed by rapid mitochondrial biogenesis. Preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes differ in the mRNA expression of genes involved in electron transport (Nufsd1, Sdhb, Uqcrc1); ATP synthesis (ATP5b); fatty acid metabolism (CPT1b, Acadl); mitochondrial transporters (Hspa9, Slc25A1) and the TCA cycle (Pcx, Mdh2) as well as citrate synthase activity. Autophagy inhibition during the first two days of differentiation blocked both phenotype changes (lipid accumulation) and the gene expression pattern, while having no or only a marginal effect over any other time period. Similarly, autophagy inhibition between days 0\u20132 inhibited mitotic clonal expansion as well as mitochondrial network remodeling.In conclusion, we found that autophagy is essential and most active during an initial stage of adipocyte differentiation but it is dispensable during its later stages. We propose that the degradation of preadipocyte cytoplasmic structures, predominantly mitochondria, is an important function of autophagy during this phase and its absence prevents remodeling of the mitochondrial gene expression pattern and mitochondrial network organization.",

     "abstract": "Research in the embryo and in culture has resulted in a sophisticated understanding of many regulators of pluripotent cell differentiation. As a consequence, protocols for the differentiation of pluripotent cells generally rely on a combination of exogenous growth factors and endogenous signalling. Little consideration has been given to manipulating other pathways to achieve pluripotent cell differentiation. The integrity of cell:cell contacts has been shown to influence lineage choice during pluripotent cell differentiation, with disruption of cell:cell contacts promoting mesendoderm formation and maintenance of cell:cell contacts resulting in the preferential formation of neurectoderm. Staurosporine is a broad spectrum inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases which has several effects on cell function, including interruption of cell:cell contacts, decreasing focal contact size, inducing epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT) and promoting cell differentiation. The possibility that staurosporine could influence lineage choice from pluripotent cells in culture was investigated. The addition of staurosporine to differentiating mouse EPL resulted in preferential formation of mesendoderm and mesoderm populations, and inhibited the formation of neurectoderm. Addition of staurosporine to human ES cells similarly induced primitive streak marker gene expression. These data demonstrate the ability of staurosporine to influence lineage choice during pluripotent cell differentiation and to mimic the effect of disrupting cell:cell contacts. Staurosporine induced mesendoderm in the absence of known inducers of formation, such as serum and BMP4. Staurosporine induced the expression of mesendoderm markers, including markers that were not induced by BMP4, suggesting it acted as a broad spectrum inducer of molecular gastrulation. This approach has identified a small molecule regulator of lineage choice with potential applications in the commercial development of ES cell derivatives, specifically as a method for forming mesendoderm progenitors or as a culture adjunct to prevent the formation of ectoderm progenitors during pluripotent cell differentiation.",

Isolated MSCs are capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, but the molecular function of p75NTR in MSCs and osteoblasts is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine the function of p75NTR in the human MG63 osteoblast cell line compared to the murine MC3T3E-1 pre-osteoblast cell line.MG63 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells expressing exogenous p75NTR protein (denoted as p75-MG63 and p75GFP-E1, respectively) were generated to compare osteogenic differentiation and cell proliferation abilities. Overexpression of p75NTR induced alkaline phosphatase activity and the mRNA expression of osteoblast-related genes such as osterix and bone sialoprotein in both p75-MG63 and p75GFP-E1. Interestingly, exogenous p75NTR stimulated cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in p75GFP-E1, but not in p75-MG63.To elucidate any different effects of p75NTR expression on osteogenic differentiation and cell proliferation, we examined the mRNA expression of tropomyosin receptor kinase (trk) genes (trkA, trkB, trkC) and Nogo receptor (NgR), which are binding partners of p75NTR. Although trkA, trkB, and trkC were detected in both p75-MG63 and p75GFP-E1, only NgR was detected in p75-MG63. We then used the K252a inhibitor of the trks to identify the signaling pathway for osteogenic differentiation and cell proliferation. Inhibition of trks by K252a suppressed p75NTR-mediated osteogenic differentiation of p75GFP-E1, whereas deletion of the GDI domain in P75NTR from the p75-MG63 produced enhanced cell proliferation compared to p75-MG63. These results suggest that p75NTR signaling associated with trk receptors promotes both cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, but that p75NTR-mediated proliferation may be suppressed by signaling from the p75NTR/NgR complex.",

Previous reports show that early postnatal cochlea harbors stem/progenitor-like cells nominated otospheres which have a limited regenerative/repair capacity, while these cell populations are progressively lost during the postnatal development. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) directly reprogrammed from non-embryonic cells have captured great attentions in the scientific community. In the present study, we determine whether Yamanaka\u05f3s factors can induce the reprogramming of cochlear cells into iPS cells. We introduce defined factors Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4 into otospheres derived from postnatal day-1 (P1) mouse SE, and analyze characteristics alterations in cochlear cells. After transduction, otospheres generated colonies exhibiting a normal karyotype and morphology similar to that of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Moreover, these cochlear iPS cells also express ESC-like markers. Importantly, the cochlear iPS cells show pluripotency in vitro and in vivo, as evidenced by differentiation into three germ layers by embryoid body formation, as well as high efficient formation of teratomas containing three germ layers in immunodeficient mice. Thus, pluripotent cochlear iPS cells can be generated from cochlear cells by using three Yamanaka\u05f3s transcription factors.

Developmental defects of the central nervous system (CNS) characterize a subset of ciliopathies showing clinical and genetic overlap, such as Joubert syndrome (JS) and Meckel syndrome (MS). Although several knock-out mice lacking a variety of ciliary proteins have shown the importance of primary cilia in the development of the brain and CNS-derived structures, developmental in vitro studies, extremely useful to unravel the role of primary cilia along the course of neural differentiation, are still missing.Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) have been recently proven to mimic brain development, giving the unique opportunity to dissect the CNS differentiation process along its sequential steps. In the present study we show that mESCs express the ciliary proteins Meckelin and Jouberin in a developmentally-regulated manner, and that these proteins co-localize with acetylated tubulin labeled cilia located at the outer embryonic layer. Further, mESCs differentiating along the neuronal lineage activate the cilia-dependent sonic hedgehog signaling machinery, which is impaired in Meckelin knock-out cells but results unaffected in Jouberin-deficient mESCs. However, both lose the ability to acquire a neuronal phenotype. Altogether, these results demonstrate a pivotal role of Meckelin and Jouberin during embryonic neural specification and indicate mESCs as a suitable tool to investigate the developmental impact of ciliary proteins dysfunction.",

Deletion of Pkd2 in the epithelia alone was sufficient to cause reproductive tract defects seen in Pkd2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that epithelial Pkd2 plays a pivotal role for development and maintenance of the male reproductive tract. In the testis, Pkd2 also plays a role in interstitial tissue and testicular cord development. In-depth analysis of epithelial-specific knockout mice revealed that Pkd2 is critical to maintain cellular phenotype and developmental signaling in the male reproductive system.

We compared the ability of the epithelial cells from both sources to generate a stratified, differentiated skin-like epithelium upon exposure to air when cultured on the two stromal cell types. Conversely, the ability of the WJC to behave as dermal fibroblasts, producing extracellular matrix and supporting the formation of a differentiated epithelium for both types of epithelial cells, was also investigated. Of the four types of constructs produced, the combination of WJC and keratinocytes was the most similar to skin engineered from dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. When cultured on dermal fibroblasts, the cord epithelial cells were able to differentiate in vitro into a stratified multilayered epithelium expressing molecules characteristic of keratinocyte differentiation after exposure to air, and maintaining the expression of keratins K18 and K19, typical of the umbilical cord epithelium.

The female spotted hyena is the only extant mammal that mates and gives birth through a pendulous penis-like clitoris. Our studies indicate that early formation of the phallus in both males and females is independent of androgens; indeed the phallus forms before the fetal testes or ovaries are capable of synthesizing androgens. Likewise, pre- and postnatal growth in length of the penis and clitoris is minimally affected by \u201candrogen status\u201d. Nonetheless, several internal morphologies, as well as external surface features of the phallus, are androgen-dependent and thus account for dimorphism between the penis and clitoris. Finally, estrogens play a critical role in penile and clitoral development, specifying the position of the urethral orifice, determining elasticity of the urethral meatus, and facilitating epithelial\u2013epithelial fusion events required for proper formation of the distal urethra/urogenital sinus and prepuce. Accordingly, prenatal inhibition of estrogen synthesis via administration of letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) leads to malformations of the glans as well as the prepuce (hypospadias). The effects of prenatal androgens, anti-androgens and impaired estrogen synthesis correlated with the tissue expression of androgen and estrogen receptors.",

The young is dependent on milk with a composition that varies through lactation to support its growth and changing needs as it matures over a lengthy period. Gonadal differentiation occurs after birth, providing a unique opportunity to examine the effects of hormonal manipulations on its sexual differentiation of the highly accessible young. In marsupials a difference in the migration of the urinary ducts around the genital ducts from eutherian mammals results in the unique tammar reproductive tract which has three vaginae and two cervices, and two distinctly separate uteri. In the tammar wallaby, a small member of the kangaroo family, we showed that virilisation of the Wolffian duct, prostate and phallus depends on an alternate androgen pathway, which has now been shown to be important for virilisation in humans. Through hormonal manipulations over differing time periods we have achieved sex reversal of both ovaries and testes, germ cells, genital ducts, prostate and phallus. Whilst we understand many of the mechanisms behind sexual differentiation there are still many lessons to be learned from understanding how sex reversal is achieved by using a model such as the tammar wallaby. This will help guide investigations into the major questions of how and why sex determination is achieved in other species. This review discusses the control and development of the marsupial urogenital system, largely drawn from our studies in the tammar wallaby and our ability to manipulate this system to induce sex reversal.",

     "abstract": "Mammalian tooth development is characterized by formation of primary teeth that belong to different tooth classes and are later replaced by a single set of permanent teeth. The first primary teeth are initiated from the primary dental lamina, and the replacement teeth from the successional dental lamina at the lingual side of the primary teeth. An interdental lamina connects the primary tooth germs together. Most mammalian tooth development research is done on mouse, which does not have teeth in all tooth classes, does not replace its teeth, and does not develop an interdental lamina. We have used the ferret (Mustela putorius furo) as a model animal to elucidate the morphological changes and gene expression during the development of the interdental lamina and the initiation of primary teeth. In addition we have analyzed cell\u2013cell signaling taking place in the interdental lamina as well as in the successional lamina during tooth replacement. By 3D reconstructions of serial histological sections we observed that the morphogenesis of the interdental lamina and the primary teeth are intimately linked. Expression of Pitx2 and Foxi3 in the interdental lamina indicates that it has odontogenic identity, and there is active signaling taking place in the interdental lamina. Bmp4 is coexpressed with the stem cell factor Sox2 at its lingual aspect suggesting that the interdental lamina may retain competence for tooth initiation. We show that when tooth replacement is initiated there is Wnt pathway activity in the budding successional lamina and adjacent mesenchyme but no active Fgf or Eda signaling. Genes associated with human tooth replacement phenotypes, including Runx2 and Il11r\u03b1, are mostly expressed in the mesenchyme around the successional lamina in the ferret. Our results highlight the importance of the dental lamina in the mammalian tooth development during the initiation of both primary and replacement teeth.",

Lampreys and hagfishes are agnathan fishes, the cyclostomes, which sit at a crucial phylogenetic position as the only living sister group of the jawed vertebrates. Comparisons between cyclostomes and jawed vertebrates can help identify shared derived (i.e. synapomorphic) traits that might have been inherited from ancestral early vertebrates, if unlikely to have arisen convergently by chance. One example of a uniquely vertebrate trait is the neural crest, an embryonic tissue that produces many cell types crucial to vertebrate features, such as the craniofacial skeleton, pigmentation of the skin, and much of the peripheral nervous system (Gans and Northcutt, 1983). Invertebrate chordates arguably lack unambiguous neural crest homologs, yet have cells with some similarities, making comparisons with lampreys and jawed vertebrates essential for inferring characteristics of development in early vertebrates, and how they may have evolved from nonvertebrate chordates. Here we review recent research on cyclostome neural crest development, including research on lamprey gene regulatory networks and differentiated neural crest fates.",

Spherical pig blastocysts on Day 10 of pregnancy undergo rapid morphological changes to tubular and then filamentous forms by Day 12 and a filamentous conceptus of almost 1\u00a0m in length by Day 16 of pregnancy. Thus, trophectoderm of each conceptus achieves intimate contact with luminal uterine epithelium (LE) for exchange of nutrients, gases, hormones, growth factors and other key molecules for survival and development. Estrogens secreted between Days 11 and 13 of pregnancy signals pregnancy recognition to ensure that nutrients and prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF) are secreted into the uterine lumen (exocrine secretion) rather than into the uterine vein (endocrine secretion) which would lead to regression of the corpora lutea (CL) and failure to maintain pregnancy. Pigs have a true epitheliochorial placenta. The fluid filled amnion bouys the embryo so that it develops symmetrically. The allantois fills with allantoic fluid to expand contact of the chorioallantois with uterine LE, and the allanotois supports the vascular system of the placenta. The chorion/trophectoderm in direct contact with uterine LE exchanges gases and nutrients and forms unique structures call areolae that absorb nutrient-rich secretions from uterine glands and transports them directly into fetal blood. The period from Days 20 to 70 of pregnancy is for placental growth in preparation for rapid fetal growth between Days 70 and 114 (term) of gestation. Maturation of the fetal hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis leads to increases in secretion of cortisol from the fetal adrenal glands. Cortisol sets in motion secretion of estrogens, oxytocin, relaxin and prolactin, as well as increases in their receptors, which are required for delivery of piglets and for initiation of lactation and expression of maternal behavior. This review provides details of gestation in the pig with respect to uterine biology, implantation, placentation, fetal development and parturition.",

     "abstract": "Salamanders and frogs are distinct orders of Amphibians with very different immune systems during adult life, exhibiting varying potential for scar free repair and regeneration. While salamanders can regenerate a range of body parts throughout all stages of life, regeneration is restricted to early stages of frog development. Comparison of these two closely related amphibian orders provides insights into the immunological influences on wound repair, and the different strategies that have evolved either to limit infection or to facilitate efficient regeneration. After injury, cells of the immune system are responsible for the removal of damaged cells and providing a cohort of important growth factors and signaling molecules. Immune cells not only regulate new vessel growth important for supplying essential nutrients to damaged tissue but, modulate the extracellular matrix environment by regulating fibroblasts and the scarring response. The profile of immune cell infiltration and their interaction with local tissue immune cells directly influences many aspects of the wound healing outcomes and can facilitate or prevent regeneration. Evidence is emerging that the transition from wound healing to regeneration is reliant on immune cell engagement and that the success of regeneration in amphibians may depend on complex interactions between stem cell progenitors and immune cell subsets. The potential immunological barriers to mammalian regeneration are discussed with implications for the successful delivery of stem cell therapeutic strategies in patients.",

These adult stem cells, located in the central body column, exhibit different cycling paces, slow for the epithelial, fast for the interstitial. To monitor the changes in cell cycling in Hydra, we established a fast and efficient flow cytometry procedure, which we validated by confirming previous findings, as the Nocodazole-induced reversible arrest of cell cycling in G2/M, and the mitogenic signal provided by feeding. Then to dissect the cycling and differentiation behaviors of the interstitial stem cells, we used the AEP_cnnos1 and AEP_Icy1 transgenic lines that constitutively express GFP in this lineage. For the epithelial lineages we used the sf-1 strain that rapidly eliminates the fast cycling cells upon heat-shock and progressively becomes epithelial. This study evidences similar cycling patterns for the interstitial and epithelial stem cells, which all alternate between the G2 and S-phases traversing a minimal G1-phase. We also found interstitial progenitors with a shorter G2 that pause in G1/G0. At the animal extremities, most cells no longer cycle, the epithelial cells terminally differentiate in G2 and the interstitial progenitors in G1/G0. At the apical pole ~80% cells are post-mitotic differentiated cells, reflecting the higher density of neurons and nematocytes in this region. We discuss how the robust G2 pausing of stem cells, maintained over weeks of starvation, may contribute to regeneration.",

Unlike embryonic stem cells, which have been extensively studied, little is known about the factors that regulate hEGC derivation and maintenance. This study demonstrates for the first time a central role for selective activation of PDGFR signaling in the derivation and maintenance of pluripotency in hEGCs. In the study, hEGCs were found to express PDGF receptor \u03b1 at high levels compared to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). PDGF significantly improved formation of alkaline phosphatase (AP) positive hEGC colonies. We subsequently determined that PDGF activates the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway as phosphorylation of AKT was up-regulated in response to PDGF. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K signaling using small molecular inhibitor LY294002 led to significantly decreased AP positive hEGC colony formation whereas inhibition of MAPK pathway using U0126 had a negligible effect. We established a primary mechanism for PDGF mediated derivation and maintenance of hEGCs by demonstrating that OCT4 was upregulated and PTEN was suppressed in a dose dependent manner in response to PDGF.",

We compared embryoid bodies (EB) and neurosphere morphology, yield of neural precursors and quality of neurons between rotary and static suspension cultures of mouse ES and iPS cells undergoing neural differentiation. Analysis of neurospheres formed under continuous rotation showed increased neurosphere uniformity and a high yield of neural precursors after neurosphere dissociation. Neurospheres formed under rotation conditions were relatively smaller, more uniform and had less dead cells and higher proliferation compared to those formed under static conditions. Neural precursors under rotation conditions matured faster, survived better, differentiated to functional neurons that stained positively for mature neuronal markers, and fired action potentials similar to the statically cultured neurons. This report thus provides a technique for the scalable production of neurons from ES and iPS cells and we suggest that rotation culture procedure can be a routine technique for stem cell neural and neuronal differentiation.",

While the developmental functions of the human HNT homolog, RREB-1, are unknown, it has been shown to function as a transcriptional modulator of several tumor suppressor genes. Here we investigate HNT's functional motifs, target genes and its regulatory abilities. We show that the C-terminal region of HNT, containing the last five of its 14 Zinc fingers, binds in vitro to DNA elements very similar to those identified for RREB-1. We map HNT's in vivo binding sites on salivary gland polytene chromosomes and define, at high resolution, where HNT is bound to two target genes, hnt itself and nervy (nvy). Data from both loss-of-function and over-expression experiments show that HNT attenuates the transcription of these two targets in a tissue-specific manner. RREB-1, when expressed in Drosophila, binds to the same polytene chromosome sites as HNT, attenuates expression of the hnt and nvy genes, and rescues the germ band retraction phenotype. HNT's ninth Zinc finger has degenerated or been lost in the vertebrate lineage. We show that a HNT protein mutant for this finger can also attenuate target gene expression and rescue germ band retraction. Thus HNT and RREB-1 are functional homologs at the level of DNA binding, transcriptional regulation and developmental control.",

Rheological measurements demonstrated that the incorporation of HA increased the compression modulus of the scaffolds. An initial in vitro evaluation showed that scaffolds seeded with porcine chondrocytes formed cartilaginous-like tissue after 8 weeks, and HA functioned to promote the growth of chondrocytes into scaffolds. Placenta-derived multipotent cells (PDMC) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were seeded on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), CII\u2013HA films, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) sheets for comparing their chondrogenesis differentiation potentials with those of adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADAS) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). Among different cells, PDMC showed the greatest chondrogenic differentiation potential on both CII\u2013HA films and SIS sheets upon TGF-\u03b23 induction, followed by GF. This was evidenced by the up-regulation of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, aggrecan, and collagen type II), which was not observed for cells grown on TCPS. This finding suggested the essential role of substrate materials in the chondrogenic differentiation of PDMC and GF. Neocartilage formation was more obvious in both PDMC and GF cells plated on CII\u2013HA composite scaffolds vs. 8-layer SIS at 28 days in vitro. Finally, implantation of PDMC/CII\u2013HA constructs into NOD\u2013SCID mice confirmed the formation of tissue-engineered cartilage in vivo.",

We observed that Kbtbd5 was absent in proliferating myoblasts and upregulated upon myogenic differentiation. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Kbtbd5 was restricted to the skeletal muscle lineage during embryogenesis. We identified a conserved 1.2\u00a0kb upstream region, which directs reporter expression to the developing skeletal muscle lineage. Transcriptional and mutagenesis assays demonstrated that the E-box motifs contribute to the Kbtbd5 promoter activity. We have also demonstrated the in vivo and in vitro binding between MRFs and the E-box motif in the 1.2\u00a0kb promoter of the Kbtbd5 gene. Our studies have revealed that the Myod family can transactivate the 1.2\u00a0kb-luc reporter through the E-box motifs. In addition, we have shown that Kbtbd5 can recruit the Cullin 3 complex in vivo. Using shRNA knockdown, our study has revealed that Kbtbd5 plays an important role in the myogenic differentiation. In summary, we have demonstrated that Kbtbd5 is the direct downstream target gene of the Myod family and regulates myogenic differentiation.

Using inducible expression of a dominant-negative Fgf receptor, we show that Fgf signaling is required around 30\u00a0hpf for correct cartilage formation. The receptor genes fgfr1a and fgr2 are expressed in pharyngeal endodermal pouches after 24\u00a0hpf or 26\u00a0hpf, respectively.

Although endodermal pouches are correctly formed and patterned, receptor knock down leads to decreased expression of runx3, egr1 and sox9b in this tissue, while expression of fsta, coding for a secreted BMP/Tgf\u00df inhibitor, is clearly increased. Rescue experiments revealed that each Fgfr1a or Fgfr2 receptor is able to compensate for the loss of the other.Thus, we show that minimal amounts of Fgfr1a or Fgfr2 are required to initiate a regulatory cascade in pharyngeal endoderm reducing expression of fsta, thereby allowing correct BMP signaling to the maturing chondrocytes of the head cartilage.",

     "abstract": "Historically, great efforts have been made to elucidate the biochemical pathways that direct the complex process of wound healing; however only recently has there been recognition of the importance that mechanical signals play in the process of tissue repair and scar formation. The body's physiologic response to injury involves a dynamic interplay between mechanical forces and biochemical cues which directs a cascade of signals leading ultimately to the formation of fibrotic scar. Fibroblasts are a highly mechanosensitive cell type and are also largely responsible for the generation of the fibrotic matrix during scar formation and are thus a critical player in the process of mechanotransduction during tissue repair. Mechanotransduction is initiated at the interface between the cell membrane and the extracellular matrix where mechanical signals are first translated into a biochemical response. Focal adhesions are dynamic multi-protein complexes through which the extracellular matrix links to the intracellular cytoskeleton. These focal adhesion complexes play an integral role in the propagation of this initial mechanical cue into an extensive network of biochemical signals leading to widespread downstream effects including the influx of inflammatory cells, stimulation of angiogenesis, keratinocyte migration, fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Increasing evidence has demonstrated the importance of the biomechanical milieu in healing wounds and suggests that an integrated approach to the discovery of targets to decrease scar formation may prove more clinically efficacious than previous purely biochemical strategies.",

Many endothelial mechanical sensors and second messenger systems may also determine hematopoietic stem cell fate, self renewal, and homing behaviors.

Several recent studies suggest that, in addition to resulting from pathology, mechanical changes may play a role akin to soluble factors in causing the progression of disease, and similar mechanical control might be essential for normal tissue development and homeostasis. Many cell types alter their structure and function in response to exogenous forces or as a function of the mechanical properties of the materials to which they adhere. This review summarizes recent progress in identifying intracellular signaling pathways, and especially transcriptional programs, that are differentially activated when cells adhere to materials with different mechanical properties or when they are subject to tension arising from external forces. Several cytoplasmic or cytoskeletal signaling pathways involving small GTPases, focal adhesion kinase and transforming growth factor beta as well as the transcriptional regulators MRTF-A, NF\u03baB, and Yap/Taz have emerged as important mediators of mechanical signaling.",

     "abstract": "Our traditional physical picture holds with the intuitive notion that each individual cell comprising the cellular collective senses signals or gradients and then mobilizes physical forces in response. Those forces, in turn, drive local cellular motions from which collective cellular migrations emerge. Although it does not account for spontaneous noisy fluctuations that can be quite large, the tacit assumption has been one of linear causality in which systematic local motions, on average, are the shadow of local forces, and these local forces are the shadow of the local signals. New lines of evidence now suggest a rather different physical picture in which dominant mechanical events may not be local, the cascade of mechanical causality may be not so linear, and, surprisingly, the fluctuations may not be noise as much as they are an essential feature of mechanism. Here we argue for a novel synthesis in which fluctuations and non-local cooperative events that typify the cellular collective might be illuminated by the unifying concept of cell jamming. Jamming has the potential to pull together diverse factors that are already known to contribute but previously had been considered for the most part as acting separately and independently. These include cellular crowding, intercellular force transmission, cadherin-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion, integrin-dependent cell\u2013substrate adhesion, myosin-dependent motile force and contractility, actin-dependent deformability, proliferation, compression and stretch.",

In rigid microenvironments, MMP3 upregulates expression of Rac1b, which translocates to the cell membrane to promote induction of reactive oxygen species and EMT. Here we examine the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in this process. Our data show that the basement membrane protein laminin suppresses the EMT response in MMP3-treated cells, whereas fibronectin promotes EMT. These ECM proteins regulate EMT via interactions with their specific integrin receptors. \u03b16-integrin sequesters Rac1b from the membrane and is required for inhibition of EMT by laminin. In contrast, \u03b15-integrin maintains Rac1b at the membrane and is required for the promotion of EMT by fibronectin.

An important question is how E-cadherin contributes to Rho signaling, notably whether junctional Rho may depend on cadherin adhesion. We sought to investigate this by assessing Rho localization and activity in epithelial monolayers depleted of E-cadherin by RNAi. We report that E-cadherin depletion reduced both Rho and Rho-GTP at the ZA, an effect that was rescued by expressing a RNAi-resistant full-length E-cadherin transgene. This impact on Rho signaling was accompanied by reduced junctional localization of the Rho GEF ECT2 and the centralspindlin complex that recruits ECT2. Further, the Rho signaling pathway contributes to the selective stabilization of E-cadherin molecules in the apical zone of the cells compared with E-cadherin at the lateral surface, thereby creating a more defined and restricted pool of E-cadherin that forms the ZA. Thus, E-cadherin and Rho signaling cooperate to ensure proper ZA architecture and function.",

Insertional inactivation of the ampA gene results in defects that define two distinct roles for the ampA gene during development. AmpA is necessary in a non-cell autonomous manner to prevent premature expression of a prespore gene marker. It is also necessary in a cell autonomous manner for the anterior like cells, which express the ampA gene, to migrate to the upper cup during culmination. It is also necessary to prevent excessive cell\u2013cell agglutination when cells are developed in a submerged suspension culture. Here, we demonstrate that a supernatant source of AmpA protein, added extracellularly, can prevent the premature mis-expression of the prespore marker. Synthetic oligopeptides are used to identify the domain of the AmpA protein that is important for preventing cells from mis-expressing the prespore gene. We further demonstrate that a factor capable of inducing additional cells to express the prespore gene marker accumulates extracellularly in the absence of AmpA protein. While the secreted AmpA acts extracellularly to suppress prespore gene expression, the effects of AmpA on cell agglutination and on actin polymerization in growing cells are not due to an extracellular role of secreted AmpA protein. Rather, these effects appear to reflect a distinct cell autonomous role of the ampA gene. Finally, we show that secretion of AmpA protein is brought about by elevating the levels of expression of ampA so that the protein accumulates to an excessive level.",

However, little is known about the role of AT1R in cardiac differentiation, which plays a key role in cardiac physiology and pharmacology. In the present study, we demonstrated that AT1R agonist significantly enhanced cardiac differentiation as determined by increased percentage of beating embryoid bodies and a higher expression level of cardiac markers. On the contrary, AT1R agonist stimulated differentiation was reversed in the presence of AT1R antagonist. In addition, by administering selective inhibitors we found that the effect of AT1R was driven via extracellular-signal regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

All iPSC lines exhibited the expected characteristics of pluripotent human cells, including the ability to differentiate to derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro. Re-expression of the SB transposase in the iPSCs after reprogramming resulted in the mobilisation of some of the transposons.

However, very little is known about the spatial and temporal pattern of Akt activity within cells and whether this pattern changes as cells enter and proceed in their differentiation programs. To address this issue we profiled Akt activation in E8.5\u2013E13.5 mouse embryos and in C2C12 cells. We used a commercial antibody against Akt, phosphorylated on one of its activating residues, Thr-308, and performed high resolution confocal imaging of the immunofluorescence in labeled embryos. We observe strong Akt activity during mitosis in the dermomyotome, the neuroepithelium and some mesenchymal cells. This burst of activity fills the whole cell except for heterochromatin-positive areas in the nucleus. A surge in activity during mitosis is also observed in subconfluent C2C12 cells. Later on in the differentiation programs of skeletal muscle and neural cells, derivatives of the dermomyotome and neuroepithelium, respectively, we find robust, sustained Akt activity in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus. Concomitantly with skeletal muscle differentiation, Akt activity becomes concentrated in the sarcomeric Z-disks whereas developing neurons maintain a uniform cytoplasmic pattern of activated Akt. Our findings reveal unprecedented cellular and subcellular details of Akt activity during mouse embryo development, which is spatially and temporally consistent with proposed functions for Akt in mitosis and myogenic and neural differentiation and/or survival. Our results thus demonstrate a subcellular change in the pattern of Akt activation when skeletal muscle and neural progenitor cells cease dividing and progress in their differentiation programs.",

     "abstract": "Endochondral bone development is orchestrated by the spatially and temporally coordinated differentiation of chondrocytes along the longitudinal axis of the cartilage anlage. Initially, the slowly proliferating, periarticular chondrocytes give rise to the pool of rapidly dividing columnar chondrocytes, whose expansion determines the length of the long bones. The Indian hedgehog (IHH) ligand regulates both the proliferation of columnar chondrocytes and their differentiation into post-mitotic hypertrophic chondrocytes in concert with GLI3, one of the main transcriptional effectors of HH signal transduction. In the absence of Hh signalling, the expression of Vlk (vertebrate lonesome kinase, also called Pkdcc) is increased. We now show that the shortening of limb long bones in Vlk-deficient mouse embryos is aggravated by additional inactivation of Gli3. Our analysis establishes that Vlk and Gli3 synergize to control the temporal kinetics of chondrocyte differentiation during long bone development. Whereas differentiation of limb mesenchymal progenitors into chondrocytes and the initial formation of the cartilage anlagen of the limb skeleton are not altered, Vlk and Gli3 are required for the temporally coordinated differentiation of periarticular into columnar and ultimately hypertrophic chondrocytes in long bones. In limbs lacking both Vlk and Gli3, the appearance of columnar and hypertrophic chondrocytes is severely delayed and zones of morphologically distinct chondrocytes are not established until E16.5. At the molecular level, these morphological alterations are reflected by delayed activation and lowered expression of Ihh, Pth1r and Col10a1 in long bone rudiments of double mutant limbs. In summary, our genetic analysis establishes that VLK plays a role in the IHH/GLI3 interactions and that Vlk and Gli3 cooperate to regulate long bone development by modulating the temporal kinetics of establishing columnar and hypertrophic chondrocyte domains.",

In addition, the use of xenogeneic genes would cause complicating matters such as immune responses when they are expressed. In this study, therefore, we established iPS cells by infecting cells from the fetal liver and newborn skin with amphotropic retroviral vectors containing cDNAs for the cynomolgus monkey genes of POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Flat colonies consisting of cells with large nuclei, similar to those in other primate ES cell lines, appeared and were stably maintained. These cell lines had normal chromosome numbers, expressed pluripotency markers and formed teratomas. We thus generated cynomolgus monkey iPS cell lines without the introduction of ecotropic retroviral receptors or other additional transgenes by using the four allogeneic transgenes. This may enable detailed analysis of the mechanisms underlying the reprogramming. In conclusion, we showed that iPS cells could be derived from cynomolgus monkey somatic cells.

A tissue microarray composed of normal prostate and BPH tissue was used and multiplexed immunohistochemistry was performed to detect AR and ER\u03b1.

AR expression and staining intensity in epithelial and stromal cells was significantly increased in BPH compared to normal prostate. ER\u03b1 expression was increased in BPH epithelium. However, stromal ER\u03b1 expression and staining intensity was decreased in BPH compared to normal prostate. Double positive (AR and ER\u03b1) epithelial cells were more prevalent in BPH, and fewer double negative (AR and ER\u03b1) stromal and epithelial negative cells were observed in BPH.

     "abstract": "The murine placenta has a trichorial structure with two multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (SCT) layers representing a barrier between the maternal and fetal blood system. Genes of endogenous retroviruses and retrotransposon-derived paternally expressed genes (Peg), remnants of past infections and integrations in the genome, have essential functions in placentogenesis. Previous studies showed that the envelope genes Syncytin-A and Syncytin-B were essential for cell\u2013cell fusion of the SCT. The goal of this study was to analyze the temporal localization and expression of nine genes throughout placental development from embryonic day (E)8.5 to E18.5 using in situ-hybridization and absolute RNA-quantification. These included a comparison of previously characterized genes from the labyrinth Syncytin-A, Syncytin-B, Gcm1, the junctional zone PL-1, PL-2, Plf, Tpbpa with two further characterized genes Peg10 and Tpbpb. Syncytin-A and Syncytin-B RNA localized to SCT-I and SCT-II, respectively. Peg10 RNA localized to all extraembryonic tissues, specifically to the parietal and sinusoidal TGC of the labyrinth layer, which is in contact with SCT-I and the maternal blood. All three retroviral/retrotransposon-derived genes showed the highest expression at E16.5, but Peg10 with 188,917.1 molecules/ng cDNA was 208-fold and 106.8-fold higher expressed than Syncytin-A and Syncytin-B, respectively. Tpbpb localized to the junctional zone and showed the highest expression at E16.5 along with PL-2, Plf, Tpbpa, but not PL-1, which decreased in expression at E10.5. To investigate a role of Syncytin-A, Syncytin-B and Peg10 in cell\u2013cell fusion, we established a cell culture system with fractionated primary trophoblasts from murine placentae. Culturing trophoblasts for up to 72\u00a0h partly resembled trophoblast development in vivo according to the nine marker genes. Knockdown of Syncytin-A demonstrated a functional regulation of cell\u2013cell fusion, where knockdown of Peg10 showed no involvement in cell fusion. Due to the expression of Peg10 in TGCs, we propose an essential functional role in the fetal\u2013maternal blood system.",

Therefore, HPV16 E6/E7 genes were employed as uniform platform to immortalize primary human corneal keratinocytes (IHCK), fibroblasts (IHCF), and endothelial (IHCE) cells. qPCR revealed that E6/E7 mRNA transcription persisted at rising passages and FISH detection of the chromosome portfolio 1, 8, 10 and 18 showed fairly the disomic cytogenetic status. Hot spot passages proved oscillation of aneuploidies in the entire passage spectrum under study, while hot spot aneuploidies annotated prevalence for distinct chromosomes. Though IIF revealed general endurance, tissue-innate corneal biomarkers were modulated, i.e. expressed in a temporal-confluence, temporal-spatial or passage-dependent manner. In summary, by the fairly normal chromosomal status, and expression of tissue-innate biomarkers, we created for the first time a uniform authentic in vitro model cell system of the human cornea, by application of the HPV16 E6/E7 immortalization platform only. This system renders a precious tool for prospective iterative in vitro studies on issues such as corneal tissue homeostasis, pharmaceutical generics, and/or evaluation of new biomaterials for clinical corneal applications.",

In addition, we studied the expression of class III \u03b2-tubulin in two murine melanogenic cell lines and show that expression of this protein starts as melanoblasts mature into melanocytes. Melanin bleaching experiments revealed close proximity between melanin and TUBB3 proteins. In vitro stimulation of primary human melanocytes by \u03b1-MSH indicated separate regulatory mechanisms for melanogenesis and to TUBB3 expression.

In the model of focal demyelination induced by lysolecithin (LPC) in the corpus callosum of adult plp-GFP animals, we observed an up-regulation of the morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in the LPC-induced lesion but not in the control animals. Moreover, we show that the adenovirus-mediated transfer of Shh in the lesion results in the attenuation of the demyelination extent as evidenced by GFP fluorescence analysis in Shh-treated and control animals. Altogether these data show how plp-GFP fluorescence can be monitored to follow the oligodendrocyte lineage during demyelination and identify Shh morphogen as an important factor during repair.",

     "abstract": "It is generally accepted that after differentiation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) become lineage restricted and unipotent in an irreversible manner. However, current results imply that even terminally differentiated cells transdifferentiate across lineage boundaries and therefore act as a progenitor cells for other lineages. This leads to the questions that whether transdifferentiation occurs via direct cell-to-cell conversion or dedifferentiation to a progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation, and whether MSC potency decreases or increases during differentiation. To address these questions, MSC were differentiated into adipogenic lineage cells, followed by dedifferentiation. The process of dedifferentiation was also confirmed by single cell clonal analysis. Finally the dedifferentiated cells were used for adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Histology, FACS, qPCR and GeneChip analyses of undifferentiated MSC, adipogenic-differentiated and dedifferentiated cells were performed. Interestingly, gene profiling and bioinformatics demonstrated that upregulation (DHCR24, G0S2, MAP2K6, SESN3) and downregulation (DST, KAT2, MLL5, RB1, SMAD3, ZAK) of distinct genes have an association with cell cycle arrest in adipogenic-differentiated cells and perhaps narrow down the lineage potency. However, the upregulation (CCND1, CHEK, HGF, HMGA2, SMAD3) and downregulation (CCPG1, RASSF4, RGS2) of these genes have an association with cell cycle progression and maybe motivate dedifferentiation of adipogenic-differentiated cells. We found that dedifferentiated cells have a multilineage potency comparable to MSC, and also observed the associative role of proliferation genes with cell cycle arrest and progression. Concluded, our results indicate that transdifferentiation of adipogenic-differentiated cells into osteogenic- or chondrogenic-differentiated cells proceeds via dedifferentiation and correlates with cell cycle arresting and deriving genes.

     "abstract": "The periodontal ligament (PDL) contains various cell populations and plays a central role in the maintenance, repair, and regeneration of the periodontium, i.e., tooth-supporting structures. Because primary cells isolated from PDL tissue are heterogeneous, the establishment of an effective isolation method for cells of interest is desired. In the present study, two morphologically distinct cell types were identified in confluent primary cultures derived from rat PDL. To isolate these cell populations, a small piece of filter paper soaked with trypsin\u2013EDTA was placed directly onto the target cell population, enabling the cells to detach from the culture dish. The filter papers were then transferred into fresh culture dishes to establish outgrowth cultures; these two steps constitute the \u201ccell fishing\u201d method. The \u201cfished\u201d cell types were propagated and subcultured for further analyses. In morphological evaluation, immunocytochemical analyses, and reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, the isolated cells exhibited a polygonal appearance or a mono- or multinucleated appearance, with a high cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio, leading to their being characterized as epithelial or myogenic cell populations, respectively. Surprisingly, a notable proportion of the multinuclear cells in the primary and subsequent isolated cultures demonstrated dramatic, spontaneous contractions, a feature typical of skeletal muscle cells. Finally, the isolated cell populations maintained a normal karyotype with a diploid chromosomal number. These results demonstrated that physiological epithelial and skeletal muscle cells can be obtained from primary PDL cultures without artificial induction using growth factors or chemicals, and can be propagated as individual lineage-committed cell populations; the populations consisted of differentiated and progenitor cells that maintained chromosomal stability. This simple, classical culture procedure provides new insights into the biological properties of PDL cells, which are potentially important for the differentiation of tissue or somatic stem cells and for the development of future cell-based therapies for dental and muscular diseases.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins from hESc\u2013MPC had in turn supported the undifferentiated expansion of hESc.

     "abstract": "The considerable therapeutic potential of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has generated increasing interest in a wide variety of biomedical disciplines. Nevertheless, researchers report studies on MSCs using different methods of isolation and expansion, as well as different approaches to characterize them; therefore, it is increasingly difficult to compare and contrast study outcomes. To begin to address this issue, the Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy proposed minimal criteria to define human MSCs. First, MSCs must be plastic-adherent when maintained in standard culture conditions (\u03b1 minimal essential medium plus 20% fetal bovine serum). Second, MSCs must express CD105, CD73 and CD90, and MSCs must lack expression of CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79\u03b1 or CD19 and HLA-DR surface molecules. Third, MSCs must differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts in vitro. MSCs are isolated from many adult tissues, in particular from bone marrow and adipose tissue. Along with their capacity to differentiate and transdifferentiate into cells of different lineages, these cells have also generated great interest for their ability to display immunomodulatory capacities. Indeed, a major breakthrough was the finding that MSCs are able to induce peripheral tolerance, suggesting that they may be used as therapeutic tools in immune-mediated disorders. Although no significant adverse events have been reported in clinical trials to date, all interventional therapies have some inherent risks. Potential risks for undesirable events, such as tumor development, that might occur while using these stem cells for therapy must be taken into account and contrasted against the potential benefits to patients.",

     "abstract": "FoxN4, a forkhead box transcription factor, is expressed in the chicken eye field and in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) throughout development. FoxN4 labelling overlapped with that of Pax6 and Sox2, two crucial transcription factors for RPCs. Later, during neurogenesis in the retina, some cells were intensely and transiently labelled for FoxN4. These cells co-labelled for Lim1, a transcription factor expressed in early-born horizontal cells. The result suggests that high levels of FoxN4 combined with expression of Lim1 define a population of RPCs committed to the horizontal cell fate prior to their last apical mitosis. As these prospective horizontal cells develop, their FoxN4 expression is down-regulated. Previous results suggested that FoxN4 is important for the generation of horizontal and amacrine cells but that it is not sufficient for the generation of horizontal cells (Li et al., 2004). We found that over-expression of FoxN4 in embryonic day 3 chicken retina could activate horizontal cell markers Prox1 and Lim1, and that it generated numerous and ectopically located horizontal cells of both main subtypes. However, genes expressed in photoreceptors, amacrine and ganglion cells were also activated, indicating that FoxN4 triggered the expression of several differentiation factors. This effect was not exclusive for the retina but was also seen when FoxN4 was over-expressed in the mesencephalic neural tube. Combining the results from over-expression and wild-type expression data we suggest a model where a low level of FoxN4 is maintained in RPCs and that increased levels during a restricted period trigger neurogenesis and commitment of RPCs to the horizontal cell fate.",

C/EBP\u03b2 gene expression was transiently induced early in adipogenesis. At later stages, in immature adipocytes, the C/EBP\u03b2 mRNA and protein levels declined. The C/EBP\u03b2-LIP protein steady-state level decreased considerably stronger than the C/EBP\u03b2-LAP level and the C/EBP\u03b2-LIP half-life was significantly shorter than the C/EBP\u03b2-LAP half-life. The turn-over of both C/EBP\u03b2-isoforms was regulated by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation. These data suggest that the protein stability of the C/EBP\u03b2-isoforms is differentially regulated in the course of adipogenesis and in immature adipocytes. Constitutive overexpression of C/EBP\u03b2-LIP had antiadipogenic activity in human ASC. C/EBP\u03b2-LAP, which promotes adipogenesis in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by directly activating expression of the adipogenic keyregulator PPAR\u03b32, induced the expression of PPAR\u03b32 and of the adipocyte differentiation gene product FABP4 in confluent ASC in the absence of adipogenic hormones. At later stages after hormone cocktail-induced adipogenesis, in immature adipocytes, constitutive overexpression of C/EBP\u03b2-LAP led to reduced expression of PPAR\u03b32 and FABP4, C/EBP\u03b1 expression was downregulated and the expression of the adipocyte differentiation gene products adiponectin and leptin was impaired. These findings suggest that constitutive overexpression of C/EBP\u03b2-LAP induces adipogenesis in human ASC and negatively regulates the expression of adipogenic regulators and certain adipocyte differentiation gene products in immature adipocytes. We conclude the regulation of both C/EBP\u03b2 gene expression and C/EBP\u03b2-LIP and C/EBP\u03b2-LAP protein turn-over plays an important role for the expression of adipogenic regulators and/or adipocyte differentiation genes in early adipogenic differentiation of human ASC and at later stages in human immature adipocytes.",

The expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors, Nkx2.5 and GATA-4, was detected by Western blotting.We found that the CaSR protein exists in both mESCs and mESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs). Increasing extracellular calcium or neomycin (an agonist of CaSR) increased [Ca2+]i and the differentiation rate. These effects were abolished by inhibition of CaSR, phospholipase C, IP3 receptor and Ca2+ ATPase, or by depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store, respectively. Activation of CaSR up-regulated protein expression of Nkx2.5 and GATA4 in EBs at an early stage of ICA-induced differentiation.In conclusion, CaSR is functionally expressed in mESCs, and activation of CaSR is involved in the differentiation of mESCs into cardiomyocytes by facilitating the expression of NKx2.5 and GATA-4.",

However, the potential impact of Ang II on ES cell differentiation is still unknown. In the present study, we have successfully induced the differentiation of ES cells into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) on collagen IV. Interestingly, incubation of ES cells with Ang II further promoted SMC differentiation from ES cells, which was abolished by prior treatment with Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan, but not Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist PD123319. Moreover, we found that, in parallel with SMC specific-marker induction, the expression levels of phosphoAkt and NF-Kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p50 were up-regulated by Ang II. Importantly, addition of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 led to a marked inhibition of Ang II induced SMC specific markers, phosphoAkt and NF-\u03baB p50 expression. Furthermore, NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY11-7082 can inhibit Ang II induced expression of SMC specific markers. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that Ang II plays a promotive role in the stage of ES cell differentiation to SMCs through AT1 receptor. We further confirmed that PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and NF-\u03baB play key roles in this process.",

Histone acetylation levels, controlled by the opposing action of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and thereby dynamically regulate transcriptional programs. HDACs execute important functions in the control of proliferation, differentiation, and the establishment of cell identities during embryonic development. To investigate the global role of the HDAC family during neural tube development, we employed Trichostatin A (TSA) to locally block enzymatic HDAC activity in chick embryos in ovo. We found that TSA treatment induces neural tube defects at the level of the posterior neuropore, ranging from slight undulations to a complete failure of neural tube closure. This phenotype is accompanied by morphological changes in neuroepithelial cells and induction of apoptosis. As a molecular consequence of HDAC inhibition, we observed a timely deregulated cadherin switching in the dorsal neural tube, illustrated by induction of Cadherin 6B as well as reciprocal downregulation of N-Cadherin expression. Concomitantly, several neural crest specific markers, including Bmp4, Pax3, Sox9 and Sox10 are induced, causing a premature loss of epithelial characteristics. Our findings provide evidence that HDAC function is crucial to control the regulatory circuits operating during trunk neural crest development and neural tube closure.",

     "abstract": "P-cadherin belongs to the family of Ca2+-dependent homophilic glycosylated cell adhesion molecules. In the normal oral epithelium it shows a strong expression in the basal cell layer which gradually decreases in the suprabasal cell layers. The exact role of P-cadherin during the development and homeostasis of the oral epithelium has not been elucidated, yet. Here, we show for the first time that P-cadherin controls differentiation by regulating cytokeratin (CK) 1/10 expression in primary oral keratinocytes (POK) from normal, but interestingly not in POKs from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissue. SiRNA knockdown of P-cadherin in normal POKs revealed a strong upregulation of CK1/10 expression on mRNA and protein level. In contrast, E-cadherin knockdown in normal oral keratinocytes did not show any influence on CK1/10 expression. Moreover, in comparison with normal control keratinocytes normal oral keratinocytes with reduced P-cadherin expression displayed an enhanced expression and a stronger nuclear staining of C/EBP-beta, a well-known regulator of CK1/10 expression in keratinocytes. Furthermore, after P-cadherin knockdown in normal POKs the promoter activity of a C/EBP-responsive luciferase construct was significantly higher than in normal POKs with regular P-cadherin expression. Additionally, we noticed a proliferation advantage in normal oral keratinocytes in contrast to keratinocytes with diminished P-cadherin expression. However, the inverted effect was seen in tumor derived primary oral keratinocytes. In summary, we show that P-cadherin contributes to the keratinocyte differentiation in the oral epithelium by influencing the CK1 and CK10 expression via C/EBP-beta-mediated signaling in normal but not in tumor derived oral keratinocytes from OSCC patients.",

In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic value of human umbilical cord matrix MSCs (HMSCs) on rat sciatic nerve after axonotmesis injury associated to Vivosorb\u00ae membrane. During HMSCs expansion and differentiation in neuroglial-like cells, the culture medium was collected at 48, 72 and 96\u00a0h for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis in order to evaluate the metabolic profile. To correlate the HMSCs ability to differentiate and survival capacity in the presence of the Vivosorb\u00ae membrane, the [Ca2+]i of undifferentiated HMSCs or neuroglial-differentiated HMSCs was determined by the epifluorescence technique using the Fura-2AM probe. The Vivosorb\u00ae membrane proved to be adequate and used as scaffold associated with undifferentiated HMSCs or neuroglial-differentiated HMSCs. In vivo testing was carried out in adult rats where a sciatic nerve axonotmesis injury was treated with undifferentiated HMSCs or neuroglial differentiated HMSCs with or without the Vivosorb\u00ae membrane. Motor and sensory functional recovery was evaluated throughout a healing period of 12 weeks using sciatic functional index (SFI), extensor postural thrust (EPT), and withdrawal reflex latency (WRL).Stereological analysis was carried out on regenerated nerve fibers. In vitro investigation showed the formation of typical neuroglial cells after differentiation, which were positively stained for the typical specific neuroglial markers such as the GFAP, the GAP-43 and NeuN.NMR showed clear evidence that HMSCs expansion is glycolysis-dependent but their differentiation requires the switch of the metabolic profile to oxidative metabolism. In vivo studies showed enhanced recovery of motor and sensory function in animals treated with transplanted undifferentiated and differentiated HMSCs that was accompanied by an increase in myelin sheath. Taken together, HMSC from the umbilical cord Wharton jelly might be useful for improving the clinical outcome after peripheral nerve lesion.",

To determine whether differentiation of ectomesenchymal dental precursor cells is supported by similar grades of extracellular matrices (ECMs) stiffness, we examined the influence of the surface stiffness on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). Cell proliferation of SHED was significantly decreased on cell culture surfaces with a muscle-like stiffness. A dexamethasone-based differentiation medium induced the osteogenic differentiation of SHED on substrates of varying mechanical stiffness. Here, the hardest surface improved the induction of osteogenic differentiation in comparison to that with the softest stiffness.

We analyzed postnatal innervation of the dental pulp in the mandibular first molar of mice deficient for Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) axon repellant molecule. Immunohistochemical localization of nerve fibers on serial sections covering the whole tooth germs using anti-peripherin antibody revealed that nerve fibers were prematurely present within the preodontoblast layer next to the inner enamel epithelium already at PN0 in Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, in the wild-type (Sema3A+/+) mice nerve fibers were seen in the pulp only after enamel formation at PN3. The nerves in Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 pulp were notably defasciculated and thinner compared to that of Sema3A+/+ mice. A premature formation of an abnormal, enlarged nerve plexus with a high number of arborizations was apparent in the pulp\u2013dentin border target area in Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 already at PN2 whereas in the wild-type mice the first sign of plexus formation was seen at PN7. The expression of mRNAs for Ngf, Gdnf and Ncam neuroregulatory molecules in mandibular molar as well as receptors for neurotrophic factors and class 3 semaphorins including Sema3A (TrkA, p75, TrkB, TrkC, Ret, Npn1, Npn2, PlxA4) in trigeminal ganglia were not altered in the Sema3A\u2212/\u2212 mice. Collectively, this data show that Sema3A serves an essential role in molar tooth pulp innervation controlling the timing of nerve fiber penetration into the pulp, their patterning and the formation of nerve plexus at pulp\u2013dentin border area, and provide further support for the hypothesis that tooth innervation is regulated by the coordinated activity of locally expressed neuroregulatory molecules exerting positive and negative influences on growing dental nerve fibers.",

     "abstract": "A common element during early left\u2013right patterning of the vertebrate body is left-sided nodal expression in the early-somite stage lateral plate mesoderm. Leftward cell movements near the node of the gastrulating chick embryo recently offered a plausible mechanism for breaking the presomite-stage molecular symmetry in those vertebrates which lack rotating cilia on the notochord or equivalent tissues. However, the temporal and functional relationships between generation of the known morphological node asymmetry, onset of leftward cell movements and establishment of stable molecular asymmetry in the chick remain unresolved. This study uses high-resolution light microscopy and in situ gene expression analysis to show that intranodal cell rearrangement during the phase of counter-clockwise node torsion at stage 4+ is immediately followed by symmetry loss and rearrangement of shh and fgf8 expression in node epiblast between stages 5\u2212 and 5+. Surprisingly, left-sided nodal expression starts at stage 5\u2212, too, but lies in the paraxial mesoderm next to the forming notochordal plate, and can be rendered symmetrical by minimal mechanical disturbance of distant tissue integrity at stage 4. The \u201cpremature\u201d paraxial nodal expression together with morphological and molecular asymmetries in, and near, midline compartments occurring at defined substages of early gastrulation help to identify a new narrow time window for early steps in left\u2013right patterning in the chick and support the concept of a causal relationship between a\u2014still enigmatic\u2014chiral (motor) protein, cell movements and incipient left\u2013right asymmetry in the amniote embryo.",

Proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were significantly enhanced in p75NTR-overexpressing MC3T3-E1 cells (p75GFP-E1).

To determine the binding partner of p75NTR in p75GFP-E1 cells during osteogenic differentiation, we examined the expression of trkA, trkB, and trkC that are known binding partners of p75NTR, as well as NgR. Pharmacological inhibition of trk tyrosine kinase with the K252a inhibitor resulted in marked reduction in the level of ALPase under osteogenic conditions. The deletion of the GDI binding domain in the p75NTR-GFP construct had no effect on mineralization.

Although the fate decision of glial progenitors was studied extensively, the signals and factors which regulate the timing of neuronal differentiation still remain unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuronal differentiation from glial progenitors, we modified the gene expression profile in NG2+ glial progenitor cells using enhanced retroviral mutagen (ERM) technique followed by phenotype screening to identify possible gene(s) responsible for glial-neuronal cell fate determination. Among the identified molecules, we found the gene named non-metastatic cell 1 which encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase protein A (Nm23-M1 or NME1). So far, the Nm23 members have been shown to be involved in various molecular processes including tumor metastasis, cell proliferation, differentiation and cell fate determination. In the present study, we provide evidence suggesting the role of NME1 in glial-neuronal cell fate determination in vitro. We showed that NME1 is widely expressed in neuronal structures throughout adult mouse CNS. Our immunohistochemical results revealed that NME1 is strongly colocalized with NF200 through white matter of spinal cord and brain. Interestingly, NME1 overexpression in oligodendrocyte progenitor OLN-93 cells potently induced the acquisition of neuronal fate, while its silencing was shown to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dual-functional role of NME1 is achieved through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Our data therefore suggested that NME1 acts as a switcher or reprogramming factor which involves in oligodentrocyte versus neuron cell fate specification in vitro.",

The aim of the present study was to gain first insights into the possible interplay between these two neighbored cell layers. We established an in vitro Transwell model of the alveolar epithelium based on human cell line H441 and investigated the influence of conditioned medium obtained from human lung endothelial cell line HPMEC-ST1.6R on the barrier properties of the H441 layers. As control for tissue specificity H441 layers were exposed to conditioned medium from human brain endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3. Addition of dexamethasone was necessary to obtain stable H441 cell layers. Moreover, dexamethasone increased expression of cell type I markers (caveolin-1, RAGE) and cell type II marker SP-B, whereas decreased the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in a concentration dependent manner. Soluble factors obtained from the lung endothelial cell line increased the barrier significantly proven by TEER values and fluorescein permeability on the functional level and by the differential expression of tight junctional proteins on the molecular level. In contrast to this, soluble factors derived from brain endothelial cells weakened the barrier significantly. In conclusion, soluble factors from lung endothelial cells can strengthen the alveolar epithelium barrier in vitro, which suggests communication between endothelial and epithelial cells regulating the integrity of the blood\u2013air barrier.",

     "abstract": "During myogenesis, human satellite cells differentiate and form multinucleated myotubes, while a fraction of the human satellite cells enter quiescence. These quiescent satellite cells are able to activate, proliferate and contribute to muscle regeneration. Post-transcriptional regulation of myogenesis occurs through specific myogenic microRNAs, also known as myomiRs. Although many microRNAs are involved in myotube formation, little is known on the involvement of microRNAs in satellite cells entering quiescence. This current study aims to investigate microRNA involvement during differentiation of human satellite cells, specifically proliferating satellite cells entering quiescence.For this, clonally expanded human satellite cells were differentiated for 5 days, after which myotubes and quiescent satellite cells were separated through FACS sorting. Next, a microRNA microarray comparison of proliferating satellite cells, myotubes and quiescent satellite cells was performed and verified through qRT-PCR.We show that during human satellite cell differentiation, microRNAs are globally downregulated in quiescent satellite cells compared to proliferating satellite cells, in particular microRNA-106b, microRNA-25, microRNA-29c and microRNA-320c. Furthermore, we show that during myogenesis microRNA-1, microRNA-133, microRNA-206 and microRNA-486 are involved in myotube formation rather than satellite cells entering quiescence. Finally, we show an overall decrease in total mRNA in quiescent satellite cells, and an indication that RNaseL regulation plays a role in promoting and maintaining quiescence. Given the importance of quiescent satellite cells in skeletal muscle development and regenerative medicine, it is imperative to distinguish between myotubes and quiescent satellite cells when investigating skeletal muscle development, especially in microRNA studies, since we show that microRNAs are globally downregulated in quiescent human satellite cells.",

Using flow cytometry we have identified two distinct subpopulations by size, large and small, within cultures of human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines. These two cell populations respond differentially to retinoic acid (RA) differentiation and several endocrine disruptor compounds (EDC). The large cell population responds to retinoic acid differentiation with greater than a 50% reduction in cell number and loss of Oct-4 expression, whereas the number of the small cell population does not change and Oct-4 protein expression is maintained. In addition, four estrogenic compounds altered SSEA-3 expression differentially between the two cell subpopulations changing their ratios relative to each other. Both populations express stem cell markers Oct-4, Nanog, Tra-1\u201360, Tra-1\u201380 and SSEA-4, but express low levels of differentiation markers common to the three germ layers. Cloning studies indicate that both populations can revive the parental population. Furthermore, whole genome microarray identified approximately 400 genes with significantly different expression between the two populations (p<0.01). We propose the differential response to RA in these populations is due to differential gene expression of Notch signaling members, CoupTF1 and CoupTF2, chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes that render the small population resistant to RA differentiation. The findings that hES cells exist as heterogeneous populations with distinct responses to differentiation signals and environmental stimuli will be relevant for their use for drug discovery and disease therapy.",

However, comparative studies for the potentials of the hepatogenic differentiation among various MSCs largely lacking. Therefore, we investigated to compare the potentials for hepatogenic differentiation of PDSCs with BM-MSCs, AD-MSCs, and UCB-MSCs. Several MSCs were isolated from human term placenta, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood and characterized isolated MSCs and BM-MSCs was performed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and special stains after mesodermal differentiation. The hepatogenic potential of PDSCs was compared with AD-MSCs, UCB-MSCs, and BM-MSCs using RT-PCR, PAS stain, ICG up-take assays, albumin expression, urea production, and cytokine assays. MSCs isolated from different tissues all presented similar characteristics of MSCs. However, the proliferative potential of PDSCs and the expression of hepatogenic markers in differentiated PDSCs were higher than other MSCs. Interestingly, the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increased in PDSCs after hepatogenic differentiation. Interestingly, stem cell factor (SCF) expression in chorionic plate-derived MSCs, one of the PDSCs, was significantly higher than in the other PDSCs. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that MSCs isolated from various adult tissues can be induced to undergo hepatogenic differentiation in vitro, and that PDSCs may have the greatest potential for hepatogenic differentiation and proliferation. Therefore, PDSCs could be used as a stem cell source for cell therapy in liver diseases.",

To refine animal usage in prostate development studies, we also determined whether a comparable number of prostatic buds were formed in male and female mouse urogenital sinus (UGS) explants grown in vitro in the presence of androgen. We used IHC to label UGS epithelium and ISH to label prostatic buds with one of three different prostatic bud marking riboprobes: a previously identified prostatic bud marker, NK-3 transcription factor, locus 1 (Nkx3-1), and two newly identified prostatic bud markers, wingless-related MMTV integration site 10b (Wnt10b) and ectodysplasin-A receptor (Edar). We calculated total buds formed per UGS and the proportion marked by each mRNA after male UGS development in vivo and male and female UGS development in vitro. Nkx3-1 was first to mark the prostate field during UGS development in vivo but all three mRNAs marked prostatic buds during later developmental stages. The mRNAs localized to different domains: Nkx3-1 was present along about half the prostatic bud length while Edar and Wnt10b were restricted to distal bud tips. None of the mRNAs marked all buds formed in vitro and the proportion marked was developmental stage- and gender-dependent. Nkx3-1 marked the highest proportion of prostatic buds during in vitro UGS development. Together, our results reveal that ISH staining of mouse UGS can be used to quantify prostatic bud number, Nkx3-1 is currently the best suited riboprobe for this method, and female UGSs cannot be used interchangeably with male UGSs when conducting prostate development studies in vitro. We also found that Nkx3-1, Edar, and Wnt10b mark different prostatic bud regions and are likely to be useful in future studies of regional differences in prostatic bud gene expression.",

Here we report the development and initial characterization of a pluripotent embryonic stem like cell line, designated as ESSA1, derived from blastula stage embryos of the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata, L). ESSA1 cells are cultured in Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and, unlike other ES cells, without a feeder layer. They have a round or polygonal morphology, grow exponentially in culture and form dense colonies. ESSA1 cells also exhibit intense alkaline phosphatase activity, normal karyotype and are positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) markers for up to 30 passages. Upon treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, ESSA1 cells differentiate into neuron-like, oligodendritic, myocyte and melanocyte cells; they can also form embryoid bodies when seeded in bacteriological plates, a characteristic usually associated with pluripotency. The capacity of ESSA1 cells to differentiate into osteoblastic, chondroblastic or osteoclastic cell lineages and to produce a mineralized extracellular matrix in vitro was demonstrated through histochemical techniques and further confirmed by immunocytochemistry using lineage-specific markers. Furthermore, ESSA1 cells can be used to produce chimera, where they contribute to the development of a variety of tissues including the trunk and gut of zebrafish embryos and fry. Thus, ESSA1 cells represent a promising model for investigating bone-lineage cell differentiation in fish and also highlight the potential of piscine stem cell research.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to exogenous hormones during development can result in permanent health problems. In utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) is probably the most well documented case in human history. DES, an orally active synthetic estrogen, was believed to prevent adverse pregnancy outcome and thus was routinely given to selected pregnant women from the 1940s to the 1960s. It has been estimated that 5 million pregnant women worldwide were prescribed DES during this period. In the early 1970s, vaginal clear cell adenocarcinomas (CCACs) were diagnosed in daughters whose mother took DES during pregnancy (known as DES daughters). Follow-up studies demonstrated that exposure to DES in utero causes a spectrum of congenital anomalies in female reproductive tracts and CCACs. Among those, cervical and vaginal adenoses are most commonly found, which are believed to be the precursors of CCACs. Transformation related protein 63 (TRP63/p63) marks the cell fate decision of M\u00fcllerian duct epithelium (MDE) to become squamous epithelium in the cervix and vagina. DES disrupts the TRP63 expression in mice and induces adenosis lesions in the cervix and vagina. This review describes mouse models that can be used to study the development of DES-induced anomalies, focusing on cervical and vaginal adenoses, and discusses their molecular pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to perform a comprehensive morphologic analysis of developing mouse external genitalia (ExG) and to determine specific sexual differentiation features that are responsive to androgens or estrogens. To eliminate sex steroid signaling postnatally, male and female mice were gonadectomized on the day of birth, and then injected intraperitoneally every other day with DES (200\u00a0ng/g), DHT (1\u00a0\u03bcg/g), or oil. On day-10 postnatal male and female ExG were dissected, fixed, embedded, serially sectioned and analyzed. We identified 10 sexually dimorphic anatomical features indicative of normal penile and clitoral differentiation in intact mice. Several (but not all) penile features were impaired or abolished as a result of neonatal castration. Those penile features remaining after neonatal castration were completely abolished with attendant clitoral development in androgen receptor (AR) mutant male mice (XTfm/Y and X/Y AR-null) in which AR signaling is absent both pre- and postnatally. Administration of DHT to neonatally castrated males restored development of all 10 masculine features to almost normal levels. Neonatal ovariectomy of female mice had little effect on clitoral development, whereas treatment of ovariectomized female mice with DHT induced partial masculinization of the clitoris. Administration of DES to neonatally gonadectomized male and female mice elicited a spectrum of development abnormalities. These studies demonstrate that the presence or absence of androgen prenatally specifies penile versus clitoral identity. Differentiated penile features emerge postnatally and are sensitive to and dependent upon prenatal or pre- and postnatal androgen. Emergence of differentiated clitoral features occurs postnatally in either intact or ovariectomized females. It is likely that each penile and clitoral feature has a unique time-course of hormonal dependency/sensitivity.",

We have shown that Ca2+ and CaM regulate ecmB expression and pstAB/pstB cell differentiation in vivo.

In isolated slug tips agents that affect Ca2+ levels and antagonize CaM had differential effect on ecmB expression and cell differentiation in the anterior versus posterior zones. Agents that increase intracellular Ca2+ levels increased the number of ecmB expressing cells in the anterior region of slugs, while agents that decrease intracellular Ca2+ levels or antagonize CaM activity increased the number of ecmB expressing cells in the posterior. We have also demonstrated that agents that affect Ca2+ levels or antagonize CaM affect cells motility and regeneration of shape in isolated slug tips and backs and regeneration of tips in isolated slug backs.

Expression of the transcription factor Tbx6 was found to increase during cardiac myocyte differentiation and to decrease during neural differentiation. Overexpression of Tbx6 was not sufficient to drive P19CL6 cells to a cardiac myocyte fate or to accelerate DMSO-induced differentiation. In contrast, knockdown of Tbx6 dramatically inhibited DMSO-induced differentiation of P19CL6 cells to cardiac myocytes, as evidenced by the loss of striated muscle-specific markers and spontaneous beating. Tbx6 knockdown was also accompanied by almost complete loss of Nkx2.5, a transcription factor involved in the specification of the cardiac myocyte lineage, indicating that Nkx2.5 is downstream of Tbx6. In distinction to its positive role in cardiac myocyte differentiation, Tbx6 knockdown augmented RA-induced differentiation of P19CL6 cells to both neurons and glia, and accelerated the rate of neurite formation. Conversely, Tbx6 overexpression attenuated differentiation to neural lineages. Thus, in the P19CL6 model, Tbx6 is required for cardiac myocyte differentiation and represses neural differentiation. We propose a model in which Tbx6 is a part of a molecular switch that modulates divergent differentiation programs within a single progenitor cell.",

ECM proteins regulate cell adhesion and differentiation through integrin mediated signal transduction. In the present study, we have examined the role of ECM proteins such as collagen type I, fibronectin, laminin and vitronectin in regulating the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSCs were grown on selected ECM protein treated tissue culture plates. The growth kinetics was assessed by calculating the doubling time of the cells on different ECM treated plates. The cells were directed to osteoblast lineage by growing them in osteogenic induction media for 21\u00a0day. Differentiation was evaluated at different time points by osteoblast differentiation associated gene expression, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, histochemical staining for mineralized matrix and calcium quantification. The doubling time of hMSCs cultured on collagen type I was significantly low, which was followed by laminin and fibronectin treated plates. However, doubling time of hMSCs cultured on vitronectin treated plate was not significantly different than that of the untreated control. High ALP gene (ALPL) expression and associated enhancement of mineralization were observed on collagen type I, fibronectin and vitronectin treated plates. Collagen type I showed early onset of mineralization with high ALP activity and up-regulation of osteopontin, ALPL, bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin genes. Vitronectin also up-regulated these genes and showed the highest amount of calcium in the secreted mineral matrix. Therefore, we conclude that, ECM proteins indeed modified the growth patterns and induced the osteoblast differentiation of hMSCs. Our findings have significant implication for bone tissue engineering applications.",

Muscle derived stem cells, known as satellite cells are responsible for the maintenance and repair of muscle tissue post-natally and in vivo would be exposed to oxygen concentrations of \u223c2\u20135%. Relatively few studies describe the function of these cells in large animal models and here we investigate the influence oxygen concentration has on modulating porcine muscle derived stem cell fate. We compared cells derived from two metabolically distinct muscles, the diaphragm and the hind limb semi-membranosus (SM) muscle. The two sub-populations responded differently to culture at atmospheric (\u223c20%) and physiological (\u223c5%) oxygen concentration. While myogenesis was enhanced in both populations at low oxygen, noticeably diaphragm derived cells exhibited greater myotube formation, than those from SM. The trans-differentiation of cells derived from these two sources was similarly affected, with considerable differences seen in adipogenic and neuronal tendencies. In addition to the effect of oxygen on cell phenotype, the expression of key signalling proteins varied between the two sub-populations during early time-points of induced differentiation, suggesting altered regulation of muscle specific stem cells under these conditions. While differences in muscle stem cell potential requires further investigation, the culture of cells in physiological oxygen concentration appears as fundamental to recreating the micro-environmental niche as routinely used factors such as cytokines, substrata and matrices.",

We have created a versatile Gateway library of clones for all 19 human Wnts. An analysis comparing epitope-tagged and untagged versions of each ligand shows that despite their similar expression at the mRNA level, Wnts exhibit considerable variation in stability, processing and secretion. At least 14 out of the 19 Wnts activate \u03b2 -catenin-dependent signaling, an activity that is cell type-dependent and tracks with the stabilization of \u03b2 -catenin and LRP6 phosphorylation.

Cat has a high degree of linkage with the human genome and has been used as a model for analysis of neurological disorders such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease and motor disorders. The present study was designed to characterize bone marrow-derived MSCs from cats and to investigate the capacity to generate functional peptidergic neurons. MSCs were expanded with cells from the femurs of cats and then characterized by phenotype and function. Phenotypically, feline and human MSCs shared surface markers, and lacked hematopoietic markers, with similar morphology. As compared to a subset of human MSCs, feline MSCs showed no evidence of the major histocompatibility class II. Since the literature suggested Stro-1 as an indicator of pluripotency, we compared early and late passages feline MSCs and found its expression in >90% of the cells. However, the early passage cells showed two distinct populations of Stro-1-expressing cells. At passage 5, the MSCs were more homogeneous with regards to Stro-1 expression. The passage 5 MSCs differentiated to osteogenic and adipogenic cells, and generated neurons with electrophysiological properties. This correlated with the expression of mature neuronal markers with concomitant decrease in stem cell-associated genes. At day 12 induction, the cells were positive for MAP2, Neuronal Nuclei, tubulin \u03b2III, Tau and synaptophysin. This correlated with electrophysiological maturity as presented by excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).

The cardiac neural crest cells are a subpopulation of cranial neural crest discovered nearly 30 years ago by ablation of premigratory neural crest. The cardiac neural crest cells are necessary for normal cardiovascular development. We begin with a description of the crest cells in normal development, including their function in remodeling the pharyngeal arch arteries, outflow tract septation, valvulogenesis, and development of the cardiac conduction system. The cells are also responsible for modulating signaling in the caudal pharynx, including the second heart field. Many of the molecular pathways that are known to influence specification, migration, patterning and final targeting of the cardiac neural crest cells are reviewed. The cardiac neural crest cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various human cardiocraniofacial syndromes such as DiGeorge, Velocardiofacial, CHARGE, Fetal Alcohol, Alagille, LEOPARD, and Noonan syndromes, as well as Retinoic Acid Embryopathy. The loss of neural crest cells or their dysfunction may not always directly cause abnormal cardiovascular development, but are involved secondarily because crest cells represent a major component in the complex tissue interactions in the head, pharynx and outflow tract. Thus many of the human syndromes linking defects in the heart, face and brain can be better understood when considered within the context of a single cardiocraniofacial developmental module with the neural crest being a key cell type that interconnects the regions.",

It has evolved as a major cellular component with impact both in development, disease and more recently also repair potential. The role of the epicardium in development, its differentiation from a proepicardial organ at the venous pole (vPEO) and the differentiation capacities of the vPEO initiating cardiac epicardium (cEP) into epicardium derived cells (EPDCs) have been extensively described in recent reviews on growth and transcription factor pathways. In short, the epicardium is the source of the interstitial, the annulus fibrosus and the adventitial fibroblasts, and differentiates into the coronary arterial smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, EPDCs induce growth of the compact myocardium and differentiation of the Purkinje fibers. This review includes an arterial pole located PEO (aPEO) that provides the epicardium covering the intrapericardial great vessels. In avian and mouse models disturbance of epicardial outgrowth and maturation leads to a broad spectrum of cardiac anomalies with main focus on non-compaction of the myocardium, deficient annulus fibrosis, valve malformations and coronary artery abnormalities. The discovery that in disease both arterial and cardiac epicardium can again differentiate into EPDCs and thus reactivate its embryonic program and potential has highly broadened the scope of research interest. This reactivation is seen after myocardial infarction and also in aneurysm formation of the ascending aorta. Use of EPDCs for cell therapy show their positive function in paracrine mediated repair processes which can be additive when combined with the cardiac progenitor stem cells that probably share the same embryonic origin with EPDCs.

Identifying factors that are critical to embryonic heart development could further our understanding of the disease and lead to new strategies of its prevention and treatment.

Over the past decade, studies from our lab and others have shown that NOS3 is required during heart development. More specifically, deficiency in NOS3 results in congenital septal defects, cardiac hypertrophy and postnatal heart failure. In addition, NOS3 is pivotal to the morphogenesis of major coronary arteries and myocardial capillary development. Interestingly, these effects of NOS3 are mediated through induction of transcription and growth factors that are crucial in the formation of coronary arteries. Finally, deficiency in NOS3 results in high incidences of bicuspid aortic valves, a disease in humans that often leads to complications with age including aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, endocarditis, aortic aneurysm formation, and aortic dissection. In summary, these data suggest NOS3 plays a critical role in embryonic heart development and morphogenesis of coronary arteries and aortic valves.",

The molecular events that induce this phenotypic change are well understood and include many growth factors, signaling components, and transcription factors. Besides their clear importance in valve development, the role of these transformed mesenchyme and the function they serve in the developing prevalve leaflets is less understood. Indeed, we know that these cells migrate, but how and why do they migrate? We also know that they undergo a transition to a mature, committed cell, largely defined as an interstitial fibroblast due to their ability to secrete various matrix components including collagen type I. However, we have yet to uncover mechanisms by which the matrix is synthesized, how it is secreted, and how it is organized. As valve disease is largely characterized by altered cell number, cell activation, and matrix disorganization, answering questions of how the valves are built will likely provide us with information of real clinical relevance. Although expression profiling and descriptive or correlative analyses are insightful, to advance the field, we must now move past the simplicity of these assays and ask fundamental, mechanistic based questions aimed at understanding how valves are \u201cbuilt\u201d. Herein we review current understandings of atrioventricular valve development and present what is known and what isn't known.

Thus, the goal of this review is to remind us of these questions and provide new perspectives on an old theme of valve development.",

     "abstract": "Partitioning of the four-chambered heart requires the proper formation, interaction and fusion of several mesenchymal tissues derived from different precursor populations that together form the atrioventricular mesenchymal complex. This includes the major endocardial cushions and the mesenchymal cap of the septum primum, which are of endocardial origin, and the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (DMP), which is derived from the Second Heart Field. Failure of these structures to develop and/or fully mature results in atrial septal defects (ASDs) and atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD). AVSDs are congenital malformations in which the atria are permitted to communicate due to defective septation between the inferior margin of the septum primum and the atrial surface of the common atrioventricular valve. The clinical presentation of AVSDs is variable and depends on both the size and/or type of defect; less severe defects may be asymptomatic while the most severe defect, if untreated, results in infantile heart failure. For many years, maldevelopment of the endocardial cushions was thought to be the sole etiology of AVSDs. More recent work, however, has demonstrated that perturbation of DMP development also results in AVSD. Here, we discuss in detail the formation of the DMP, its contribution to cardiac septation and describe the morphological features as well as potential etiologies of ASDs and AVSDs.",

Cardiac conduction system development is intricately related to the development and maturation of the embryonic heart towards its four-chambered form, as is indicated by the fact that disturbed development of cardiac structures is often accompanied by a disturbed formation of the CCS. Electrophysiological studies have shown that selected conduction disturbances and cardiac arrhythmias do not take place randomly in the heart but rather at anatomical predilection sites. Knowledge on development of the CCS may facilitate understanding of the etiology of arrhythmogenic events. In this review we will focus on embryonic development of the CCS in relation to clinical arrhythmias, as well as on specific cardiac conduction abnormalities that are observed in patients with congenital heart disease.",

     "abstract": "Animal models are critically important for a mechanistic understanding of embryonic morphogenesis. For decades, visualizing these rapid and complex multidimensional events has relied on projection images and thin section reconstructions. While much insight has been gained, fixed tissue specimens offer limited information on dynamic processes that are essential for tissue assembly and organ patterning. Quantitative imaging is required to unlock the important basic science and clinically relevant secrets that remain hidden. Recent advances in live imaging technology have enabled quantitative longitudinal analysis of embryonic morphogenesis at multiple length and time scales. Four different imaging modalities are currently being used to monitor embryonic morphogenesis: optical, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Each has its advantages and limitations with respect to spatial resolution, depth of field, scanning speed, and tissue contrast. In addition, new processing tools have been developed to enhance live imaging capabilities. In this review, we analyze each type of imaging source and its use in quantitative study of embryonic morphogenesis in small animal models. We describe the physics behind their function, identify some examples in which the modality has revealed new quantitative insights, and then conclude with a discussion of new research directions with live imaging.",

     "abstract": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into all three main germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Although a number of methods have been developed to differentiate ES cells into neuronal phenotypes such as sensory and motor neurons, the efficient generation of GABAergic interneurons from ES cells still presents an ongoing challenge. Because the main output of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is the gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter whose controlled homeostasis is required for normal brain function, the efficient generation in culture of functional interneurons may have future implications on the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. The goal of this work was to examine the generation of GABAergic neurons from mouse ES cells by comparing an embryoid body-based methodology versus a hydrogel-based encapsulation protocol that involves the use of all-trans-retinoid acid (RA). We observed that (1) there was a 2-fold increase in neuronal differentiation in encapsulated versus non-encapsulated cells and (2) there was an increase in the specificity for interneuronal differentiation in encapsulated cells, as assessed by mRNA expression and electrophysiology approaches. Furthermore, our results indicate that most of the neurons obtained from encapsulated mouse ES cells are GABA-positive (\u223c87%). Thus, these results suggest that combining encapsulation of ES cells and RA treatment provide a more efficient and scalable differentiation strategy for the generation in culture of functional GABAergic interneurons. This technology may have implications for future cell replacement therapies and the treatment of CNS disorders.",

     "abstract": "The reciprocal influence and bidirectional cross-talk between bone and energy metabolism is a recent finding, since the discovery that the product of osteoblasts osteocalcin increases pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation, insulin secretion and sensitivity. Conversely, the anabolic effect of insulin is crucial for osteoblast function, as suggested by severe osteopenia and increased incidence of fracture in insulin-deficient diabetic patients. The Insulin Receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase, which is commonly expressed in the insulin-sensitive liver, muscle, and adipose tissues, is also found in animal and human bone. Here we show that in human bone two insulin receptor isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) are differently expressed. Mature human osteoblasts predominantly express IR-B, whereas IR-A is mainly expressed in osteoblast precursors, and IR-B/IR-A mRNA ratio significantly increases along the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal precursors. Moreover, transfected osteoprogenitors overexpressing IR-A show an increased proliferation rate. In contrast, when transfected with and overexpressing IR-B, their proliferation rate is reduced, corresponding to a more differentiated phenotype. In conclusion, the fine regulation of the expression of different isoforms of IR during osteogenic differentiation confirms the important role played by IR in bone homeostasis, providing the basis for new perspectives on the various involvements of IR isoforms in bone pathophysiology.",

Aimed at investigating this aspect, a series of in vitro experiments were performed with StC isolated from first trimester human chorionic villi (CVStC).CVStC were cultured in: (i) standard mesenchymal medium (MM) and (ii) AmniomaxII\u00ae (AM), specifically designed to grow amnion-derived cells in prenatal diagnostic procedures. Cells were then exposed to distinct differentiation treatments and distinguished according to morphology, immunophenotype and molecular markers. Human StC obtained from adult bone marrow (BMStC) were used as control. CVStC cultured either in MM or AM presented stromal morphology and immunophenotype, were negative for pluripotency factors (Nanog, Oct-4 and Sox-2), lacked detectable telomerase activity and retained high genomic stability. In AM, however, CVStC exhibited a faster proliferation rate compared to BMStC or CVStC kept in MM. During differentiation, CVStC were less efficient than BMStC in acquiring adipocytes and osteocytes features; the cardiomyogenic conversion occurred at low efficiency in both cell types. Remarkably, in the presence of pro-angiogenic factors, CVStC reprogrammed toward an endothelial-like phenotype at significantly higher efficiency than BMStC. This effect was particularly evident in CVStC expanded in AM. Mechanistically, the reduced CVStC expression of anti-angiogenic microRNA could support this process.The present study demonstrates that, despite of fetal origin, CVStC exhibit restricted plasticity, distinct from that of BMStC and predominantly directed toward the endothelial lineage.",

Despite considerable progress within the last few years, therapeutic approaches for this type of tumor are still limited. The respective tumor cells originate from myogenic precursor cells and are characterized by a blockade in their differentiation program. Interestingly, there is a direct inverse correlation between the differentiation status of a specific rhabdomyosarcoma cell and its metastatic potential. Thus, here, we tested whether the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which regulates myogenic differentiation and is also a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of other types of tumors, might be an interesting candidate for the development of novel rhabdomyosarcoma treatment strategies. For this purpose, we analyzed NF-\u03baB activity (classical pathway) in myoblasts with different differentiation potential, specifically in three different rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. In addition, we inhibited NF-\u03baB activity in these cells and analyzed the effects on myogenic differentiation. We show that after the induction of differentiation, NF-\u03baB activity declines rapidly in normal myoblasts, but only slightly in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. However, after treatment of the cells with two different small-molecule NF-\u03baB-inhibiting compounds, the IKK inhibitor curcumin and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, we found that neither curcumin nor lactacystin promoted myogenic differentiation in either normal myoblasts or rhabdomyosarcoma cells.

However, downstream events of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling that control the formation of mesendoderm are still unclear. In the present study, we used mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as a model, and identified a homeodomain protein Nkx1-2 as a key regulator of mesendoderm formation. In the mouse embryo, Nkx1-2 was expressed in the primitive streak, in which the nascent mesendoderm emerges. In P19 cells, the expression of Nkx1-2 was activated by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling independently of Brachyury, an evolutionary conserved early mesendoderm gene. In contrast, the expression of Nkx1-2 was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of Brachyury. Nkx1-2 acted as a transcriptional repressor to mediate the action of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to activate the Brachyury expression. We found Tcf3 as a potential target of gene repression by Nkx1-2, and the down-regulation of Tcf3 was partly required for effective activation of Brachyury by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. These results suggest that Nkx1-2 is a critical component of the gene regulatory network that operates downstream of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to regulate the formation of mesendoderm.",

     "abstract": "The immune system plays a key role in eliminating cancer cells in the body. However, even in fully immune-competent bodies cancers can evade anti-tumor immune action. There is increasing evidence that epithelial cancers can actively suppress anti-tumor immune responses by creating an immune-suppressive micro-environment. It has been reported that epithelial cancers can express immune genes/proteins not normally expressed by their parental tissues, including a variety of cytokines/receptors, immune transcription factors and Ig motifs in cell surface molecules. Recently we observed increased expression of immune genes, including immune-suppressive genes, by prostate epithelial cancers. In view of the above, we propose that immune-suppressive activity of epithelial cancers may stem from their acquisition of immune properties via a transdifferentiation process, we term \u201cEpithelial Immune Cell-like Transition\u201d (EIT), similar to neuroendocrine-like transdifferentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma cells. We propose that the acquired immune properties enable the cancer cells to \u201ccommunicate\u201d with immune cells, leading to suppression of anti-cancer immune activity in their micro-environment and facilitation of the expansion and malignant progression of the disease. Acquired immune properties of epithelial cancers, which might be quite common, could provide novel targets for reducing cancer-generated immune-suppressive activity and enhancing anti-tumor immune activity. This proposed paradigm shift could lead to novel therapeutic approaches with improved efficacy and broad application.",

We show that three major stem cell pluripotency/differentiation pathways, Notch, canonical Wnt, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, are affected by smoke exposure, and that Nodal signaling through SMAD2 is specifically impacted by effects on Lefty1, Nodal, and FoxH1. These events are associated with upregulation of microRNA-302a, a post-transcriptional silencer of Lefty1.

We hypothesized that relatively low frequency mechanical stimulation (0.01\u00a0Hz) can inhibit adipogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells, even in a potent adipogenic differentiation medium. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in adipogenic medium under control (non-mechanically stimulated) conditions and under oscillatory surface stretch with 10% amplitude and 0.01\u00a0Hz frequency for 6\u00a0h per day for up to 5 days. Cell population was assessed by counting and adipogenic differentiation was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) after 3 and 5 days. Involvement of the ERK signaling pathway was assessed by Western blot. Low frequency mechanical stimulation significantly decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 after 3 days and FABP4 after 3 and 5 days versus non-stimulated culture. ERK signaling was decreased in mechanically-stimulated culture, indicating a role in the inhibition of adipogenic differentiation.Application of this study: Low frequency mechanical stimulation may provide a technically simple means for control of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in cell-based therapies, particularly for inhibition of differentiation toward undesired adipogenic lineages.",

     "abstract": "Previous work, verified here, showed that colchicine affects Dictyostelium pattern formation, disrupts morphogenesis, inhibits spore differentiation and induces terminal stalk cell differentiation. Here we show that colchicine specifically induces ecmB expression and enhances accumulation of ecmB-expressing cells at the posterior end of multicellular structures. Colchicine did not induce a nuclear translocation of DimB, a DIF-1 responsive transcription factor in vitro. It also induced terminal stalk cell differentiation in a mutant strain that does not produce DIF-1 (dmtA\u2212) and after the treatment of cells with DIF-1 synthesis inhibitor cerulenin (100\u00a0\u03bcM). This suggests that colchicine induces the differentiation of ecmB-expressing cells independent of DIF-1 production and likely through a signaling pathway that is distinct from the one that is utilized by DIF-1. Depending on concentration, colchicine enhanced random cell motility, but not chemotaxis, by 3\u20135 fold (10\u201350\u00a0mM colchicine, respectively) through a Ca2+-mediated signaling pathway involving phospholipase C, calmodulin and heterotrimeric G proteins. Colchicine's effects were not due to microtubule depolymerization as other microtubule-depolymerizing agents did not have these effects. Finally normal morphogenesis and stalk and spore cell differentiation of cells treated with 10\u00a0mM colchicine were rescued through chelation of Ca2+ by BAPTA-AM and EDTA and calmodulin antagonism by W-7 but not PLC inhibition by U-73122. Morphogenesis or spore cell differentiation of cells treated with 50\u00a0mM colchicine could not be rescued by the above treatments but terminal stalk cell differentiation was inhibited by BAPTA-AM, EDTA and W-7, but not U-73122. Thus colchicine disrupts morphogenesis and induces stalk cell differentiation through a Ca2+-mediated signaling pathway involving specific changes in gene expression and cell motility.",

Herein, long-term and large-field live cell imaging was used to study the process of megakaryopoiesis at the single cell level (n=9300) from human CD34+ cord blood (CB) in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO) or the cytokine cocktail BS1 with or without nicotinamide (NIC). Comparative analyses revealed that the cocktail BS1 increased the mitotic and proplatelet rate of diploid and polyploid cells, respectively. Conversely, only NIC treatment increased the endomitotic rate of megakaryocytes (MKs) leading to the formation of CB-MKs with ploidy level frequently observed with BM-MKs. However, NIC failed to enhance platelet production. Rather, a 7- and 31-fold reduction in proplatelet formation was observed in tetraploid and octaploid CB-MKs, respectively, and ex vivo platelet production output was reduced by half due to a reduction in MK output in NIC cultures. Unexpectedly, a significant fraction of di- and polyploid CB-MKs were seen to undergo complete proplatelet regression. Though rare (<0.6%), proplatelet reversal led to the formation of regular round cells that could at times resume normal development. The cell tracking data was then used to investigate the impact of \u201cdevelopmental fate\u201d and ploidy on cell cycling time, and to identify potential developmental patterns. These analyses revealed that cell fate and ploidy level have major impacts on the cell cycling time of the cells, and that four recurrent cell lineage patterns could be identified for CD34+ cells undergoing MK differentiation.",

In most cases, FGFs and BMPs have opposing effects, and specific developmental outcomes arise out of a balance between the two growth factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that signaling pathways activated by FGFs and BMPs interact via inhibitory crosstalk. Here we demonstrate a role for the BMP effector TGF-\u03b2 Activated Kinase 1 (TAK1) in the maintenance of Smad1 activity in Xenopus embryos, via the inhibition of erk MAPK. Up- or downregulation of TAK1 levels produces an inverse alteration in the amount of activated erk MAPK. The inhibition of erk MAPK by TAK1 is mediated by p38 and a corresponding decrease in phosphorylation of MEK. TAK1 morphant embryos show a decrease in the nuclear accumulation of Smad1. Conversely, reduction of erk MAPK activity via overexpression of MAP Kinase Phosphatase1 (MKP1) leads to an increase in nuclear Smad1. Both TAK1 morphant ectoderm and ectoderm treated with FGF show a decrease in the expression of several Smad1-inducible genes. Neural-specific gene expression is inhibited in isolated ectoderm coexpressing noggin and TAK1, suggesting that TAK1 is sufficient to inhibit neural specification. Introduction of TAK1 morpholino oligonucleotide expands the expression of organizer genes, disrupts formation of the boundary between organizer and non-organizer mesoderm, and increases the spatial range of MAPK activation in response to localized FGF. Our results indicate that inhibitory interactions between FGF and BMP4 effector pathways increase the robustness of BMP signaling via a feed-forward mechanism.",

We further go on to identify that mesenchymal stem cells from Prx1-Dkk1 mice have limited proliferative ability, but normal differentiation potential, which may explain the mechanism for the limb reduction defects observed. We believe Prx1-Dkk1 mice may prove useful in the future to study the mechanisms underlying the development of congenital limb reduction defects.",

It is not known whether these and related proteins are present in undifferentiated stem cells, or when they appear in cardiomyogenic cells following differentiation. We first tested the hypothesis that nuclear actin and cardiac isoforms of troponin C (cTnC) and tropomyosin (cTm) are present along with cTnI and cTnT in nuclei of isolated, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in culture. We also tested the hypothesis that of these five proteins, only actin is present in nuclei of multipotent, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from adult rats in culture, but that cTnC, cTnI, cTnT and cTm appear early and uniquely following cardiomyogenic differentiation. Here we show that nuclear actin is present within nuclei of both ventricular cardiomyocytes and undifferentiated, multipotent BM-MSCs. We furthermore show that cTnC, cTnI, cTnT and cTm are not only present in myofilaments of ventricular cardiomyocytes in culture but are also within their nuclei; significantly, these four proteins appear between days 3 and 5 in both myofilaments and nuclei of BM-MSCs treated to differentiate into cardiomyogenic cells. These observations indicate that cardiac troponin and tropomyosin could have important cellular function(s) beyond Ca2+-regulation of contraction. While the roles of nuclear-associated actin, troponin subunits and tropomyosin in cardiomyocytes are not known, we anticipate that the BM-MSC culture system described here will be useful for elucidating their function(s), which likely involve cardiac-specific, Ca2+-dependent signaling in the nucleus.",

Caco-2 cells differ from normal enterocytes for mutations of APC and \u03b2-catenin genes, factors known to be involved in the transcriptional control of MYC gene during enterocyte differentiation. In this paper, we investigated how Myc regulation could be achieved during Caco-2 differentiative process, notwithstanding the APC and \u03b2-catenin mutations. We highlighted the post translational regulation of Myc protein as one of the essential mechanisms that allows the exit from cell cycle and onset of differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Moreover, we found a strong correlation between Myc protein downregulation and the expression of the transcription factor Cdx2, suggesting the existence of a regulative link between these two proteins.",

In this study we re-evaluate the capacity of mouse and human bone marrow-derived MSCs to contribute to the development of renal tissue using a novel method of embryonic kidney culture. Although MSCs show expression of some genes involved in renal development, their contribution to nephrogenesis is very limited in comparison to other stem cell types tested. Furthermore, we found that both mouse and human MSCs have a detrimental effect on the ex vivo development of mouse embryonic kidney, this effect being mediated through a paracrine action.

     "publication date": "03-2012",
     "abstract": "For tissue engineering, cultivation of pluripotent stem cells on three-dimensional scaffolds allows the generation of organ-like structures. Previously, we have established an organotypic culture system of skin to induce epidermal differentiation in adult stem cells. Multipotent stem cells are not able to differentiate across germinal boundaries. In contrast, pluripotent stem cells readily differentiate into tissues of all three germ layers. Germline-derived pluripotent stem cells (gPS cells) can be generated by induction of pluripotency in mouse unipotent germline stem cells without the introduction of exogenous transcription factors. In the current study, we analyzed the influence of organotypic culture conditions of skin on the epithelial differentiation of gPS cells in comparison to the well-established HM1 ES cell line. Quantitative RT-PCR data of the pluripotency gene Oct4 showed that gPS cells are characterized by an accelerated Oct4-downregulation compared to HM1 ES cells. When subjected to the organotypic culture conditions of skin, gPS cells formed tubulocystic structures lined by stratified (CK5/6+, CK14+, CK8/18\u2212) epithelia. HM1 ES cells formed only small tubulocystic structures lined by simple, CK8/18+ epithelia. BMP-4, an epidermal morphogen, significantly enhanced the expression of epithelial markers in HM1 ES cells, but did not significantly affect the formation of complex (squamous) epithelia in gPS cells. In HM1 ES cells the differentiation into squamous epithelium was only inducible in the presence of mature dermal fibroblasts. Both pluripotent stem cell types spontaneously differentiated into mesodermal, endodermal and into neuroectodermal cells at low frequency, underlining their pluripotent differentiation capacity. Concluding, the organotypic culture conditions of skin induce a multilayered, stratified epithelium in gPS cells, in HM1 ES cells only in the presence of dermal fibroblasts. Thus, our data show that differentiation protocols strongly depend on the stem cell type and have to be modified for each specific stem cell type.",

Under non-adherent growth conditions, A818-6 cells differentiate into 3D highly organised polarised epithelial hollow spheres, resembling duct-like structures. A818-6 cells showed a differentiation\u2013dependent FAP-1 localisation. Cells grown as 2D monolayers revealed FAP-1 staining in a juxtanuclear cisternal position, as well as localisation in the nucleus. After differentiation into hollow spheres, FAP-1 was relocated towards the actin cytoskeleton beneath the outer plasma membrane of polarised cells and no further nuclear localisation was observed. CD95 surface staining was found only in a subset of A818-6 monolayer cells, while differentiated hollow spheres appeared to express CD95 in all cells of a given sphere. We rarely observed co-localisation of CD95 and FAP-1 in A818-6 monolayer cells, but strong co-localisation beneath the outer plasma membrane in polarised cells. Analysis of surface expression by flow cytometry revealed that only a subset (36%) of monolayer cells showed CD95 surface expression, and after induction of hollow spheres, CD95 presentation at the outer plasma membrane was reduced to 13% of hollow spheres. Induction of apoptosis by stimulation with agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies, resulted in increased caspase activity in both, monolayer cells and hollow spheres. Knock down of FAP-1 mRNA in A818-6 monolayer cells did not alter resposiveness to CD95 agonistic antibodies. These data suggested that CD95 signal transduction was not affected by FAP-1 expression in A818-6 monolayer cells. In differentiated 3D hollow spheres, we found a polarisation-induced co-localisation of CD95 and FAP-1. A tight control of receptor surface representation and signalling induced apoptosis ensures controlled removal of individual cells instead of a \u201csnowball effect\u201d of apoptotic events.",

Analysis of both cartilage and bone development in affected embryos and mice from birth till P35 did not reveal any major defect in histogenesis, except a reduced number of chondrocytes in the vertebral anlage at E13.5. In conclusion, the sustained expression of Hoxa2 in the chondrocyte lineage is characterized by a proportionate short stature resulting from skeletal growth defect. The indepth analysis of cartilage and bone histogenesis points towards an initial deficit in cell mobilization to enter chondrogenesis.",

     "abstract": "In this review, we propose a new classification of vertebrate cilia/flagella and discuss the evolution and prototype of cilia. Cilia/flagella are evolutionarily well-conserved membranous organelles in eukaryotes and serve a variety of functions, including motility and sensation. Vertebrate cilia have been traditionally classified into conventional motile cilia and sensory primary cilia. However, an avalanche of emerging evidence on the variations of cilia has made it almost impossible to classify them in a simple dichotomic manner. For example, conventional motile cilia are also involved in the sensation of bitter taste to facilitate the beating of cilia as a defense system of the respiratory system. On the other hand, the primary cilium, often regarded as a non-motile sensory organelle, has been revealed to be motile in vertebrate embryonic nodes, where they play a crucial role in the determination of left\u2013right asymmetry of the body. Moreover, choroid plexus epithelial cells in the cerebral ventricular system exhibit multiple primary cilia on a single cell. Considering these lines of evidence on the diversity of cilia, we believe the classification of cilia should be based on their structure and function, and include more detailed criteria. Another intriguing issue is how in the evolution of cilia, their function and morphology are combined. For example, has motility been acquired from originally sensory cilia, or vice versa? Alternatively, were they originally hybrid in nature? These questions are inseparable from the classification of cilia per se. We would like to address these conundrums in this review article, principally from the standpoint of differentiation of the animal cell.",

A key player in this process is the multi-subunit IFT-complex, which acts as an adapter between the motor proteins required for movement and the ciliary cargo proteins. Since the discovery of IFT more than 15 years ago, considerable effort has gone into the purification and characterization of the IFT complex proteins. Even though this has led to very interesting findings and has greatly improved our knowledge of the IFT process, we still know very little about the overall architecture of the IFT complex and the specific functions of the various subunits. In this review we will give an update on the knowledge of the structure and function of individual IFT proteins, and the way these proteins interact to form the complex that facilitates IFT.",

The dyneins are composed of multiple subunits, which are thought to be preassembled in the cytoplasm before they are transported into cilia and flagella. Axonemal dyneins have been extensively studied in Chlamydomonas. In addition, analyses of human PCDs over the past decade, together with studies in other model animals, have identified the conserved components required for dynein assembly. Recently also, the first cytoplasmic component of dynein assembly, kintoun (ktu), was elucidated through the analysis of a medaka mutant in combination with human genetics and cell biology and biochemical studies of Chlamydomonas.

     "abstract": "Cilia and flagella are highly conserved eukaryotic microtubule-based organelles that protrude from the surface of most mammalian cells. These structures require large protein complexes and motors for distal addition of tubulin and extension of the ciliary membrane. In order for ciliogenesis to occur, coordination of many processes must take place. An intricate concert of cell cycle regulation, vesicular trafficking, and ciliary extension must all play out with accurate timing to produce a cilium. Here, we review the stages of ciliogenesis as well as regulation of the length of the assembled cilium. Regulation of ciliogenesis during cell cycle progression centers on centrioles, from which cilia extend upon maturation into basal bodies. Centriole maturation involves a shift from roles in cell division to cilium nucleation via migration to the cell surface and docking at the plasma membrane. Docking is dependent on a variety of proteinaceous structures, termed distal appendages, acquired by the mother centriole. Ciliary elongation by the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT) ensues. Direct modification of ciliary structures, as well as modulation of signal transduction pathways, play a role in maintenance of the cilium. All of these stages are tightly regulated to produce a cilium of the right size at the right time. Finally, we discuss the implications of abnormal ciliogenesis and ciliary length control in human disease as well as some open questions.",

Most NPH gene products (NPHPs) localize to the cilium, and appear to control the transport of cargo protein to the cilium by forming functional networks. Inversin interacts with NPHP1 and NPHP3, and shares with NPHP4 the ability to antagonize Dishevelled-stimulated canonical Wnt signaling, potentially through recruitment of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C). However, Dishevelled antagonism may be confined towards the basal body, thereby polarizing motile cilia on the cells of the ventral node and respiratory tract. Inversin is essential for recruiting Dishevelled to the plasma membrane in response to activated Frizzled, a crucial step in planar cell polarity signaling. During vertebrate pronephros development, the Inversin-mediated translocation of Dishevelled appears to orchestrate the migration of cells and differentiation of segments that correspond to the mammalian loop of Henle. Thus, defective tubule migration and elongation may contribute to concentration defects and cause cyst formation in patients with NPH.",

Embryos of the analyzed frogs develop from eggs of different sizes, and display different reproductive and developmental strategies. In particular, dorsal convergence and extension and archenteron elongation begin during gastrulation in embryos of rapidly developing frogs, as in Xenopus laevis. In contrast, cells that involute during gastrulation are stored in the large circumblastoporal collar that develops around the closed blastopore in embryos of slow-developing frogs. Dorsal convergence and extension only start after blastopore closure in slow-developing frog embryos. However, in the neurulae, a gastrocoel roof plate develops, despite the accumulation of superficial mesodermal cells in the circumblastoporal collar. Embryos of all four species develop a ciliated gastrocoel roof plate at the beginning of neurulation. Accordingly, fluid-flow across the gastrocoel roof plate is likely the mechanism of left-right asymmetry patterning in these frogs, as in X. laevis and other vertebrates.

A key feature of this pathway, shared by embryos of all non-avian vertebrate classes analyzed to date (e.g. fish, amphibia and mammals) is the formation of a transitory midline epithelial structure. Remarkably, the motility of cilia projecting from this epithelium produce a leftward-directed movement of extracellular liquid. This leftward flow precedes any sign of asymmetry in gene expression. Numerous analyses have shown that this leftward flow is not only necessary, but indeed sufficient to direct laterality. Interestingly, however, cilia-independent mechanisms acting much earlier in development in the frog Xenopus have been reported during the earliest cleavage stages, a period before any major zygotic gene transcription. The relationship between these two distinct mechanisms is not understood. In this review we present the conserved and critical steps of Xenopus LR axis formation. Next, we address the basic question of how an early asymmetric activity might contribute to, feed into, or regulate the conserved cilia-dependent pathway. Finally, we discuss the possibility that Spemann's organizer is itself polarized in the left\u2013right dimension. In attempting to reconcile the sufficiency of the cilia-dependent pathway with potential earlier-acting asymmetries, we offer a general practical experimental checklist for the Xenopus community working on the process of left\u2013right determination.

In this study, we hypothesized that the primary cilia of SCs are the regulators of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling-mediated myelination. To confirm our hypothesis, we used mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG)/SC co-cultures, wherein the behavior of SCs could be analyzed by maintaining the interaction of SCs with DRG neurons. Under these conditions, SCs had primary cilia, and Hh signaling molecules accumulated on the primary cilia. When the SCs were stimulated by the addition of desert hedgehog or smoothened agonist, formation of myelin segments on the DRG axons was facilitated. On the contrary, upon administration of cyclopamine, an inhibitor of Hh signaling, myelin segments became comparable to those of controls. Of note, the ratio of SCs harboring primary cilium reached the highest point during the early phase of myelination. Furthermore, the strongest effects of Hh on myelination were encountered during the same stage. These results collectively indicate that Hh signaling regulates myelin formation through primary cilia in the PNS.",

     "abstract": "Loss of cilia and ciliary protein causes various abnormalities (called ciliopathy), including situs inversus, renal cystic diseases, polydactyly and dysgenesis of the nervous system. Renal cystic diseases are the most frequently observed symptoms in ciliopathies. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles with the following regions: a ciliary tip, shaft, transitional zone and basal body/mother centriole. Joubert syndrome (JBTS), Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Nephronophthisis (NPHP) are overlapping syndromes. Recent studies show that JBST and MKS responsible gene products are localized in the transitional zone of the cilia, where they function as a diffusion barrier, and control protein sorting and ciliary membrane composition. Nephrocystins are gene products of NPHP responsible genes, and at least 11 genes have been identified. Although some nephrocystins interact with JBST and MKS proteins, proteomic analysis suggests that they do not form a single complex. Localization analysis reveals that nephrocystins can be divided into two groups. Group I nephrocystins are localized in the transitional zone, whereas group II nephrocystins are localized in the Inv compartment. Homologs of group I nephrocystins, but not group II nephrocystins, have been reported in C. reinhardtii and C. elegans. In this review, we summarize the structure of the ciliary base of C. reinhardtii, C. elegans and mammalian primary cilia, and discuss function of nephrocystins. We also propose a new classification of nephrocystins.",

     "abstract": "We recently identified Flattop (Fltp; 1700009p17Rik) in a screen for potential Foxa2 target and novel mouse organizer genes. Besides its expression in the embryonic node, we found that Fltp is active in other monociliated tissues such as the sensory organs of the inner ear, duct and islets of the pancreas as well as in testis. Additionally, Fltp mRNA is expressed in multiciliated epithelial cells of the lung and of the choroid plexi in the brain. To genetically lineage trace these cells during development and injury as well as to conditionally inactivate genes in these tissues, we generated a Cre recombinase knock-in mouse line using the Fltp gene locus. By homologous recombination we have fused the Fltp open-reading frame to a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag followed by an intervening viral T2A sequence for co-translational cleavage and an improved Cre recombinase (iCre). This strategy allows both the analysis of the tagged Fltp-TAP-T2A protein and the usage of the iCre recombinase for conditional targeting approaches. Using the ROSA26 reporter mouse line we show that FltpT2AiCre is first active in the monociliated cells of the node, notochord, floorplate and prechordal plate, consistent with the Fltp-TAP-T2A protein production in the node progenitor cells. Furthermore iCre recombinase activity is detected in multiciliated tissues such as choroid plexi of the brain and epithelial cells of the lung with the onset at E10.5 and E13.5, respectively. In the pancreas, \u03b2-galactosidase activity is seen in the monociliated cells of the pancreatic duct and islet of Langerhans. Intercrossing FltpT2AiCre mice with the CAG-CAT-EGFP reporter mouse line further confirms iCre activity in multiciliated cells of the lung and brain on a cellular level. Thus, the FltpT2AiCre line is a powerful tool to conditionally inactivate genes in distinct mono- and multiciliated tissues and to analyze the tagged Fltp protein in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Dental follicle is a loose connective tissue that surrounds the developing tooth. Dental follicle cells (DFCs) have a promising potential for tissue engineering applications including periodontal and bone regeneration. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying osteogenic differentiation. In a previous study we detected that more than 35% of genes that are regulated during osteogenic differentiation of DFCs have promoter binding sites for the transcription factors TP53 and SP1. However, the role of these transcription factors in dental stem cells is still unknown. We hypothesize that both factors influence the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation in dental stem cells. Therefore, we transiently transfected DFCs and dental pulp stem cells (SHED; Stem cells from human exfoliated decidiuous teeth) with expression vectors for these transcription factors. After overexpression of SP1 and TP53, SP1 influenced cell proliferation and TP53 osteogenic differentiation in both dental cell types. The effects on cell proliferation and differentiation were less pronounced after siRNA mediated silencing of TP53 and SP1. This indicates that the effects we observed after TP53 and SP1 overexpression are indirect and subject of complex regulation. Interestingly, upregulated biological processes in DFCs after TP53-overexpression resemble the downregulated biological processes in SHED after SP1-overexpression. Here, regulated processes are involved in cell motility, wound healing and programmed cell death. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that SP1 and TP53 influence cell proliferation and differentiation and similar biological processes in both SHED and DFCs.",

It has been well defined that SCF and G-CSF contribute to regulation of lineage commitment for HSCs. However, little is known about whether SCF and G-CSF play roles in the determination and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Here we demonstrate the novel function of SCF and G-CSF in controlling cell cycle and cell fate determination of NSCs. We also observe that SCF and G-CSF promote neuronal differentiation and inhibit astroglial differentiation at the early stage of differentiation. In addition, our research data reveal that SCF in combination with G-CSF has a dual function in promoting cell cycle exit and directing neuronal fate commitment at the stage of NSC dividing. This coordination effect of SCF+G-CSF on cell cycle arrest and neuronal differentiation is through enhancing neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) activity. These findings extend current knowledge regarding the role of SCF and G-CSF in the regulation of neurogenesis and provide insights into the contribution of hematopoietic growth factors to brain development and remodeling.",

     "abstract": "The timing of when the embryonic left\u2212right (LR) axis is first established and the mechanisms driving this process are subjects of strong debate. While groups have focused on the role of cilia in establishing the LR axis during gastrula and neurula stages, many animals appear to orient the LR axis prior to the appearance of, or without the benefit of, motile cilia. Because of the large amount of data available in the published literature and the similarities in the type of data collected across laboratories, I have examined relationships between the studies that do and do not implicate cilia, the choice of animal model, the kinds of LR patterning defects observed, and the penetrance of LR phenotypes. I found that treatments affecting cilia structure and motility had a higher penetrance for both altered gene expression and improper organ placement compared to treatments that affect processes in early cleavage stage embryos. I also found differences in penetrance that could be attributed to the animal models used; the mouse is highly prone to LR randomization. Additionally, the data were examined to address whether gene expression can be used to predict randomized organ placement. Using regression analysis, gene expression was found to be predictive of organ placement in frogs, but much less so in the other animals examined. Together, these results challenge previous ideas about the conservation of LR mechanisms, with the mouse model being significantly different from fish, frogs, and chick in almost every aspect examined. Additionally, this analysis indicates that there may be missing pieces in the molecular pathways that dictate how genetic information becomes organ positional information in vertebrates; these gaps will be important for future studies to identify, as LR asymmetry is not only a fundamentally fascinating aspect of development but also of considerable biomedical importance.",

     "abstract": "Neph3 (filtrin) is a membrane protein expressed in the glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), but its role in the glomerulus is still largely unknown. To characterize the function of Neph3 in the glomerulus, we employed the zebrafish as a model system. Here we show that the expression of neph3 in pronephros starts before the onset of nephrin and podocin expression, peaks when the nephron primordium differentiates into glomerulus and tubulus, and is then downregulated upon glomerular maturation. By histology, we found that neph3 is specifically expressed in pronephric podocytes at 36\u00a0hpf. Furthermore, disruption of neph3 expression by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides results in distorted body curvature and transient pericardial edema, the latter likely reflecting perturbation of glomerular osmoregulatory function. Histological analysis of neph3 morphants reveals altered glomerular morphology and dilated pronephric tubules. The phenotype of neph3 morphants, curved body and pericardial edema, is rescued by wild-type zebrafish neph3 mRNA. In addition to glomerulus, neph3 is highly expressed in the developing brain and specific regions of mature midbrain and hindbrain. In line with this, neph3 morphants show aberrant brain morphology. Collectively, the expression of neph3 in glomerulus and brain together with the morphant phenotype imply that neph3 is a pleiotropic gene active during distinct stages of tissue differentiation and associates directly in the regulation of both glomerular and neural development.",

     "abstract": "Granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promotes the growth, survival, differentiation and activation of normal myeloid cells and is essential for fully functional macrophage differentiation in vivo. To better understand the mechanisms by which growth factors control the balance between proliferation and self-renewal versus growth-suppression and differentiation we have used the bi-potent FDB1 myeloid cell line, which proliferates in IL-3 and differentiates to granulocytes and macrophages in response to GM-CSF. This provides a manipulable model in which to dissect the switch between growth and differentiation. We show that, in the context of signaling from an activating mutant of the GM-CSF receptor \u03b2 subunit, a single intracellular tyrosine residue (Y577) mediates the granulocyte fate decision. Loss of granulocyte differentiation in a Y577F second-site mutant is accompanied by enhanced macrophage differentiation and accumulation of \u03b2-catenin together with activation of Tcf4 and other Wnt target genes. These include the known macrophage lineage inducer, Egr1. We show that forced expression of Tcf4 or a stabilised \u03b2-catenin mutant is sufficient to promote macrophage differentiation in response to GM-CSF and that GM-CSF can regulate \u03b2-catenin stability, most likely via GSK3\u03b2. Consistent with this pathway being active in primary cells we show that inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 activity promotes the formation of macrophage colonies at the expense of granulocyte colonies in response to GM-CSF. This study therefore identifies a novel pathway through which growth factor receptor signaling can interact with transcriptional regulators to influence lineage choice during myeloid differentiation.",

Immunoblot analysis revealed early (1\u00a0h) activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2, and progressive activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p38MAPK and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) during 72\u00a0h of isoproterenol treatment. Expression of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) of the \u03b22, but not \u03b21, subtype increased over time in parallel with increases in the proliferation marker PCNA and parotid gland weight. Levels of \u03b22-AR mRNA, assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis, were upregulated in parotid glands of isoproterenol treated rats. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a positive regulator of \u03b22-AR transcription, was activated at 1\u00a0h after isoproterenol administration, as evidenced by increased nuclear translocation and DNA binding using immunohistochemical staining and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ELISA of NF-\u03baB, also a \u03b22-AR transcriptional regulator, revealed an increase in p65 and p50 subunits in nuclear protein extracts from parotid glands of isoproterenol treated rats. Together, these results demonstrate that \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation activates diverse cell survival and progrowth signaling pathways, including cAMP and EGFR linked activation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and p70S6K, and also induction of \u03b22-ARs, possibly mediated by CREB and NF-\u03baB, resulting in salivary gland enlargement. We propose that during isoproterenol treatment activation of the \u03b21-AR, the predominant \u03b2-AR subtype in unstimulated salivary glands, initiates proliferative signaling cascades, and that upregulation of the \u03b22-AR plays an essential role in later stages of salivary gland growth.",

However, despite advances in culture techniques, hES cells require supplementation with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), an exogenous stemness factor, which is needed to sustain the authentic undifferentiated status. We developed a new culture system for hES cells; this system does not require supplementation with FGF-2 to obtain hES cells that are suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This culture system employed mesenchymal stem cells derived from hES cells (hESC-MSCs) as autologous human feeder cells in the absence of FGF-2. The hES cell line SNUhES3 cultured in this new autologous feeder culture system maintained the typical morphology of hES cells and expression of pluripotency-related proteins, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, OCT4, and alkaline phosphatase, without development of abnormal karyotypes after more than 30 passages. RNA expression of the pluripotency-related genes OCT4 and NANOG was similar to the expression in SNUhES3 cells maintained on xenofeeder STO cells. To identify the mechanism that enables the cells to be maintained without exogenous FGF-2, we checked the secretion of FGF-2 from the mitomycin-C treated autofeeder hESC-MSCs versus xenofeeder STO cells, and confirmed that hESC-MSCs secreted FGF-2 whereas STO cells did not. The level of FGF-2 in the media from the autofeeder system without exogenous FGF-2 was comparable to that from the xenofeeder system with addition of FGF-2. In conclusion, our new culture system for hES cells, which employs a feeder layer of autologous hESC-MSCs, supplies sufficient amounts of secreted FGF-2 to eliminate the requirement for exogenous FGF-2.",

Studies of morbid anatomy, clinical observations and contemporary cellular biology have contributed to an evolving interpretation of the causality of the disease.

Age, hormones and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interactions are all contributing factors to the pathogenesis of BPH. Control of the microenvironment in normal and abnormal growth is a multifactorial process.

While the precise molecular etiology remains unclear, sex steroids have been implicated in the development and maintenance of BPH. Sufficient data exists linking androgens and androgen receptor pathways to BPH and use of androgen reducing compounds, such as 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors which block the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, are a component of the standard of care for men with LUTS attributed to an enlarged prostate. However, BPH is a multifactorial disease and not all men respond well to currently available treatments, suggesting factors other than androgens are involved. Testosterone, the primary circulating androgen in men, can also be metabolized via CYP19/aromatase into the potent estrogen, estradiol-17\u03b2. The prostate is an estrogen target tissue and estrogens directly and indirectly affect growth and differentiation of prostate. The precise role of endogenous and exogenous estrogens in directly affecting prostate growth and differentiation in the context of BPH is an understudied area. Estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been shown to promote or inhibit prostate proliferation signifying potential roles in BPH. Recent research has demonstrated that estrogen receptor signaling pathways may be important in the development and maintenance of BPH and LUTS; however, new models are needed to genetically dissect estrogen regulated molecular mechanisms involved in BPH. More work is needed to identify estrogens and associated signaling pathways in BPH in order to target BPH with dietary and therapeutic SERMs.",

     "abstract": "The human prostate gland is one of the only internal organs that continue to enlarge throughout adulthood. The specific mechanisms that regulate this growth, as well as the pathological changes leading to the phenotype observed in the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), are essentially unknown. Recent studies and their associated findings have made clear that many complex alterations occur, involving persistent and chronic inflammation, circulating hormonal level deregulation, and aberrant wound repair processes. BPH has been etiologically characterized as a progressive, albeit discontinuous, hyperplasia of both the glandular epithelial and the stromal cell compartments coordinately yielding an expansion of the prostate gland and clinical symptoms. Interestingly, the inflammatory and repair responses observed in BPH are also key components of general wound repair in post-natal tissues. These responses include altered expression of chemokines, cytokines, matrix remodeling factors, chronic inflammatory processes, altered immune surveillance and recognition, as well as the formation of a prototypical \u2018reactive\u2019 stroma, which is similar to that observed across various fibroplasias and malignancies of a variety of tissue sites.

Thus, the functional biology of a reactive stroma, within the context of an adult disease typified by epithelial and stromal aberrant hyperplasia, is critical to understand within the context of prostate disease and beyond. The mechanisms that regulate reactive stroma biology in BPH represent targets of opportunity for new therapeutic approaches that may extend to other tissue contexts. Accordingly, this review seeks to address the dissection of important factors, signaling pathways, genes, and other regulatory components that mediate the interplay between epithelium and stromal responses in BPH.",

The purpose of this review is to consider the ways in which inflammatory cytokines belonging to the interleukin family, members of the IFG family, and stem cells may contribute to the development and progression of BPH-LUTS. This might occur in three mechanisms: One, interleukin signaling, IFG signaling and stem cells may contribute to reactivation of developmental growth mechanisms in the adult prostate leading to tissue growth. Two, given that epidemiologic studies indicate an increased incidence of BPH-LUTS in association with obesity and diabetes, IFG signaling may provide the mechanistic basis for the effect of diabetes and obesity on prostate growth. Three, expression of interleukins in association with inflammation in the prostate may induce sensitization of afferent fibers innervating the prostate and result in increased sensitivity to pain and noxious sensations in the prostate and bladder and heightened sensitivity to bladder filling.",

Patients suffering from benign prostatic symptoms report a substantially reduced quality of life, and the relationship between benign prostate conditions and prostate cancer is uncertain. Epidemiologic data for BPH and CP/CPPS are limited, however an apparent association between BPH symptoms and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been consistently reported. The prostate synthesizes and stores large amounts of cholesterol and prostate tissues may be particularly sensitive to perturbations in cholesterol metabolism. Hypercholesterolemia, a major risk factor for CVD, is also a risk factor for BPH. Animal model and clinical trial findings suggest that agents that inhibit cholesterol absorption from the intestine, such as the class of compounds known as polyene macrolides, can reduce prostate gland size and improve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Observational studies indicate that cholesterol-lowering drugs reduce the risk of aggressive prostate cancer, while prostate cancer cell growth and survival pathways depend in part on cholesterol-sensitive biochemical mechanisms. Here we review the evidence that cholesterol metabolism plays a role in the incidence of benign prostate disease and we highlight possible therapeutic approaches based on this concept.",

     "abstract": "A wealth of published studies indicate that a variety of chemokines are actively secreted by the prostatic microenvironment consequent to disruptions in normal tissue homeostasis due to the aging process or inflammatory responses. The accumulation of senescent stromal fibroblasts, and, possibly, epithelial cells, may serve as potential driving forces behind chemokine secretion in the aging and enlarged human prostate. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and histological inflammation may also potentially serve as rich sources of chemokine secretion in the prostate. Once bound to their cognate receptors, chemokines can stimulate powerful pro-proliferation signal transduction pathways and thus function as potent growth factors in the development and progression of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). These functions have been amply demonstrated experimentally and particularly point to robust Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, as well as global transcriptional responses, which mediate chemokine-stimulated cellular proliferative responses. A small body of literature also suggests that chemokine-mediated angiogenesis may comprise a contributing factor to BPH/LUTS development and progression. Thus, the observed low-level secretion of multiple chemokines within the aging prostatic microenvironment may promote a concomitant low-level, but cumulative, over-proliferation of both stromal fibroblastic and epithelial cell types associated with increased prostatic volume. Though the accumulated evidence is far from complete and suffers from some rather extensive gaps in knowledge, it argues favorably for the conclusion that chemokines can, and likely do, promote prostatic enlargement and the associated lower urinary tract symptoms, and justifies further investigations examining chemokines as potential therapeutic targets to delay or ablate BPH/LUTS initiation and progression.",

     "abstract": "Diabetes significantly increases the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The major endocrine aberration in connection with the metabolic syndrome is hyperinsulinemia. Insulin is an independent risk factor and a promoter of BPH. Insulin resistance may change the risk of BPH through several biological pathways. Hyperinsulinemia stimulates the liver to produce more insulin-like growth factor (IGF), another mitogen and an anti-apoptotic agent which binds insulin receptor/IGF receptor and stimulates prostate growth. The levels of IGFs and IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in prostate tissue and in blood are associated with BPH risk, with the regulation of circulating androgen and growth hormone. Stromal\u2013epithelial interactions play a critical role in the development and growth of the prostate gland and BPH. Previously, we have shown that the expression of c-Jun in the fibroblastic stroma can promote secretion of IGF-I, which stimulates prostate epithelial cell proliferation through activating specific target genes. Here, we will review the epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular findings which have evaluated the relation between diabetes and development of BPH.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, the female reproductive tract (FRT) develops from a pair of paramesonephric or M\u00fcllerian ducts (MDs), which arise from coelomic epithelial cells of mesodermal origin. During development, the MDs undergo a dynamic morphogenetic transformation from simple tubes consisting of homogeneous epithelium and surrounding mesenchyme into several distinct organs namely the oviduct, uterus, cervix and vagina. Following the formation of anatomically distinctive organs, the uniform MD epithelium (MDE) differentiates into diverse epithelial cell types with unique morphology and functions in each organ. Classic tissue recombination studies, in which the epithelium and mesenchyme isolated from the newborn mouse FRT were recombined, have established that the organ specific epithelial cell fate of MDE is dictated by the underlying mesenchyme. The tissue recombination studies have also demonstrated that there is a narrow developmental window for the epithelial cell fate determination in MD-derived organs. Accordingly, the developmental plasticity of epithelial cells is mostly lost in mature FRT. If the signaling that controls epithelial differentiation is disrupted at the critical developmental stage, the cell fate of MD-derived epithelial tissues will be permanently altered and can result in epithelial lesions in adult life. A disruption of signaling that maintains epithelial cell fate can also cause epithelial lesions in the FRT. In this review, the pathogenesis of cervical/vaginal adenoses and uterine squamous metaplasia is discussed as examples of such incidences.",

In the poultry industry, broilers are genetically selected for greater pectoral but not leg muscularity yield leading to leg disorders and thereby welfare issues. It is known that the pectoralis major of broilers contains more muscle fibres of larger diameters than egg-layers but little is known about the leg gastrocnemius muscle cellular characteristics. As muscle fibre numbers are set by hatch, the molecular regulation of myogenesis was investigated in pectoral (selected) and gastrocnemius (unselected) muscles of chick embryos to help explain diverging post-hatch phenotypes. Results showed that broilers were more active from embryonic day (ED) 8 and heavier from ED12 to 18 than layers. The pectoral muscle of broilers exhibited increased myoblast proliferation on ED15 (raised myonuclei, MyoD and PCNA) followed by increased differentiation from ED16 (raised myogenin, IGF-I) leading to increased muscle fibre hyperplasia and mass by ED18 compared to layers. In the gastrocnemius muscle of broilers, cell proliferation was also raised up to ED15 accompanied by increased PCNA, MyoD and IGF-I mRNAs. However, from ED16, myogenin and IGF-I mRNAs were similar to that of layers and PCNA was reduced leading to similar fibre area, nuclei numbers and muscle mass at ED18. We conclude that genetic selection for enhanced post-hatch pectoral muscle growth has altered the temporal expression of IGF-I and thereby myogenin transcription affecting cellular characteristics and mass by hatch in a muscle specific manner. These observations should help develop intervention strategies aimed at improving leg muscle strength and thereby animal welfare to meet growing consumer demand.",

A preliminary investigation of the typical stem cell phenotypes revealed that CD44 expression decreased remarkably as the passage number of the ADSCs increased. Further examinations revealed that the higher the cell passage number, the lower the cell proliferation capability, differentiation potency, and expression of stem cell transcriptional factors and cell cycle regulators such as cyclins E, A, B, CDK2, and CDK1/CDC2. To verify if the observed changes in differentiation potency according to the number of cell divisions were related to cell cycle regulators, p3 ADSCs were treated with the selective CDK2 and CDK1/CDC2 inhibitor Purvalanol A. Inhibitor treatment of p3 ADSCs induced changes in the morphology, differentiation potency, and pattern of stem cell transcriptional factor expression so that these low passage ADSCs more closely resembled high-passage ADSCs.

When mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted into the injured tibialis anterior muscles, they differentiated into skeletal muscle cells in vivo.

     "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells are pluripotent precursor cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes and myocytes. Despite their important therapeutic potential little is known about the transcriptional cascades that govern lineage decisions in these cells. Treatment of C3H10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells with retinoic acid (RA) inhibits adipogenesis and enhances osteoblastogenesis. In particular, RA treatment stimulates the expression of the osteoblast master regulator, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), whose expression is necessary for the formation of bone. We have shown previously in mesenchymal stem cells that RA acts to stimulate osteoblastogenesis by interfering with the actions of the bzip transcription factor CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein beta (C/EBP\u03b2), where it binds to a negative regulatory element within the Runx2 promoter and inhibits its expression. Herein we show that Smad3, whose expression is stimulated by RA, relays the effects of RA on differentiation by initiating the displacement of C/EBP\u03b2 from the Runx2 promoter. In addition to stimulating Smad3 expression, RA also stimulated the nuclear localization of this factor, such that in the absence of RA, ectopic Smad3 was unable to drive osteoblastogenesis. While not sufficient to promote osteoblastogenesis, knockdown of Smad3 using a specific shRNA prevented the RA-mediated stimulation of differentiation and displacement of C/EBP\u03b2 from the Runx2 P1 promoter. Taken together, these data indicate that Smad3 is an important mediator of RA activity during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and is necessary for the stimulation of osteoblastogenesis.",

Math6 is a closely related bHLH factor transiently activated downstream of Neurogenin3 in endocrine progenitors. Here we characterize the Math6 promoter and locate the Neurogenin3 binding site, thus confirming that Math6 is a genuine Neurogenin3 target. We also show that Math6 activation rates are largely controlled by epigenetic mechanisms involving the balance between activating H3K4 and repressive H3K27 methylation marks. High Math6 expression in the embryonic pancreas associates with an H3K4me3-only state, whereas low Math6 expression in differentiated endocrine cells correlates with chromatin dually marked with H3K4me3/H3K27me3, a feature originally associated with developmental genes that are repressed but poised for activation in ES cells. Importantly, we show that Neurogenin3 can trigger the conversion of Math6 from a poorly transcribed bivalent to an active monovalent state in vitro, hence providing a mechanism whereby Neurogenin3 may activate Math6 in endocrine progenitors. Finally, because Neurogenin3-induced changes in histone methylation are observed at other endocrine gene promoters, we propose that this mechanism may contribute to the determination of endocrine cell fate by Neurogenin3 in the pancreas.",

In this study, we isolated plastic-adherent cells from human term decidua vera, called decidua-derived-mesenchymal cells (DMCs), and compared their properties with those of bone marrow-derived-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). The DMCs strongly expressed the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin, but not cytokeratin 19 or HLA-G, and had a high proliferative potential. That is, they exhibited a typical fibroblast-like morphology for over 30 population doublings. Cells phenotypically identical to the DMCs were identified in the decidua vera, and genotyping confirmed that the DMCs were derived from the maternal components of the fetal adnexa. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the expression pattern of CD antigens on the DMCs was almost identical to that on BM-MSCs, but some DMCs expressed the CD45 antigen, and over 50% of them also expressed anti-fibroblast antigen. In vitro, the DMCs showed good differentiation into chondrocytes and moderate differentiation into adipocytes, but scant evidence of osteogenesis, compared with the BM-MSCs. Gene expression analysis showed that, compared with BM-MSCs, the DMCs expressed higher levels of TWIST2 and RUNX2 (which are associated with early mesenchymal development and/or proliferative capacity), several matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, 3, 10, and 12), and cytokines (BMP2 and TGFB2), and lower levels of MSX2, interleukin 26, and HGF. Although DMCs did not show the full multipotency of BM-MSCs, their higher proliferative ability indicates that their cultivation would require less maintenance. Furthermore, the use of DMCs avoids the ethical concerns associated with the use of embryonic tissues, because they are derived from the maternal portion of the placenta, which is otherwise discarded. Thus, the unique properties of DMCs give them several advantages for clinical use, making them an interesting and attractive alternative to MSCs for regenerative medicine.",

In this study, we explored the potential of iPS cells to differentiate into alveolar Type II (ATII)-like epithelial cells. Analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining showed that pulmonary surfactant proteins commonly expressed by ATII cells such as surfactant protein A (SPA), surfactant protein B (SPB), and surfactant protein C (SPC) were upregulated in the differentiated cells. Microphilopodia characteristics and lamellar bodies were observed by transmission electron microscopy and lipid deposits were verified by Nile Red and Periodic Acid Schiff staining. C3 complement protein, a specific feature of ATII cells, was present at high levels in culture supernatants demonstrating functionality of these cells in culture. These data show that the differentiated cells generated from iPS cells using a culture method developed previously (Rippon et al., 2006) are ATII-like cells.To further characterize these ATII-like cells, we tested whether they could undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by exposure to drugs that induce lung fibrosis in mice, such as bleomycin, and the combination of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFb1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). When the ATII-like cells were exposed to either bleomycin or a TGFb1\u2013EGF cocktail, they underwent phenotypic changes including acquisition of a mesenchymal/fibroblastic morphology, upregulation of mesenchymal markers (Col1, Vim, a-Sma, and S100A4), and downregulation of surfactant proteins and E-cadherin.We have shown that ATII-like cells can be derived from skin fibroblasts and that they respond to fibrotic stimuli. These cells provide a valuable tool for screening of agents that can potentially ameliorate or prevent diseases involving lung fibrosis.",

While the requirement of FGF in Nodal/activin-induced mesoderm formation has been reported, the fate of the tissue modulated by these signals is not fully understood. Here, we examined the fate of tissues when exogenous activin was added and FGF signaling was inhibited in animal cap explants of Xenopus embryos. Activin-induced dorsal mesoderm was converted to ventral mesoderm by inhibition of FGF signaling. We also found that inhibiting FGF signaling in the dorsal marginal zone, in vegetal-animal cap conjugates or in the presence of the activin signaling component Smad2, converted dorsal mesoderm to ventral mesoderm. The expression and promoter activities of a BMP responsive molecule, PV.1 and a Spemann organizer, noggin, were investigated while FGF signaling was inhibited. PV.1 expression increased, while noggin decreased. In addition, inhibiting BMP-4 signaling abolished ventral mesoderm formation induced by exogenous activin and FGF inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of dorso-ventral mesoderm in early Xenopus embryos is regulated by a combination of FGF, activin and BMP signaling.",

     "abstract": "The translation initiation factor eif6 has been implicated as a regulator of ribosome assembly, selective mRNA translation and apoptosis. Many of these activities depend upon the phosphorylation of eif6 serine 235 by PKC. Previous data showed that eif6 binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit when unphosphorylated, inhibiting assembly with the 40S subunit. Phosphorylation of Ser235 releases eif6 from the 60S subunit and allows assembly. eif6 acts as an anti-apoptotic factor via regulation of the bcl2/bax balance and acts selectively upstream of bcl2. This activity also depends upon phosphorylation of eif6 Ser235. One of the consequences of eif6 overexpression in Xenopus embryos is aberrant eye development. Here we evaluate the eye phenotype and show that it is transient. We show that the whole eye, particularly the retina layers, of the embryos injected with eif6-encoding mRNA recover by stage 42. Embryos over-expressing eif6 have normal expression of anterior- and brain-specific markers, indicating that outside the eye field, other neural regions appear unaffected by the eif6 injection. No eye defect was detected when morpholinos were used to reduce eif6 protein synthesis. We tested how two known pathways of eif6 function with respect to alteration of eye development. We found that injection of bcl2 did not produce the eye phenotype and eif6-bax co-injection did not rescue the eye defect, suggesting that the eye phenotype is not bearing on the anti-apoptotic role played by eif6 is not linked to its role as an anti-apoptotic factor. We also determined that PKC-dependant phosphorylation of Ser235 in eif6 is not required to produce defective eye development. These results indicate that the aberrant eye phenotype, produced by eif6 overexpression, is not directly linked to the PKC-regulated effects of eif6 on translation and ribosomal subunit interaction or on eif6 anti-apoptotic properties.",

However, overexpression of DNMT1 is lethal, making it difficult to assess the direct effect of high levels of DNMT1 on neuronal development in vivo. We therefore used Dnmt1tet/tet mouse ES cells that overexpress DNMT1 as an in vitro model to investigate the impact of high levels of DNMT1 on neuronal differentiation. Although there is down-regulation of DNMT1 during early stages of differentiation in wild type and Dnmt1tet/tet ES cell lines, neurons derived from Dnmt1tet/tet cells showed abnormal dendritic arborization and branching. The Dnmt1tet/tet neuronal cells also showed elevated levels of functional N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a feature also reported in some neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Considering the roles of reelin and GAD67 in neuronal networking and excitatory/inhibitory balance, respectively, we studied methylation of these genes' promoters in Dnmt1tet/tet ES cells and neurons. Both reelin and GAD67 promoters were not hypermethylated in the Dnmt1tet/tet ES cells and neurons, suggesting that overexpression of DNMT1 may not directly result in methylation-mediated repression of these two genes. Taken together, our results suggest that overexpression of DNMT1 in ES cells results in an epigenetic change prior to the onset of differentiation. This epigenetic change in turn results in abnormal neuronal differentiation and upregulation of functional NMDA receptor.",

In the present study, we examined the expression of SRY and SOX9 proteins in the B6.YTIR gonad, which undergoes partial or complete sex reversal. The results show that the ontogeny of SRY expression in the B6.YTIR gonad was comparable with that in the B6.XY gonad. On the other hand, while SOX9 expression immediately followed SRY expression in the B6.XY gonad, it was considerably delayed compared to SRY expression in the B6.YTIR gonad or SOX9 expression in the B6.XY gonad. Although SOX9 expression reached the entire gonad at a time point, it was downregulated and became restricted to the central area in which testis cords were organized. MIS, a marker of Sertoli cells, appeared only in well-organized testis cords.

To investigate factors controlling vaginal epithelial cell differentiation from a single layer of pseudostratified epithelium to a multi-layered stratified epithelium with keratin, we focused on fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs). Transformation related protein 63 (Trp63) expression, a marker of stratified epithelium, increased in the M\u00fcllerian vaginal epithelial cells from days 0 to 5, and keratin 14 (Krt14) was expressed from day 5, suggesting that Trp63-negative vaginal epithelial cells can differentiate into Trp63-positive cells after birth. Fgf7 and Fgf10 were localized in the vaginal stroma but their receptor, Fgf receptor 2IIIb (Fgfr2IIIb), was localized in the vaginal epithelium. Both Fgf9 and its receptor, Fgfr2IIIc, were localized in the vaginal epithelium. Vaginae cultured with FGF10 or anti-FGF9 antibody showed stratified epithelium with an intense Krt14 expression; however, an inhibitor of phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3 (MAPK1/3) canceled the effect of FGF10 and anti-FGF9 antibody. Thus, Fgf10 stimulates the differentiation of pseudostratified epithelial cells into stratified cells via MAPK1/3 pathway, and Fgf9 inhibits this differentiation in the neonatal mouse vagina.",

This study aimed to determine the (1) Sertoli cell maturation state, (2) time of occurrence and (3) composition, differentiation and fate of clustered cells in knockout mice. Using immunohistochemistry connexin 43 deficient Sertoli cells showed an accurate start of the mature markers androgen receptor and GATA-1 during puberty and a vimentin expression from neonatal to adult. Expression of anti-Muellerian hormone, as a marker of Sertoli cell immaturity, was finally down-regulated during puberty, but its disappearance was delayed. This observed extended anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone synthesis during puberty was confirmed by western blot and Real-Time PCR and suggests a partial alteration in the Sertoli cell differentiation program. Additionally, Sertoli cells of adult knockouts showed a permanent and uniform expression of GATA-1 at protein and mRNA level, maybe caused by the lack of maturing germ cells and missing negative feedback signals. At ultrastructural level, basally located adult Sertoli cells obtained their mature appearance, demonstrated by the tripartite nucleolus as a typical feature of differentiated Sertoli cells. Intratubular clustered cells were mainly formed by abnormal Sertoli cells and single attached apoptotic germ cells, verified by immunohistochemistry, TUNEL staining and transmission electron microscopy. Clusters first appeared during puberty and became more numerous in adulthood with increasing cell numbers per cluster suggesting an age-related process. In conclusion, adult connexin 43 deficient Sertoli cells seem to proliferate while maintaining expression of mature markers and their adult morphology, indicating a unique and abnormal intermediate phenotype with characteristics common to both undifferentiated and differentiated Sertoli cells.",

     "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon guiding the allele-specific marking of parental alleles. Genes regulated by imprinting are only or preferentially expressed from a single allele during development and in the adult, and the transcriptional activity of each allele is dictated by its parental origin. Consequently, active and repressed alleles of imprinted genes are marked by activating and repressive histone marks, respectively. Whether these marks are implicated in the germline imprints distinguishing maternal and paternal alleles at fertilization or indeed in the mitotic inheritance of the two transcriptional states is currently unknown. The only epigenetic modification which is known to fulfill these roles is DNA methylation. Most but not all imprinted genes are marked by regions of allele-specific DNA methylation termed differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Whereas some DMRs, the gametic DMRs, are directly inherited from the mature gametes at fertilization, others, the somatic DMRs, are only acquired in postimplantation embryos. Although all somatic imprints are thought to emerge as a consequence of the cis-activity of a nearby gametic imprint, the molecular mechanisms guiding the de novo methylation at somatic DMRs are not fully understood. Here we review the known characteristics of gametic and somatic DMRs, with an emphasis on the factors implicated in the initiation and maintenance of these epigenetic marks. The analysis of somatic DMRs offers the opportunity to study the mechanism of de novo DNA methylation outside the context of the germline and as such might help to elucidate common mechanisms implicated in epigenetic silencing during development and differentiation. Moreover, studies on genes directly silenced by somatic DMRs may be informative in understanding the significance of controlling gene dosage in the adult.",

     "abstract": "Organogenesis involves a series of dynamic morphogenesis and remodeling processes. Since feathers exhibit complex forms, we have been using the feather as a model to analyze how molecular pathways and cellular events are used. While several major molecular pathways have been studied, the roles of matrix degrading proteases and inhibitors in feather morphogenesis are unknown. Here we addressed this knowledge gap by studying the temporal and spatial expression of proteases and inhibitors in developing feathers using mammalian antibodies that cross react with chicken proteins. We also investigated the effect of protease inhibitors on feather development employing an in vitro feather bud culture system. The results show that antibodies specific for mammalian MMP2 and TIMP2 stained positive in both feather epithelium and mesenchyme. The staining co-localized in structures of E10\u2013E13 developing feathers. Interestingly, MMP2 and TIMP2 exhibited a complementary staining pattern in developing E15 and E20 feathers and in maturing feather filaments. Although they exhibited a slight delay in feather bud development, similar patterns of MMP2 and TIMP2 staining were observed in in vitro culture explants. The broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitors AG3340 and BB103 (MMP inhibitors) but not Aprotinin (a plasmin inhibitor) showed a reversible effect on epithelium invagination and feather bud elongation. TIMP2, a physiological inhibitor to MMPs, exhibited a similar effect. Markers of feather morphogenesis showed that MMP activity was required for both epithelium invagination and mesenchymal cell proliferation. Inhibition of MMP activity led to an overall delay in the expression of molecules that regulate either early feather bud growth and/or differentiation and thereby produced abnormal buds with incomplete follicle formation. This work demonstrates that MMPs and their inhibitors are not only important in injury repair, but also in development tissue remodeling as demonstrated here for the formation of feather follicles.",

During malignancy or following brain injury, mature astrocytes have been reported to re-express neuronal genes and re-gain neurogenic potential to a certain degree, yet few studies have addressed the underlying mechanisms due to a limited number of cellular models or tools to probe this process. Here, we use a synthetic small-molecule (isoxazole) to demonstrate that highly malignant EGFRvIII-expressing Ink4a/Arf\u2212/\u2212; Pten\u2212/\u2212 astrocytes downregulated their astrocyte character, re-entered the cell cycle, and upregulated neuronal gene expression. As a collateral discovery, isoxazole small-molecules blocked tumor cell proliferation in vitro, a phenotype likely coupled to activation of neuronal gene expression. Similarly, histone deacetylase inhibitors induced neuronal gene expression and morphologic changes associated with the neuronal phenotype, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic-mediated gene activation. Our study assesses the contribution of specific genetic pathways underlying the de-differentiation potential of astrocytes and uncovers a novel pharmacological tool to explore astrocyte plasticity, which may bring insight to reprogramming and anti-tumor strategies.",

     "abstract": "Functional intestinal epithelium relies on complete polarization of enterocytes marked by the formation of microvilli and the accurate trafficking of glycoproteins to relevant membrane domains. Numerous transport pathways warrant the unique structural identity and protein/lipid composition of the brush border membrane. Annexin II (Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding protein) is an important component of one of the apical protein transport machineries, which involves detergent-resistant membranes and the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we investigate in intestinal Caco-2 cells the contribution of annexin II to the sorting and transport of brush border hydrolases and role in intestinal cell polarity. Downregulation of annexin II in Caco-2-A4 cell line results in a severe reduction of the levels of the brush border membrane resident enzyme sucrase isomaltase (SI) as well as structural components such as ezrin. This reduction is accompanied by a redistribution of these proteins to intracellular compartments and a striking morphological transition of Caco-2 cells to rudimentary epithelial cells that are characterized by an almost flat apical membrane with sparse and short microvilli. Concomitant with this alteration is the redistribution of the intermediate filament protein keratin 19 to the intracellular membranes in Caco-2-A4 cells. Interestingly, keratin 19 interacts with annexin II in wild type Caco-2 cells and this interaction occurs exclusively in lipid rafts. Our findings suggest a role for annexin II and K19 in differentiation and polarization of intestinal cells.",

Dietary l-arginine supplementation to gilts during early gestation has been proposed as a way to enhance fetal survival. This study aims to investigate the effects of variation in fetal growth within litters and dietary l-arginine treatment during early gestation in pregnant sows on expression levels of several genes involved in early adipose tissue development and lipid deposition in the fetuses. At day 75 of pregnancy, sows fed a standard gestation diet throughout pregnancy and sows fed 26\u00a0g l-arginine daily from days 14 to 28 of gestation in supplement to the standard diet were sacrificed. Six pairs of littermates in each dietary group with the smallest or the heaviest fetal weights within each litter were collected (total: 24 fetuses). Expression levels of DLK1/PREF1 and FZD7 were significantly greater in subcutaneous backfat of the smallest fetuses. Conversely, transcriptional adipogenic regulators PPARG, SREBP1, and CEBPA, and genes involved in terminal adipocytic differentiation LPL, ME1, and FABP4 were less expressed in those piglets. Fetal weight has no effect on expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA content in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Maternal dietary l-arginine treatment did not affect subcutaneous adipose tissue features in 75-day old fetuses. The gene expression changes observed in the smallest fetuses are likely associated to a lower body fat content at birth, and could predispose to catch-up fat growth during the postnatal period.",

Runx3 null mouse lung shows an abnormal phenotype and loss of Runx3 induced remodeling in the lung. Interestingly, lung adenocarcinoma is observed in Runx3 heterozygous mice at 18 months of age. During lung development various cellular and molecular events occur such as cell proliferation, cell death, differentiation and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT).

Excessive EMT was observed in lungs at PN1 day in Runx3 null mice and PN18 months in Runx3 heterozygous mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of EMT was used to curb tumor progression. In this study, U0126 was injected to pregnant mouse for inhibition of pERK signaling.

     "abstract": "From the point of view of regenerative potential, the most important cells are pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Such cells must fulfill certain in vitro as well as in vivo criteria that have been established by work with PSCs isolated from embryos, which are known as embryonic stem cells (ESCs). According to these criteria, pluripotent stem cells should: (i) give rise to cells from all three germ layers, (ii) complete blastocyst development, and (iii) form teratomas after inoculation into experimental animals. Unfortunately, in contrast to immortalized embryonic ESC lines or induced PSCs (iPSCs), these last two criteria have thus far not been obtained in a reproducible manner for any potential PSC candidates isolated from adult tissues. There are two possible explanations for this failure. The first is that PSCs isolated from adult tissues are not fully pluripotent; the second is that there are some physiological mechanisms involved in keeping these cells quiescent in adult tissues that preclude their \u201cunleashed proliferation\u201d, thereby avoiding the risk of teratoma formation. In this review we present an evidence that adult tissues contain remnants from development; a population of PSCs that is deposited in various organs as a backup for primitive stem cells, plays a role in rejuvenation of the pool of more differentiated tissue-committed stem cells (TCSCs), and is involved in organ regeneration. These cells share several markers with epiblast/germ line cells and have been named very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs). We suggest that, on one hand, VSELs maintain mammalian life span but, on the other hand, they may give rise to several malignancies if they mutate. We provide an evidence that the quiescent state of these cells in adult tissues, which prevents teratoma formation, is the result of epigenetic changes in some of the imprinted genes.",

Since it is discarded post-partum it may be useful for regenerative medicine and cell therapy. Amniotic membranes have already been used extensively as biologic dressings in ophthalmic, abdominal and plastic surgery. HAM contains two cell types, from different embryological origins, which display some characteristic properties of stem cells. Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from the embryonic ectoderm, while human amnion mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs) are derived from the embryonic mesoderm. Both populations have similar immunophenotype and multipotential for in vitro differentiation into the major mesodermal lineages, however they differ in cell yield.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major pro-angiogenic factor, whereas pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) is the most potent natural angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, the regulatory role of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) during angiogenesis was assessed by the endothelial differentiation potential, VEGF/PEDF production and responses to pro-angiogenic and hypoxic conditions. The in vivo regulation of blood vessel formation by BMSCs was also explored in a SCID mouse model. Results showed that PEDF was expressed more prominently in BMSCs compared to VEGF. This contrasted with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) where the expression of VEGF was higher than that of PEDF. The ratio of VEGF/PEDF gene expression in BMSCs increased when VEGF concentration reached 40\u00a0ng/ml in the culture medium, but decreased at 80\u00a0ng/ml. Under CoCl2-induced hypoxic conditions, the VEGF/PEDF ratio of BMSCs increased significantly in both normal and angiogenic culture media. There was no expression of endothelial cell markers in BMSCs cultured in either pro-angiogenic or hypoxia culture conditions when compared with HUVECs. The in vivo study showed that VEGF/PEDF expression closely correlated with the degree of neovascularization, and that hypoxia significantly induced pro-angiogenic activity in BMSCs. These results indicate that, rather than being progenitors of endothelial cells, BMSCs play an important role in regulating the neovascularization process, and that the ratio of VEGF and PEDF may, in effect, be an indicator of the pro- or anti-angiogenic activities of BMSCs.",

Using this method, we monitored proliferation and differentiation of H. virescens midgut cells cultured in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) or AlbuMAX II. Supplementation with FBS resulted in increased stem cell differentiation after 5 days of culture, while AlbuMAX II-supplemented medium promoted stem cell proliferation.

One of these genes, mkpB, additionally codes for a region similar to the Rhodanase domain, characteristic of animal MAP kinase-phosphatases, in its N-terminal region. Cells that over-express this gene show increased protein phosphatase activity. mkpB is expressed in D. discoideum ameba at growth but it is greatly induced at 12\u00a0h of multicellular development.

Cells that express a catalytically inactive mutant of MkpB grow and aggregate like wild-type cells but show a greatly impaired post-aggregative development. In addition, the expression of cell-type specific genes is very delayed, indicating that this protein plays an important role in cell differentiation and development.

The rate of cell proliferation in the ureteric epithelium and consequently the number of ureteric tips are reduced in the kidneys lacking Plexin B2 (Plxnb2\u2212/\u2212). Semaphorin 4C, a ligand for Plexin B2, stimulates branching of the ureteric epithelium in wild type and Plxnb2+/\u2212 kidney explants, but not in Plxnb2\u2212/\u2212 explants. As shown by co-immunoprecipitation Plexin B2 interacts with the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, the receptor of Glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), in embryonic kidneys. Isolated Plxnb2\u2212/\u2212 ureteric buds fail to respond to Gdnf by branching, but this response is rescued by Fibroblast growth factor 7 and Follistatin as well as by the metanephric mesenchyme.

The aim of this study was to use Cdx2-transgenic mice to investigate: (i) Sox2 expression in the intestinal metaplastic mucosa of the Cdx2-transgenic mouse stomach; and (ii) the relationship between Sox2 and Cdx2. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine Sox2, Cdx2, Muc5Ac, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression levels and single- or double-label immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the localization of Sox2, Cdx2, gastric mucin and alkaline phosphatase activity. We determined that Sox2 mRNA in the intestinal metaplastic mucosa of the Cdx2-transgenic mouse stomach was expressed 3.5-fold compared to the normal mouse stomach. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the same cells in the intestinal metaplastic mucosa expressed both Cdx2 and Sox2. Gastric mucin was not expressed while alkaline phosphatase activity was recognized in the intestinal metaplastic mucosa in spite of the Sox2 expression. Cdx2 increased the transcriptional activity of the Sox2 gene, and Sox2 increased the transcriptional activity of the Muc5Ac gene, which was reduced by cotransfecion of Cdx2 together with Sox2 in the human gastric carcinoma cell line AGS.

In cell culture, primary myoblast/myotube cultures, and mouse and human muscle sections, FRG1 showed distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations and nuclear shuttling assays indicated the subcellular pools of FRG1 are linked. During myoblast differentiation, FRG1\u2019s subcellular distribution changed dramatically with FRG1 eventually associating with the matured Z-discs. This Z-disc localization was confirmed using isolated mouse myofibers and found to be maintained in adult human skeletal muscle biopsies. Thus, FRG1 is not likely involved in the initial assembly and alignment of the Z-disc but may be involved in sarcomere maintenance or signaling. Further analysis of human tissue showed FRG1 is strongly expressed in arteries, veins, and capillaries, the other prominently affected tissue in FSHD. Overall, we show that in mammalian cells, FRG1 is a dynamic nuclear and cytoplasmic protein, however in muscle, FRG1 is also a developmentally regulated sarcomeric protein suggesting FRG1 may perform a muscle-specific function.

The pellet cultures of hMSCs in a chondrogenic medium were exposed to TGF-\u03b21 and TSA. Quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, Alcian blue staining, and immunohistochemistry staining were used to confirm and compare the differences in chondrogenesis by analyzing the mRNA of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, Aggrecan, and Col2A1), synthesis of chondrogenic proteins and type II collagen, respectively. TGF-\u03b21 signaling and its downstream targets were determined by western blot analysis. TGF-\u03b21 led to significant increases in chondrogenic gene expression and the synthesis of chondrogenic proteins. However, TSA significantly decreased chondrogenic gene expression and the synthesis of chondrogenic proteins in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-\u03b21 increased phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 and Sp1 expression around half an hour after induction. The increase of Sp1, but not Smad 2/3 activation was almost completely blocked by the addition of TSA. The chondrogenic effect of TGF-\u03b21 was also suppressed by the Sp1-binding inhibitor mithramycin A. Finally, overexpression of Sp1 abolished TSA-mediated inhibition of TGF-\u03b21-induced chondrogenesis. Our study showed that TSA inhibited chondrogenesis through inhibition of TGF-\u03b21-induced Sp1 expression. Furthermore, Sp1 could be a useful tool in future studies looking into biological mechanisms by which chondrogenesis of hMSCs can be augmented, especially in the area of clinical application.",

To date, the signal transduction events that induce CPEB activation remain somewhat unclear, however, XGef has been shown to be involved in this process. P42 MAPK (ERK2) activity and XRINGO accumulation are also required for the activating phosphorylation of CPEB. We show here that XGef activity influences the early meiotic function of XRINGO/CDK1, a novel component of the progesterone signaling pathway. An XGef-specific antibody depresses XRINGO-induced GVBD, whereas XGef overexpression accelerates this process. XGef and CPEB interact with XRINGO in immature and maturing oocyte extracts and XGef, XRINGO and ERK2 interact directly in vitro. These data suggest that an XGef/XRINGO/ERK2/CPEB complex forms in ovo during early meiotic resumption. Notably, specific inhibition of XRINGO/CDK1 activity in CPEB phosphorylation-competent extracts completely blocks phosphorylation of CPEB, which suggests that XRINGO/CDK1 directly phosphorylates CPEB. Finally, overexpression of XGef (65-360), which cannot bind CPEB or ERK2, but is capable of XRINGO association, blocks XRINGO-induced meiotic progression potentially through titration of endogenous XRINGO. Combined, our results suggest that XGef is involved in XRINGO/CDK1 mediated activation of CPEB and that an XGef/XRINGO/ERK2/CPEB complex forms in ovo to facilitate this process.",

We tested a two-step differentiation procedure in which ESCs were first cultured with activin A to favor formation of definitive endoderm, and then treated with fibroblast-conditioned medium with or without Wnt3A. The definitive endoderm expressed a number of genes associated with gut-tube development through mouse embryonic day 8.5 (Sox17, Foxa2, and Gata4 expressed and Id2 silent). The intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 gene was also activated in the endodermal cells, whereas the Msi1, Ephb2, and Dcamkl1 intestinal stem cell markers were not. Exposure of the endoderm to fibroblast-conditioned medium with Wnt3A resulted in the activation of Id2, the remaining intestinal stem cell markers and the later gut markers Cdx2, Fabp2, and Muc2. Interestingly, genes associated with distal gut-associated mesoderm (Foxf2, Hlx, and Hoxd8) were also simulated by Wnt3A. The two-step differentiation protocol generated gut bodies with crypt-like structures that included regions of Lgr5-expressing proliferating cells and regions of cell differentiation. These gut bodies also had a smooth muscle component and some underwent peristaltic movement. The ability of the definitive endoderm to differentiate into intestinal epithelium was supported by the vivo engraftment of these cells into mouse colonic mucosa. These findings demonstrate that definitive endoderm derived from ESCs can carry out intestinal cell differentiation pathways and may provide cells to restore damaged intestinal tissue.",

MiRNAs play an important role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of N-myc on miRNA expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. We performed a miRNA profiling study on SK-N-BE (2) cells, and determined differentially expressed miRNAs during differentiation initiated by MYCN knockdown, using anti-MYCN short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology.Microarray analyses revealed 23 miRNAs differentially expressed during the MYCN knockdown-mediated neuronal differentiation of MNA neuroblastoma cells. The expression changes were bidirectional, with 11 and 12 miRNAs being up- and down-regulated, respectively. Among the down-regulated miRNAs, we found several members of the mir-17 family of miRNAs. Mir-21, an established oncomir in a variety of cancer types, became strongly up-regulated upon MYCN knockdown and the subsequent differentiation.Neither overexpression of mir-21 in the high-MYCN neuroblastoma cells, nor repression of increased mir-21 levels during MYCN knockdown-mediated differentiation had any significant effects on cell differentiation or proliferation.We describe a subset of miRNAs that were altered during the N-myc deprived differentiation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells. In this context, N-myc acts as both an activator and suppressor of miRNA expression. Mir-21 was up-regulated during cell differentiation, but inhibition of mir-21 did not prevent this process.

The efficacy of pretreated MSCs was evaluated by preparing in-vivo mouse model with liver fibrosis by intraperitoneal administration of CCl4. Pretreated MSCs were transplanted in the left lateral lobe of mice with liver fibrosis and showed enhanced localization and differentiation abilities after 1 month. The expression for cytokeratin 8, 18, albumin and Bcl-xl was up-regulated and that of HGF, Bax and Caspase- 3 was down-regulated in animals transplanted with pretreated MSCs. Sirus red staining also confirmed a significant reduction in the fibrotic area in liver tissue transplanted with pretreated MSCs as compared to untreated MSCs and was concomitant with improved serum levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

Although much is known about pathogenic PrP conversion and its role in TSEs, the normal function of PrPC is poorly understood. Given the abundant expression of PrPC in the developing mammalian CNS and the spatial association with differentiated stages of neurogenesis, recently it has been proposed that PrPC participates in neural cell differentiation. In the present study, we investigated the role of PrPC in neural development during early embryogenesis. In bovine fetuses, PrPC was differentially expressed in the neuroepithelium, showing higher levels at the intermediate and marginal layers where more differentiated states of neurogenesis were located. We utilized differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to test whether PrPC contributed to the process of neural differentiation during early embryogenesis. PrPC showed increasing levels of expression starting on Day 9 until Day 18 of ES cell differentiation. PrPC expression was negatively correlated with pluripotency marker Oct-4 confirming that ES cells had indeed differentiated. Induction of ES cells differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) resulted in up-regulation of PrPC at Day 20 and nestin at Day 12. PrPC expression was knocked down in PrP-targeted siRNA ES cells between Days 12 and 20. PrPC knockdown in ES cells resulted in nestin reduction at Days 16 and 20. Analysis of bovine fetuses suggests the participation of PrPC in neural cell differentiation during early embryogenesis. The positive association between PrPC and nestin expression provide evidence for the contribution of PrPC to ES cell differentiation into neural progenitor cells.",

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are immature oligodendrocytes and can differentiate into myelin-forming cells of central nervous system under certain conditions. OPC transplantation is an attractive approach for the treatment of demyelinating diseases. In this study, we transplanted OPCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP-OPCs) into normal and injured rat spinal cords to evaluate the differentiation of transplanted OPCs in vivo. Unfortunately, the grafted GFP-OPCs, in spinal cord whether normal or injured, were all differentiated into astrocytes, but not oligodendrocytes. Our further study indicated that inflammatory environment might not be the key factor influencing the differentiation of OPCs. Some spinal cord components, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), were the major factors that induced OPCs to differentiate into astrocytes. The three types of BMP receptor (BMPRIA, IB and II) could all be detected in OPCs, and the astroglial differentiation of OPCs induced by spinal cord homogenate extract (SCHE) in vitro could be blocked partly by noggin, an antagonist of BMP. These results suggested that the BMPR signal transduction pathway might be one of the key factors which determine the differentiation direction of engrafted OPCs in spinal cord.",

Notch1, -2, as well as the Notch target gene Hes1 are expressed in the putative stem cells in the continuously growing mouse incisors, but so far there has not been any evidence for a function of the Notch pathway in the regulation of the incisor stem cells. We have analysed the effects of the Notch pathway inhibitor DAPT on the maintenance, proliferation, and differentiation of the epithelial stem cells in explant cultures of the mouse incisor. The proximal part of the incisor containing the cervical loop stem cell niche was dissected from newborn mice and cultured for 2\u20136 days in vitro. DAPT inhibited the expression of Notch target gene Hes1 in the cervical loop indicating that Notch signalling was inhibited in the putative stem cells. The most striking effect of DAPT was a significant reduction in the size of the cervical loop. DAPT caused a marked but partially reversible decrease in cell proliferation, as well as massive apoptosis in the epithelial stem cell niche. Interestingly, restricted apoptosis was detected within the Notch expressing putative stem cells also in the control cultures as well as in incisors in vivo, suggesting that apoptosis may be a mechanism regulating the size of the epithelial stem cell pool in the incisor. The differentiation of the epithelial cells into enamel-forming ameloblasts was not affected by DAPT but the number of preameloblasts was progressively decreased during culture period reflecting the depletion of stem and progenitor cells. Our results indicate that Notch signalling is required for epithelial stem cell survival and enamel formation in the continuously growing mouse incisor.",

TGF\u03b1 and EGFR overexpression have been reported in various human cancers. However, whether TGF\u03b1 induces cancer by itself is unknown in urogenital organs. To investigate whether TGF\u03b1 overexpression induces carcinogenesis in urogenital organs, we analyzed the phenotypes of urogenital organs in male TGF\u03b1 transgenic (TG) mice of the CD1 strain. Urogenital organs including the kidney, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes, and epididymis were isolated from 4- to 48-week-old TGF\u03b1 TG and wild-type (WT) CD1 mice. Prostates were separated into anterior prostate (AP), dorsolateral prostate (DLP), and ventral prostate (VP). Neither tumor formation nor epithelial hyperplasia was observed in the TGF\u03b1 TG mouse urogenital organs that we have investigated. Histopathologically, in prostate, we found an increased number of p63-positive basal epithelial cells in the TGF\u03b1 TG mice AP and DLP. There was no morphological change in the stromal component, such as hypercellular stroma or fibrosis. However, bladder weight was greater in TGF\u03b1 TG mice than that in WT mice, and distended bladders were observed macroscopically in 19 of 20 TGF\u03b1 TG mice over 20 weeks of age. Ki67 labeling index was increased significantly in the TGF\u03b1 TG mouse urethral epithelium, whereas neither epithelial hyperplasia nor hypertrophy was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that TGF\u03b1 overexpression in mouse urogenital organs alone may not be responsible for tumor formation and epithelial hyperplasia, but is involved in bladder outlet obstruction.",

Tyrosine kinase signalling via EphB receptors has been characterised in many developmental processes, and EphB3 mRNA expression was detected in prostate inductive mesenchyme in previous gene profiling studies. This led us to examine the expression and function of EphrinB signalling in prostate development, to determine if EphrinB ligands might function as mesenchymal paracrine regulators of prostate growth. Using PCR, wholemount in situ hybridisation, and immunohistochemistry we examined the expression of EphB receptors and EphrinB ligands in rat prostate during development to determine which showed mesenchymal expression. EphB3 and EphrinB1 transcripts and proteins were expressed in the mesenchyme of developing prostate and in female urogenital mesenchyme and smooth muscle. The function of EphrinB signalling was examined using in vitro organ culture assays of ventral prostate (VP), which were treated with EphB3\u2013Fc and EphrinB1\u2013Fc proteins to inhibit or augment Ephrin signalling. Addition of recombinant EphB3\u2013Fc resulted in a significant decrease in VP organ size, while recombinant EphrinB1\u2013Fc resulted in a significant increase in VP organ size and epithelial proliferation. Additionally, EphrinB1\u2013Fc reduced the degree of epithelial branching in VP organs and increased ductal tip size, though without disrupting normal differentiation. We have identified expression of EphrinB1 in prostatic mesenchyme and suggest that the EphrinB signalling system acts as a regulator of prostate growth. EphrinB\u2013EphB signalling may function as an autocrine regulator of mesenchyme and/or as a paracrine regulator of epithelia.",

None of these possibilities have been definitively proven or disproven by direct scientific data. To define precisely the origin of vaginal epithelium, epithelial cells of the M\u00fcllerian duct, Wolffian duct, or urogenital sinus were fluorescently labeled in mouse embryos by crossing tdTomato-EGFP dual-reporter transgenic mice with transgenic mouse lines that express Cre-recombinase in each type of epithelium. In embryos and newborn mice, the vagina consisted of fused M\u00fcllerian ducts plus the sinus vagina of urogenital sinus origin. However, the proportion of the sinus vagina was significantly reduced as the M\u00fcllerian vagina grew caudally. By postpartum day 7, the M\u00fcllerian vagina extended to the caudal end of the body, whereas the sinus vagina remained only at the junction between the vagina and perineal skin. As the vagina opened in puberty, urogenital sinus epithelium was detected only in the vulva, but not in the vagina. Additionally, from embryo to adult stages, residual Wolffian duct epithelium was present in the dorsolateral stromal wall of the vagina, but not within vaginal or vulvar epithelium. In conclusion, adult mouse vaginal epithelium is derived solely from M\u00fcllerian duct epithelium.",

     "abstract": "Smooth muscle differentiation and patterning is a fundamental process in urinary bladder development that involves a complex array of local environmental factors, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interaction, and signaling pathways. An epithelial signal is necessary to induce smooth muscle differentiation in the adjacent bladder mesenchyme. The bladder epithelium (urothelium) also influences the spatial organization of the bladder wall. Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is expressed by the urothelium, promotes mesenchymal proliferation and induces differentiation of smooth muscle from embryonic bladder mesenchyme. Shh, whose signal is mediated through various transcription factors including Gli2 and BMP4, is likely also important in the patterning of bladder smooth muscle. However, it is not known to what extent early mediators of mesenchymal migration, other Shh-associated transcription factors, and crosstalk between the Shh signaling cascade and other pathways are involved in the patterning of bladder smooth muscle. Here we review the role of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interaction and Shh signaling in smooth muscle differentiation and patterning in the bladder. We also discuss emerging signaling molecules, transcription factors, and mesenchyme properties that might be fruitful areas of future research in the process of smooth muscle formation in the bladder.",

Although some of the brain pathologies of XLAG have already been described, the crucial extra-brain symptoms are severe growth retardation, transient hyperglycemia and intractable diarrhea. Since ARX expresses in the islets of Langerhans during the embryonic stage, these visceral phenotypes may be related to a loss of ARX function, which develops endocrine cells in the pancreas. We investigated the abnormal pancreatic development of XLAG patients with ARX-null mutation. We performed immunohistochemistry of XLAG pancreases, using the antibodies against glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, ghrelin, Brn4, Nkx2.2, Mash1, amylase and pancreatic lipase. As the results, the glucagon- and pancreatic polypeptide-producing cells were found to be completely deficient in the islets of Langerhans. We also discovered marked interstitial fibrosis, small exocrine cells with loss of amylase-producing cells and an enlargement of the central lumen of the glandular acini. These pathological findings indicate that ARX contributes not only to endocrine development, but also to exocrine development of the human pancreas, and its deficiency may lead to the severe phenotypes of XLAG patients.",

In this study, we tested whether human amnion-derived cells (hADCs) could be rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed into iPS cells by the defined factors: OCT4/SOX2/NANOG. hADCs from normal placenta were isolated and cultured. The 3rd passage cells were infected with the lentiviral vectors for the delivery of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Afterwards, the generated iPSCs were identified by morphology, pluripotency markers, global gene expression profiles, and epigenetic status both in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that we were able to reprogram hADCs by the defined factors (OCT4/SOX2/NANOG). The efficiency was significantly high (about 0.1%), and the typical colonies appeared on the 9th day after infection. They were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface markers, gene expression, and the epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes. Furthermore, these cells were able to differentiate into various cell types of all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that hADCs were an ideal somatic cell resource for the rapid and efficient generation of iPS cells by OCT4/SOX2/NANOG.",

Studies suggest that human amniotic fluid (hAF) contains multipotent progenitor cells capable of differentiating to all three germ layers. Here, we used high-content, live-cell imaging to assess the ability to reprogram hAF cells towards a beta cell phenotype. A fluorescent reporter system was developed where DsRed express (DSRE) expression is driven by the human insulin promoter. Using integrative lentiviral technology, we created stable reporter hAF cells that could be routinely monitored for insulin promoter activation. These cells were subjected to combinatorial high-content screening using adenoviral-mediated expression of up to six transcription factors important for beta cell development. Cells were monitored for DSRE expression which revealed an optimal combination of the transcription factors required to induce insulin gene expression in hAF cells. These optimally induced cells were examined for expression of additional beta cell transcription factors and proteins involved in glucose sensing and insulin processing. RT-qPCR revealed very low level expression of insulin that was ultimately insufficient to reverse streptozotocin-induced diabetes following sub-capsular kidney transplantation. High-content, live-cell imaging using fluorescent reporter cells provides a convenient method for repeated assessment of cellular reprogramming. hAF cells could be reprogrammed to express key beta cell proteins, however insulin gene expression was insufficient to reverse hyperglycemia in diabetic animals.",

We demonstrate that small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of AGPAT1 expression prevents the induction of myogenin, a key transcriptional activator of the myogenic program, and inhibits the expression of myosin heavy chain. This effect is rescued by transfection with AGPAT1 but not AGPAT2. Knockdown of AGPAT2 has no effect. The regulation of myogenesis by AGPAT1 is associated with alterations on actin cytoskeleton. The role of AGPAT1 on actin cytoskeleton is further supported by colocalization of AGPAT1 to areas of active actin polymerization. AGPAT1 overexpression was not associated with an increase in PA levels. Our observations strongly implicate AGPAT1 in the development of skeletal muscle, specifically to terminal differentiation.

Our study aimed at establishing the expression profiles of miRNAs during intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) differentiation and determining a miRNA \u201csignature\u201d that distinguishes between small and large IECs. MiRNA arrays were employed to profile miRNA expression in two IEC models: the enterocyte-like Caco2-BBE and the colonocyte-like HT29-Cl.19A cell lines. Microarray data showed that in both cell lineages, the differentiated stage exhibited a different miRNA expression profile from undifferentiated stage. Interestingly, Caco2-BBE cells were distinguished from HT29-Cl.19A cells by their unique miRNA expression profile. Notably, HT29-Cl.19A cells exhibited down-regulation of miR-1269 and up-regulation of miR-99b and miR-125a-5p compared with Caco2-BBE cells. Most importantly, transfection of Caco2-BBE cells with mature miR-99b, mature miR-125a-5p and antisense of mature miR-1269 decreased growth rate and trans-epithelial resistance of the cells, indicating their shift toward HT29-Cl.19A cell phenotype.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of surface antigen selection of BM-MSCs and to understand the mechanisms underlying their differentiation.MSCs were isolated from BM stroma and expanded. CD105+ subpopulation was isolated using a magnetic separator. We compared culture-expanded selected cells with non-selected cells. We analyzed the phenotypic profiles, the expression of the stem cell marker genes Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2 and the multi-lineage differentiation potential (adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic). The multi-lineage differentiation was confirmed using histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques.The selected and non-selected cells displayed similar phenotypes and multi-lineage differentiation potentials. Analyzing each cell source individually, we could divide the six donors into two groups: one with a high percentage of CD29 (\u03b21-integrin) expression (HL); one with a low percentage of CD29 (LL). These two groups had different chondrogenic capacities and different expression levels of the stem cell marker genes.This study showed that phenotypic profiles of donors were related to the chondrogenic potential of human BM-MSCs. The chondrogenic potential of donors was related to CD29 expression levels. The high expression of CD29 antigen seemed necessary for chondrogenic differentiation. Further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for these differences in BM-MSCs chondrogenesis is therefore warranted.

However, the precise origin of LSCs remains unclear. Herein we determine if bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from rats in acute hepatic failure (AHF) possess hepatic characteristics and have differentiation potential. BMSCs were isolated from AHF and sham-operated rats, and primary hepatocytes were isolated from normal rats for comparison. The transcriptomic profile of BMSCs and primary hepatoyctes was analyzed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array. BMSCs isolated from AHF and normal rats were induced to differentiate into hepatocytes in vitro and the degree of hepatic differentiation was assessed using quantitative real time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical assays. AHF-derived BMSCs had a significantly different gene expression profile compared to control BMSCs. Thirty-four gene/probe sets were expressed in both AHF-derived BMSCs and primary hepatocytes, but were absent in control-derived BMSCs, including 3 hepatocyte-specific genes. Forty-four genes were up-regulated more than 2-fold in AHF-derived BMSCs compared to controls, including 3 genes involved in hepatocyte metabolism and development. Furthermore, AHF-derived BMSCs expressed more hepatocyte related genes than control BMSCs. Additional experiments to validate the differentiation of AHF-derived BMSCs, compared to control-derived BMSCs, showed that several hepatocyte-specific genes and proteins [such as albumin (ALB) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP)] were expressed earlier, and at higher levels, after 1 week of differentiation. Hepatocyte-specific metabolic functions were also significantly higher in the AHF group compared to control cells. Conclusion: AHF-derived BMSCs had a hepatic transcriptional profile and expressed hepatocyte specific genes early during differentiation, and possessed greater hepatogenic potency in vitro compared to cells isolated from control animals, further confirming their potential as a stem cell-based therapy for end-stage liver disease.",

Both lines of myc cDKO mESC exhibited severely disrupted self-renewal, pluripotency, and survival along with enhanced differentiation. Chimeric embryos injected with DKO mESC most often completely failed to develop or in rare cases survived but with severe defects. The essential nature of myc for self-renewal and pluripotency is at least in part mediated through orchestrating pluripotency-related cell cycle and metabolic programs. This study demonstrates that endogenous myc genes are essential for mESC pluripotency and self-renewal as well as providing the first evidence that myc genes are required for early embryogenesis, suggesting potential mechanisms of myc contribution to iPS cell formation.",

Retinoic acid (RA) is frequently used to promote neural differentiation of pluripotent cells under a wide variety of culture conditions. Through systematic comparison of differentiation conditions we demonstrate that RA induced neuronal differentiation of human ES and EC cells requires prolonged RA exposure and intercellular communication mediated by high cell density. These parameters are necessary for the up-regulation of neural gene expression (SOX2, PAX6 and NeuroD1) and the eventual appearance of neurons. Forced over-expression of neither SOX2 nor NEUROD1 was sufficient to overcome the density dependency of neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 activity blocked the ability of RA to direct cell differentiation along the neural lineage, suggesting a role for appropriately regulated WNT signalling. These data indicate that RA mediated neuronal differentiation of human EC and ES cell lines is not a cell autonomous program but comprises of a multi-staged program that requires intercellular input.",

In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, oxidizing extracellular redox potentials (Eh) increased intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed a greater response to extracellular Eh, producing more intracellular ROS, than preadipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes also produced more extracellular ROS and re-regulated the extracellular Eh to a more oxidizing state than preadipocytes. During 3T3-L1 differentiation, cellular glutathione and mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 become oxidized, suggesting that adipogenesis may be enhanced under conditions promoting intracellular and mitochondrial compartment oxidation. Under various extracellular Eh, 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, as determined by lipid accumulation and the expression of early genetic markers of adipogenesis, was sensitive to the extracellular redox environment, where it was enhanced under oxidizing conditions and lower under reducing conditions. Using a diet-induced obesity mouse model, plasma was collected before and after the 8 week diet regimens. Plasma GSH Eh was unchanged as a consequence of weight gain but plasma cystiene (Cys) Eh was significantly oxidized in overweight animals. Data presented here show that adipocytes/excessive adipose preferentially alter extracellular Eh to a more oxidized state in vivo and in vitro and may promote further adipogenesis.",

To test this hypothesis, we cocultured adipocytes with osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the absence of direct cell contact and then analyzed gene expression changes in the osteoblastic population by using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found that, upon coculture, MSC-derived osteoblasts showed appearance of adipogenic (lipoprotein lipase, leptin) and decrease of osteogenic (osteocalcin) mRNA markers. Our results indicate that in vitro, MSC-derived adipocytes are capable of inducing MSC-derived osteoblasts to differentiate to an adipocyte phenotype. These new data suggest that (i) transdifferentiation of committed osteoblasts into adipocytes may contribute to the increase in marrow fat content at the expense of bone-forming cells and (ii) this switch might be initiated by the adipocytes themselves.",

At one level this regulation may involve spatially and temporally ordered patterns of expression of specific RTK signaling antagonists, such as Sef (similar expression to fgfs). Growth factors, notably FGFs, play important roles in development of the vertebrate ocular lens. FGF induces lens cell proliferation and differentiation at progressively higher concentrations and there is compelling evidence that a gradient of FGF signaling in the eye determines lens polarity and growth patterns. We have recently identified the presence of Sef in the lens, with strongest expression in the epithelial cells. Given the important role for FGFs in lens developmental biology, we employed transgenic mouse strategies to determine if Sef could be involved in regulating lens cell behaviour. Over-expressing Sef specifically in the lens of transgenic mice led to impaired lens and eye development that resulted in microphthalmia. Sef inhibited primary lens fiber cell elongation and differentiation, as well as increased apoptosis, consistent with a block in FGFR-mediated signaling during lens morphogenesis. These results are consistent with growth factor antagonists, such as Sef, being important negative regulators of growth factor signaling. Moreover, the lens provides a useful paradigm as to how opposing gradients of a growth factor and its antagonist could work together to determine and stabilise tissue patterning during development and growth.",

In the embryo itself, the first EMT event occurs at gastrulation. Cells from the single epithelial cell layer (epiblast or primitive ectoderm) move to the midline to form the primitive streak, a linear structure that bisects the embryo along the antero-posterior axis. These are the cells that undergo EMT and internalize to generate the mesoderm and the endoderm, highlighting the importance of the EMT for embryonic development, but also pointing to the need for an EMT repressor in those cells that remain in the ectoderm to become central nervous system and epidermis. Among the key evolutionary conserved factors that induce EMT at gastrulation and at additional developmental processes are the members of the Snail family (Barrallo-Gimeno and Nieto, 2009). However, they need to be downregulated in the adult, as their pathological activation leads to several prominent pathologies including tumour progression and fibrosis (Thiery et al., 2009). Therefore, it is important to identify not only those factors that induce Snail expression but also those that prevent it. These repressors are the candidates to play an important role in protecting cells from undergoing EMT to ensure the formation of ectodermal derivatives during development and to maintain epithelial homeostasis in the adult.

     "abstract": "Two different types of neurulation processes take place during early embryogenesis. One is a well known neurulation where a sheet of epithelial cells folds inward to form a tubular structure (primary neurulation). Another one, called secondary neurulation (SN), is seen in a posterior region of the body. SN proceeds by mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), the process contrasting with that of the primary neurulation. Although the SN was histologically described more than 70 years ago, its molecular- and cellular mechanisms remain unknown. SN precursor cells are generated during gastrulation from ingressing cells (mesenchymal) that also give rise to presomitic mesoderm (PSM). This raises two questions: What discriminates SN from PSM? And how mesenchymal cells undergo epithelialization during the SN? To address these questions, we have focused on two transcriptional factors, Pax2 expressed in SN-region and Tbx6L in PSM, to perform tissue-specific gene manipulation using chicken embryos. We have found that Pax2 and Tbx6L play important roles in the formation of SN and PSM, respectively, by counteracting each other. Remarkably, Pax2, when overexpressed in PSM, causes ectopic formation of SN-like neural tube. Furthermore, Tbx6L impedes SN formation when expressed in a presumptive SN. These findings suggest that during the SN processes, Pax2 represses mesodermal genes (i.e. Tbx6L), and regulates a set of genes important for cell epithelialization and tubular formation. We will also discuss a possible link of SN to Hox gene regulation in the construction of posterior body structures.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that cell\u2013cell adhesion is not a static process, but it actively controls social cell behavior. For example, in developing epithelial layers, local constriction of cell\u2013cell junctions autonomously induces the intercalation of cells, a process required for the convergent\u2013extension of tissues. The junctional constriction also plays a role in the folding of epithelial layers, which is important for many types of epithelial morphogenesis, such as neural tube formation. On the other hand, loosening of cell\u2013cell contacts is known to assist cell migration as seen in cancer invasion. How do the cells regulate their contacts with others? Cadherin is the major cell\u2013cell adhesion receptor, which structurally builds \u201cadherens junction (AJ)\u201d at the apical cellular interfaces. In the AJs, cadherin interacts with a couple of cytoplasmic proteins, called catenins. Importantly, the cadherin\u2013catenin complex is further linked with the cytoskeletal structures, such as F-actin and microtubules that are known to serve for regulating a number of cellular behaviors, such as cell motility and shaping. Thus, the adhesive and motile elements are combined into single machinery, and this explains why the cell junctions can have such dynamic and regulatable properties. We have been analyzing the molecular details of AJ\u2013actin or microtubule interactions, and also their potential roles in epithelial or neural morphogenesis.

     "abstract": "The morphogen like properties of Hedgehog (Hh) family proteins have been well documented in a number of contexts. In vertebrates, the best characterized example of such a role is in the developing neural tube, where different ventral neuronal identities are specified in response to the strength and duration of Shh signaling emanating from the notochord and floorplate. In an analogous fashion, members of the BMP family secreted by the lateral non neural ectoderm and the roofplate of the neural tube act to specify dorsal neural cell fates. The effects of Shh and BMP on cell fate specification in the neural tube are mutually antagonistic but how cells integrate the effects of these opposing influences is not well understood. Several lines of evidence have shown that the specification of distinct cell types in the zebrafish myotome is similarly mediated by varying levels of Hh signalling activity, and that BMP likely plays a role in modulating the response of these cells to Hh activity. Through analysis of the regulation of the eng2a gene, a key marker of muscle cell types induced in response to high threshold levels of Shh, we have now identified a clear link between BMP signaling and expression of a putative Hh target gene. We show that Smad activity represses eng2a expression and that activated forms of Smads bind to specific Hh responsive enhancer elements upstream of the eng2a promoter: moreover, we show that nuclear accumulation of pSmads is abrogated in cells exposed to the highest levels of Hh signaling activity. Our findings provide a mechanistic basis for the response of cells to different levels of a morphogen (Shh) while at the same time revealing a novel example of \u201ccross-talk\u201d between the two signaling pathways.",

However, the molecular link between induction of cell cycle progression and inhibition of cell differentiation in NSCs/NPCs is poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) promotes proliferation of NSCs/NPCs while it inhibits their differentiation, which suggests that a molecular link between growth and differentiation pathways is functioning downstream of FGF2 signaling. We hypothesized that a component or components in the proliferative signaling pathway should also be involved in inhibition of NSCs/NPCs differentiation. We have found that the FGF2 signaling and the Wnt canonical pathway cooperate together, via inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and subsequent induction of cyclin D1 expression, to promote proliferation of NSCs/NPCs. Interestingly, the GSK3beta inactivation-mediated beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus is involved in the inhibition of neurogenesis from NSCs/NPCs by activation of hes1 and hes5 gene expression through the cooperation with a Notch pathway. As we have previously demonstrated, astrocyte differentiation from NSCs/NPCs is synergistically induced by a combination of LIF and BMP2. In this symposium, we also present our recent data showing that beta-catenin stabilization by a GSK3 beta inhibitor decreases the number of GFAP expressing astrocytes in the culture of NSCs/NPCs with LIF and BMP2. In addition, forced expression of cyclin D1, a common downstream target of FGF2 and Wnt signals, decreases the number of GFAP expressing astrocytes. We further show that knockdown of cyclin D1 relieves the inhibitory effect of the GSK3beta inhibitor.

     "abstract": "Inheritance and maintenance of the DNA sequence and its organization into chromatin are central for eukaryotic life. To orchestrate DNA-replication and -repair processes in the context of chromatin is a challenge. Factors have been isolated from cell extracts that stimulate early steps in chromatin assembly in vitro. One such factor, chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1), facilitates nucleosome formation coupled to DNA synthesis. It is thought to participate in a marking system at the crossroads of DNA replication and repair to monitor genome integrity and to define particular epigenetic states. We have now identified a chromatin assembly pathway independent of DNA synthesis involving the HIRA protein. Notably, CAF-1 is part of the histone H3 complex, H3.1 complex (replicative form) (Groth et al., 2007a, 2007b) and HIRA of the H3.3 complex (replacement form) (Tagami et al., 2004; Nakatani et al., 2004; Quivy et al., 2008; Loyola et al., 2009). In addition, another histone chaperone, Asf1, has to be integrated in a network of interactions leading to nucleosome deposition. A novel chaperone for the centromeric histone variant CENPA has been identified (Dunleavy et al., 2009). A major goal in our laboratory is to integrate the function of these factors and histone variants in vivo during development. This is considered in connection with replication, repair and control of histone pools.We will discuss our recent findings on this topic and the interrelationships with other assembly factors.Groth, A., Rocha, W., Verreault, A., Almouzni, G., 2007a.

     "abstract": "To clarify the molecular mechanisms linking two distinct Polycomb complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, and their biological outcomes, we examined the genome-wide distributions of PRC1 components and the PRC1-catalyzed histone modification, mono-ubiquitinated H2A (H2Aub1), in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We also integrated data for PRC2 components and the PRC2-catalyzed modification, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). H2Aub1 localizes to silent developmental gene promoters, nearly all of which are also enriched for PRC1 and PRC2. H2Aub1 deposition and PRC1 localization are shown to depend on two parallel pathways. The first pathway is PRC2-dependent and involves recognition of H3K27me3 by Cbx2 in PRC1. The second is independent of PRC2 and instead depends on the catalytic activity of Ring1B at key PRC1 target genes. The catalytic activity of Ring1B promotes the expression of Mel18 and Bmi1, which in turn help bring PRC1 to the chromatin and concurrently enhance its catalytic activity to ubiquitinate H2A. We propose that these two mechanisms complement each other to deposit PRC1 and H2Aub1 at critical differentiation genes in ESCs and mediate stable and reversible repression in response to subsequent induction of developmental programs.",

     "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression of a specific set of genes in mammals. Imprinting has crucial influences on embryonic growth, placental development, and animal behavior. It is known that monoallelic expression of the imprinted genes is regulated by differential DNA methylation established during male and female gametogenesis. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the target specific de novo DNA methylation and imprinting in germ cells. We have recently found that the piRNA system is involved in de novo DNA methylation of mouse Rasgrf1, a paternally methylated imprinted locus, in prospermatogonia of the fetal testis. The piRNA system has been known to silence retrotransposons in germ cells, but our case provides the first evidence that a protein-coding gene is regulated by this system. Based on the findings, we propose a mechanistic model in which the specificity of de novo DNA methylation is determined by the interaction between piRNAs and nascent RNAs transcribed at the target regions.",

The definitive endoderm in the anterior region of the post-gastrula stage embryo is fated for forming the epithelial lining of the foregut and the tissues of the associated organs, such as the respiratory tract, thyroid, thymus, liver and pancreas. To gain insights into the molecular determinants of foregut development, we performed microarray analyses to identify endoderm-enriched transcripts in the foregut of early-somite-stage mouse embryos. Validation by in situ hybridization reveals that the transcripts coding for an atypical Rho GTPase, Rhou, are preferentially expressed in the foregut endoderm. Knockdown of Rhou by shRNA in embryonic stem cells affects the differentiation of endoderm derivatives in response to Activin treatment, but not that of the mesoderm. Rhou-deficient cells in embryoid bodies also display abnormal epithelial organization. In embryos generated from the knockdown ES cells by tetraploid complementation, the cells lining the embryonic foregut lose the epithelial architecture, with reduced apical concentration of F-actin and tendency of detaching from the epithelium. Differentiation of the Rhou-deficient endoderm is also impaired. A proper regulation of Rhou activity is therefore required for the maintenance of epithelial organization of the endoderm which appears to be a crucial intermediate step for endoderm differentiation.",

The precise reasons for sarcopenia are unclear. While sarcopenia is widely studied in rats, it has barely been studied in geriatric mice. We describe the time course of sarcopenia in mice and show significant loss of muscle mass at 24 and 27/29 months. We also demonstrate an excellent capacity of myogenic precursor cells in geriatric muscle (of mice aged 27/29 months) to form new muscle in regenerating muscle grafts cross-transplanted between young and very old mice [Shavlakadze et al., 2010. Biogerontology 11, 363\u2013376]. Muscle function also requires electrical stimulation by a nerve, yet impaired innervation as a cause for sarcopenia has barely been considered. The extent of muscle denervation in geriatric mice was examined using immunostaining of whole intact muscles to identify the contribution of both muscle and nerve to the maintenance neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), and sections of lumbar spinal cord to quantify numbers of alpha-motoneurons. These analyses show striking morphological changes of NMJs and innervation, with a significant loss (~20%) of innervation in NMJ of geriatric muscles and myofibre type changes, but no significant loss of alpha-motoneurons cell bodies in the spinal cord of geriatric mice. Establishing these baseline data for geriatric mice is essential in order to take full advantage of the wealth of genetically modified mice available to study many aspects of sarcopenia, especially the molecular basis for this pronounced denervation.",

Understanding the underlying developmental mechanisms that control differentiation of pluripotent cells to cardiac progenitors and their derivatives and mimicking these in defined culture conditions in vitro is now essential for moving the field forward. Culture conditions have now been sufficiently refined that cardiomyocyte and vascular differentiation is a fairly efficient and reproducible process. Genetically marked HESCs have been produced in which expression of the green fluorescent protein marker is expressed ubiquitously or driven by specific lineage markers. We have used these tagged lines to trace cardiomyocytes following transplantation into a mouse heart after myocardial infarction and select the progenitors of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Long term survival of the cells and integration into the host heart has been observed and early improvements in cardiac function but these are not sustained. Cardiac repair using stem cell derived cardiomyocytes will likely require more than efficient cardiomyocytes production. More immediate applications of hESC- and hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial cells in drug discovery and disease are now close to implementation.

We have recently demonstrated, using clonal and functional analysis, that all stratified epithelia contain clonogenic stem cells that can respond to skin morphogenetic signals, while cells obtained from simple or pseudo-stratified epithelia cannot. A genome-wide expression analysis favors multilineage priming rather than reprogramming. Collectively, these observations are reminiscent of epithelial metaplasia, a phenomenon in which a cell adopts the phenotype of another epithelial cell, often in response to repeated environmental stress, e.g. smoking, alcohol and micro-traumatisms. Furthermore, they support the notion that metaplasia results from the expression of an unseen potency, revealed by an environmental deficiency. The thymus supposedly contains only progenitor epithelial cells but no stem cells. We have demonstrated that the thymus also contains a small population of clonogenic cells that can function as bona fide multipotent hair follicle stem cells in response to an inductive skin microenvironment and a genome-wide expression analysis indicates that it correlates with robust changes in the expression of genes important for thymus identity.

To investigate the safeness of iPS cells-derived NS/PCs, we examined various factors who could affect the tumorigenic ability of iPS cells-derived NS/PCs, including the origin of iPS cells, usage of c-Myc transgene or usage of genetic selection using drug resistant gene. Consequently, the origin of the iPS cells was concluded to be the crucial factor for predicting the safety issue and that the content of undifferentiated cells within NS/PCs highly correlated with their tumorigenic activity (Miura et al., Nat. Biotech, 2009). Then, the therapeutic ability of NS/PCs-derived from pre-evaluated non-tumorigenic iPS cells was examined for injured spinal cord using mouse model. We found that the pre-evaluated non-tumorigenic iPS-derived NS/PCs and ES-derived ones show similar therapeutic effects upon SCI.

In zebrafish the neural tube is generated by converting a soild neural rod into a tube. During rod stage, a polarised midline becomes established and eventually a small lumen opens in a roughly ventral to dorsal progression. The lumen inflates to become the ventricle later in development. We have previously suggested the transition from rod to tube is orchestrated by an unique mirror-symmetric cell division which deposits one daughter cell on either side of the future midline, and at the same time establishes the apical nature of the midline by depositing Par3 protein at the cleavage plane. To investigate the advantages of this novel division in establishment of apical-basal polarity and lumen formation we have inhibited cell division and examined the consequences on neural tube formation. We find that cells can still polarize when division is blocked, however polarization and cellular organization at the midline is more disorganized and lumen formation is disrupted. To better understand the roles of the mirror-symmetric division, we are using time-lapse microscopy to compare cell behaviour and polarization between wild-type and division-blocked embryos and we observe novel cell behaviours that are helping us understand the mechanisms that direct cell polarization and morphogenesis of the neural tube lumen.",

This suggests that it is possible to separate somite formation from a somitogenesis clock. What appears to go wrong in these apparently clockless somites is the partition of each somite into rostral and caudal halves: markers for these are inappropriately expressed. It also appears that somites generated without the clock have very specific axial identities.

However, the precise role of GDNF/Ret signaling in this process, and the specific responses of UB cells to GDNF, remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies provide new insight into the effects of Ret signaling on cell behavior, the functional overlap between GDNF and other growth factors, and the genes functioning downstream of Ret. Lineage studies show that the UB tip cells, which express Ret, are the progenitors for UB growth, while GDNF-expressing mesenchymal cells are the progenitors of nephron epithelia. Time-lapse studies of chimeric embryos reveal that the earliest role of Ret signaling is in the Wolffian duct, where it promotes cell movements that give rise to the first ureteric bud tip. The requirement for GDNF/Ret signaling can be largely relieved by removing the negative regulator Sprouty1, implicating other growth factors, in particular FGF10, in the support of UB growth and branching. However, the kidneys that develop in the absence of GDNF/Ret and Sprouty1 display branching abnormalities, suggesting a unique role for GDNF in determining UB branching pattern. A number of genes whose expression is induced in the UB by GDNF has been identified, including two ETS transcription factors Etv4 and Etv5. These genes are required downstream of Ret for the Wolffian duct cell movements that form the UB tip domain, as well as for later UB growth and branching.",

     "abstract": "The kidney develops through reciprocal interactions between two precursor tissues: the metanephric mesenchyme and the ureteric bud. We previously reported that the zinc finger protein Sall1 is essential for ureteric bud attraction toward the mesenchyme. We also demonstrated that multipotent nephron progenitors that form colonies upon Wnt4 stimulation, and which strongly express Sall1, exist in the metanephric mesenchyme; these cells can partially reconstitute a three-dimensional structure in an organ culture setting. Here we show that Kif-k, a kinesin family gene, is a downstream target of Sall1 and that disruption of this gene causes kidney agenesis because of impaired ureteric bud attraction. In the Kif-k-null metanephros, compact adhesion between mesenchymal cells adjacent to the ureteric buds and the polarized distribution of integrin \u03b18 were impaired, resulting in failed maintenance of Gdnf, a critical ureteric bud attractant. Overexpression of Kif-k in vitro caused increased cell adhesion through interactions with non-muscle myosin. Thus Kif-k is essential for kidney development because it regulates the adhesion of mesenchymal cells in contact with ureteric buds. Upon induction by ureteric buds, successive activation of Wnt4 and Notch2 generates nephrons from the nephron progenitors in the metanephric mesenchyme. Mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition requires Wnt4, and normal development of the proximal nephron (epithelia of glomeruli and proximal tubules) requires Notch2. It is unknown, however, whether Notch2 dictates the fate of the proximal nephron directly. Thus, we generated a mutant strain of mice with activated Notch2 in Six2-containing nephron progenitor cells of the metanephric mesenchyme. Notch2 activation did not skew the cell fate toward the proximal nephron but resulted in severe kidney dysgenesis and depletion of Six2-positive progenitors. We observed ectopic expression of Wnt4 and premature tubule formation, similar to the phenotype of Six2-deficient mice. Taken together, these data suggest that a positive feedback loop exists between Notch2 and Wnt4, and that Notch2 stabilizes, rather than dictates, nephron fate by shutting down the maintenance of undifferentiated progenitor cells, thereby depleting this population.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate ECM remodeling are not fully understood. In zebrafish, asymmetric migration of the epithelial lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) displaces the gut to the left, leading to the correct placement of the liver and pancreas. The bHLH transcription factor Hand2 is expressed in the anterior LPM as well as its mesenchymal derivatives. In order to observe these tissues at higher resolution, we generated a transgenic line that expresses GFP under the control of the hand2 regulatory regions. By confocal imaging, we show that during the process of gut looping, Laminin is distributed along the LPM/gut boundary, and appears to be degraded by the Hand2-expressing cells as they undergo asymmetric migration. Laminin degradation is required for LPM migration and is dependent on matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. Loss of Hand2 function causes reduced MMP activity and prolonged Laminin deposition at the LPM/gut boundary. Consequently, asymmetric LPM migration and leftward gut looping fail to occur in these embryos. Our study reveals an unexpected role for Hand2, a transcription factor that controls cell specification and differentiation, in modulating ECM remodeling during organ morphogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The genetics of cancer and development have converged in the identification of intra- and extra-cellular signaling pathways that are aberrantly regulated in cancer and are also central to embryonic pattering. The Wnt signaling pathway has provided an outstanding example of this. Wnt proteins are secreted molecules and Wnts activate multiple intracellular signaling systems. The b-catenin-dependent pathway that is most extensively studied is known to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation. Genetic alterations of proteins that constitute this pathway are often observed in human cancer. Some Wnts activate the b-catenin-independent pathway that modulates cell movement and polarity, as first observed during embryogenesis. However, how the b-catenin-independent pathway regulates these cellular functions or whether the abnormal activation of this pathway is involved in tumorigenesis is not clear. Since Wnt5a is a representative ligand that activates the b-catenin-independent pathway, we analyzed the molecular mechanism by which Wnt5a activates signaling pathway, regulates cell adhesion and migration, and affects aggressiveness of cancers. We found that Wnt5a activates Rac through clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis. Knockdown of Wnt5a reduced the dynamics of focal adhesion turnover and suppressed cell migration activities. Dvl and APC formed a complex with each other, and Wnt5a enhanced the complex formation. Dvl and APC bound to FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and paxillin, respectively, and Dvl and APC were necessary for cell-to-substrate adhesion-dependent activation of FAK and phosphorylation of paxillin. Furthermore, Wnt5a receptor Fz2 and integrin were present closely on substrate-facing surface of cells. These results suggest that Wnt5a and integrin signaling cooperate to regulate cell adhesion and migration. Immunohistochmical analyses revealed that Wnt5a is overexpressed in about 30% of gastric cancer samples. The positivity of Wnt5a expression was correlated with advanced stages and poor prognosis of gastric cancer. Knockdown of Wnt5a in gastric cancer cells suppressed their metastatic ability in nude mice. These results suggest that Wnt5a is a good therapeutic target for gastric cancer. In this seminar, we will discuss about our recent observations in the functions and mechanisms of the Wnt5a/b-catenin-independent pathway with an emphasis on its functional contribution to tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "While originally implicated in inflammatory and immune processes, it is now apparent that canonical STAT signaling drives a variety of fundamental cellular processes, including stem cell renewal, cell proliferation, migration, and progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, STATs are often constitutively activated/phosphorylated in an array of hematologic and solid neoplasms. In the developing kidney, STATs 1 and 3 are already phosphorylated in cortical progenitors at the earliest stages of rudiment formation, while most other STAT family members appear at later stages of nephrogenesis. Functionally, STAT3 activation is associated with the conversion of metanephric mesenchyme to form the epithelia of the nephron, whereas STAT1 activation stimulates progenitor proliferation, upregulates the expression of survival/anti-apoptotic factors such as Mcl-1, and inhbits mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Moreover, inactivation of STAT1 has the converse effect, accelerating tubule formation. The pediatric cancer, Wilms tumor, is derived from metanephric mesenchyme and caricatures the differentiation of this tissue. It is characterized by the expansion of a blastemal population that is inhibited in its ability to undergo mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition to form nephronic tubules. An examination of tumor tissues has revealed that STAT1, but not STAT3, is constitutively activated by phosphorylation of S727 in Wilms tumors. Furthermore, overexpression of an unphosphorylated mutant form, S727A-STAT1, or knockdown of endogenous STAT1 in renal tumor cells inhibits their anchorage-independent growth. Genomic expression profiling has determined that STAT1 activity in tumor cells is dependent in part on the up regulation of survival/anti-apoptotic factors, Mcl-1, Hsp-27, and Cux-1, and inhibition of STAT1 or these factors induces apoptosis in renal tumor cells. These findings demonstrate that both metanephric progenitors and renal tumor cells utilize a STAT1-dependent mechanism for growth/survival and possibly regulation of differentiation and suggest that inhibition of signaling by this transcription factor may provide an efficacious target for Wilms tumor therapy",

We show here that autocrine TGF-\u03b2 signaling plays essential roles in retention of stemness of glioma-initiating cells. TGF-\u03b2 induced expression of Sox2, and this induction was mediated by Sox4, a novel, direct target gene of TGF-\u03b2. Inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 signaling resulted in deprivation of tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells through induction of their differentiation, and these effects were attenuated in glioma-initiating cells transduced with exogenous Sox2 or Sox4. Furthermore, glioma-initiating cells pre-treated with a TGF-\u03b2 signaling inhibitor exhibited less tumorigenic activity and lethal potency in an intracranial transplantation assay. To target cancer stem cells in clinical situations, elucidation of differences between cancer stem cells and normal stem cells, and identification of novel targets which can eradicate cancer stem cells without affecting normal stem cells will be important. We show that the regulatory mechanism of the Sox axis in glioma-initiating cells is distinct from that in neural progenitor cells. Our findings suggest important differences between glioma-initiating cells and neural progenitor cells, and may open the way to depriving glioma-initiating cells of the tumorigenic activity with minimally affecting normal brain tissues (Ikushima et al., 2009).Ikushima, H., et al., 2009.

     "abstract": "In epithelial tissues, the lineage relationship between normal progenitor cells and cell type(s) of origin for cancer has been poorly understood. In our studies, we have shown that a known regulator of prostate epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3.1, marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells which express Nkx3.1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, while single-cell transplantation assays show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3.1 mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration assays suggest that Nkx3.1 is required for stem cell maintenance. Finally, targeted deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor gene in CARNs results in rapid formation of carcinoma following androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations indicate that CARNs represent a novel luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer. In our ongoing work, we are investigating the properties of CARNs as cells of origin for prostate cancer. We will present our recent findings and discuss their implications with respect to the relationship between epithelial progenitor populations, prostate cancer initiation, and putative cancer stem cells.",

When cultivated at 40.5\u00a0\u00b0C, they behave as normal epithelial cells, whereas after a shift to 35\u00a0\u00b0C, Src tyrosine kinase is activated and the transformation process begins. Src-transformed MDCK cells grown at +40.5\u00a0\u00b0C in 3-D Matrigel form polarized cysts with apical surface facing an internal lumen and basal surface facing the extracellular matrix (ECM). Upon Src-activation at +35\u00a0\u00b0C these cells form lumenless spherical cysts without apico-basal polarity (T\u00f6yli et al., 2010, Lab Invest., in press). In order to monitor the mechanism of lumen filling in 3D culture we transfected Src-MDCK cells with GFP cadherin. These cells were cultivated in Matrigel at +40.5\u00a0\u00b0C until they formed lumina, and subsequently monitored under a microscope adjusted at +35\u00a0\u00b0C to follow the transformation process for up to 24\u00a0h. GFP cadherin and Hoechst stain served as markers for cell polarization and transformation. In 1\u20132\u00a0h the cells began to lose their apico-basal polarity and some cells were observed inside the lumen. In 6\u00a0h the luminal space was filled, but the cyst size was not increased. When incubated overnight at +35\u00a0\u00b0C, the cells formed large irregular clusters. We conclude that the initial mechanism of filling the luminal space was cell migration. Next, we cultivated the MDCK cells on a non-adhesive surface in the presence of a function-blocking beta1-integrin antibody. In these 1D conditions both untransformed and v-Src-transformed MDCK cells formed aggregates floating in the suspension without any apico-basal polarity. Interestingly, the cells survived several days without entering apoptosis. The results show that ECM-contact and integrin signalling are crucial for formation of apico-basal axis and central lumen. However, additional signals are needed to trigger apoptosis in cells without ECM contact in suspension or trapped within the 3D cell cluster. We observed a strong expression of survivin in ts-Src MDCK cells grown in 3D environment at +35\u00a0\u00b0C (T\u00f6yli et al., 2010). Survivin is a highly expressed protein in almost all malignant tumours and completely missing in adult healthy tissues. It is an essential regulator of mitosis, inhibits apoptosis and promotes migration of transformed cells. Thus, survivin may serve as a possible Src oncogene target at various steps of carcinogenesis.",

When cells migrate in the body, their surrounding tissues (environment) might be influential on the migratory behavior. However, little is known about interactions between migrating cells and their environment in the actual body. We have recently established a novel experimental system in which cultured line-cells are transplanted into early chicken embryos, where their migratory behaviors are directly assessed in vivo. We have examined 12 different cell lines, including 4 non-cancer cell lines (chicken DF-1, mammalian COS-7, NIH3T3 and C2C12) and 8 human cancer cell lines (HT1080, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Y-1, Panc-1, A375, Mewo and A2058). These cells are manufactured in vitro to stably express EGFP prior to transplantation into the dorsal aspect of the somitic mesoderm of E2 chicken embryo. Among the 12 cell lines, HT1080 cells (highly invasive human sarcoma) are found to actively migrate to the dorsal aorta whereas the others do not. Time-lapse imaging with confocal laser microscopy allows us to observe numerous filopodia extending from migrating cells. Such migratory behavior is dependent on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), known to degrade extracellular matrix proteins. When overexpressed with MMP inhibitor Timp-2 or Reck, the migration has been impaired. Following the migration, HT1080 cells accumulate around the aortic vessel. Interestingly, the dorsal and ventral aspects of this vessel provide differential environment to the HT1080: in the dorsal region cells undergo intravasation (breaking the blood vessel to invade into the blood stream) whereas the ventral region allows pronounced accumulation of cells. We will discuss how cells interact with their surrounding tissues for cell migration and intravasation events.",

Melanocytes are known as melanin-producing cells in which melanin is synthesized in melanosomes. In the tanning processes, melanocytes extend numerous dendrites that are attached to surrounding keratinocyes, and subsequently melanin granules are transferred through melanocyte dendrites to keratinocytes. Although several models for intercellar melanin-transfer have been proposed by in vitro experiments and electron microscopic observations, the mechanisms of melanin-transfer in vivo remain controversial. We have developed time-lapse imaging techniques that directly visualize the melanin-transfer in an ex vivo cultured skin of chicken embryo, where epidermal cells and melanocytes are expected to behave in a similar way to in vivo. In this system, embryonic melanocytes are genetically and stably labeled with a membrane-bound EGFP using transposon-mediated gene transfer technique (Sato et al., 2007. Dev. Biol.). This manipulation directly visualizes fine structures of dendrites of differentiated melanocytes. At early stages of melanin-synthesis, melanocytes actively elongate and continuously change their shape with dendrites both extending and retracting. As melanin-synthesis proceeds, these dendrites form blebs on the plasma membrane, and subsequently they release small membrane vesicles (0.5\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) to the extracellular space. Importantly, these vesicles contain melanin granules, and become incorporated into adjacent keratinocytes. Thus, melanin granules are transferred from melanocytes into keratinocytes via membrane vesicles. This is the first demonstration that the process of melanin transfer is directly visualized in the developing skin.",

     "abstract": "Neural tube closure is one of the most prominent morphogenetic events during vertebrate development with dynamic cell shape changes and reorganization of cells. These cell behaviors are observed not only in a forming neural tube (neural ectoderm) itself but also in epidermal (non-neural) ectoderm. Cells in the neural ectoderm undergo apical constriction and mediolateral intercalation, which allow the neural tissue to form a groove along the anteroposterior axis and converge toward the midline, respectively. Although the knowledge on cellular and molecular mechanisms within neural ectoderm during vertebrate neurulation is accumulating, contribution of non-neural ectoderm is not well understood. In tissue level, non-neural ectoderm intensively moves toward the dorsal side of the embryo, probably contributing to the actual closure event, and it has been shown by studies with chick embryos that explants of neural ectoderm isolated from non-neural ectoderm fail to form neural tube, demonstrating the importance of non-neural ectoderm for neural tube closure. To clarify cellular and molecular basis of non-neural ectoderm that contributes to neural tube closure, we have analyzed possible mechanisms that may generate a force causing the movements, using Xenopus laevis embryos as a vertebrate model system. We first tested a contribution of cell divisions by treating the embryos with hydroxyurea and aphidicolin (HUA), inhibitors for cell division, throughout neurulation. Time-lapse images and sections of fixed embryos revealed that neural tube closure of the HUA-treated embryos were indistinguishable from the untreated controls with cell divisions suppressed significantly, suggesting that cell divisions may be dispensable for the tube closure. We are currently examining other cellular mechanisms, including surface expansion, mediolateral and/or anteroposterior rearrangement, and radial intercalation of non-neural ectoderm cells, using digital scanned laser light sheet microscopy (DSLM) as one of powerful tools enabling live imaging of cell morphogenesis in neural tube closure.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "Gastrulation is one of the most important processes during the morphogenesis of early embryo, involving dynamic cell shape change and migration. In chordates, notochord, a rod-shape structure that contributes to body extension and neural tube formation, is formed by collective cell movements of the axial mesoderm (AM) through gastrulation. During notochord formation, AM cells become narrow along mediolateral (M\u2013L) axis and such polarized cells intercalate each other to extend the tissue along anterior\u2013posterior (A\u2013P) axis. This process, called convergent extension (CE), requires the establishment of cell polarity at the same time and in the same direction in AM. Although planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is essential for cell polarization and regulation of CE, little is known about how the polarity of AM cells is established collectively at the beginning of CE. During Xenopus gastrulation, leading edge mesoderm (LEM), positioned in front of the AM, attach to the blastocoel roof and migrate towards the animal pole. The LEM contributes to the directional migration of involuting marginal zone cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that anterior migration of the LEM generate the pulling force along A\u2013P direction, and the generated force stretch AM cells to establish M\u2013L cell polarity. To test this hypothesis, we first performed mesoderm migration assay in vitro and found that the LEM migrated faster than the AM. We measured the force generated by the LEM in vitro using thin glass pipette. The estimated force varied but ranged from tens to hundreds of nano-newtons. These results suggest that the LEM generate the pulling force to the AM in a significant order of force magnitude. Next, to test whether the pulling force induces collective cell polarization in the AM, we developed stretch assay system using a silicone chamber. To determine the magnitude of stretch force applied to the activin-induced AM on the scale same as we observed, we measured the Young\u2019s modulus of the AM using glass pipette and calculated the force by formula of Hooke\u2019s law. Using these methods, we estimated that 5\u201315% stretch is probably equal to LEM-generated force. We are currently examining the effect of such stretch on AM with comparable magnitudes of force generated by LEM, and determine if the stretching affects polarity formation process. This study might contribute to better understanding of the distribution of force fields and the function of mechanical factors in animal development.",

The neural plate develops bilateral neural folds, which in turn come into contact in the midline and fuse together to create the neural tube. Programmed cell death (PCD), especially apoptosis, is widely observed during the process. Several lines of evidence suggested that apoptosis is essential to complete cranial NTC. However, it is still unclear how apoptosis contributes to the completion of cranial NTC. To examine the relationship between dying cells and morphogenetic movement such as neural plate bending, fusion of neural ridge, and epithelial remodeling after the fusion, direct visualization of dying cells during NTC could be effective. We have conducted a live-imaging analysis of apoptosis during cranial NTC with the mouse embryo expressing SCAT3, a fluorescent indicator protein to monitor caspase-3 activation in living cells. In these embryos, caspase activation was observed in dying cells of the pre-fusion neural ridge, fusion point, and the post-fusion midline. Thus, this system allowed us to observe the dynamics of cranial NTC when caspase activation and apoptosis were inhibited. We found that the speed of closure tended to become slow under caspase-inhibited condition, suggesting that caspase activation and apoptosis contribute to the progression of neural tube closure within a limited developmental time window.",

To understand the mechanisms involved in left\u2013right asymmetrical morphogenesis, we are using the embryonic hindgut of Drosophila. To search for genes involved in the left\u2013right asymmetrical morphogenesis of the embryonic hindgut, we conducted a genome wide screen. From the screen, we identified DE-Cadherin (DE-Cad) and Myosin31DF (Myo31DF) mutants, which show randomized and reverse laterality of the hindgut, respectively. To get a mechanistic insight into how these two genes function during left\u2013right asymmetrical morphogenesis, we searched for instructive cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the left\u2013right asymmetrical morphogenesis. We found that the shape of epithelial cells of the hindgut is chiral with respect to the anterior\u2013posterior axis. This new type of cell chirality was named, planar cell chirality (PCC). PCC tended to be slanted to the left in wild-type flies. In Myo31DF mutant flies, PCC tended to be slanted to the right. DE-Cad mutants showed symmetrical PCC. Moreover, our in silico simulation suggested that PCC is sufficient for the left\u2013right asymmetric morphogenesis of the hindgut. These data suggest that PCC has an instructive role in the left\u2013right asymmetrical morphogenesis of the hindgut. In our genome wide genetic screens, we also identified extramacrochaetae (emc), as a gene involved in regulating the laterality of the embryonic hindgut. emc encodes a negative helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor involved in a diverse range of biological processes such as cell-fate determination. emc mutants showed symmetrical PCC. In addition, overexpression of Myo31DF and DE-Cad rescued the emc laterality defects, implying the Emc functions genetically upstream of Myo31DF and DE-Cadherin. In summary, we have identified emc as a new regulator of the hindgut left\u2013right asymmetry and suggested that emc functions upstream of DE-Cad and Myo31DF to regulate PCC.",

In the mammalian neocortex, each pyramidal neuron has a main thick dendrite towards the outer (pial) side of the brain wall, while it has an axon towards the opposite side (inside). Although the mechanism of axon vs. dendrite formation has extensively been studied in 2D dissociated-cell cultures containing neurons isolated from in vivo tissues, whether the preceding or accompanying in vivo cellular events such as the birth and migration of neurons and their layer formation are linked with this neuronal polarization process and if so how is unknown. Through time-lapse monitoring of young neurons migrating in mouse cerebral wall slices, we found that (1) some neurons start extension of axon-like fibers during their migration step but others became axonogenic during the following layer-forming step and (2) the main dendrite of each neuron grew (or was established through an apparent direct transition) from a preexisting process that had worked as a \u201cleading process\u201d (into which the nucleus can go) during neuronal migration. To gain insights into intracellular events during these morphogenetic transitions and neuronal polarization in vivo, we have been live monitoring the centrosome and Golgi apparatus in migrating or layer-forming neocortical neurons. In axonogenic neurons, we observed both centrosome and Golgi opposite to a growing axon, contrasting with 2D-cultured neurons having centrosome and Golgi on the axonal side. This pial (outer) localization of centrosome and Golgi in vivo also occurred when axon-free neurons were migrating towards the pial side; these organella existed at the base of the leading process. These results suggest that neuronal axonogenesis and dendritogenesis in vivo may proceed based on the morphological \u201chistory\u201d of each neuron, as well as synchronically occurring events such as layer formation, presumably under the influence of microenvironment.",

Cell density affects both, cell\u2013cell contacts and the cell shape, but the exact role of these latter cellular properties in regulating the Hippo pathway remains elusive. In this study, we examined the role of the cell shape on the Hippo pathway. To exclude the effects of cell\u2013cell contacts, individual NIH3T3 cells were cultured in small cell\u2013adhesive areas termed microdomains. The cell shape was changed according to the microdomains size. Nuclear localization of Yap was observed with large microdomains or corresponding flattened cells, but not with small microdomains resulting in the formation of round cells. Clear stress fiber formation was observed only in large microdomains concomitant with nuclear Yap. Disruption of F-actin by drug treatment reduced the nuclear localization of Yap and transcriptional activity of Tead irrespective of cell shape. Core components of the Hippo pathway (upstream to downstream) are Merlin, Mst, Lats, Yap and Tead. When activity of the Hippo pathway was blocked by the expression of a dominant negative form of Merlin, Yap stayed in the nucleus, even when F-actin was disrupted. These results suggest that F-actin regulates the Hippo pathway upstream of Merlin, and that the cell shape regulates the Hippo pathway independent of cell\u2013cell contacts by controlling the amount of F-actin.",

     "abstract": "Melanin pigmentation in the skin is crucial for protecting our body from UV irradiation. Melanins are synthesized by melanocytes within an intracellular organelle, called melanosome. The melanosomes are subsequently transferred to neighboring cells (keratinocytes) that eventually become pigmented. Thus, understanding how the melanosome-transfer is regulated is an important issue in developmental biology, cancer biology (melanoma), and also in cosmetic treatment. The melanosome-transfer has been proposed to be regulated by interactions between melanocytes and keratinocytes. However, little direct evidence at the molecular level has been available due to a lack of model system. It would be useful if neighboring melanocytes and keratinocytes are genetically manipulated. We have recently developed a long-term manipulation of melanocytes in late-stage embryos with transposon-mediated gene transfer, and also optimized a condition for ex-vivo culture of skin taken from such embryos. Combining with high resolution time-laps live imaging techniques, we have observed that melanosomes are transferred from EGFP-labeled melanocytes into a neighboring keratinocyte. Toward understanding how such melanosome-transfer is regulated by the keratinocyte, we have further developed a novel method where melanocytes and their neighboring keratinocytes are separately manipulated with exogenous genes, i.e. EGFP-melanocytes and Tomato-keratinocytes. EGFP cDNA is electroporated into early neural crest cells, precursors of melanocytes, of stage12 embryo. The same embryo is subsequently electroporated with Tomato cDNA into the epidermal ectoderm (precursor of keratinocytes). Such successive electroporation into two distinct origins of tissues allows melanocytes and keratinocytes to be labeled with EGFP and Tomato, respectively. Furthermore, we have observed an EGFP-melanocyte and Tomato-keratinocyte are adjacent to each other in the skin at later stages of development. This method has established a basis for manipulation of the two important cell types with candidate genes that are expected to regulate melanosome-transfer.",

However the precise mechanism by which Pk controls these biological processes remains largely unknown.To dissect and elucidate the biological functions of Pk in further detail, we have constructed a series of Pk deletion variants and tested their activities. We found that expression of a variant that lacks LIM and PET domains induces excess actin-dependent filopodia-like processes in Xenopus animal caps and HEK293 cells. This version of Pk localises to these processes. On the other hand, in animal caps expressing another variant which lacks the middle portion, cells became dissociated from each other, indicating inhibited cell adhesion.

     "abstract": "Wnt proteins are highly conserved secreted proteins that are essential for development in all metazoan organisms. Wnt proteins bind to cell surface receptors and activates the \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways. The \u03b2-catenin-dependent pathway regulates cell proliferation and differentiation through the regulation of target gene expression. The \u03b2-catenin-independent pathway is involved in cell migration and polarity. Knockout mouse studies revealed that both the \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways of Wnt signaling are important in the epithelial morphogenesis of tubular organs such as the lungs, kidneys, guts, and mammary glands, but its molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Epithelial cells established apical\u2013basal polarity and formed cyst with central lumen in three-dimensional culture. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased the size of cyst through the promotion of cell proliferation. Although Wnt3a, which is a representative ligand that activates the \u03b2-catenin-dependent pathway, did not affect cyst morphogenesis, combination of Wnt3a and EGF induced tube-like branching morphogenesis. Treatment with EGF and blebbistatin, a Myosin II inhibitor, induced branching morphogenesis similar to that induced by EGF and Wnt3a. Blebbistatin inhibited phosphorylation of paxillin, which is a component of focal adhesions. Knockdown of \u03b2-catenin or LRP6, which is a receptor of Wnt3a, inhibited branching morphogenesis induced by Wnt3a. Wnt5a, which is a representative ligand that activates the \u03b2-catenin-independent pathway, did not affect cyst morphology in the presence or absence of EGF. Knockdown of Wnt5a inhibited the formation of apical membrane domain of epithelial cells. ECM signaling from the basal cell surface is important for the decision of apical\u2013basal polarity. Wnt5a was observed at the basal cell surface and Ror2, a Wnt5a receptor specifically localized basolateral cell surface in epithelial cyst. These results indicate that both the \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways of Wnt signaling are involved in the regulation of epithelial polarity and morphogenesis through the distinct mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Cells within all multicellular organisms are surrounded by a heterogeneous mixture of macromolecules, collectively known as the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is synthesised and organised by cells, providing them with a substrate to interact with, spaces to migrate through and cell\u2013ECM engagement also directly impacts cell polarisation, proliferation, survival and differentiation. ECM molecules are present from the earliest stages of embryo development and the developmentally regulated dynamics of ECM assembly and degradation play key roles in many embryological processes. In this study we addressed how fibronectin, laminin and chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans are deposited in the early (HH12\u201315) chick embryo, focusing on the developing mesodermal regions and the neural tube. We find that fibronectin is the first ECM molecule to form a complex ECM. Although present in the interstitial space, fibrillar fibronectin matrices are more prominent lining epithelioid (somites, notochord and intermediate mesoderm) and epithelial (neural tube) tissues, before any assembled basement membrane is detected. However, as these epithelioid/epithelial tissues develop, laminin is progressively assembled on their surface. Assembly starts in small patches localized in fibronectin-poor areas and with developmental time, these patches grow in size until the tissues are lined with a laminin basement membrane. Inhibition of fibronectin assembly leads to abnormal cell polarization and containment, suggesting that the fibronectin matrix is essential for the initial epithelial development of these tissues, before the appearance of the basement membrane. Although the interstitial spaces of HH12\u201315 embryos are only partially filled with a fibronectin matrix, we find that chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans are progressively deposited in these spaces and appear to play a role in separating the early tissue units. In agreement with this, treatment of cultured chick embryo explants with chondroitinase ABC leads to the collapse of all extracellular space and to mesodermal tissue deformations. We conclude that fibronectin matrices play an important role in polarizing cells and containing cell movements in young epithelia before a laminin-containing basement membrane forms, while chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans are crucial for maintaining interstitial spaces. The developmental deposition of these ECMs is thus essential for the correct morphogenesis of the early embryo.",

Sox10 is a transcription factor required for the maintenance of pluripotency and survival of eNCSCs during enteric nervous system (ENS) development. SOX10 mutations disrupt NCSCs development and result in Waardenburg\u2013Hirschsprung (WS4) disease, which displays varying degrees of intestinal aganglionosis, pigmentation and hearing defects. To elucidate the role of Sox10 in migration of eNCSCs, and to understand how the impaired function contributes to gut aganglionosis, we generated a novel WS4 mouse mutant Sox10NGFP where EGFP reporter was fused to the N-terminal region of Sox10. EGFP expression in Sox10NGFP mice recaptured the dynamics of Sox10 expression during development. Neurospheres of mutant eNCSCs exhibited reduced proliferation capability as demonstrated by BrdU incorporation assay. The mean size of mutant neurospheres was significantly reduced compared with wildtype control. Using time-lapse imaging, we found that migratory eNCSCs in Sox10NGFP/+ mutants displayed altered trajectories and reduced migration speed compared to Wnt1cre/ZEG control. Explant culture, assays that determine the advancement of eENCCs in normal/abnormal gut environment, indicated that migration defects in Sox10NGFP/+ mice occurred in a cell-autonomous manner. Together, these findings suggested that Sox10 mutation impaired the proliferation and migration capability of eNCSCs. The abnormal migration behavior of mutant eNCSCs restricted the colonization of eNCSC along the gut wall, and contributed to aganglionosis in mutant guts.",

To investigate the biological significance of CaMKId during zebrafish embryogenesis, we cloned and characterized two splice variants of zebrafish CaMKI\u03b4, zCaMKI\u03b4-L (392 AA) and zCaMKI\u03b4-S (368 AA). Although recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed weak protein kinase activities, they were activated when phosphorylated by mouse Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase alpha. Activated CaMKI\u03b4 significantly phosphorylated various proteins including CREB, histones, and myelin basic protein in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. In COS7 cells, transiently expressed zCaMKI\u03b4-L and zCaMKI\u03b4-S were localized in the cytoplasm as in case of mouse CaMKI\u03b4. During zebrafish embryogenesis, zCaMKI\u03b4-L and zCaMKI\u03b4-S were detected in the embryos after 36 and 60\u00a0hpf, respectively, by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Western blotting analysis in adult zebrafish demonstrated wide expression of zCaMKI\u03b4-L in the brain, eyes, ovary, and skeletal muscle. In contrast, zCaMKI\u03b4-S specifically localized in the brain. The knockdown of the zCaMKI\u03b4 genes with morpholino-based antisense oligonucleotides resulted in an increase of abnormal embryos with small heads, and this phenotype was rescued by coinjection with recombinant zCaMKI\u03b4 but not with kinase-dead mutant.

The visceral endoderm, a single cell-layered tissue sustaining embryonic growth through nutrients/gas exchange and participating in the axis determination by orchestrating various signalling cascades, exhibits high activity of endocytosis. The apical vacuoles are large digestive compartments located to the apical cytoplasm, and their limiting membranes were positive for lysosome and late endosome marker proteins. We focused on the membrane dynamics of these subcellular compartments to find that the delivery of endosomes to the apical vacuoles involves unique, microautophagy-like process. Mutant embryos with defects in the membrane transport failed to complete gastrulation.

In order to ensure the correct formation of body plan, there must be genetic and developmental mechanisms that link and coordinately regulate the establishment of the DV and AP axes. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these interactions remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that the forkhead box transcription factor FoxB1, which is upregulated by the neuralizing factor XOct-25 (Takebayashi-Suzuki et al., Mech. Dev., 2007), plays an essential role for the formation of the DV and AP axes. Overexpression of FoxB1 promotes neural induction and inhibits BMP-dependent epidermal differentiation in ectodermal explants, thereby regulating the DV patterning of the ectoderm. In addition, FoxB1 was also found to promote the formation of posterior neural tissue, and the posteriorizing effects of FoxB1 require Wnt signal activation, indicating that FoxB1 is also involved in AP axis patterning via the Wnt pathway. Loss-of-function analysis of FoxB1 confirmed that FoxB1 regulates the establishment of the DV and AP axes in Xenopus ectoderm. Importantly, we show evidence that FoxB1 functionally interacts with its upstream factor XOct-25 and plays an essential role in induction and/or maintenance of neural tissue. Our results suggest that FoxB1 contributes to a mechanism that fine tunes and leads to the coordinated formation of the DV and AP axes during early development.",

However, the precise mechanisms by which HS chains regulate the activity of growth factors in complex mammalian morphogenetic processes remain to be elucidated. Here, we identified the transgene insertion allele of Ext2, a gene causative of multiple hereditary exostoses that catalyzes the elongation of HS chains. Marker expression analyses of Ext2-deficient embryos revealed that HS chains are essential for the response to Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and, in particular, for the local distribution of FGF ligands in the extraembryonic ectoderm. Moreover, the expression of HS chains attached to the cell surface is specific to those areas in which FGF signaling is potentially active. Additional fine mosaic studies with single-cell resolution involving chimeras suggested that the expression of cell surface-attached HS-chains is crucial for early embryonic development. Given that 22 FGF ligands, 4 FGF receptors, and 12 membrane-associated core proteins are redundantly expressed, we propose that the spatially and temporally localized expression of HS-chains attached to cell surfaces also contributes to FGF signaling distribution during mammalian morphogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Efficient definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation is essential for the generation of hepatocytes from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which are in demand for drug development and clinical application. However, this has been hindered as signaling pathways regulating the differentiation remain unclear. Therefore, understanding the signaling pathways controlling DE formation is important for differentiation of hESCs to hepatic lineages. Generation of DE through the initial formation of mesendoderm is activin-dependent differentiation. Further induction by higher concentration of Activin A gives rise to DE, whereas lower concentration favors mesoderm lineage. On the other hand, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which is important for ESCs self-renew were shown to be potent inhibitors of the differentiation. It has been shown that supression of PI3K signaling efficiently promotes differentiation of hESCs into mesendoderm and then DE in conditioned medium. However, the differentiation efficiency and molecular mechanism underlying the mesendoderm and DE differentiation cannot be clearly addressed in this culture condition. Therefore, in this study, we have used chemically defined medium to assess differentiation potential by supression of PI3K in combination with Activin A. In this study, we demonstrate that suppression of PI3K signal in H1 hESCs causes downregulation of pluripotency marker (Oct4 and Sox2) and induces mesendoderm/endoderm gene expression (Brachyury, Gata 6 and FoxA2). Treatment of hESCs with combined Activin A (100\u00a0ng/ml) and PI3K inhibitor, Ly 294002 (20\u00a0\u03bcM) increased expression of mesendoderm and endoderm markers (Brachury, GSC, FOxA2, Sox17 and Wnt3a) several fold higher than that of Activin A (100\u00a0ng/ml) alone. As a result of improved DE formation, combined treatments also improved hepatocytes production, exhibited higher level of hepatic gene expression and increased Cyp3A4 activity (four-fold higher) than those derived from the treatment with activin alone. These results suggest that repression of PI3K is necessary for efficient DE differentiation and subsequently for the hepatocyte generation.",

It regulates formation of the M\u00fcllerian duct and suppresses androgen synthesis during ovarian development. The conventional Wnt-4 knock-out is lethal soon after the birth. In order to avoid the postnatal lethality and to study potential later functions of Wnt-4 in the ovary and reproductive duct development we have generated a conditional Wnt-4 knock-out allele by gene targeting technique. The Wnt-4flox/\u2212 mice were crossed with the Amhr2Cre/+::Wnt-4flof/flox mice to obtain conditional Wnt-4 knock-out mice. The efficiency of the average inactivation of the floxed allele was around 74% as judged by qRT-PCR. In case of conditional Wnt-4 inactivation the ovarian size and weight were not affected after the birth but in the aging mice the ovarian weight increased by 40% mostly due to hypertrophied corpora lutea. In many of the cases the amount of follicles was not changed significantly. However when deletion efficiency was relatively high the follicles did not mature to the antral stages. Two oocytes containing follicles were frequently observed in Wnt-4 knock-out ovaries. The estrous-circle was also disturbed, the diestrus was prolonged and fertility was reduced by 63% in comparison to wild-type mice. The qRT-PCR showed decreased expression of KitL where as expression of Bmp15, Gdf9 and Nobox was not changed significantly. We also fate mapped the cell lineages generated from the cells that express Wnt-4 gene normally by using a GFPCre knock in allele to the Wnt-4 locus. These studies revealed the Wnt-4 expressive cells generated most of the follicular cells. The kidneys of the Wnt-4 deficient mice were compromised. As the Amhr2Cre recombines a floxed reporter also in the kidney of an adult we draw a conclusion that Wnt-4 has a signaling role in the adult kidney as well. The hypomorphic Wnt-4 mCherry knock-in allele demonstrated severe follicular defects that lead to reduced fertility. We conclude that Wnt-4 signaling maintains female fertility by supporting maturation of the follicle and is essential for proper kidney function in the adult.",

     "abstract": "The mammary gland is a unique organ in its ability to undergo repetitive cycles of growth, differentiation, function and involution in the mature adult. These processes depend upon a pool of committed multipotent cells that undergo asymmetric division to give rise to more differentiated progeny that proliferate at the onset of gestation. It is normally not possible to access these cells from lactating women to generate primary mammary epithelial cultures for research as surgical intervention is rare during lactation. We have identified cells expressing markers for multipotent mammary epithelial cells (CD49f, CD24 and p63) in human breastmilk samples. These primary mammary epithelial cells (PMEC) can be expanded and manipulated in epithelial-specific monolayer culture to produce differentiated cells expressing luminal (CK18) and myoepithelial (CK14) markers. Using the immortalised non-tumorigenic mammary line MCF10A and tumorigenic mammary line MDA231 as a comparison, we show that PMEC have a distinctive response to extra-cellular matrix (ECM) and growth and functional regulators. In monolayer culture PMEC bypass replicative senescence at day 8 in response to ethanolamine and hormones prolactin, placental lactogen and RANKL, while immortal lines show no response in their rapid growth pattern. In three-dimensional ECM culture PMEC and MCF10A produce alveolus-like structures that maintain a basal layer of CD49f-positive cells and a luminal layer of CK18-positive cells, while MDA231 form disorganized invasive colonies. Uniquely, PMEC also produce hallmark milk proteins beta-casein and alpha-lactalbumin in response to prolactin stimulation in the luminal secretory layer. These data imply that the cell population expanded during lactation is receptive to distinct stimuli that results in differentiation in ways not observed in cells taken from the non-lactating gland. We demonstrate that human milk is a non-invasive source of these cells, providing a tool for further research into the specific pathways that regulate differentiation. Using such models may be useful to further understand mechanisms that underlie mammary gland pathologies.",

Here we show that tightly controlled extracellular distribution of Dpp, rather than its expression pattern, correlates with complex wing vein patterns in two distantly related species, the Dipteran Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and the Hymenopteran Athalia rosae (sawfly). In Drosophila, directional diffusion and active retention of Dpp localize the signal in future wing veins through BMP binding proteins, Short gastrulation (Sog) and Crossveinless (Cv), and through BMP type I receptor Thickvein (Tkv) and unknown positive feedback mechanisms, respectively. In sawfly, Dpp signal also reflects more complex wing vein patterns and loss of Cv by RNAi fails to establish both distinct fore- and hind-wing vein patterns. These results suggest that diversified insect wing vein patterns are acquired through directional Dpp diffusion at the extracellular space. Changes in extracellular regulation of secreted growth factors may be a general mechanism for creating evolutionarily diversified patterns.",

     "abstract": "Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling is one of the noncanonical Wnt pathways which regulates cell polarity and cell movement in many biological systems. The signaling components of this pathway, including Wnt, Frizzled, Dishevelled (Dsh) and Prickle (Pk) are called PCP proteins. It has been shown that polarized subcellular localizations of PCP proteins are essential for regulating cell polarity in some tissues such as Drosophila wing epithelial cells and sensory hair cells of the mouse inner ear. In these cells, cytoplasmic PCP proteins Dsh and Pk localize to the opposite sides of the cell according to the tissue polarity. This suggests that the mechanism to regulate PCP protein distribution may be evolutionarily conserved. In Xenopus development, it is known that Dsh, Pk and other PCP proteins play essential roles in gastrulation movements, but the molecular function and the regulatory mechanism of PCP proteins are pooly understood. In order to know the function of Pk, we searched for Pk-interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening. Interesetingly, some of the proteins identified in this assay are related to the ubiquitin system including components of cullin-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. We detected Pk ubiquitination in Xenopus embryos and this ubiquitination seemed to regulate the localization of Pk. We found that Pk and Dsh were segregated on the plasma membrane in a Wnt signal-dependent manner and that this segregation required the function of the ubiquitination system. We are currently investigating the regulatory mechanism of Pk and Dsh localization by ubiqutination, and the role of the ubiquitin system in Wnt/PCP signaling will be discussed.",

While genetic studies often discover functional compensation between paralog genes, little is known about regulatory mechanisms underlying their interactions. In this study we addressed this issue by studying regulation of vertebrate Pax2, Pax5 and Pax8 genes that have evolved from a single ancestral gene of early cephalochordates and exhibit overlapping but different expression during eye, ear, brain and kidney development. Comparison of human, chicken and Xenopus genomic sequences in the Pax2/5/8 loci and high-throughput transgenic analysis in Xenopus identified 16 enhancers for Pax2, 7 for Pax5, and 3 for Pax8. Interestingly, Pax5 and Pax8 are associated with enhancers that are active in the tissues expressing Pax2, but not Pax5 or Pax8. One of such Pax5 enhancers, which is active in the pronephros, shares sequence features with a Pax2 pronephric enhancer. These two appear to have evolved from the common ancestral enhancer through the genome duplication. This Pax5 enhancer implied a hidden potential of this gene to be activated in the pronephros, and we actually found that Pax2-knockdowned embryos express Pax5 in the pronephros to rescue expression of WT1, a downstream target of Pax2 in normal embryos. These results revealed a dynamic balancing mechanism between the paralogs, which involves ectopic gene activation and may reflect regulatory mechanisms of their ancestral gene.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that epigenetic modifications, such as histone methylation, histone acetylation and DNA methylation, play fundamental roles in gene expression from the genome. Among them, the trimethylation/demethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) is associated with silencing/activation of some developmental regulatory genes, such as Hox clusters. In mammals, the trimethylation of H3K27 is mediated by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that consists of three core subunits, Ezh2, Eed and Suz12 proteins, whereas the demethylation is mediated by Jmjd3 and Utx proteins. We isolated Xenopus orthologs of Ezh2, Eed, Jmjd3 and Utx, and examined their expression and function to explore roles for the H3K27 trimethylation/demethylation in frog development. Their expression all initially localizes in the animal hemisphere at the blastula stages, and subsequently remains faintly in the ectoderm at the gastrula stages. After the neural tube closure, expression of Ezh2, Eed, Jmjd3 and Utx becomes remarkable in the brain, eye, spinal cord, and migrating head neural crest cells. Overexpression of either Ezh2 or Jmjd3 perturbed expression of neural crest genes, Slug and Twist, but did not apparently affect gene expression in the central nervous system, such as Otx2 and Six3 in the forebrain and midbrain, Krox20 in the hindbrain, and HoxB9 in the spinal cord, at the neurula stages. Alcian blue staining revealed that these over-expressed embryos later developed abnormal cranial cartilage structures at the tadpole stages. These results showed that both the genes for trimethylation and demethylation of H3K27 are co-expressed in the neural tissues, and suggests that the regulated balance between these two activities is critical for the neural crest development.",

Recently, it has been shown that the presence of 10\u2013200\u00a0\u00b5g/ml vitamin C (Vc) improves efficiency tenfold in generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in mice and humans (Esteban et al., 2009). It has been suggested that Vc may overcome the senescence roadblock during the reprogramming process in iPS generation, probably independent of its function as an antioxidant. Currently, this improvement is thought to result from alleviating cell senescence via P53 repression. Furthermore, Vc promotes the transition of pre-iPS cells to a fully reprogrammed state. Here, we examined whether addition of Vc can improve SCNT development. First we tested how addition of Vc to culture media affects parthenogenetic embryonic development. It was found that the presence of 10\u00a0mg/ml Vc in parthenogenetic oocyte activation killed all of the oocytes. In contrast, less than 0.1\u00a0mg/ml Vc kept embryos viable through preimplantation development with similar blastocyst rates (90%), suggesting that the presence of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml Vc does not interfere preimplantation development. Next, we applied of 0.1\u00a0mg/ml Vc to SCNT embryos in order to improve development. Unfortunately the addition of Vc did not improve, but rather worsened it (39% vs. 30% for control and Vc-treated embryos). Finally, we confirmed the expression of p53 during the preimplantation. Taken together, these results indicate that in contrast to iPS generation, inhibition of p53 does not enhance reprogramming of somatic cells in SCNT, suggesting different rate-limiting steps in the reprogramming pathway of these two reprogramming technologies or/and also their different reprogramming mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "A large fraction of eukaryote genomes is occupied by transposable elements (TEs). TEs move around within the genome in a cell and so have the potential to cause harmful mutations, chromosomal rearrangement, sterility, and other disorders. Hence, silencing TEs is essential for living organisms. Recent studies show that silencing TEs in germlines involves a subset of small RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are mainly derived from TEs. In Drosophila, several genes, including maelstrom (mael), are involved in piRNA biogenesis; however, their functions remain elusive. To understand the molecular function of mael in piRNA biogenesis, we identified proteins that physically interact with Mael in ovaries. A centrosomal protein, Cnn (centrosomin), and a heterodimer consisting of Msps (mini spindles) and TACC (transforming acidic coiled-coil protein) are Mael-interacting proteins. Cnn and the Msps\u2013TACC complex are required for efficient microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) formation. These findings strongly suggest the involvement of mael in microtubule organization. Examination of mael mutants by immunofluorescence analyses revealed a failure of proper MTOC formation in oocytes and the mis-localization of Cnn and gamma-tubulin, a centrosome indicator, simultaneous with the mis-localization of oocytes in egg chambers. Thus, mael is necessary for the proper localization of MTOC component proteins and MTOC formation during oogenesis.Also in a cultured Drosophila somatic Schneider2 (S2) cells Mael is expressed. This cell line is, therefore, a useful tool to understand the involvement of mael in the cell division and mitotic spindle dynamics. Mael was depleted in S2 cells that express GFP-\u03b1-tubulin by RNAi and time-lapse microscopy was performed. Our preliminary experiments showed that depletion of Mael in S2 cells causes arrest in mitosis. We will discuss the possible requirement of Mael in the regulation of centrosome- and/or microtubule-organization at this meeting.",

     "abstract": "Gene therapy is a promising strategy to treat certain inherited disorders. In that context, lentiviral vectors (LV) have been used in ex vivo protocols for the stable gene-modification of hematopoietic stem cells. There are concerns about the potential genotoxicity of integrative vectors such as LV. So far, these concerns have only been envisioned as resulting from unwanted genomic insertion leading to insertional mutagenesis. At present, there has been no investigation of potential epigenetic modification induced by the procedure of gene transfer into stem cells. Epigenetic changes are known to be induced in cells following culture and stress. This prompted us to investigate if the procedure used for ex vivo lentiviral transduction which involves a period of cytokine pre-activation prior to LV infection, could induce epigenetic alterations in human CD34+ haematopoietic/progenitor cells. The expression of a panel of known epigenetic proteins was explored by immunohistochemical analysis at initiation of the treatment, post-stimulation and post-infection of umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells. To measure the patterns and levels of expression of these proteins in the cell population and to account for the heterogeneity of the CD34+ cell population, we used high throughput image analysis with the Cell Profiler Software. As expected, the cytokine pre-activation of the cells led to a heterogeneous up regulation of several proteins known to be involved in metabolic changes and stress response. Importantly, the systematic analysis of up to 30 morphological features per cell indicated that lentiviral infection itself had a distinct effect than those of cytokines. Cells infected with the LV displayed significantly different and more heterogenous phenotypic profiles compared to non-transduced cells or pre-activated only cells. These constitute the first observations to our knowledge that ex vivo lentiviral transduction of hematopoietic cells may induce epigenetic changes. Our data suggest that lentiviral transduction may represent a stress for the cell leading to an \u201cepigenetic storm\u201d which could induce variable deregulation of certain genes in the cells. We show that these effects could be monitored and further experiments are ongoing to evaluate the impact of different experimental conditions on such epigenetic changes.",

     "abstract": "An increasing number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) has been identified. Targets of ncRNAs include not only mRNA, but also genomic DNA. It can be hypothesized that ncRNAs derived from gene regulatory regions are involved in sequence-specific alterations of epigenetic processes. We discovered novel endogenous polyA+ ncRNAs (>200 nt in size) derived from promoter regions in a rat phenochromocytoma, PC12, and a fibroblast cell line, NRK. We named them promoter-associated ncRNAs (pancRNAs). In three neural genes, Map2b, Nefl and Vim, antisense but not sense pancRNAs were involved in setting open chromatin structures by altering DNA methylation and histone modification status. These results suggest that a fraction of naturally occurring pancRNAs function at cis-regulatory elements as a single-stranded form. Using promoter microarrays, we systematically identified changes in antisense pancRNA expression during the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF treatment. We identified 402 and 919 pancRNAs in undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells, respectively. Of these, 49 were specifically expressed in undifferentiated PC12 cells, whereas 555 were specifically expressed in differentiated PC12 cells. Interestingly, about 80% of the pancRNA-bearing genes contained CpG islands in their promoter regions. Therefore, hundreds of polyA+ RNAs may function to maintain and/or change the cellular status by their association with gene regulatory regions. We are now investigating the potential of these novel cell-state-specific pancRNAs especially for epigenetic setting.",

     "abstract": "During spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic stage of spermatogenesis, the chromatin structure of spermatid undergoes dramatic changes: histones are replaced with transition proteins and subsequently with protamines, and the global chromatin is highly condensed. Histone acetylation results in a loose nucleosomal structure, and is believed to facilitate this chromatin transformation. Histone hyperacetylation emerges from step 8 round spermatid and elongating spermatid which are the initial steps of chromatin reorganization. The mechanisms responsible for this global histone modification are poorly understood. Here we showed that the deletion of murine Enhancer of Polycomb 1 (Epc1, a homologue of Drosophila Epc whose mutations enhancing the phenotypes of other Polycomb group mutants) resulted in an arrest of spermiogenesis at step 7 round spermatid coincidently with an evanescence of histone hyperacetylation. We further found that Epc1 associated with a histone acetyltransferase Tip60 in testis, and the depletion of Epc1 severely disrupted the distribution of Tip60. In some individuals, a few spermatids escaped from the arrest and their chromatin was recaptured with acetylated histones and incorporated with transition protein 2, although their levels were much lower than normal elongating spermatids. Treatment with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, also increased the incorporation of transition protein 2 into Epc1\u2212/\u2212 spermatids. These data demonstrated that Epc1 associating with Tip60 plays an important role in histone hyperacetylation during male germ cell development.",

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play critical roles in regulation of histone acetylation but also act on non-histone substrates. It is reported that the developmental rate of cloned embryos is significantly improved by treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor. In contrast, the developmental rate of fertilized embryo is decreased after TSA treatment. Currently it has been assumed that TSA treatment induces hyperacetylation of histones which changes gene regulations. However, TSA treatment can also have impact on acetylation level of non-histone proteins, for example p53 and tubulin which may contribute to the embryonic development. To elucidate the functions of HDAC in the early development and reprogramming it is important to clarify the acetylation states of these non histone proteins in TSA-treated embryos.In this study, we investigated the acetylation levels in unfertilized oocytes as well as in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos and parthenogenetic developed (PG) embryos after 10\u00a0h activation by immunostaining using anti-acetylated-Lysine antibody and anti-acetylated-alpha-Tubulin antibody. Our results showed hyperacetylation in pronuclei of IVF embryos and PG embryos. Additionally, by TSA treatment, acetylation of pronuclei was accelerated by over 1.5 times and that of cytoplasm was accelerated by over 2 times in both IVF embryos and PG embryos. Interestingly, comparison of the acetylation levels between male and female pronuclei in IVF embryos revealed acetylation level of male pronuclei significantly higher than that of female pronuclei, and this difference remained even with TSA treatment. Furthermore, we have shown that acetylation of tubulin is accelerated by both activation and TSA treatment. These results show that the acetylation state of embryos, including histone and non-histone proteins, was changed by activation. Especially, we have demonstrated that alpha-tubulin which constructs spindle in MII oocytes also constructs cytoskeleton in IVF embryos and PG embryos by activation. In addition, our results suggest that there is the possibility that the acetylation level of non-histone proteins also accelerated by the acetylation level of cytoplasm. Furthermore, the difference of the acetylation level between male and female pronuclei was not affected by HDAC activity because the difference was not cancelled out by TSA treatment.",

The PIWI-piRNA complex silences transposable elements and other genes that show complementarities to the piRNA sequences. Without functions of PIWI proteins and piRNAs, transposable elements become active, which has high potential to injure the genome. Thus, both PIWI proteins and piRNAs are essential for maintenance of genomic integrity and germline development. piRNA in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells (OSCs) are generated only through the primary processing pathway and are loaded onto Piwi, a member of PIWI proteins. However, factors required for the primary piRNA processing remain elusive. We focused on elucidating the mechanism of the primary processing pathway using the OSC line, which we have established from the female germline stem cell/ovarian somatic sheet (fGS/OSS) line, and found that primary piRNA biogenesis occur through Yb bodies, cytoplasmic structures that have been previously implicated in RNA processing. armitage (armi), a gene encoding an ATP-dependent RNA helicase, is necessary for primary piRNA biogenesis in OSCs. Armi localizes Piwi to Yb bodies by associating with Piwi and Yb, the main component of Yb bodies. piRNA intermediates are loaded onto the Armi-Piwi complex and processed into mature piRNAs. Loss of Yb caused depletion of Yb bodies and resulted in a reduction in overall piRNA levels. Yb bodies also impacted piRNA intermediates production, suggesting that they play important roles in primary piRNA biogenesis. zucchini (zuc), a gene encoding a putative cytoplasmic nuclease, is involved in processing piRNA intermediates into mature piRNAs. Without Armi, Yb or Zuc, Piwi is not loaded with piRNAs and does not localize to nucleus. A Piwi mutant that lacks the nuclear localization signal and therefore is not localized in the nucleus failed to silence transposons. These data suggest that Armi, Yb and Zuc are required for primary piRNA biogenesis and Piwi function. We further identified components of Yb bodies other than Armi and Yb and cloned piRNA intermediates. We will discuss in detail primary piRNA biogenesis based on our analyses.",

     "abstract": "Background: Since the first successful report of cloned mammals after nuclear transfer of somatic cells in sheep in 1997, cloned animals of various species have been produced. Generally, somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is performed with non-activated metaphase II (MII) oocytes as recipients, because activation of oocytes has adverse effects on the developmental potential of SCNT oocytes. Rat oocytes are spontaneously activated soon after ovulation, but Zhou et al. successfully cloned the first rat by SCNT using the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to inhibit spontaneous oocyte activation (2003. Science 302, 1179). To date, however, this is the only report of a cloned rat by SCNT, indicating that successful cloning of rat SCNT depends on other unknown factors as well. Here we examined several factors affecting the developmental potential of rat SCNT embryos aimed at establishing reliable procedures for successful rat SCNT. Methods and results: First, we examined the effect of MG132 on spontaneous activation of rat oocytes. The oocytes (from 3- to 5-week-old Sprague Dawley rats) maintained developmental potential after parthenogenetic activation for at least 4\u00a0h in 5\u00a0\u00b5M MG132-supplemented medium. Long exposure of SCNT oocytes to MG132 before activation affected the developmental potential due to spindle abnormalities. SCNT oocytes receiving fresh cumulus cells as nuclear donors with short-duration exposure to MG132 had a high cleavage rate, and several oocytes developed to the blastocyst stage, but the rate was very low, with or without treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), which improves the developmental potential of SCNT oocytes in mouse and bovine. When donor cells were cultured before SCNT, reconstituted oocytes developed to the 4-cell stage at a higher rate than non-cultured oocytes, even those of the same cell origin, and some oocytes developed to the blastocyst stage. To improve the developmental potential of rat SCNT oocytes, not only should spontaneous activation be avoided, but donor preparation, epigenetic modification, and in vitro culture conditions should also be examined.",

Failure of asymmetric cell division can result in their hyperproliferation, a phenotype resembling brain tumors. During asymmetric division of neural stem cells, several proteins controlling the self-renewal vs differentiation decision, including the differentiation factor Numb, are asymmetrically localized and preferentially segregated into one daughter cell. Polo kinase was previously identified as a brain tumor suppressor that mediates the asymmetric localization and segregation of Numb by phosphorylating Pon, an adaptor protein for Numb. We have identified Drosophila Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a brain tumor-suppressor that can inhibit self-renewal of neuroblasts. Supernumerary larval brain neuroblasts are generated at the expense of differentiated neurons in PP2A mutants. The PP2A heterotrimeric complex composed of the catalytic subunit (Mts), scaffold subunit (PP2A-29B), and a B regulatory subunit (Tws), is required for the asymmetric cell division of neuroblasts. PP2A complex regulates asymmetric localization of Numb, Pon and atypical protein kinase C as well as proper mitotic spindle orientation. Interestingly, PP2A and Polo kinase enhance Numb and Pon phosphorylation. PP2A, like Polo, acts to prevent excess neuroblast self-renewal primarily by regulating asymmetric localization/activation of Numb. Reduction of PP2A function in larval brains or S2 cells causes a marked decrease in Polo transcript and protein abundance. Overexpression of Polo or Numb significantly suppresses neuroblast overgrowth in PP2A mutants, suggesting that PP2A inhibits excess neuroblast self-renewal in Polo/Numb pathway. We will also discuss about novel players in asymmetric division that we have identified from genetics screens.",

It was previously shown that in macrophages, MIF binds to a complex of CD74 and CD44.

Moreover, we found that in neurospheres MIF increases the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, AMPK, and Stat3 (Ser727) which are known as factors supporting the cell survival, proliferation and/or maintenance of NSPCs.

The embryonic neocortex contains two main types of neural precursors, apical progenitors (APs) and more lineage committed basal progenitors (BPs), whose expansion is believed to contribute to an increase in cortical thickness and cortical surface area, respectively, during development and evolution of the mammalian brain. The length of the cell cycle is known to influence the switch from proliferative to neuron-generating divisions of neural stem and progenitor cells. Specifically, G1 phase was shown to lengthen during neuron-generating divisions and a shortening of G1 by overexpression of the cdk4/cyclinD1 complex was shown to promote the expansion of BPs. These observations suggest that an increase in cortical surface area and, in principle, generation of mice with gyrencephalic brains, could be achieved by controlling the expression of cdk/cyclin complexes during cortical development. Therefore, we generated transgenic mouse lines for the tissue-specific, inducible, and temporally controlled overexpression of cdks/cyclins in neural precursors and investigated the effect of these manipulations on brain development, cytoarchitecture and size.

We have recently showed that natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A), which is a specific receptor for atrial and brain natriuretic peptide (ANP and BNP), is expressed in preimplantation embryos and in murine ES cells. In this study, we examined whether NPR-A is involved in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. Targeting of NPR-A with short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in phenotypic changes indicative of differentiation, downregulation of self-renewal and pluripotency factors (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2), and upregulation of differentiation genes. NPR-A knockdown also resulted in a marked downregulation of phosphorylated Akt, which is essential for ES cell self-renewal. Furthermore, NPR-A knockdown induced accumulation of ES cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, we found that ANP was expressed in self-renewing ES cells, whereas its level was reduced after ES cell differentiation by the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor. Treatment of ES cells with exogenous ANP upregulated the expression of Oct4 and Nanog, and this upregulation depended on NPR-A signaling, because it was completely reversed by pretreatment with NPR-A antagonist or cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. Also, ANP increased the expression level of phosphorylated Akt. These findings provide a novel role for NPR-A in the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells.",

     "abstract": "Vascular networks of blood vessels are stereotypically patterned in early developing embryos. It remains unknown how the vascular patterns are established in three-dimensional tissues including peripheral organs and the central nervous system (CNS). We study the mechanisms underlying the patterning of blood vessels in CNS using early spinal cord as a model. In chicken E4 embryos, endothelial cells of somitic origin penetrate into the spinal cord through the ventral edge. Subsequently, forming vessels extend dorsally along determined paths. We found that these paths coincide with the interface between the layer of progenitor cells (medial) and the layer of differentiated neurons and glial cells (lateral). Since the blood vessels do not invade the progenitor layer, we reasoned that the progenitor layer elicits inhibitory influence on the blood vessel formation. To test this, we experimentally promoted neural/glial differentiation in the progenitor territory. The small GTPase RhoA is known to maintain progenitor cells, thus delaying neurogenesis. When the progenitor layer was electroporated with dominant-negative RhoA (DN-RhoA), the cells underwent precocious neural differentiation. Remarkably, in the electroporated region, an ectopic formation of blood vessels was observed. These observations support the idea that the blood vessel patterning in CNS is regulated by local environment, where neural progenitor cells appear to prevent the vessel formation. We will discuss relationships between vascular patterning and neural differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The iPS-technology has opened a previously unexplored way to study the mechanisms of cell differentiation. Thus, cells that have already differentiated or committed to a certain cell type can potentially be reprogrammed to either a less differentiated state or a different type of cells. Such cell reprogramming technology has so far been applied to an in vitro situation. Toward the goal of achieving cell reprogramming directly in vivo, we have focused on neural crest cells (NCCs), multipotent precursors of peripheral nervous system. NCCs are highly amenable for in vivo gene manipulation using in ovo electroporation technique, particularly in chicken embryos. In addition, the entire cell lineage derived from NCCs has been described, and many transcriptional factors are available that regulate the development of NCCs and their derivatives. Combining these advantages of NCCs with recently established technologies such as tet-on inducible expression (Watanabe et al., 2007. Dev. Biol.) and transposon-mediated stable integration of electroporated genes (Sato et al., 2007. Dev. Biol.), NCCs have become an excellent model to achieve the in vivo cell reprogramming. We have found that Sox9, Sox 10, and canonical Wnt signal are powerful candidates with which NCCs and their derivatives can be reprogrammed directly in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Stem cells from various lineages have well known for its migration tendency toward glioma and become attractive vehicles to deliver therapeutic genes to brain tumors. However, which factors and mechanisms work in these functions is not yet known. To identify those factors and mechanisms, we analyzed the brain tumor-specific gene expression profile using microarray analysis. We choose 14 candidate genes, reported to play roles in tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, and cell motility to further experiments. Chemoattract molecule 1 (CM1) is one of them, and highly expressed in malignancy tumors. Real time polymerase chain reaction and Immuno-histochemistry assay results support that. To check possibility of NSC motility reinforcement by CM1, in vitro boyden chamber assay was performed. CM1 dramatically induced the migration of human neural stem cells (NSC) two times as VEGF, previously known chemoattract molecule, did. Interestingly, when CM1 over-expressing cells were transplanted in rat brain, it attracted NSCs, which were transplanted in the same or contra-lateral hemisphere. These migrations were mediated by FAK downstream signaling pathway controlling actin and tubulin dynamics. We prepared cytosine deaminase gene encoding NSC (CD-NSC) line by retrovirus transduction. We explored their therapeutic potential on brain tumor model in the presence of prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). CD-NSCs injected to animal that transplanted CM1 over expressing cells mixed with C6 rat glioma cell followed by 5-FC administration for 2 weeks. In more CM1 over-expressing cells were transplanted to the animal, tumor volume was significantly decreased compare less transplanted it. Additionally, many stem cells showed dramatic migratory capacity in much more CM1 over-expressing cell transplanted groups. These results suggest that malignant tumor derived CM1, induce FAK downstream signal pathway, could play an important role in NSC tropism for glioma cells for tumor growth inhibition gene deliver and may provide valuable information for establishment of a new stem cell base cancer therapeutic strategy.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "Cell differentiation is traditionally seen as a sequence of genetically predetermined gene expression changes. This view has been challenged recently by the discovery of important stochastic fluctuations in gene expression and by the identification of the role these fluctuations may play in the cell fate decision. In particularly, it has been proposed that fully multipotent cells fluctuate slowly between states with varying likelihoods of differentiation and this spontaneous heterogeneity or \u201cnoise\u201d is the central driving force behind multipotency. It has been proposed that the different phenotypic states correspond to attractor states in the \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d defined by the network of genes. In our study we used myoblasts that express the differentiation marker CD56 considered as a sign of definitive fate commitment to the muscle pathway. We show experimentally that these cells fluctuate between two phenotypes. Using spatial distribution analysis of the cells in growing population, computer simulations of these observations and experimental test of the new predictions made by the model we show that the fluctuations follow a bistable dynamics driven by a microenvironment and phenotype dependent noise. We show that fluctuation between phenotypes is not a distinguishing feature of multipotent cells. Committed tissue cells (myoblasts, used in our study) also may fluctuate between different phenotypes. We suggest that phenotypic fluctuations are a general feature of any non-terminally differentiated cell, thus, reversion to a previous differentiation state is a normal event. The cellular microenvironment contributes actively to the fluctuations by increasing the noise level in cells with a given phenotype and decreasing it in others. Importantly, the microenvironment is created by the cells themselves as a consequence of their motility that creates random cell interactions. In this way each cell contributes to put together its own microenvironment that in turn stimulates it to fluctuate between the phenotypes until the most appropriate phenotypic state with low noise is found. This means that the attractor state is not cell intrinsic; rather it is specified by the joint action of the cell-intrinsic gene network and the network of cell-cell interactions. Both networks are subject to stochastic fluctuations.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "Stem cell posses the remarkable characteristics to produce its daughter cell that retain a stem-cell identity and the other that differentiates. Stem cells reside in dedicated cellular microenvironments termed stem-cell niches. These niches dictate a stem-cell identity, maintain the stem cell population, and coordinate proper homeostatic production of differentiated cells. Drosophila germ line stem cells (GSCs) are one of the ideal models for stem cell study in vivo. In apical tips of both male and female gonads, GSCs associate with specially differentiated somatic gonadal cells, the niche cells. These niche cells generate niches for GSCs by secreting signaling molecules, such as TGF-beta ligand, Dpp and JAK/STAT ligand Upd, which are essential for GSC maintenance. Although these facts indicate that region of niche is defined by the spatial distribution of these ligands, molecular mechanisms that regulate ligand distribution within the niche is not characterized. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are one kind of glycoprotein which are expressed on the cell surface and/or in the extracellular matrix. Recent in vivo studies have shown that HSPGs play critical roles in regulating signaling during development by a variety of mechanisms including regulation of extracellular ligand distribution. Here we show that Drosophila HSPGs are essential components of GSC niche. Drosophila two glypians, a subfamily of HSPGs, dally and dally-like were expressed in niche cells of female and male gonads, respectively and were required for GSC maintenance. In GSCs of these glypican mutants, signaling which is essential for GSC maintenance were impaired. Conversely, when dally was ectopically expressed in ovaries, we observed expansion of GSC niche. These results showed that these glypicans define niche region by regulating range of niche signal activity, presumably by controlling ligand distribution. HSPGs are evolutionally conserved molecules, thus our results imply HSPGs are general niche components that define niche region molecularly.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "Retinal homeobox (Rx) genes are master regulators of retinal development in all vertebrate species. They are implicated in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells (Arendt et al., 2004) and also in the regulation of cell movements during optic cup formation (Rembold et al., 2006). Interestingly, the loss of Rx gene expression is also associated with a reduction of proliferation in the developing eye. In fishes and frogs, these genes are expressed in retinal progenitor cells and later on in adult retinal stem cells (Mathers et al., 1997). Our hypothesis is that Rx genes also play a major role in the specification and maintenance of retinal progenitor cells. In the teleost Medaka, three paralogs exist. While Rx3 is expressed during optic cup evagination (Rembold et al., 2006), Rx1 and Rx2 are expressed in all retinal progenitor cells. In the course of eye development, the expression of Rx1 and Rx2 is confined to the stem cell pool in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), the Mueller glia cells and the photoreceptor cells. The exact function of these genes in the CMZ and their contribution to the formation and maintenance of stem cells in Medaka has not yet been elucidated. It is however likely that the diverse functions of Rx genes have been separated between the paralogs. We use two different approaches to identify the roles of Rx1 and Rx2 in retinal stem cells. First, we analyze the regulatory regions of vertebrate Rx genes using bioinformatic approaches. We found that Rx1 and Rx2 have common as well as specific regulatory elements. These putative regulatory elements and combinations of them are tested using in vivo reporter assays in order to elucidate the regulatory input that is responsible for the expression of Rx genes in retinal stem cells. In a second approach, we analyze the function of Rx genes by using knockdown and over-expression assays. We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of the Medaka Rx genes in the establishment and maintenance of retinal stem cells.",

RYBP (Ring1 and YY1 Binding Protein) is a zinc finger protein, which interacts with the members of the mammalian polycomb complexes. RYBP is also a subunit of complexes containing transcription factors such as E2F6 and the embryonic stem (ES) pluripotency regulator Oct4. In addition, RYBP has been described as a positive regulator of apoptosis and in the apoptotic context, RYBP is known as DEDAF (death effector domain associated factor). RYBP is gene essential during embryonic development (its constitutive inactivation leads to an early embryonic lethal situation). We have generated a conditional inactivating ES cell line to study RYBP function in ES cells. Transcriptome analysis of RYBP-deficient cells identified a set of derepressed loci statistically correlated with a subset of upregulated genes in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells.TCHiP-chip analysis showed RYBP binding to a larger set of loci than those derepressed in RYBP-deficient ES cells, suggesting the involvement of redundant repressive mechanisms. RYBP silenced genes often show RYBP enrichment on nearby short CpG islands rather than on promoter regions. RYBP bound loci include many transposon-related repetitive sequence elements (IAP, MusD and MuERV) of which only those with a low CpG density are derepressed in the absence of RYBP. We are investigating a possible role of RYBP on the establishment of gene repression patterns stabilized by DNA methylation during ES cell differentiation.",

     "abstract": "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays important roles in self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Tcfs and Lef1 are DNA-binding transcriptional factors for the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In the absence of \u03b2-catenin, Tcf/Lef1 generally functions as transcriptional repressor with co-repressor proteins such as Groucho, CtBP, and HIC-5. But Tcf/Lef1 turns into transcriptional activator when they interact with \u03b2-catenin. Therefore, so far it was considered that the activity of Tcf/Lef1 is regulated by the absence or presence of \u03b2-catenin, however the intrinsic role of Tcf/Lef1 has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to determine if Tcf/Lef1 itself plays differential roles in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of mouse ES cells. Interestingly, the expression of TCFs and LEF1 was dynamically changed during various differentiation conditions, such as removal of LIF, EB formation and neuronal differentiation in N2B27 media, suggesting that the function of each Tcfs and Lef1 may be different in ES cells. Ectopic expression of Tcf1 or dominant negative form of Lef1 (dnLef1) sustains self-renewal of ES cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), while ectopic expression of Tcf3, Lef1 or dnTcf1 did not block differentiation. In addition, ectopic expression of Tcf1 or knockdown of Lef1 blocked differentiation into neural precursor and cardiomyocyte. Ectopic expression of either Lef1 or dnLef1 blocked neuronal differentiation, suggesting that transient induction of Lef1 seemed to be necessary for the initiation and progress of differentiation. ChIP analysis show that Tcf1 bound to Nanog promoter and ectopic expression of Tcf1 enhanced the transcription of Nanog. Overall, our data suggest that Tcf1 plays critical roles in the maintenance of stemness whereas Lef1is involved in the initiation of differentiation.

Epigenetic programs along with developmental signaling pathways, such as Notch and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), constitute a network system coordinating the fate of hESCs.

Previously, we have assessed the effect of short- and long-term hypoxic exposure on the inhibition of hESCs spontaneous differentiation. In the current study, we examined the effect of Notch and Shh pathways on the self-renewal of hESCs exposed to low oxygen (5%) for short and long term, corresponding 4 weeks and 18 months, respectively. Using specific antagonists of Notch and Shh, we demonstrated a significant decrease of pluripotency-associated markers Oct4 and Nanog for each of the pathways. Co-inhibition of the two pathways had an additive effect. The proliferative capacity of hESC colonies and the expression of Notch and Shh downstream genes, Hes and Hey, and Gli1, respectively, were assessed as well. In conclusion, our data highlight a complementary role of Notch and Shh signaling pathways in preventing hESCs spontaneous differentiation in hypoxia.",

     "abstract": "Activation of Wnt signaling enhances self-renewal of mouse embryonic and neural stem/progenitor cells. However, contrary to these results, undifferentiated ES cells shows very low level of endogenous Wnt signaling and ectopic activation of Wnt signaling blocks neural differentiation. Therefore it is not clear whether or when endogenous Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is necessary for self-renewal or neural differentiation of ES cells. When we examined the expression profile of Wnt signaling components, expressions of most Wnts are very low in undifferentiated ES cells while some of Wnts are increased during differentiation. We generated stable ES cell lines that probe Wnt signaling activity and these cells showed that Wnt signaling was very low in undifferentiated ES cells while increased during embryonic body formation or neural differentiation. However, conditioned media from differentiated ES cells did not induce higher reporter activity than that of undifferentiated ES cells, which suggests that ES cells may change the sensitivity to Wnt signaling during differentiation whereas the levels of secreted Wnts are same. Changes in the composition of Tcfs or Lef1 in ES cells at different conditions may be a possible mechanism. In addition, we observed that activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling at different time periods resulted in differential effects on neural differentiation of 46C ES cells that show increased Sox1 promoter driven GFP during neural differentiation; activation of Wnt signaling by the treatment with BIO (a GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor) in early or late period blocks or enhances neural differentiation, respectively. Consistent with these results, inactivation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in late period by the treatment with endo-IWR1 (an Axin stabilizer) blocked neural differentiation.

These characteristics are likely governed by tight regulation of a molecular network that includes POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG. In addition to known genes, transcriptome profiling studies have also identified a large number of novel transcripts that appear to be significantly expressed in stem cells. Several novel targets previously identified by reverseSAGE were investigated and these transcripts appear to be long non-coding RNAs. Two of these, HEST097 and HEST147, were further studied to determine possible connections to the stem cell fate. Real-time PCR showed specific expression of these targets in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human embryonic carcinomas (hECCs), with little expression in other cell types, and was confirmed by SAGE database analysis. RNAi knockdown of HEST097 and HEST147 in hECC cell line NCCIT produced minor morphological changes and no overt signs of differentiation despite downregulation of NANOG. Cell proliferation appeared to be reduced and cell cycle markers were also affected. Intriguingly, siRNA knockdown of HEST147 resulted in downregulation of FGF4 expression, a gene that is located on the chromosome region downstream to HEST147. This may possibly point towards a role in which the stability of a long non-coding RNA may affect expression of a neighbouring transcript on its chromosome location. The discovery of these stem cell-specific transcripts raises interesting questions where further studies would be required in order to determine the possible mechanisms in which long non-coding RNAs may affect the stem cell fate.",

BMP-2 treated cultures showed more intense alcian blue staining for proteoglycans than ITS treated cultures at early time points. Both ITS and BMP-2 treated cultures showed similar mineral deposition in cultures treated with 4\u00a0mM phosphate via von Kossa staining, however FTIR spectroscopy of cultures showed different matrix properties. ITS treated cultures produced matrix that more closely resembled mouse calcified cartilage by FTIR analysis. 45Ca uptake curves showed delayed onset of mineralization in cultures treated with BMP-2, however they had an increased rate of mineralization (initial slope of 45Ca uptake curve) when compared to the cultures treated with ITS. Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of both collagens type I and type II in BMP-2 and ITS treated control (1\u00a0mM inorganic phosphate) and mineralizing cultures. BMP-2 treated mineralizing cultures displayed more intense staining for collagen type II than all other cultures. Collagen type X staining was detected at Day 9 only in mineralizing cultures treated with ITS. Western blotting of Day 9 cultures confirmed the presence of collagen type X in the mineralizing ITS cultures, and also showed very small amounts of collagen type X in BMP-2 treated cultures and control ITS cultures. By Day 16 all cultures stained positive for collagen type X. These data suggest that BMP-2 induces a more chondrogenic phenotype, while ITS treatment favors maturation and hypertrophy of the chondrocytes in the murine micromass cultures.",

In humans, re-arrangements in CREBBP are associated with the Rubinstein\u2013Taybi Syndrome (RSTS) that is characterised by craniofacial, skeletal and neuronal symptoms. Neuronal defects in RSTS can be attributed to genetic re-arrangements in CREBBP, which has been implicated in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. The present study was designed to investigate the role of CREBBP re-arrangements during neuronal differentiation. Towards this, deletion constructs of pCREBBP, viz. p\u0394CB\u2013HAT and p\u0394HAT\u2013CT were generated and transfected into NT2 cells. Expression profiling of the components of Notch, Wnt, SHH and Retinoid signaling along with screening of the neuronal markers was carried out in the NT2 cells and their mutant derivatives. ChIP-PCRs along with co-immunoprecipitations were also performed in these cells to investigate defects due to inappropriate interaction of mutated CREEBP with the corresponding transcription factor and other transcription regulatory proteins both at steady state as well as during differentiation. Mutant NT2 cells lacking the CREB, BROMO and HAT domains (CB\u2013HAT) were highly proliferative and showed limited differentiation; while mutant NT2 cells expressing CREBBP lacking the HAT and CTAD domains (HAT\u2013CT) are proliferation deficient and differentiate rapidly albeit generating an insufficient number of neurons. Altered CREBBP structure resulted in changes in HAT activity, cell cycle profiles and expression of basal levels of components of Notch, SHH, Wnt and retinoid pathways known to be critical in the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors. At the chromatin level, aberrant signaling correlated with altered binding affinities of the (CREBBP\u2014transcription factor) complexes to promoter regions of components of these pathways.

     "abstract": "The cellular response to materials implanted in the peritoneal cavity has been utilised to produce tissue for grafting to hollow smooth muscle organs (blood vessels, bladder, uterus and vas deferens). To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms involved in encapsulation of a foreign object, and subsequent differentiation of encapsulating cells, the present study used microarray technology and real-time RT-PCR to identify the temporal changes in gene expression associated with tissue development. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 3\u20137 days post-implantation of foreign objects (cubes of boiled egg white) into rats, they were encapsulated by tissue comprised primarily of haemopoietic (CD45+) cells, mainly macrophages (CD68+, CCR1+). By day 14, tissue capsule cells no longer expressed CD68, but were positive for myofibroblast markers \u03b1-smooth muscle (SM) actin and SM22. In accordance with these results, gene expression data showed that early capsule (days 3\u20137) development was dominated by the expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific genes (CD14, CSF-1, CSF-1R, MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b2). As tissue capsule development progressed (days 14\u201321), myofibroblast-associated and pro-fibrotic genes (associated with TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathways, including Wnt 4, TGF\u03b2RII, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), SMADs-1, -2, -4 and collagen-1 subunits) were significantly up-regulated. The up-regulation of genes associated with Cardiovascular and Skeletal and Muscular System Development at later time-points suggests the capacity of cells within the tissue capsule for further differentiation to smooth muscle, and possibly other cell types. The identification of key regulatory pathways and molecules associated with the fibrotic response to implanted materials has important applications not only for optimising tissue engineering strategies, but also to control deleterious fibrotic responses.",

We hypothesize Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the urothelial signal that promotes bladder mesenchymal proliferation and induces bladder smooth muscle differentiation.Pregnant FVB mice were euthanized on embryonic day (E) 12.5 and fetal bladders were harvested. Two experimental protocols were utilized:(1) Bladder mesenchyme (BLM) was isolated by incubating intact bladders (IB) in 0.02\u00a0M EDTA and then removing the urothelium by microdissection. IB and BLM were cultured in Shh-deficient media or BLM was cultured in Shh-supplemented (480\u00a0nM) media for 72\u00a0h. (2) IB were cultured for 72\u00a0h in media containing different concentrations of Shh (0, 48, and 480\u00a0nM).Specimens were sized by serial sectioning. Cell counts were performed after trypsin digestion. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect smooth muscle-specific protein expression. \u03b1-Actin expression was quantified using Western blot.All specimens were viable at 72\u00a0h. BLM cultured without Shh survived but did not grow or undergo smooth muscle differentiation. IB cultured without Shh and BLM cultured with Shh grew and expressed smooth muscle proteins at 72\u00a0h. IB cultured with Shh were larger and contained more cells than IB cultured without Shh (all p<0.05). Increasing Shh concentration from 48 to 480\u00a0nM did not change bladder size, cell counts, or the level of \u03b1-actin expression. Prior to culture, IB did not express \u03b1-actin. After culture of IB in Shh-deficient media, \u03b1-actin was detected throughout the mesenchyme except in the submucosal layer. The IB submucosa was thinner after culture with 48\u00a0nM Shh and smooth muscle completely obliterated the submucosa after culture with 480\u00a0nM Shh.In fetal mouse bladders, urothelium-derived Shh is necessary for mesenchymal proliferation and smooth muscle differentiation.

Here, we examined the expression and function of Neptune in the neural plate border (NPB) in the Xenopus embryo. Depletion of Neptune protein in developing embryos by using antisense MO caused loss of the hatching gland and otic vesicle as well as malformation of neural crest-derived cranial cartilages and melanocytes. Neptune MO also suppressed the expression of hatching gland and neural crest markers such as he, snail2, sox9 and msx1 at the neurula stage. Subsequent experiments showed that Neptune is necessary and sufficient for the differentiation of hatching gland cells and that it is located downstream of pax3 in the signal regulating the differentiation of these cells. Thus, Neptune is a new member of hatching gland specifier and plays a physiological role in determination and specification of multiple lineages derived from the NPB region.",

Bone marrow stem cell transplantation prevents functional deterioration following myocardial infarction. However, effect of myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) on stem cell differentiation is poorly understood. We investigate the role of collagen matrices and integrin system in cardiac differentiation and engraftment of stem cells in infarcted myocardium. Sternum-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells (CLCs). They were characterized using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and functional integrin neutralization assays. CLCs were injected into peri-infarct borders of injured myocardium of Wistar rats one week following left anterior descending (LAD) artery ligation. Cardiac function was analyzed via pressure-volume relationships. Cardiac differentiated CLCs displayed collagen V specificity, which was absent in undifferentiated MSCs. Collagen V, but not collagen I matrix, promoted attachment, proliferation and cardiac differentiation of CLCs. In contrast to \u03b21, \u03b1v integrin contributed minimally in the attachment of CLCs on collagen matrices. However, inhibition of \u03b1v\u03b23, but not \u03b12\u03b21 integrin, selectively attenuated troponin T, sarcomeric \u03b1-actin and ryanodine 2 receptor gene expression in CLCs. Both MSC and CLC transplantation prevented chamber dilatation and improved contractile function. However, systolic activity in MSC transplanted animals was accompanied by heightened wall stress as demonstrated by elevated myocardial end-diastolic pressure and prolonged tissue relaxation time. Localization of CLCs in the vicinity of collagen V-expressing myofibers promoted their integration into cardiac syncytium. CLCs may facilitate hemodynamic recovery by preserving tissue elasticity in the peri-infarct borders that sustains contractile efficiency for functional recovery in an actively remodeling infarcted myocardium.",

In this study, we characterized the effect of TGF-\u03b22 on metanephric development. Rat and mouse metanephroi cultured in the presence of exogenous TGF-\u03b22 for up to 15 days were small, and contained rudimentary ureteric branches and few glomeruli. These metanephroi were mostly comprised of mesenchymal cells, with two cell populations (designated Type 1 and Type 2 cells) evident. Type 1 cells were only observed when TGF-\u03b22 was added from the commencement of culture, they resembled chondroblasts and were Alcian Blue and Col IIB positive. Type 2 cells were observed whenever TGF-\u03b22 was added to the media, formed a band at the periphery of the explants consisting of 5\u201310 layers of spindle-shaped cells, and were alpha-smooth muscle actin positive. Molecular and RNA in situ hybridization analysis of metanephroi cultured in the presence of TGF-\u03b22 for 6 days demonstrated that Type 1 and 2 cells were negative for Pax2, WT1, GDNF and FoxD1. Gene expression profiling demonstrated an upregulation of chondrocyte, myogenic and stromal genes, some of which were identified as markers of Type 1 and Type 2 cells. In addition, TGF-\u03b22 was capable of maintaining the survival of mouse isolated metanephric mesenchyme (iMM) in the absence of serum or inductive signals from the ureteric epithelium. TGF-\u03b22 also induced the differentiation of iMM into Type 1 and 2 cells. The presence of chondrocytes and muscle in these cultures is reminiscent of the cell types found in some Wilms' tumors. These studies demonstrate that TGF-\u03b22 is capable of differentiating metanephric mesenchyme away from a renal cell fate.",

But \u201cwith great power, comes great responsibility\u201d, meaning that germ cells are only a few steps away from turning carcinogenic. Despite recent advances little is known about germ cell formation in mammals, predominantly because of the inaccessibility of these cells. Moreover, it is difficult to pin down what in essence is characteristic of a germ cell, as germ cells keep changing place, morphology, expression markers and epigenetic identity. Formation of (primordial) germ cells in primate ES cell cultures would therefore be helpful to identify molecular signalling pathways associated with germ cell differentiation and to study epigenetic changes in germ cells. In addition, the in vitro derivation of functional germ cells from ES cells could be used in combination with therapeutic cloning to generate patient-specific ES cell lines, and can have applications in animal breeding. In this review we present the state-of-the-art on how mouse and human germ cells are formed in vivo (the good), we discuss the link between germ cells, pluripotency and germ cell tumours (the bad) and show that despite continuous progress in trying to differentiate germ cells in vitro (the ugly) the generation of functional germ cells is still a real challenge.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, germ cells derive from the pluripotent cells that are present early in embryogenesis, and then differentiate into male sperm or female eggs as development proceeds. Fusion between an egg and a sperm at fertilization allows genetic information from both parents to be transmitted to the next generation, and produces a pluripotent zygote to initiate the next round of embryogenesis. Meiosis is a central event in this self-perpetuating cycle that creates genetic diversity by generating new combinations of existing genetic alleles, and halves the number of chromosomes in the developing male and female germ cells to allow chromosome number to be maintained through successive generations. The developing germ cells also help to maintain genetic and chromosomal stability through the generations by protecting the genome from excessive de novo mutation. Several mouse mutants have recently been characterised whose germ cells exhibit defects in silencing the potentially mutagenic endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons that are prevalent in mammalian genomes, and these germ cells also exhibit defects in progression through meiosis. Here we review how mouse germ cells develop and proceed through meiosis, how mouse germ cells silence endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons, and discuss why silencing of endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons may be required for meiotic progression in mice.",

     "abstract": "General belief in reproductive biology is that in most mammals female germ line stem cells are differentiated to primary oocytes during fetal development and oogenesis starts from a pool of primordial follicles after birth. This idea has been challenged previously by using follicle kinetics studies and demonstration of mitotically active germ cells in the postnatal mouse ovary (Johnson et al., 2004; Kerr et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). However, the existence of a population of self-renewing ovarian germ line stem cells in postnatal mammals is still controversial (Eggan et al., 2006; Telfer et al., 2005; Gosden, 2004). Recently, production of offspring from a germ line stem cell line derived from the neonatal mouse ovary was reported (Zou et al., 2009). This report strongly supports the existence of germ line stem cells and their ability to expand in vitro. Recently, using a transgenic mouse model in which GFP is expressed under a germ cell-specific Oct-4 promoter, we isolated and generated multipotent cell lines from male germ line stem cells (Izadyar et al., 2008). Using the same strategy we isolated and derived cell lines from postnatal mouse ovary. Interestingly, ovarian germ line stem cells expanded in the same culture conditions as the male suggesting that they have similar requirements for their self-renewal. After 1 year of culture and many passages, ovarian germ line stem cells maintained their characteristics and telomerase activity, expressed germ cell and stem cell markers and revealed normal karyotype. As standard protocol for differentiation induction, these cells were aggregated and their ability to form embryoid bodies (EBs) was investigated. EBs generated in the presence of growth factors showed classical morphology and expressed specific markers for three germ layers. However, in the absence of growth promoting factors EBs were smaller and large cells with the morphological and molecular characteristics of oocytes were formed. This study shows the existence of a population of germ line stem cell in postnatal mouse ovary with multipotent characteristics.",

Immunostaining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed expression of specific hepatic markers including alpha-fetoprotein, albumin and alpha-1-anti-trypsin.

     "abstract": "During early embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells arise from the primitive epithelium and can revert to an epithelial phenotype by passing through mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) of the Wharton's Jelly of the umbilical cord (UC-MSC) express pluripotency markers underlining their primitive developmental state. As mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow (BM-MSC) possess a strong propensity to ameliorate mesenchymal tissue damage, UC-MSC might also be able to differentiate into cells apart from the mesoderm, allowing replacement of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues.In this study, we analysed the possible epidermal differentiation of UC-MSC on dermal equivalents (DEs) consisting of collagen I/III with dermal fibroblasts and subjected to the culture conditions for tissue engineering of skin with keratinocytes. The culture conditions were further modified by pre-treating the cells with 5-azacytidine or by supplementing the medium with all trans retinoic acid. Interestingly, a subpopulation of UC-MSC (29%) co-expressed pan-cytokeratin (epithelial marker; pan-CK) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker) after isolation. Under the three-dimensional conditions of skin, the number of pan-CK+-cells increased to >30% after 21 days of cultivation, while under osteogenic culture conditions the cells were pan-CK-negative, thus showing the influence of the artificial niche. Nevertheless, the pan-CK-expression was neither accompanied by typical epithelial morphology nor expression of other epidermal markers. The pan-CK-detection can be explained by the expression of cytokeratins in myofibroblasts. UC-MSC expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin after isolation and displayed all features of functional myofibroblasts like morphology, cell-mediated contraction of a collagen gel and production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The treatment with all trans retinoic acid or 5-azacytidine could neither induce an epidermal differentiation nor enhance the myofibroblastic differentiation. Concluding, UC-MSC might be an interesting cell source to support the regeneration of wounds by their differentiation into myofibroblasts and their extensive synthesis of ECM components.",

The skeleton of vertebrates offers an exemplar readout of their activity: Hox genes control the morphology of the skeleton by defining type of vertebrae, and structure of the limbs. The head skeleton of vertebrates is formed by cranial neural crest (CNC), and mainly by a Hox-free domain of the CNC. Ectopic expression of anterior Hox genes in the CNC prevents the formation of the facial skeleton. These inhibitory effects on skeletogenesis are at odds with the recognized function of Hox genes in patterning the developing skeleton. To clarify these controversial effects, we overexpressed Hoxa2 across the entire developing endochondral skeleton in mouse. This gave rise to strong and spatially restricted effects: the most noticeable abnormalities were detected in the cranial base and consisted in a failure of bones to form or in a transformed morphology of bones. The rest of the skeleton exhibited milder defects, which never consisted in the absence or the transformation of any skeletal components. Analyses at early stages of endochondral bone development showed disorganized cell condensations in the cranial base of Col2a1-Hoxa2 transgenic embryos. We show that the distribution of Hoxa2-positive cells in Col2a1-Hoxa2 embryos does not match the wild-type developing cartilages. The Hoxa2-positive cells detected in atypical, non-chondrogenic location in the cranial base, remain as chondrocytes and lay down cartilage, indicating that Hoxa2 does not alter the fate of chondrocytes, but interferes with their spatial distribution. We propose that the ability of Hoxa2 to change the spatial distribution of cells accounts for the different phenotypes observed in Col2a1-Hoxa2 embryos; it also provides an explanation for the apparent inconsistency between the inhibitory effects of Hoxa2 on skeletal development, and the ability of Hox genes to establish the morphology of the vertebrate skeleton.",

It is anticipated that regenerative medicine will provide an alternative to liver transplants for such patients. Regenerative medicine refers to the academic field of eliciting the inherent capacity of organisms for self-regeneration to the greatest possible extent in order to develop new methods of treatment for intractable disorders. From this perspective, much is expected from the use of human embryonic stem cells (ES cells) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), and the vigorous development of technology to induce the differentiation of such stem cells into cells possessing hepatic functions is underway. Clinical applications of these human stem cells, however, have yet to reach even the earliest stages of implementation. Facing off against these versatile ES cells are stem cells derived from somatic cells present within organisms, which are attracting attention owing to their superiority in terms of ethics and safety, with many research institutes now in the process of elucidating the details of stem cell separation and identification as well as their plasticity and pluripotency. Bone marrow cells are the best-known somatic-cell-derived stem cells, but the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found in adipose tissue has also recently attracted attention.

In this study, we investigated the effects of BMP2 on mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) cell differentiation and regulation of the expression of Id1-3 and neural-specific transcription factors. Our results showed that BMP2 stimulation upregulated Id1-3 expression at the early stage of application by involvement of the Smad signaling pathway. BMP2 caused phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by upregulation of Id1-3. Co-incubation with Noggin, a BMP antagonist, or Smad1 siRNA transfection significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and upregulation of Id protein. Furthermore, our results showed that BMP2-induced differentiation of Neuro2a cells into neurons by downregulating the expression of Id1-3 proteins and upregulating the expression of neural-specific transcriptional factors Dlx2, Brn3a, and NeuroD6. The results suggested that the transient upregulation of Id1-3 expression during the early phase of BMP stimulation may play a role in lineage specification and promote differentiation of neuroblastoma cells towards a neuronal phenotype. Subsequently, a coordinated increase in expression of proneural transcription factors and a decrease in Id1-3 expression may culminate in the transition from proliferation to neurogenesis and the terminal neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells.",

     "abstract": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) with regenerative potential have been identified in heart. Whether these cells become new cardiac lineage cells by phenomena of transdifferentiation or fusion is also being investigated. Although, these mechanisms give cardiomyocytes, it has to be considered that MSCs transplantation could carry out ossification and calcification processes. An alternative might be the use of myocytes; however, the problem is the arrythmia. For those reasons, is that we investigated how to obtain cardiomyocyte-like cells from human MSCs (hMSCs). The aim of the present work was to evaluate a nuclear reprogramming of the hMSCs by a neonatal rat cardiomyocytes extract (EX) using Streptolysin O (SLO) treatment. hMSCs treated with 57.5\u00a0ng/ml SLO presented ball-like, stick-like and myotube-like morphology. In the absence of cardiomyogenic stimuli, hMSCs expressed markers of cardiac phenotype-like sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin, connexin-43 and GATA-4. However, when hMSCs were treated with SLO+EX or 10\u00a0\u03bcM of 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), the expression of these markers were significantly increased and furthermore, expressed SERCA-2, cardiac Troponin I, \u03b2-MyHC, desmin, MLC-2a and MLC-2v thus showing the phenotype of mature cardiomyocytes. PCR analysis showed that cardiomyocyte-related genes, such as \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21-AR), MLC-2a and cardiac Troponin T, were expressed after SLO+EX treatment like with 5-AZA. We concluded that the extract of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes could promote a nuclear modification of hMSCs to cardiomyogenic-like cells differentiation. Since the 5-AZA treatment appears to be genotoxic and taking into account the obtained results, the nuclear reprogramming by cell extract may be an approach leading to the identification of soluble factors that drives the reprogramming.",

     "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells and precursor cells are ideal candidates for tendon and ligament tissue engineering; however, for the stem cell-based approach to succeed, these cells would be required to proliferate and differentiate into tendon/ligament fibroblasts on the tissue engineering scaffold. Among the various fiber-based scaffolds that have been used in tendon/ligament tissue engineering, hybrid fibrous scaffolds comprising both microfibers and nanofibers have been recently shown to be particularly promising. With the nanofibrous coating presenting a biomimetic surface, the scaffolds can also potentially mimic the natural extracellular matrix in function by acting as a depot for sustained release of growth factors. In this study, we demonstrate that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) could be successfully incorporated, randomly dispersed within blend-electrospun nanofibers and released in a bioactive form over 1 week. The released bioactive bFGF activated tyrosine phosphorylation signaling within seeded BMSCs. The bFGF-releasing nanofibrous scaffolds facilitated BMSC proliferation, upregulated gene expression of tendon/ligament-specific ECM proteins, increased production and deposition of collagen and tenascin-C, reduced multipotency of the BMSCs and induced tendon/ligament-like fibroblastic differentiation, indicating their potential in tendon/ligament tissue engineering applications.",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronan is an oligosaccharide found in the pericellular matrix of numerous cell types and hyaluronan-induced signaling is known to facilitate fibrosis and cancer progression in some tissues. Hyaluronan is also commonly instilled into the eye during cataract surgery to protect the corneal endothelium from damage. Despite this, little is known about the distribution of hyaluronan or its receptors in the normal ocular lens. In this study, hyaluronan was found throughout the mouse lens, with apparently higher concentrations in the lens epithelium. CD44, a major cellular receptor for hyaluronan, is expressed predominately in mouse secondary lens fiber cells born from late embryogenesis into adulthood. Surgical removal of lens fiber cells from adult mice resulted in a robust upregulation of CD44 protein, which preceded the upregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression typically used as a marker of epithelial\u2013mesenchyma transition in this model of lens epithelial cell fibrosis. Mice lacking the CD44 gene had morphologically normal lenses with a response to lens fiber cell removal similar to wildtype, although they exhibited an increase in cell-associated hyaluronan. Overall, these data suggest that lens cells have a hyaluronan-containing pericellular matrix whose structure is partially regulated by CD44. Further, these data indicate that CD44 upregulation in the lens epithelium may be an earlier marker of lens injury responses in the mouse lens than the upregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin.",

     "abstract": "Rat submandibular gland can regenerate following ligation-induced atrophy, eventually recovering its normal morphology and function. Previous studies have suggested that the regeneration process implies both self-proliferation of existing acini and formation of new acinar cells. One hypothesis is that new acinar cells may differentiate from the ductal cells in a similar fashion to the process of cytodifferentiation occurring during submandibular glandular development. In this study atrophy was induced, under recovery anaesthesia, by applying a metal clip on the main duct of the submandibular gland without including the chorda lingual nerve. After 2 weeks the duct was deligated for 3, 5 or 7 days or 8 weeks and the glands collected. Tissue was prepared for immunohistochemstry, biochemical analysis and RNA extraction. The histology of the regenerated glands shows several normal-looking acini, which have regained their glycoprotein content (AB/PAS positive), data also confirmed by biochemical analysis (SDS-PAGE/PAS). Regenerating tissue was characterized by the presence of embryonic-like branched structures ending with AB/PAS positive acinar cells. The proteins SMG-B and PSP are normally expressed in acinar cell precursors during development but only by intercalated ductal cells in the adult stage. In the adult regenerating gland mRNA levels of both SMG-B and PSP were found to be up-regulated compared to ligated glands and SMG-B expression localized to acinar cells whilst the ductal cells were negative. This study of rat submandibular gland regeneration suggests new acinar cells have differentiated from ducts and express markers of acinar cell precursors in a similar manner to the cytodifferentiation process occurring during glandular development.",

     "abstract": "For heart failure, new therapeutic strategies based on augmentation of the regenerative resources of the heart muscle are under evaluation. More knowledge about the mechanisms regulating growth of the embryonic or adult heart muscle will help to improve the results. The present over-expression study provides further insight into the role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in growth regulation of myocardial tissue derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells.Mouse ES cells (D3) exhibiting ectopic expression of TERT under the regulation of the \u03b2-actin promoter were generated and allowed to differentiate over a period of up to 18 days. In contrast to the controls, the TRAP assay did not reveal any decrease of telomerase activity during differentiation of TERT transgenic ES cells. Following cell dissociation and staining for sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin, singular myocardial precursors could be identified and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy: compared with the controls, the outgrowths of TERT transgenic ES cells showed a significant enlargement of the cellular fraction formed by cardiomyocyte precursors, while BrdU-(double) staining did not reveal a change of its proliferation rate. In addition, the average physical dimensions of the precursors appeared to be enlarged. The myocardial precursors exhibited three different morphologies: spindle-like or round or tri-/multi-angular. While, compared with the controls, in TERT transgenic ES cell outgrowths the overall number of myocardial cells was enhanced, the formation of spindle-like or round-shaped precursors was suppressed. On the molecular level, RT-PCR analysis showed the mRNA-expression level of \u03b1-MHC, a gene whose expression is specific for pacemaker-like or atrial-like precursors (Kolossov et al., 2005), to be reduced. Furthermore, TERT transgenic outgrowths displayed a reduced beating frequency.It can be concluded that TERT over-expression promotes the differentiation of mouse ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes in a phenotype-specific manner.",

In this study, we isolate rat oral mucosal lamina propria cells (OMLPC) using nestin as a marker in an immunomagnetic sorting technique. The OMLPCs was negative for cytokeratin. Nestin and vimentin were expressed in the OMLPCs. And CD44 and STRO-1 were expressed in a subset of the OMLPCs, which suggest that the nestin positive OMLPCs be heterogeneous. Otherwise, OMLPCs express Oct4, which is a critical gene for pluripotency. The OMLPCs proliferated actively in vitro. A colony forming study demonstrated that OMLPCs exhibited colony-generating capacity. When cultured in defined medium, OMLPCs generated cells characteristic of osteoblast, adipocyte and astrocyte-like cells. In addition, OMLPCs seeded into three dimensional scaffolds form bone-like structures in vivo after 8 weeks. All of the results demonstrate that OMLPCs are a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells existing in rat oral mucosal lamina propria. Nestin is shown to be a useful molecular marker for these cells. In certain environments, OMLPCs can form hard tissue. Thus, OMLPCs may serve as a suitable source of cells for future bone or tooth tissue engineering applications.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of angiogenic factors in inducing endothelial differentiation of C3H/10T1/2 cells in vitro. C3H/10T1/2 cells were treated with angiogenic factors, VEGF (10\u00a0ng/mL) and bFGF (5\u00a0ng/mL). At specified time points, cells were subjected to morphological study, immunofluorescence staining, RT-PCR, LDL-uptake tests and 3-D culture for the examination of the structural and functional characteristics of endothelial cells. Classic cobblestone-like growth pattern appeared at 6 day of the induced differentiation. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR analyses revealed that the induced cells exhibited endothelial cell-specific markers such as CD31, von Willebrand factor, Flk1, Flt1, VE-cadherin, Tie2, EphrinB2 and Vezf1 at 9 day. The induced C3H/10T1/2 cells exhibited functional characteristics of the mature endothelial phenotype, such as uptake of acetylated low-density lipoproteins (Ac-LDL) and formation of capillary-like structures in three-dimensional culture. At 9 day, Weibel\u2013Palade bodies were observed under a transmission electron microscope. This study demonstrates, for the first time, endothelial differentiation of C3H/10T1/2 cells induced by angiogenic factors, VEGF and bFGF, and confirms the multipotential differentiation ability.

     "abstract": "FOXC1 and FOXC2 are forkhead/winged-helix transcription factors expressed in paraxial mesoderm and somites. Emphasizing the importance of FOXC1/2 during embryonic development, double-knockout mice lacking the alleles for both Foxc1 and Foxc2 failed to form segmented somites and undergo myogenesis. The present study aims to determine upstream factors that regulate Foxc1/2 expression during the differentiation of P19 cells into skeletal muscle. Previous work had shown that dominant-negative forms of \u03b2-catenin, Gli2, and Meox1 could inhibit distinct stages of skeletal myogenesis in P19 cells. In the presence of a dominant-negative \u03b2-catenin fusion protein, Foxc1/2 transcripts were not upregulated and neither were markers of somitogenesis/myogenesis, including Meox1, Pax3 and MyoD. Conversely, inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl or overexpression of activated \u03b2-catenin in aggregated P19 cells resulted in enhancement of Foxc1/2 expression, indicating that FOX transcription may be under the control of Wnt signaling. Supporting this hypothesis, \u03b2-catenin bound to conserved regions upstream of Foxc1 during P19 cell differentiation and drove transcription from this region in a promoter assay. In addition, ectopic expression of a dominant-negative Meox1 or Gli2 resulted in decreased Foxc1/2 transcript levels, correlating with inhibition of skeletal myogenesis. Overexpression of Gli2 was also sufficient to upregulate Foxc1/2 transcript levels and induce skeletal myogenesis. In summary, Foxc1/2 expression is dependent on a complex interplay from various signaling inputs from the Wnt and Shh pathways during early stages of in vitro skeletal myogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Stromal\u2013epithelial signaling is a critical regulator of normal prostate development and has been speculated to play an equally important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-4, BMP-7), expressed by the urogenital sinus epithelium and mesenchyme, exert reciprocal and coordinate effects on outgrowth of nascent prostate ducts. Over-expression of Shh in the LNCaP xenograft was shown previously to accelerate tumor growth by a paracrine mechanism. A survey of BMP regulators expressed in the developing prostate revealed increased Noggin and BMP-7 mRNA in the stromal component of Shh over-expressing xenografts. In vitro studies demonstrated that treatment of LNCaP cells with BMP-4 and BMP-s7 induced Id-1 expression and inhibited tumor cell proliferation. The activity of BMP-4 was abrogated by co-addition of Noggin; the activity of BMP-7 was not. Quantitative analysis of BMP signaling revealed ambivalent results: decreased tumor cell expression of the BMP response gene Id-1 but increased staining for phospho-SMAD 1,5, 8. To directly test whether increased xenograft tumor growth could be explained by Noggin-mediated blockade of BMP-2/4 effects on tumor cell proliferation, we generated LNCaP xenografts containing stromal cells over-expressing Noggin. Tumor cells in these xenografts exhibited decreased Id-1 and reduced SMAD phosphorylation, but tumor growth was not altered. We conclude that tumor cell Shh expression can induce significant changes in expression of BMP ligands and inhibitors in the stromal microenvironment but that acceleration of LNCaP xenograft tumor growth by Shh over-expression cannot be attributed solely to increased Noggin expression in the tumor stroma.",

     "abstract": "The development of the gastric mucosa is controlled by hormones, growth factors and feeding behavior. Early weaning (EW), which means the abrupt interruption of suckling, increases proliferation and differentiation in the rat gastric epithelium. Transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1) is secreted in the stomach, binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and may control cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Here, we investigated the influence of suckling\u2013weaning transition on the differentiation of mucous neck cells in the stomach and its association to the expression of TGF\u03b1 and EGFR. Fifteen-day-old Wistar rats were divided into two groups: suckling (control), in which pups were kept with the dam, and early weaning (EW), in which rats were separated from their mother and fed with hydrated powdered chow. TGF\u03b1 and EGFR levels were increased at 18 days in EW animals compared to control ones (p<0.05). Histochemical reactions with Periodic Acid-Schiff reagent+Alcian Blue or Bandeiraea simplicifolia II lectin were used to stain the mucous neck cells and showed an increase in this cell population throughout EW, which was more pronounced at 17 days when compared to suckling pups (p<0.05). These morphological results were confirmed by RT-PCR for mucin 6. The levels of mucin 6 mRNA were higher in EW animals from the 16th to the 18th day (1\u20133 days post-weaning) when compared to the respective control group. Inhibition of EGFR through AG1478 administration to EW animals prevented the expansion of mucous neck cell population induced by EW (p<0.05). Therefore, early weaning up regulated TGF\u03b1/EGFR expression and induced differentiation of mucous neck cells. Moreover, we showed that EGFR takes part in the maturation of this cell population. We conclude that regular suckling\u2013weaning transition is crucial to guarantee the development of the gastric mucosa.",

     "abstract": "The Wnt4 gene encodes a secreted signaling molecule controlling the development of several organs, such as the kidney, adrenal gland, ovary, mammary gland and pituitary gland. It is thought to act in the embryonic kidney as an auto-inducer of nephrogenesis controlling mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition, and Wnt4-deficient mice die soon after birth, probably of kidney failure. Given the requirement for Wnt4 signaling in the control of organogenesis, the targeting of Cre recombinase under the control of the Wnt4 promoter would provide a valuable tool for fate mapping and functional genomics. We report here on the generation and characterization of a Wnt4EGFPCre knock-in allele where the EGFPCre fusion cDNA and Neo selection cassette were targeted into the Wnt4 locus. EGFP-derived fluorescence was observed in the pretubular aggregates of the E14.5 embryonic kidney that normally express Wnt4 mRNA. Characterization of the pattern of recombination of the floxed Rosa26LacZ reporter with the Wnt4EGFPCre allele revealed that in addition to the embryonic kidney, reporter-derived staining was observed in the embryonic gonad, spinal cord, lung and adrenal gland, i.e. the sites of Wnt4 gene expression. Time-lapse fate mapping of the Wnt4EGFPCre-activated yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from the Rosa26 locus in organ culture revealed that the cells that had expressed the Wnt4 gene contributed to the nephrons, some of the cells around the stalk of the developing ureter and also certain presumptive medullary stromal cells. Moreover, the time-lapse movies suggested that the first few pretubular cell aggregates may not mature into nephrons but instead appear to disintegrate. In association with this, Rosa26YFP-positive stromal cells emerge around these disintegrating structures. Such cells may be transient, since their derivatives are neither detected later in the more mature kidney nor is there an overlap of the Wnt4EGFPCre; Rosa26LacZ-marked cells with those of the endothelial cells, the smooth muscle cells or the macrophages. The Wnt4EGFPCre allele provides a useful new tool for conditional mutagenesis and provides the first time-lapse-based map of the fate of nephron precursor cells.",
