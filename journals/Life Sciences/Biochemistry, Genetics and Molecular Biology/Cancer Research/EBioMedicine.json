     "abstract": "Animal studies suggest sphingolipids as an early marker of impaired glucose metabolism; however, research in humans is limited. We evaluated whether individual sphingolipid species were associated with fasting plasma glucose and incident impaired fasting glucose in a longitudinal cohort study.We measured 15 sphingolipid species from blood samples collected in 2001\u20132003 from 2145 participants without prevalent diabetes in the Strong Heart Family Study. Fasting plasma glucose was measured in blood samples collected at baseline and follow-up (mean 5.5\u202fyears after baseline).The average age of study participants was 38\u202fyears; 41% were men. Ceramide, sphingomyelin, and glucosylceramide species levels were higher in older participants; lactosyl-ceramide levels were higher in participants with lower BMIs. In adjusted analyses, greater concentrations of most ceramide species and lower lactosyl-ceramide with palmitic acid (LC-16) were associated with higher glucose levels at baseline. We did not observe associations of sphingomyelin species or glucosyl-ceramide species with glucose levels. Associations of sphingolipid levels with fasting glucose levels at follow-up were similar but had greater uncertainty than associations with baseline glucose. Although no statistically significant associations of sphingolipids with incident impaired fasting glucose were present, results were similar to glucose analyses.We identified several ceramide species associated with higher fasting glucose levels and one sphingolipid, LC-16, that was associated with lower fasting glucose levels. These findings compliment previous research, which linked these sphingolipids with fasting insulin levels, and suggest that higher levels of these ceramides and lower LC-16 may be an early marker of impaired glucose metabolism.US National Institutes Health.",

     "abstract": "We and others have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) expression is increased in obesity/atherosclerosis and is positively correlated with atherosclerotic burden. However, the mechanism by which DPP4 expression is regulated in obesity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the pathways regulating the expression of DPP4 on macrophages.Flowsight\u00ae Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo\u2122 Protease Assay kit.Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. Obese patients with body mass index (BMI)\u202f\u2265\u202f30 had a higher level of monocyte DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese (BMI\u202f<\u202f30) patients. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, up-regulated DPP4 expression on macrophages with a preferential increase in CD36+ cells. OxLDL mediated DPP4 up-regulation was considerably diminished by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) knockdown and CD36 deficiency. TRIF deficiency, but not MyD88 deficiency, attenuated oxLDL-induced DPP4 increase.Our study suggests a key role for oxLDL and downstream CD36/TLR4/TRIF in regulating DPP4 expression. Increased DPP4 in response to oxidized lipids may represent an integrated mechanism linking post-prandial glucose metabolism to lipoprotein abnormality-potentiated atherosclerosis.",

     "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are reaching global epidemic proportions. Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO2 to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO2. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated oleic acid (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy metabolism.CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO2 improves body composition and energy metabolism and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO2. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO2 administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO2. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, \u03b1SMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO2 inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO2 improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.",

     "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its based agents improve glycemic control. Although their attenuating effect on hepatic glucose output has drawn our attention for decades, the potential mechanisms remain unclear.Cytokine array kit was used to assess cytokine profiles in db/db mice and mouse primary hepatocytes treated with exenatide (exendin-4). Two diabetic mouse models (db/db and Pax6m/+) were treated with a GLP-1 analog exenatide or liraglutide. The expression and secretion of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in the livers of diabetic mice, primary mouse and human hepatocytes, and the human hepatic cell line HepG2 treated with or without GLP-1 analog were measured. Blockage of FGF21 with neutralizing antibody or siRNA, or hepatocytes isolated from Fgf21 knockout mice were used, and the expression and activity of key enzymes in gluconeogenesis were analyzed. Serum FGF21 level was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) receiving exenatide treatment.Utilizing the cytokine array, we identified that FGF21 secretion was upregulated by exenatide (exendin-4). Similarly, FGF21 production in hepatocytes was stimulated by exenatide or liraglutide. FGF21 blockage attenuated the inhibitory effects of the GLP-1 analogs on hepatic glucose output. Similar results were also observed in primary hepatocytes from Fgf21 knockout mice. Furthermore, exenatide treatment increased serum FGF21 level in patients with T2D, particularly in those with better glucose control.We identify that function of GLP-1 in inhibiting hepatic glucose output is mediated via the liver hormone FGF21. Thus, we provide a new extra-pancreatic mechanism by which GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis.National Key Research and Development Program of China, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing and Peking University Medicine Seed Fund for Interdisciplinary Research.",

     "abstract": "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is a key regulator of body weight in animals by regulating food intake. Its receptor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), was identified recently. Pre-clinical studies showed that it is a promising therapeutic target for cardiometabolic diseases and anorexia/cachexia. Although many pharmaceutical companies are developing drugs targeting GFRAL, whether the findings from animal studies can be extrapolated to man is unknown. Mendelian randomization (MR) is useful in investigating the relationship between risk factors and disease outcomes. We aimed to use a two-sample MR approach to evaluate the clinical usefulness of targeting GDF15 for cardiometabolic diseases.Genetic instruments and summary statistics for MR analyses were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of GDF15 and cardiometabolic outcomes (n\u202f=\u202f27,394 to 644,875), including body mass index, waist-hip ratio, waist circumference, whole-body lean mass, fat percentage, Type 2 Diabetes, fasting glucose, glycated haemoglobin, fasting insulin, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, coronary artery disease, and estimated BMD (eBMD). Conventional inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was adopted to obtain the causal estimates of GDF-15 with different outcomes; weighted median and MR-egger were used for sensitivity analyses.There was null association between GDF15 levels and anthropometric outcomes. One SD increase in genetically-determined GDF15 was significantly associated with reduced HDL-C (beta: -0.048SD; SE: 0.014; P =\u202f.001) but the result was not significant in sensitivity analyses. A consistent significant causal association was observed between GDF15 and eBMD in IVW (beta: 0.026 SD; SE: 0.005; P\u202f<\u202f.001) and subsequent sensitivity analyses.This study sheds lights on the potential of drugs targeting the GDF15/GFRAL axis. It suggested that the effect of targeting GDF15/GFRAL axis for weight control in human may be different from the effects observed in animal studies. GDF15 treatment may improve BMD in humans.No specific funding was received for this study.",

     "abstract": "The increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) indicates a demand for novel therapeutic approaches. Proteome analysis of vascular tissues from animal models and humans with CVD could lead to the identification of novel druggable targets.LC-MS/MS analysis of thoracic aortas from three mouse models of non-diabetic and diabetic (streptozotocin (STZ)-induced) atherosclerosis followed by bioinformatics/pathway analysis was performed. Selected findings were confirmed by proteomics analysis of human vessels from patients with CVD as well as in vitro studies (migration, proliferation, angiogenesis assays) using endothelial (HUVEC) cells.Comparative tissue proteomics of low density lipoprotein receptor deficient (Ldlr\u2212/\u2212) and diabetic Ldlr\u2212/\u2212 (Ldlr\u2212/\u2212STZ) with wild type (WT) animals led to the identification of 284 differentially expressed proteins in both models. Among them, 177 proteins were also differentially expressed in diabetic apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE\u2212/\u2212STZ) mice, suggesting expression changes associated with atherosclerosis independent of the model used. These proteins recapitulated the hallmarks of atherosclerosis. Comparison of these findings with differentially expressed proteins in human vessels with CVD enabled shortlisting of six commonly dysregulated proteins. Among them, lysine-specific demethylase 5D (KDM5D) exhibited pronounced overexpression accompanied by a reduction in the protein levels of its substrate, the trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), in patients with CVD. Functional interference studies applying a KDM5 inhibitor on HUVEC reduced cell proliferation, migration and tube-forming ability in vitro.This high-throughput proteomics strategy identified KDM5 histone demethylases being potentially involved in CVD, possibly by affecting H3K4 methylation.[SysVasc, HEALTH-2013 603288], [ERA-CVD PROACT: ANR-17-ECVD-0006, 01KL1805], [FRM, DEQ20170336759].",

     "abstract": "Alectinib has shown a greater efficacy to ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancers in first-line setting; however, most patients relapse due to acquired resistance, such as secondary mutations in ALK including I1171N and G1202R. Although ceritinib or lorlatinib was shown to be effective to these resistant mutants, further resistance often emerges due to ALK-compound mutations in relapse patients following the use of ceritinib or lorlatinib. However, the drug for overcoming resistance has not been established yet.We established lorlatinib-resistant cells harboring ALK-I1171N or -G1202R compound mutations by performing ENU mutagenesis screening or using an in vivo mouse model. We performed drug screening to overcome the lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutations. To evaluate these resistances in silico, we developed a modified computational molecular dynamic simulation (MP-CAFEE).We identified 14 lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutants, including several mutants that were recently discovered in lorlatinib-resistant patients. Some of these compound mutants were found to be sensitive to early generation ALK-TKIs and several BCR-ABL inhibitors. Using our original computational simulation, we succeeded in demonstrating a clear linear correlation between binding free energy and in vitro experimental IC50 value of several ALK-TKIs to single- or compound-mutated EML4-ALK expressing Ba/F3 cells and in recapitulating the tendency of the binding affinity reduction by double mutations found in this study. Computational simulation revealed that ALK-L1256F single mutant conferred resistance to lorlatinib but increased the sensitivity to alectinib.We discovered lorlatinib-resistant multiple ALK-compound mutations and an L1256F single mutation as well as the potential therapeutic strategies for these ALK mutations. Our original computational simulation to calculate the binding affinity may be applicable for predicting resistant mutations and for overcoming drug resistance in silico.This work was mainly supported by MEXT/JSPS KAKENHI Grants and AMED Grants.",

     "abstract": "Differential gene expression patterns are commonly used as biomarkers to predict treatment responses among heterogeneous tumors. However, the link between response biomarkers and treatment-targeting biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a prognosis-guided approach to establish the determinants of treatment response.The prognoses of biological processes were evaluated by integrating the transcriptomes and clinical outcomes of ~26,000 cases across 39 malignancies. Gene-prognosis scores of 39 malignancies (GEO datasets) were used for examining the prognoses, and TCGA datasets were selected for validation. The Oncomine and GEO datasets were used to establish and validate transcriptional signatures for treatment responses.The prognostic landscape of biological processes was established across 39 malignancies. Notably, the prognoses of biological processes varied among cancer types, and transcriptional features underlying these prognostic patterns distinguished response to treatment targeting specific biological process. Applying this metric, we found that low tumor proliferation rates predicted favorable prognosis, whereas elevated cellular stress response signatures signified resistance to anti-proliferation treatment. Moreover, while high immune activities were associated with favorable prognosis, enhanced lipid metabolism signatures distinguished immunotherapy resistant patients.These findings between prognosis and treatment response provide further insights into patient stratification for precision treatments, providing opportunities for further experimental and clinical validations.National Natural Science Foundation, Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China, National Key Research and Development Program, Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong, Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou, MRC, CRUK, Breast Cancer Now, Imperial ECMC, NIHR Imperial BRC and NIH.",

We used in vitro transcribed 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA (3pRNA) to therapeutically target the RIG-I pathway. We performed in vitro functional analysis in bone-marrow derived dendritic cells and investigated RIG-I-enhanced vaccines in different murine melanoma models.We found that protein vaccination together with RIG-I ligation via 3pRNA strongly synergizes with CTLA-4 blockade to induce expansion and activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that translates into potent antitumor immunity. RIG-I-induced cross-priming of cytotoxic T cells as well as antitumor immunity were dependent on the host adapter protein MAVS and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and were mediated by dendritic cells.Overall, our data demonstrate the potency of a novel combinatorial vaccination strategy combining RIG-I-driven immunization with CTLA-4 blockade to prevent and treat experimental melanoma.German Research Foundation (SFB 1335, SFB 1371), EMBO, Else Kr\u00f6ner-Fresenius-Foundation, German Cancer Aid, European Hematology Association, DKMS Foundation for Giving Life, Dres.

Ovarian cancer-associated antigen 66 (OVA66) is now known to be overexpressed in multiple tumours and plays a role in tumour development, but the underlying mechanisms has not been fully investigated.We employed ovarian and cervical cancer cells and mouse models to detect the role of OVA66 in angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of cancer cells. Immunofluorescence and western blot were used to determine the function of OVA66 in regulating autocrine VEGF-VEGFR2 signalling. Immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analysis were used to detect the correlation of OVA66 and VEGF expression.OVA66 overexpression in the cancer cell lines promoted VEGF secretion, tumour growth and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, shRNA-mediated OVA66 knockdown had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, OVA66 overexpression was found to boost an autocrine VEGF\u2013VEGFR2 positive-feedback signalling loop in the tumour cells, leading to amplified effect of VEGF on tumour angiogenesis and proliferation and increased migration in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Finally, we identified a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of OVA66 and VEGF in ovarian and cervical cancer specimens, and found that OVA66 was significantly associated with advanced ovarian cancer.We identify a novel function for OVA66 in regulating an autocrine VEGF\u2013VEGFR2 feed-forward signalling loop that promotes tumour progression and angiogenesis.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81602262); and Excellent Youth Scholar Program of Tongji University (2015KJ062).",

     "abstract": "DNA damage repair (DDR) alterations are important events in cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance. However, the involvement of DDR alterations in glioma malignancy needs further investigation. This study aims to characterize the clinical and molecular features of gliomas with DDR alterations and elucidate the biological process of DDR alterations that regulate the cross talk between gliomas and the tumor microenvironment.Integrated transcriptomic and genomic analyses were undertaken to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the role of DDR alterations in glioma. The prognostic DDR-related cytokines were identified from multiple datasets. In vivo and in vitro experiments validated the role of p53, the key molecule of DDR, regulating M2 polarization of microglia in glioma.DDR alterations are associated with clinical and molecular characteristics of glioma. Gliomas with DDR alterations exhibit distinct immune phenotypes, and immune cell types and cytokine processes. DDR-related cytokines have an unfavorable prognostic implication for GBM patients and are synergistic with DDR alterations. Overexpression of MDK mediated by p53, the key transcriptional factor in DDR pathways, remodels the GBM immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting M2 polarization of microglia, suggesting a potential role of DDR in regulating the glioma microenvironment.Our work suggests that DDR alterations significantly contribute to remodeling the glioma microenvironment via regulating the immune response and cytokine pathways.This study was supported by: 1.

The level of cellular metabolism was determined by extracellular flux analyzer. The relationship between p53 and EPB41L4A-AS1 was explored by qRT-PCR, luciferase assay and ChIP assay. The interactions between EPB41L4A-AS1 and HDAC2 or NPM1 were determined by RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down assay and RNA-FISH- immunofluorescence.EPB41L4A-AS1 was a p53-regulated gene. Low expression and deletion of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 were found in a variety of human cancers and associated with poor prognosis of cancer patients. Knock down EPB41L4A-AS1 expression triggered Warburg effect, demonstrated as increased aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis. EPB41L4A-AS1 interacted and colocalized with HDAC2 and NPM1 in nucleolus. Silencing EPB41L4A-AS1 reduced the interaction between HDAC2 and NPM1, released HDAC2 from nucleolus and increased its distribution in nucleoplasm, enhanced HDAC2 occupation on VHL and VDAC1 promoter regions, and finally accelerated glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Depletion of EPB41L4A-AS1 increased the sensitivity of tumor to glutaminase inhibitor in tumor therapy.EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a repressor of the Warburg effect and plays important roles in metabolic reprogramming of cancer.",

Activation of pathways was analyzed at gene and protein expression levels. A genetic model of glioma in Drosophila melanogaster and mice with GBM patients-derived orthotopic xenografts were used as in vivo models of disease.GBM and recurrent gliomas display a specific V-ATPase signature. Such signature resolves the heterogeneous class of IDH-wild type lower-grade gliomas, identifying the patients with worse prognosis independently from clinical and molecular features (p\u202f=\u202f0\u00b703, by Cox proportional-hazards model).

We previously showed that some V-ATPase subunits are enriched in glioma stem cells and in patients with poor survival. In this study, we investigated how expression of a GBM-like V-ATPase pump influences the non-neoplastic brain microenvironment.Large oncosome (LO) vesicles were isolated from primary glioblastoma (GBM) neurospheres, or from patient sera, and co-cultured with primary neoplastic or non-neoplastic brain cells. LO transcript and protein contents were analyzed by qPCR, immunoblotting and immunogold staining. Activation of pathways in recipient cells was determined at gene and protein expression levels. V-ATPase activity was impaired by Bafilomycin A1 or gene silencing.GBM neurospheres influence their non-neoplastic microenvironment by delivering the V-ATPase subunit V1G1 and the homeobox genes HOXA7, HOXA10, and POU3F2 to recipient cells via LO. LOs reprogram recipient cells to proliferate, grow as spheres and to migrate. Moreover, LOs are particularly abundant in the circulation of GBM patients with short survival time. Finally, impairment of V-ATPase reduces LOs activity.We identified a novel mechanism adopted by glioma stem cells to promote disease progression via LO-mediated reprogramming of their microenvironment.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 is able to sensitize ESCC cells to cisplatin (DDP) and determine the underlying mechanisms.Viability, clonogenicity, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were assessed in ESCC cells treated with BI2536 or DDP alone or in combination. Checkpoint activation was examined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Xenograft model was used to assess the efficacy of the co-treatment. The expression level of GSDME in tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemistry.We found that the combination of BI2536 and DDP was synergistic in ESCC cells, which induced pyroptosis in ESCC cells at low doses. Mechanistic studies revealed that BI2536 significantly induced DNA damage and impaired the DNA damage repair pathway in DDP-treated cells both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we found that co-treatment with BI2536 and DDP induced pyroptosis in ESCC cells depending on the caspase-3/GSDME pathway. Importantly, our study found that GSDME was more highly expressed in tumour tissue than that in normal adjacent tissues, and could serve as a prognostic factor.BI2536 sensitizes ESCC cells to DDP by inhibiting the DNA damage repair pathway and inducing pyroptosis, which provides new information for understanding pyroptosis. Our study also reveals that the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 may be an attractive candidate for ESCC targeted therapy, especially when combined with DDP for treating the GSDME overexpression subtype.National 973 Program and National Natural Science Fundation of China.",

Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) with high expression in stomach generates chiral (R)-2-hydroxy FAs ((R)-2-OHFAs) and regulates glucose utilization which is important for cell proliferation and invasiveness. We hypothesized that FA2H impacts gastric tumor growth and could represent a novel target to improve gastric cancer therapy.FA2H level in 117 human gastric tumors and its association with tumor growth, metastasis and overall survival were examined. Its roles and potential mechanisms in regulating tumor growth were studied by genetic and pharmacological manipulation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.FA2H level was lower in gastric tumor tissues as compared to surrounding tissues and associated with clinicopathologic status of patients, which were confirmed by analyses of multiple published datasets. FA2H depletion decreased tumor chemosensitivity, partially due to inhibition of AMPK and activation of the mTOR/S6K1/Gli1 pathway. Conversely, FA2H overexpression or treatment with (R)-2-OHFAs had the opposite effects. In line with these in vitro observations, FA2H knockdown promoted tumor growth with increased level of tumor Gli1 in vivo. Moreover, (R)-2-OHFA treatment significantly decreased Gli1 level in gastric tumors and enhanced tumor chemosensitivity to cisplatin, while alleviating the chemotherapy-induced weight loss in mice.Our results demonstrate that FA2H plays an important role in regulating Hh signaling and gastric tumor growth and suggest that (R)-2-OHFAs could be effective as nontoxic wide-spectrum drugs to promote chemosensitivity.Grants of NSF, NIH, and PAPD.",

Similarly, the stratified LODDS classification had a better performance of discrimination and higher accuracy of prognosis than the pN and LNR classification. The multivariable model using the LODDS classification also showed superiorly predictive accuracy and discriminatory capacity to those of the 7th and, 8th TNM node and LNR classification. These results were fully validated in an independent international multicentre cohort.The LODDS scheme showed a better prognostic performance than the LNR or pN schemes in patients with SBA regardless of continuous or stratified pattern.

In situ hybridization and qPCR were used to evaluate the expression of MALAT1 and miR-106b-5p in the paraffin-embedded normal and CRC tissues. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis with the log-rank test was used for survival analyses. Immunohistochemistry staining was applied to investigate the expression of SLAIN2. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay was applied to observe the microtubule (MT) mobility. In vitro and in vivo invasion and metastasis assays were used to explore the function of MALAT1/miR-106b-5p/SLAIN2 in the progression of CRC.miR-106b-5p was identified as a suppressor in CRC. Functionally, ectopic or silencing the expression of miR-106b-5p inhibited or promoted the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. The long non-coding RNA MALAT1 regulated the miR-106b-5p expression and further mediated the mobility of SLAIN2-related MTs by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in the progression of CRC. Clinically, low miR-106b-5p expression predicted poor survival of CRC patients, especially in combination with high MALAT1/ SLAIN2 expression.miR-106b-5p served as a suppressor in combination with MALAT1/miR-106b-5p/SLAIN2, which might be a group of potential prognostic biomarkers in the prognosis of CRC.This work was supported by National Program Project for Precision Medicine in National Research and Development Plan of China (2016YFC0905300), National Natural Science Foundation of China (81572930), National Key Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016YFC0905303, 2016YFC1303200), Beijing Science and Technology Program (D17110002617004), Non-profit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (2018PT32012), CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences (CIFMS) (2016-I2M-1-001), Incentive Fund for Academic Leaders of Oncology Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (RC2016003), and Beijing Hope Run Special Fund from Cancer Foundation of China (LC2017A19).

Clinical specimens and mouse model of tumorigenesis were used for determining the expression and correlation of hnRNPM and its target gene. Transcriptomic and translatomic analyses were performed to profile target genes regulated by hnRNPM.Hypoxia increases cytosolic hnRNPM binding onto its target mRNAs and promotes translation initiation. Clinical colon cancer specimens and mouse carcinogenesis model showed that hnRNPM is elevated during the development of colorectal cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis.

Data of RNAseq, mutation profiles, copy number variation (CNV), miRNAseq and methylation array from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were adopted to analyze the distinctive genomic patterns associated with h-prune expression.By using TMA, we found increased expression of h-prune in HCC tumor cells compared with adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression of h-prune was correlated with poorer OS and DFS outcomes. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that h-prune expression was an independent risk factor for both OS and DFS. Gene enrichment analysis showed that the gene signatures of cell proliferation, DNA methylation and canonical Wnt signaling pathway were enriched in h-prune-high patients. Notably, somatic mutation analysis demonstrated that higher mutation burden of RB1 and RPS6KA3 could be observed in h-prune-high patients.

The effects of POH1 on the ubiquitination and stability of the TGF-\u03b2 receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) and the activation of downstream effectors were tested by western blotting. Primary mouse liver tissues from polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)- treated Mx-Cre+, poh1f/f mice and control mice were used to detect the TGF-\u03b2 receptors. The metastatic-related capabilities of HCC cells were studied in vitro and in mice.Here we show that POH1 is a critical regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and promotes tumor metastasis. Integrative analyses of HCC subgroups classified with unsupervised transcriptome clustering of the TGF-\u03b2 response, metastatic potential and outcomes, reveal that POH1 expression positively correlates with activities of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumors and with malignant disease progression. Functionally, POH1 intensifies TGF-\u03b2 signaling delivery and, as a consequence, promotes HCC cell metastatic properties both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of the TGF-\u03b2 receptors was severely downregulated in POH1-deficient mouse hepatocytes. Mechanistically, POH1 deubiquitinates the TGF-\u03b2 receptors and CAV1, therefore negatively regulates lysosome pathway-mediated turnover of TGF-\u03b2 receptors.Our study highlights the pathological significance of aberrantly expressed POH1 in TGF-\u03b2 signaling hyperactivation and aggressive progression in HCC.",

Although ILCs are critical for host defense against infections and tissue homeostasis, their roles in tumor development are not well established.We studied the function of ILC3 cells in the liver for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in murine HCC models using flow cytometry, adoptive transfer, and in vitro functional assays.We found that ILC3 lacking the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor (NCR\u2212ILC3) promoted the development of HCC in response to interleukin 23 (IL-23). IL-23 serum level is elevated in HCC patients and its high expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes. We found that IL-23 could promote tumor development in murine HCC tumor models. IL-23 promoted the expansion of NCR\u2212ILC3 and its differentiation from group 1 ILCs (ILC1s). Furthermore, NCR\u2212ILC3 initiated IL-17 production upon IL-23 stimulation and directly inhibited CD8+ T cell immunity by promoting lymphocyte apoptosis and limiting their proliferation.Together, our findings suggest that NCR\u2212ILC3 initiates the IL-17-rich immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and promotes the development of HCC, thus may serve as a promising target for future cancer immunotherapy.This work was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (81471586, 81571556), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, the collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, start-up grant from National University of Singapore, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas CPRIT (RR180017), and the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Center Support (Core) Grant CA016672 (to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center).",

     "abstract": "Analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is promising for broad applications in clinical settings, but with significant bias towards late-stage cancers. Although recent studies have discussed the diverse and degraded nature of cfDNA molecules, little is known about its impact on the practice of cfDNA analysis.We developed single-strand library preparation and hybrid-capture-based cfDNA sequencing (SLHC-seq) to analysis degraded cfDNA fragments. Next we used SLHC-seq to perform cfDNA profiling in 112 pancreatic cancer patients, and the results were compared with 13 previous reports. Extensive analysis was performed in terms of cfDNA fragments to explore the reasons for higher detection rate of KRAS mutations in the circulation of pancreatic cancers.By applying the new approach, we achieved higher efficiency in analysis of mutations than previously reported using other detection assays. 791 cancer-specific mutations were detected in plasma of 88% patients with KRAS hotspots detected in 70% of all patients. Only 8 mutations were detected in 28 healthy controls without any known oncogenic or truncating alleles. cfDNA profiling by SLHC-seq was largely consistent with results of tissue-based sequencing. SLHC-seq rescued short or damaged cfDNA fragments along to increase the sensitivity and accuracy of circulating-tumour DNA detection.We found that the small mutant fragments are prevalent in early-stage patients, which provides strong evidence for fragment size-based detection of pancreatic cancer. The new pipeline enhanced our understanding of cfDNA biology and provide new insights for liquid biopsy.",

Here, we describe a new mode of regulation of TRIM25 expression mediated by an antagonistic interplay between IGF2BP3 and miR-3614-3p.The expression level of TRIM25, IGF2BP3, pri-miR-3614 and miR-3614-3p in breast cancer (BC) tissues, non-tumor tissues and BC cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Binding of miR-3614-3p and IGF2BP3 to TRIM25 RNA was verified using luciferase activation assays, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and biotin pull-down assays. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of IGF2BP3-miR-3614-3p-TRIM25 axis in in breast cancer cells proliferation.We found that an intragenic miRNA-3614-3p inhibits the expression of its host gene TRIM25 by binding to its 3\u2032- untranslated region (UTR). Interestingly, IGF2BP3 can competitively occupy this binding site and inhibit miRNA-3614 maturation, thereby protecting TRIM25 mRNA from miR-3614-mediated degradation. The overexpression of miR-3614-3p dramatically inhibited breast cancer cell growth through the downregulation of TRIM25. Furthermore, the silencing of IGF2BP3 reduced TRIM25 expression, suppressed cell proliferation, and exhibited a synergistic effect with miR-3614-3p overexpression.Collectively, these results demonstrate that control of TRIM25 RNA by an interplay between IGF2BP3 and miR-3614-3p represents a mechanism for breast cancer cell proliferation.The scientific research and sharing platform construction project of Shaanxi Province, Opening Project of Key Laboratory of Shaanxi Province for Craniofacial Precision Medicine Research, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation and The National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

     "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant residents in the breast tumor microenvironment. In our work, we found activation of DNA damage-independent ATM (oxidized ATM), enhanced glycolysis and aberrant metabolism-associated gene expressions in breast CAFs. Nevertheless, whether and how oxidized ATM regulates the glycolytic activity of CAFs keep in unveil. Recently, a reverse Warburg effect was observed in tumor tissues, in which host cells (such as CAFs, PSCs) in the tumor microenvironment have been found to \u201cfuel\u201d the cancer cells via metabolites transfer. However, the molecular mechanisms of the metabolites from stromal cells playing a role to the progression of cancer cells remain to be determined.Oxidized ATM activation in stromal CAFs was assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. The increased glycolytic ability of CAFs was validated by measurements of OCR and ECAR and detections of glucose consumption and lactate production. Kinase assay and western blotting were performed to confirm the phosphorylation of GLUT1. The membrane location of phosphorylated GLUT1 was determined by biotin pull-down assay and immunofluorescence staining. The regulation of PKM2 through oxidized ATM was evaluated by western blots. In addition, the impact of lactate derived from hypoxic CAFs on cancer cell invasion was investigated both in vitro (transwell assays, western blots) and in vivo (orthotopic xenografts).Hypoxia-induced oxidized ATM promotes glycolytic activity of CAFs by phosphorylating GLUT1 at S490 and increasing PKM2 expression. Moreover, lactate derived from hypoxic CAFs, acting as a metabolic coupling between CAFs and breast cancer cells, promotes breast cancer cell invasion by activating the TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling axis and fueling the mitochondrial activity in cancer cells.Our work shows that oxidized ATM-mediated glycolysis enhancement in hypoxic stromal fibroblasts plays an essential role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis and may implicate oxidized ATM as a target for breast tumor treatment.This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to detect the transcriptional regulation of Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATC1). The prognostic merit of NFATC1 expression was assessed by Kaplan-Meier assay.Immunohistochemistry revealed strong immunostaining for FUNDC1 in cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane distribution in BC tissues as compared with normal breast epithelium. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis showed worse outcome for BC patients with high FUNDC1 expression. In vitro assay of gain- and loss-of-function of FUNDC1 suggested that FUNDC1 could stimulate BC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, elevated FUNDC1 level promoted Ca2+ cytosol influx from ER and extracellular, as well as NFATC1 nuclear translocation and activity. Nuclear NFATC1 bound to the BMI1 gene promoter and transcriptionally upregulated its expression. Notably, BMI1 overexpression could rescue the loss of function of FUNDC1. Co-expression of FUNDC1 and BMI1 in BC patients predicted worse prognosis than without either expression.FUNDC1 might promote BC progression by activating the Ca2+\u2013NFATC1\u2013BMI1 axis.

PD-L1 could promote the expression of stemness markers (OCT4 and Nanog) in breast cancer stem cells. However, the mechanisms by which PD-L1 regulates the stemness of breast cancer cells and PD-L1 is regulated in breast cancer cells are still unclear.Lentivirus infection was used to construct stable cell lines. The correlation between PD-L1 and stemness markers expression was evaluated in clinical samples. Additionally, luciferase reporter assay combined with RNA-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to verify the direct binding of miR-873 on PD-L1. Furthermore, flow cytometry, mammosphere formation combined with nude mouse tumor xenograft model were carried out to examine the effects of miR-873/PD-L1 axis on the stemness of breast cancer cells. Finally, MTT assay was performed to determine the effects of miR-873/PD-L1 axis on drug resistance.PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of stemness markers, and overexpression of PD-L1 contributed to chemoresistance and stemness-like properties in breast cancer cells via activating PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. Mechanistically, miR-873 inhibited PD-L1 expression through directly binding to its 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), and miR-873 attenuated the stemness and chemoresistance of breast cancer cells which was dependent on PD-L1 and the downstream PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling. Notably, the promotion of PD-L1 on the stemness and chemoresistance was enhanced by recombinant PD-1 (rPD-1), this effect was attenuated by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.miR-873/PD-L1 regulatory axis might serve as a therapeutic target to enhance the chemo-sensitivity and eliminate the stemness of breast cancer cells.This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China, No. 81702957, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation, No. 2017M620230, the Postdoctoral Research Funding Scheme of Jiangsu Province (2017), No. 1701197B, and the Priority Academic Program Development (PAPD) of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",

However, whether targeting the functional interplay between Ero1\u03b1 and PDI could be a new approach for cancer therapy remains unknown.We performed wound healing assays, transwell migration and invasion assays and xenograft assays to assess cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis; gel filtration chromatography, oxygen consumption assay and in cells folding assays were used to detect Ero1\u03b1-PDI interaction and Ero1\u03b1 oxidase activity.Here, we report that elevated expression of Ero1\u03b1 is correlated with poor prognosis in human cervical cancer. Knockout of ERO1A decreases the growth, migration and tumorigenesis of cervical cancer cells, through downregulation of the H2O2-correlated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We identify that the conserved valine (Val) 101 of Ero1\u03b1 is critical for Ero1\u03b1-PDI complex formation and Ero1\u03b1 oxidase activity. Val101 of Ero1\u03b1 is specifically involved in the recognition of PDI catalytic domain. Mutation of Val101 results in a reduced ER, retarded oxidative protein folding and decreased H2O2 levels in the ER of cervical cancer cells and further impairs cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth.Our study identifies the critical residue of Ero1\u03b1 for recognizing PDI, which underlines the molecular mechanism of oxidative protein folding for tumorigenesis and provides a proof-of-concept for cancer therapy by targeting Ero1\u03b1-PDI interaction.This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, and Youth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS.",

     "abstract": "Radiation-induced sarcoma (RIS) is a rare but serious event. Its occurrence has been discussed during the implementation of new radiation techniques and justified appropriate radioprotection requirements. New approaches targeting intrinsic radio-sensitivity have been described, such as radiation-induced CD8 T-lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) able to predict late radio-induced toxicities. We studied the role of RILA as a predisposing factor for RIS as a late adverse event following radiation therapy (RT).In this prospective biological study, a total of 120 patients diagnosed with RIS were matched with 240 control patients with cancer other than sarcoma, for age, sex, primary tumor location and delay after radiation. RILA was prospectively assessed from blood samples using flow cytometry.Three hundred and forty-seven patients were analyzed (118 RIS patients and 229 matched control patients). A majority (74%) were initially treated by RT for breast cancer. The mean RT dose was comparable with a similar mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) for RIS (53.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.0\u202fGy) and control patients (57.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f15.1\u202fGy) (p =\u202f.053). Median RILA values were significantly lower in RIS than in control patients with respectively 18.5% [5.5\u201355.7] and 22.3% [3.8\u201352.2] (p\u202f=\u202f.0008). Thus, patients with a RILA >21.3% are less likely to develop RIS (p <\u202f.0001, OR: 0.358, 95%CI [0.221\u20130.599].RILA is a promising indicator to predict an individual risk of developing RIS. Our results should be followed up and compared with molecular and genomic testing in order to better identify patients at risk.

     "abstract": "Transcriptional dysregulation drives cancer formation but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant kidney tumor which canonically activates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) pathway. Despite intensive study, novel therapeutic strategies to target RCC have been difficult to develop. Since the RCC epigenome is relatively understudied, we sought to elucidate key mechanisms underpinning the tumor phenotype and its clinical behavior.We performed genome-wide chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq) and transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) on paired tumor/normal samples from 3 patients undergoing nephrectomy for removal of RCC. We incorporated publicly available data on HIF binding (ChIP-seq) in a RCC cell line. We performed integrated analyses of these high-resolution, genome-scale datasets together with larger transcriptomic data available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Though HIF transcription factors play a cardinal role in RCC oncogenesis, we found that numerous transcription factors with a RCC-selective expression pattern also demonstrated evidence of HIF binding near their gene body. Examination of chromatin accessibility profiles revealed that some of these transcription factors influenced the tumor's regulatory landscape, notably the stem cell transcription factor POU5F1 (OCT4). Elevated POU5F1 transcript levels were correlated with advanced tumor stage and poorer overall survival in RCC patients. Unexpectedly, we discovered a HIF-pathway-responsive promoter embedded within a endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) element at the transcriptional start site of the PSOR1C3 long non-coding RNA gene upstream of POU5F1. RNA transcripts are induced from this promoter and read through PSOR1C3 into POU5F1 producing a novel POU5F1 transcript isoform. Rather than being unique to the POU5F1 locus, we found that HIF binds to several other transcriptionally active LTR elements genome-wide correlating with broad gene expression changes in RCC.Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of matched tumor and normal tissues from even a small number of primary patient samples revealed remarkably convergent shared regulatory landscapes. Several transcription factors appear to act downstream of HIF including the potent stem cell transcription factor POU5F1. Dysregulated expression of POU5F1 is part of a larger pattern of gene expression changes in RCC that may be induced by HIF-dependent reactivation of dormant promoters embedded within endogenous retroviral LTRs.",

Functional analysis of plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies showed that the DENV2-specific response was dominated by cells producing DENV2 serotype-specific antibodies. DENV2-neutralizing antibodies targeted quaternary structure epitopes centered on domain III of the viral envelope protein (EDIII). Functional analysis of MBC and serum antibodies from the same subjects six months post-challenge revealed maintenance of the serotype-specific response in both compartments. The serum response mainly targeted DENV2 serotype-specific epitopes on EDIII.Our data suggest overall functional alignment of DENV2-specific responses from the plasmablast, through the MBC and LLPC compartments following primary DENV2 inflection.

The quantitative relevance of efflux in more relevant clinical isolates remains largely unknown.We developed a versatile method for genetic engineering in multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, and used this method to delete tolC and specific antibiotic-resistance genes in 18 representative MDR clinical E. coli isolates. We determined efflux activity and minimal inhibitory concentrations for a diverse set of clinically relevant antibiotics in these mutants. We also deleted oprM in MDR P. aeruginosa strains and determined the impact on antibiotic susceptibility.tolC deletion abolished detectable efflux activity in 15 out of 18 tested E. coli strains, and modulated antibiotic susceptibility in many strains. However, all mutant strains retained MDR status, primarily because of other, antibiotic-specific resistance genes. Deletion of oprM altered antibiotic susceptibility in a fraction of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates.Efflux modulates antibiotic resistance in clinical MDR isolates of E. coli and P. aeruginosa.

We performed whole-genome sequencing on isolates collected post-2010 to assess their phylogenetic relationships and inter-country transmission.A total of 716 invasive meningococcal isolates collected between 2011 and 2016 from 11 meningitis belt countries were whole-genome sequenced for molecular characterization by the three WHO Collaborating Centers for Meningitis.We identified three previously-reported clonal complexes (CC): CC11 (n\u202f=\u202f434), CC181 (n\u202f=\u202f62) and CC5 (n\u202f=\u202f90) primarily associated with NmW, NmX, and NmA, respectively, and an emerging CC10217 (n\u202f=\u202f126) associated with NmC. CC11 expanded throughout the meningitis belt independent of the 2000 Hajj outbreak strain, with isolates from Central African countries forming a distinct sub-lineage within this expansion. Two major sub-lineages were identified for CC181 isolates, one mainly expanding in West African countries and the other found in Chad. CC10217 isolates from the large outbreaks in Nigeria and Niger were more closely related than those from the few cases in Mali and Burkina Faso.Whole-genome based phylogenies revealed geographically distinct strain circulation as well as inter-country transmission events. Our results stress the importance of continued meningococcal molecular surveillance in the region, as well as the development of an affordable vaccine targeting these strains.Meningitis Research Foundation; CDC's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection; GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.",

     "abstract": "Gut integrity is compromised in abdominal sepsis with increased cellular apoptosis and altered barrier permeability. Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) form a physiochemical barrier that separates the intestinal lumen from the host's internal milieu and is strongly involved in the mucosal inflammatory response and immune response. Recent research indicates the involvement of the stimulator of interferons genes (STING) pathway in uncontrolled inflammation and gut mucosal immune response.We investigated the role of STING signaling in sepsis and intestinal barrier function using intestinal biopsies from human patients with abdominal sepsis and with an established model of abdominal sepsis in mice.In human abdominal sepsis, STING expression was elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal biopsies compared with healthy controls, and the degree of STING expression in the human intestinal lamina propria correlated with the intestinal inflammation in septic patients. Moreover, elevated STING expression was associated with high levels of serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein that served as a marker of enterocyte damage. In mice, the intestinal STING signaling pathway was markedly activated following the induction of sepsis induced by cecal ligation perforation (CLP). STING knockout mice showed an alleviated inflammatory response, attenuated gut permeability, and decreased bacterial translocation. Whereas mice treated with a STING agonist (DMXAA) following CLP developed greater intestinal apoptosis and a more severe systemic inflammatory response. We demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was released during sepsis, inducing the intestinal inflammatory response through activating the STING pathway. We finally investigated DNase I administration at 5\u202fhours post CLP surgery, showing that it reduced systemic mtDNA and inflammatory cytokines levels, organ damage, and bacterial translocation, suggesting that inhibition of mtDNA-STING signaling pathway protects against CLP-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.Our results indicate that the STING signaling pathway can contribute to lethal sepsis by promoting IEC apoptosis and through disrupting the intestinal barrier. Our findings suggest that regulation of the mtDNA-STING pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy to promote mucosal healing and protect the intestinal barrier in septic patients.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

     "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is under investigation for a range of inflammatory conditions. While mechanisms of benefit are poorly understood, most models rely on the viability of transplanted microbes. We hypothesised that protocols commonly used in the preparation of faecal transplants will substantially reduce the number, diversity and functional potential of viable microbes.Stools from eight screened donors were processed under strict anaerobic conditions, in ambient air, and freeze-thawed. Propidium monoazide (PMA) sample treatment was combined with quantitative PCR, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis to define the viable microbiota composition and functional potential.Approximately 50% of bacterial content of stool processed immediately under strict anaerobic conditions was non-viable. Homogenisation in ambient air or freeze-thaw reduced viability to 19% and 23% respectively. Processing of samples in ambient air resulted in up to 12-fold reductions in the abundance of important commensal taxa, including the highly butyrogenic species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Subdoligranulum variable, and Eubacterium hallii. The adverse impact of atmospheric oxygen exposure on the capacity of the transplanted microbiota to support SCFA biosynthesis was demonstrated by significantly reduced butyrate and acetate production by faecal slurries processed in ambient air. In contrast, while reducing overall levels of viable bacteria, freeze-thaw did not significantly alter viable microbiota composition.The practice of preparing material for faecal transplantation in ambient air profoundly affects viable microbial content, disproportionately reducing the abundance of anaerobic commensals and the capacity for biosynthesis of important anti-inflammatory metabolites.This work was supported by the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.

     "abstract": "Skin atrophy is a major adverse effect of topical glucocorticoids. We recently reported that REDD1 (regulated in development and DNA damage 1) and FKBP51 (FK506 binding protein 5), negative regulators of mTOR/Akt signaling, are induced by glucocorticoids in mouse and human skin and are central drivers of steroid skin atrophy. Thus, we hypothesized that REDD1/FKBP51 inhibitors could protect skin against catabolic effects of glucocorticoids.Using drug repurposing approach, we screened LINCS library (http://lincsproject.org/LINCS/) to identify repressors of REDD1/FKBP51 expression. Candidate compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit glucocorticoid-induced REDD1/FKBP51 expression in human primary/immortalized keratinocytes and in mouse skin. Reporter gene expression, microarray, and chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to evaluate effect of these inhibitors on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling.Bioinformatics analysis unexpectedly identified phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR/Akt inhibitors as a pharmacological class of REDD1/FKBP51 repressors. Selected PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors-Wortmannin (WM), LY294002, AZD8055, and two others indeed blocked REDD1/FKBP51expression in human keratinocytes. PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors also modified global effect of glucocorticoids on trascriptome, shifting it towards therapeutically important transrepression; negatively impacted GR phosphorylation; nuclear translocation; and GR loading on REDD1/FKBP51 gene promoters. Further, topical application of LY294002 together with glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA) protected mice against FA-induced proliferative block and skin atrophy but did not alter the anti-inflammatory activity of FA in ear edema test.Our results built a strong foundation for development of safer GR-targeted therapies for inflammatory skin diseases using combination of glucocorticoids with PI3K/mTOR/Akt inhibitors.Work is supported by NIH grants R01GM112945, R01AI125366, and HESI-THRIVE foundation.",

Here, we investigated the role of osteoblastic pleckstrin homology domain-containing family O member 1 (PLEKHO1), a negative regulator of osteogenic lineage activity, in regulating joint inflammation in RA.The level of osteoblastic PLEKHO1 in RA patients and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice was examined. The role of osteoblastic PLEKHO1 in joint inflammation was evaluated by a CIA model and a K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis (STA) model which were induced in osteoblast-specific Plekho1 conditional knockout mice and mice expressing high Plekho1 exclusively in osteoblasts, respectively. The effect of osteoblastic PLEKHO1 inhibition was explored in a CIA mice model and a non-human primate arthritis model. The mechanism of osteoblastic PLEKHO1 in regulating joint inflammation were performed by a series of in vitro studies.PLEKHO1 was highly expressed in osteoblasts from RA patients and CIA mice. Osteoblastic Plekho1 deletion ameliorated joint inflammation, whereas overexpressing Plekho1 only within osteoblasts exacerbated local inflammation in CIA mice and STA mice. PLEKHO1 was required for TRAF2-mediated RIP1 ubiquitination to activate NF-\u03baB for inducing inflammatory cytokines production in osteoblasts. Moreover, osteoblastic PLEKHO1 inhibition diminished joint inflammation and promoted bone formation in CIA mice and non-human primate arthritis model.These data strongly suggest that the highly expressed PLEKHO1 in osteoblasts contributes to joint inflammation in RA. Targeting osteoblastic PLEKHO1 may exert dual therapeutic action of alleviating joint inflammation and promoting bone formation in RA.",

Cortistatin (CST) is a neuropeptide discovered over 20\u202f years ago, which plays a vital role in inflammatory reactions. However, it is unknown whether CST is involved in cartilage degeneration and OA development.The interaction between CST and TNF-\u03b1 receptors was investigated through Coimmunoprecipitation and Biotin-based solid-phase binding assay. Western blot, Real-time PCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence staining, nitrite production assay and DMMB assay of GAG were performed for the primary chondrocyte experiments. Surgically induced and spontaneous OA models were established and western blot, flow cytometry, Real-time PCR, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in vivo imaging were performed for in vivo experiments.CST competitively bound to TNFR1 as well as TNFR2. CST suppressed proinflammatory function of TNF-\u03b1. Both spontaneous and surgically induced OA models indicated that deficiency of CST led to an accelerated OA-like phenotype, while exogenous CST attenuated OA development in vivo. Additionally, TNFR1- and TNFR2-knockout mice were used for analysis and indicated that TNFRs might be involved in the protective role of CST in OA. CST inhibited activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in OA.This study provides new insight into the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategy of cartilage degenerative diseases, including OA.The National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, Key Research and Development Projects of Shandong Province and the Cross-disciplinary Fund of Shandong University.",

     "abstract": "Acute T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) is usually indicated by alteration in serum-creatinine measurements when considerable transplant damage has already occurred. There is, therefore, a need for non-invasive early detection of immune signals that would precede the onset of rejection, prior to transplant damage.We examined the RT-qPCR expression of 22 literature-based genes in peripheral blood samples from 248 patients in the Kidney Allograft Immune Biomarkers of Rejection Episodes (KALIBRE) study. To account for post-transplantation changes unrelated to rejection, we generated time-adjusted gene-expression residuals from linear mixed-effects models in stable patients. To select genes, we used penalised logistic regression based on 27 stable patients and 27 rejectors with biopsy-proven T-cell-mediated rejection, fulfilling strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. We validated this signature in i) an independent group of stable patients and patients with concomitant T-cell and antibody-mediated-rejection, ii) patients from an independent study, iii) cross-sectional pre-biopsy samples from non-rejectors and iv) longitudinal follow-up samples covering the first post-transplant year from rejectors, non-rejectors and stable patients.A parsimonious TCMR-signature (IFNG, IP-10, ITGA4, MARCH8, RORc, SEMA7A, WDR40A) showed cross-validated area-under-ROC curve 0.84 (0.77\u20130.88) (median, 2.5th\u201397.5th centile of fifty cross-validation cycles), sensitivity 0.67 (0.59\u20130.74) and specificity 0.85 (0.75\u20130.89). The estimated probability of TCMR increased seven weeks prior to the diagnostic biopsy and decreased after treatment. Gene expression in all patients showed pronounced variability, with up to 24% of the longitudinal samples in stable patients being TCMR-signature positive. In patients with borderline changes, up to 40% of pre-biopsy samples were TCMR-signature positive.Molecular marker alterations in blood emerge well ahead of the time of clinically overt TCMR. Monitoring a TCMR-signature in peripheral blood could unravel T-cell-related pro-inflammatory activity and hidden immunological processes. This additional information could support clinical management decisions in cases of patients with stable but poor kidney function or with inconclusive biopsy results.",

Acute GVHD humanised mice showed activation of T cells with skewed TCR repertoire without significant macrophage activation.Using humanised mouse models, we demonstrated distinct immune mechanisms contributing acute and chronic GVHD. In cGVHD model, co-activation of human HSPC-derived macrophages and T cells educated in the recipient thymus contributed to delayed onset, multi-organ disease. In acute GVHD model, mature human T cells contained in the graft resulted in rapid disease progression.

     "abstract": "The fallopian tube fimbria is regarded as the main tissue of origin and incessant ovulation as the main risk factor of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Previously, we discovered the tumorigenesis activity of human ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) upon injection to the mammary fat pad of Trp53-null mice. We also found a mutagenesis activity of FF-ROS and a apoptosis-rescuing activity of Hb from retrograde menstruation. However, neither of them can explain the tumorigenesis activities of FF.From two cohorts of ovulatory FF retrieved from IVF patients, the main growth factor responsible for the transformation of human fimbrial epithelial cells was identified. Mechanism of activation, ways of signal transduction of the growth factor, as well as the cellular and genetic phenotypes of the malignant transformation was characterized.In this study, we showed that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-axis proteins, including IGFBP-bound IGF2 as well as the IGFBP-lytic enzyme PAPP-A, are abundantly present in FF. Upon engaging with glycosaminoglycans on the membrane of fimbrial epithelial cells, PAPP-A cleaves IGFBPs and releases IGF2 to bind with IGF-1R. Through the IGF-1R/AKT/mTOR and IGF-1R/AKT/NANOG pathways, FF-IGF leads to stemness and survival, and in the case of TP53/Rb or TP53/CCNE1 loss, to clonal expansion and malignant transformation of fimbrial epithelial cells. By depleting each IGF axis component from FF, we proved that IGF2, IGFBP2/6, and PAPP-A are all essential and confer the majority of the transformation and regeneration activities.This study revealed that the FF\u2013IGF axis functions to regenerate tissue damage after ovulation and promote the transformation of fimbrial epithelial cells that have been initiated by p53- and Rb-pathway disruptions.The study was supported by grants of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 106-2314-B-303-001-MY2; MOST 105-2314-B-303-017-MY2; MOST 107-2314-B-303-013-MY3), and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, Taiwan (TCMMP104-04-01).",

However, the specific antigenic epitopes of ATAB have remained unknown. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to determine specific targets of ATAB in uRM patients.Potential targets of ATAB were analyzed by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry, and thereby identifying \u03b1-Enolase (ENO1). ATAB targeting of ENO1 was further confirmed in a competitive binding assay. Levels of anti-ENO1 antibodies as well as \u03b2-hCG and progesterone were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, expression of ENO1 was analyzed in first trimester placentas by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis.We here identified ENO1 as a prominent target of ATAB. Serum levels of anti-ENO1 antibodies were increased in ATAB-positive compared to ATAB-negative patients. Further, increased expression of ENO1 and its co-expression with \u03b2-arrestin was found in the extra villous trophoblasts of uRM patients in first trimester placentas. In vitro, anti-ENO1 antibodies decreased the secretion of \u03b2-hCG and progesterone in JEG-3 and primary human villous trophoblast cells.Serum anti-ENO1 antibodies might be an autoimmune biomarker for uRM.

Mouse ovary organ cultures were used to examine the direct role of metabolites or metabolic hormones on primordial follicle activation.Mouse primordial follicle activation, was reduced by restricted protein intake and was accelerated by excessive protein intake, in an ovarian mTORC1 signaling-dependent manner. Furthermore, restricted or excessive protein intake resulted in an augmentation or decline of oocyte number and fertility at older age, respectively. Liver-specific ablation of FGF21, which resulted in a reduction of 87% in circulating FGF21, abrogated the preserving effect of low-protein intake on primordial follicle pool. Interestingly, FGF21 had no direct effect on the activation of primordial follicles, but instead required an adipokine adiponectin. Moreover, AdipoRon, an oral adiponectin receptor agonist, prevented the over-activation effect of excessive protein intake on primordial follicle activation.Dietary protein consumption controlled ovarian primordial follicle reserve and fertility, which required coordination between FGF21 and adiponectin.Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 31772616).",

It is associated with placental oxidative stress, hypoxia and inflammation leading to soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sENG) secretion and reduced placental growth factor (PlGF). This results in widespread endothelial dysfunction causing hypertension and multisystem organ injury. Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant medication used to treat autoimmune disease. Importantly, it is safe in pregnancy. We examined the potential of sulfasalazine to quench antiangiogenic factors and endothelial dysfunction and increase angiogenic factor secretion.We performed functional experiments using primary human pregnancy tissues to examine the effects of sulfasalazine on sFlt-1, sENG and PlGF secretion. Sulfasalazine is known to inhibit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and upregulate heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) thus we explored the effect of these transcription factors on sFlt-1 secretion from human cytotrophoblasts. We examined the ability of sulfasalazine to reduce key markers of endothelial dysfunction and dilate whole blood vessels.We demonstrate sulfasalazine administration reduces sFlt-1 and sENG and upregulates PlGF secretion from human placental tissues. Furthermore sulfasalazine mitigates endothelial dysfunction in several in vitro/ex vivo assays. It enhanced endothelial cell migration and proliferation, promoted blood vessel dilation (vessels obtained from women at caesarean section) and angiogenic sprouting from whole blood vessel rings. The effect of sulfasalazine on the secretion of sFlt-1 was not mediated through either the NFkB or HO-1 pathways.We conclude that sulfasalazine reduces sFlt-1 and sENG secretion and endothelial dysfunction and upregulates PlGF.

Under optogenetic stimulation substance P increased in wildtype to match levels in Dyt1 KI, and acetylcholinesterase was elevated in the striatum of stimulated DYT1 KI. No signs of dystonic movements were observed under stimulation of up to one hour in both genotypes and age groups, and the sensorimotor deficit previously observed in 6\u202fmonths old DYT1 KI mice persisted under stimulation.Overall this supports an endophenotype of dysregulated cholinergic activity in DYT1 dystonia, but depolarizing cholinergic interneurons was not sufficient to induce overt dystonia in DYT1 KI mice.",

Due to the lack of reliable prediction methods, the acute evaluation of SCI severity and therapeutic intervention efficacy is extremely difficult, presenting major obstacles to the development of acute SCI treatment. We herein report a novel method for accurately predicting the functional prognosis using the acute-phase serum zinc concentration after SCI.We produced experimental animal SCI models with different prognoses and examined the relationship among the SCI severity, functional outcome, and acute-phase serum zinc concentration. We also examined whether we could predict the functional prognosis by evaluating the serum zinc concentration within 72\u202fh after SCI in a human prospective study.In a mouse model, the acute serum zinc concentrations decreased in proportion to SCI severity and the serum zinc concentrations at 12\u202fh after SCI accurately predicted the functional prognosis. We clarified the mechanism underlying this serum zinc proportional decrease, showing that activated monocytes took up zinc from blood-serum and then infiltrated the lesion area in a severity-dependent manner. A non-linear regression analysis of 38 SCI patients showed that the serum zinc concentrations in the acute-phase accurately predicted the long-term functional outcome (R2\u202f=\u202f0\u00b784) more accurately than any other previously reported acute-phase biomarkers.The acute-phase serum zinc concentration could be a useful biomarker for predicting the functional prognosis. This simple method will allow for more objective clinical trials and the development of patient-tailored treatment for SCI.",

In severe cases, the progression of pleural fibrosis leads to lung entrapment, resulting in dyspnea and respiratory failure. However, the mechanism of pleural fibrosis is poorly understood.miR-4739 levels were detected by miRNA array and real-time PCR. Real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to identify the expression profile of indicators related to fibrosis. Target gene of miR-4739 and promoter activity assay was measured by using dual-luciferase reporter assay system. In vivo, pleural fibrosis was evaluated by Masson staining and miR-4739 level was detected by In situ hybridization histochemistry.We found that bleomycin induced up-regulation of miR-4739 in pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs). Over-regulated miR-4739 mediated mesothelial-mesenchymal transition and increased collagen-I synthesis in PMCs. Investigation on the clinical specimens revealed that high levels of miR-4739 and low levels of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) associated with pleural fibrosis in patients. Then we next identified that miR-4739 targeted and down-regulated BMP-7 which further resulted in unbalance between Smad1/5/9 and Smad2/3 signaling. Lastly, in vivo studies revealed that miR-4739 over-expression induced pleural fibrosis, and exogenous BMP-7 prevented pleural fibrosis in mice.Our data indicated that miR-4739 targets BMP-7 which mediates pleural fibrosis.

     "abstract": "Cell senescence is a driver of ageing, frailty, age-associated disease and functional decline. In oncology, tumour cell senescence may contribute to the effect of adjuvant therapies, as it blocks tumour growth. However, this is frequently incomplete, and tumour cells that recover from senescence may gain a more stem-like state with increased proliferative potential. This might be exaggerated by the induction of senescence in the surrounding niche cells. Finally, senescence will spread through bystander effects, possibly overwhelming the capacity of the immune system to ablate senescent cells. This induces a persistent system-wide senescent cell accumulation, which we hypothesize is the cause for the premature frailty, multi-morbidity and increased mortality in cancer survivors.Senolytics, drugs that selectively kill senescent cells, have been developed recently and have been proposed as second-line adjuvant tumour therapy. Similarly, by blocking accelerated senescence following therapy, senolytics might prevent and potentially even revert premature frailty in cancer survivors.Adjuvant senostatic interventions, which suppress senescence-associated bystander signalling, might also have therapeutic potential. This becomes pertinent because treatments that are senostatic in vitro (e.g. dietary restriction mimetics) persistently reduce numbers of senescent cells in vivo, i.e. act as net senolytics in immunocompetent hosts.",

Therefore, there is a mandate to find novel therapeutic targets to improve therapy, and biomarkers to monitor therapeutic response.Liver fibrosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or thioacetamide (TAA) in wild type (WT) or CTHRC1\u2212/\u2212 mice, followed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. CTHRC1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used to abrogate the effect of CTHRC1 in vitro and in vivo.Here, we reported that collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1), a secreted protein derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), was significantly up-regulated in fibrotic liver tissues. CTHRC1 promoted HSCs transformation from a quiescent to an activated state, and enhanced migratory or contractile capacities of HSCs by activating TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Meanwhile, CTHRC1 competitively bound to Wnt noncononical receptor and promoted the contractility but not activation of HSCs. CCl4 or TAA-induced liver fibrosis was attenuated in CTHRC\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with littermate control, while a monoclonal antibody of CTHRC1 suppressed liver fibrosis in WT mice treated with CCl4 or TAA.We demonstrated that CTHRC1 is a new regulator of liver fibrosis by modulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Targeting CTHRC1 could be a promising therapeutic approach, which can suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling and avoid the side effects caused by directly targeting TGF-\u03b2.

It remains unknown whether excessive PTH secretion affects WAT browning and to what extent it contributes to body weight change in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).Using the adeno-associated virus injection, Pth gene over-expressed mice mimicking PHPT were firstly established to observe their WAT browning and body weight alteration. The association between PTH and body weight was investigated in 496 PHPT patients. The adipose browning activities of 20 PHPT and 60 control subjects were measured with PET/CT scanning.Elevated plasma PTH triggered adipose tissue browning, leading to increased energy expenditure, reduced fat content, and finally decreased body weight in PHPT mice. Higher circulating PTH levels were associated with lower body weight (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.048, P\u202f=\u202f.0003) independent of renal function, serum calcium, phosphorus,and albumin levels in PHPT patients. PHPT patients exhibited both higher prevalence of detectable brown/beige adipose tissue (20% vs 3.3%, P\u202f=\u202f.03) and increased browning activities (SUV in cervical adipose was 0.77 vs 0.49,P\u202f=\u202f.02) compared with control subjects.Elevated serum PTH drove WAT browning program, which contributed in part to body weight loss in both PHPT mice and patients.

     "abstract": "Bariatric surgery leads to early and long-lasting remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. Among several factors, gut hormones are thought to be crucial mediators of this effect. Unlike GLP-1, the role of the hormone peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) in bariatric surgery in humans has been limited to appetite regulation and its impact on pancreatic islet secretory function and glucose metabolism remains under-studied.Changes in PYY concentrations were examined in obese patients after bariatric surgery and compared to healthy controls. Human pancreatic islet function was tested upon treatment with sera from patients before and after the surgery, in presence or absence of PYY. Alterations in intra-islet PYY release and insulin secretion were analysed after stimulation with short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and the cytokine IL-22.We demonstrate that PYY is a key effector of the early recovery of impaired glucose-mediated insulin and glucagon secretion in bariatric surgery. We establish that the short chain fatty acid propionate and bile acids, which are elevated after surgery, can trigger PYY release not only from enteroendocrine cells but also from human pancreatic islets. In addition, we identify IL-22 as a new factor which is modulated by bariatric surgery in humans and which directly regulates PYY expression and release.This study shows that some major metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery can be emulated ex vivo. Our findings are expected to have a direct impact on the development of new non-surgical therapy for T2D correction.",

Suppression of QCR2 inhibits cancer cell growth by activating p53 signaling and inducing p21-dependent cell cycle arrest and senescence. QCR2 directly interacts with PHB in the mitochondria. Overexpression of QCR2 inhibits PHB binding to p53 in the nucleus, and facilitates p53 ubiquitination and degradation, consequently leading to tumorigenesis.

The manufacturing of T cells in a tailor-made setting is a long and expensive process which could be resolved by the use of universal cells. Currently, only the Natural Killer (NK) cell line NK-92 is FDA approved for universal use. In order to expand their recognition ability, they were equipped with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs). However, unlike CARs, T-cell receptors (TCRs) can recognize all cellular proteins, which expand NK-92 recognition to the whole proteome.We herein genetically engineered NK-92 to express the CD3 signaling complex, and showed that it rendered them able to express a functional TCR. Functional assays and in vivo efficacy were used to validate these cells.This is the first demonstration that a non-T cell can exploit TCRs. This TCR-redirected cell line, termed TCR-NK-92, mimicked primary T cells phenotypically, metabolically and functionally, but retained its NK cell effector functions.

A training data set of biopsy-verified reports, normal and cancerous skin lesions (n\u202f=\u202f3954), were used to develop a DL classifier exploring visual features (System A). The outputs of the classifier were sonified, i.e. data conversion into sound (System B). Derived sound files were analyzed by a second machine learning classifier, either as raw audio (LABS, OBS) or following conversion into spectrograms (LABS) and by image analysis and human heuristics (OBS). The OBS criteria outcomes were System A specificity and System B sensitivity as raw sounds, spectrogram areas or heuristics.LABS employed dermoscopies, half benign half malignant, and compared the accuracy of Systems A and B. System A algorithm resulted in a ROC AUC of 0.976 (95% CI, 0.965\u20130.987). Secondary machine learning analysis of raw sound, FFT and Spectrogram ROC curves resulted in AUC's of 0.931 (95% CI 0.881\u20130.981), 0.90 (95% CI 0.838\u20130.963) and 0.988 (CI 95% 0.973\u20131.001), respectively. OBS analysis of raw sound dermoscopies by the secondary machine learning resulted in a ROC AUC of 0.819 (95% CI, 0.7956 to 0.8406). OBS image analysis of AUC for spectrograms displayed a ROC AUC of 0.808 (CI 95% 0.6945 To 0.9208). By applying a heuristic analysis of Systems A and B a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 91% were derived in the clinical study.Adding a second stage of processing, which includes a deep learning algorithm of sonification and heuristic inspection with machine learning, significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. A combined two-stage system is expected to assist clinical decisions and de-escalate the current trend of over-diagnosis of skin cancer lesions as pathological.Bostel Technologies.Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03362138",

     "abstract": "Fast growing cancer cells require greater amounts of ATP than normal cells. Although glycolysis was suggested as a source of anabolic metabolism based on lactate production, the main source of ATP to support cancer cell metabolism remains unidentified.We have proposed that the oxoglutarate carrier SLC25A11 is important for ATP production in cancer by NADH transportation from the cytosol to mitochondria as a malate. We have examined not only changes of ATP and NADH but also changes of metabolites after SLC25A11 knock down in cancer cells.The mitochondrial electron transport chain was functionally active in cancer cells. The cytosolic to mitochondrial NADH ratio was higher in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma cells than in normal cells. This was consistent with higher levels of the oxoglutarate carrier SLC25A11. Blocking malate transport by knockdown of SLC25A11 significantly impaired ATP production and inhibited the growth of cancer cells, which was not observed in normal cells. In in vivo experiments, heterozygote of SLC25A11 knock out mice suppressed KRASLA2 lung tumor formation by cross breeding.Cancer cells critically depended on the oxoglutarate carrier SLC25A11 for transporting NADH from cytosol to mitochondria as a malate form for the purpose of ATP production. Therefore blocking SLC25A11 may have an advantage in stopping cancer growth by reducing ATP production.The Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT to SYK (NRF-2017R1A2B2003428).",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind resistance is therefore an important issue. Here we assessed the role of EGFR pathway substrate 8 (EPS8) and Forkhead box O 3a (FoxO3a) as potentially valuable targets in the resistance of NSCLC .The expression levels of EPS8 and FoxO3a in patients with NSCLC (n\u202f=\u202f75) were examined by immunohistochemistry staining, while in cells were detected by qPCR and western blot. The effects of EPS8 and FoxO3a on resistance, migration and invasion, cell cycle arrest were detected by MTT, transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the mechanisms of EPS8 expression and FoxO3a regulation.We observed that the expression of EPS8 inversely correlated with FoxO3a in NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC patients. FoxO3a levels were significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with para-carcinoma tissues, while EPS8 is opposite. Besides, they play reverse roles in the resistance to gefitinib, the migration and invasion abilities, the cell cycle arrest in vitro and the tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, FoxO3a inhibits EPS8 levels by directly binding its gene promoter and they form a negative loop in EGFR pathway.Targeting FoxO3a and EPS8 in EGFR signaling pathway prevents the progression of NSCLC, which implied that the negative loop they formed could served as a therapeutic target for overcoming resistance in NSCLC.National Natural Science Foundation of China, Science and Technology Project of Henan, Outstanding Young Talent Research Fund of Zhengzhou University and the National Scholarship Fund.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant tumor mainly occurring in young people. Due to the limited effective therapeutic strategies, OS patients cannot achieve further survival improvement. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of cell membrane receptors and consequently hold the significant promise for tumor imaging and targeted therapy. We aimed to explore the biological functions of Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1PR3), one of the members of GPCRs family, in OS and the possibility of S1PR3 as an effective target for the treatment of osteosarcoma.The quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expressions. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation assay and cell apoptosis assay were performed to test the cellular proliferation in vitro. Subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was generated to evaluate the functions of S1PR3 in vivo. RNA sequencing was used to compare gene expression patterns between S1PR3-knockdown and control MNNG-HOS cells. In addition, metabolic alternations in OS cells were monitored by XF96 metabolic flux analyzer. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was used to explore the interaction between Yes-associated protein (YAP) and c-MYC. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to investigate the binding capability of PGAM1 and YAP or c-MYC. Moreover, the activities of promoter were determined by the luciferase reporter assay.S1PR3 and its specific ligand Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were found elevated in OS, and the higher expression of S1PR3 was correlated with the poor survival rate. Moreover, our study has proved that the S1P/S1PR3 axis play roles in proliferation promotion, apoptosis inhibition, and aerobic glycolysis promotion of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, the S1P/S1PR3 axis inhibited the phosphorylation of YAP and promoted the nuclear translocation of YAP, which contributed to the formation of the YAP\u2013c-MYC complex and enhanced transcription of the important glycolysis enzyme PGAM1. Moreover, the S1PR3 antagonist TY52156 exhibited in vitro and in vivo synergistic inhibitory effects with methotrexate on OS cell growth.Our study unveiled a role of S1P, a bioactive phospholipid, in glucose metabolism reprogram through interaction with its receptor S1PR3. Targeting S1P/S1PR3 axis might serve as a potential therapeutic target for patients with OS.This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81472445 and 81672587).",

Here, we evaluate the chimeric anti-mouse PDGFR\u03b1 antibody 1E10Fc as a radiosensitizer in a primary mouse model of STS.Primary STS were initiated in mice.

RT (25\u202fGy delivered in 5 daily 5\u202fGy fractions) was initiated on Day 0 with first drug treatment. Tumors were measured 3\u00d7 per week. Upon reaching 900\u202fmm3, tumors and lungs were harvested. A two-way ANOVA was performed to compare tumor growth delay. Primary tumors were stained for CD31 and PDGFR\u03b1 and lungs were assessed for micrometastases.

Currently, the 5-year survival of AML patients is about 30% and for elderly patients, the rate drops to <10%. About 30% of AML patients harbor an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of Fms-Like Tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) or a FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). Inhibitors of FLT3, such as Rydapt that was recently approved by the FDA, have shown good initial response but patients often relapse due to secondary mutations in the FLT3 TKD, like D835Y and F691\u202fL mutations.Alkynyl aminoisoquinoline and naphthyridine compounds were synthesized via Sonogashira coupling. The compounds were evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo effects on leukemia growth.The compounds inhibited FLT3 kinase activity at low nanomolar concentrations. The lead compound, HSN431, also inhibited Src kinase activity. The compounds potently inhibited the viability of MV4\u201311 and MOLM-14 AML cells with IC50 values <1\u202fnM. Furthermore, the viability of drug-resistant AML cells harboring the D835Y and F691\u202fL mutations were potently inhibited.

In the training cohort, we formulated a prognostic lncRNA scoring system composed of five lncRNAs with significant prognostic impact from the lncRNA expression profiling.Higher lncRNA scores were significantly associated with older age and adverse gene mutations. Further, the higher-score patients had shorter overall and disease-free survival than lower-score patients, which were also confirmed in both internal and external validation cohorts (TCGA database). The multivariate analyses revealed the lncRNA score was an independent prognosticator in AML, irrespective of the risk based on the 2017 ELN classification. Moreover, in the 2017 ELN intermediate-risk subgroup, lncRNA scoring system could well dichotomize the patients into two groups with distinct prognosis. Within the ELN intermediate-risk subgroup, we found that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could provide better outcome on patients with higher lncRNA scores.

Despite recent progress, the mechanism underlying chemoresistance remains to be further defined.Expression of G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsies of primary breast cancer who subsequently underwent preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of -function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of GPR120 signaling pathway in the chemoresistance of breast cancer cells.We identified that GPR120, a receptor for long-chain fatty acids, was important for the acquisition of chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. We showed that GPR120 expression was positively associated with clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients. In breast cancer cells, GPR120 enhanced the de novo synthesis of fatty acids that served as GPR120 ligands to activate GPR120 signaling via a feedback mechanism. Upregulated GPR120 signaling rendered cells resistant to epirubicin-induced cell death by upregulating ABC transporters expression and thus decreasing the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin. Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway was responsible for the GPR120-mediated expression of ABC transporters leading to modulation of the concentration of chemotherapeutic drugs in cells. The functional importance of GPR120 in chemoresistance was further validated using epirubicin-treated tumor xenografts, in which we showed that blockade of GPR120 signaling with AH7614 or GPR120-siRNA significantly compromised chemoresistance.Our results highlight that GPR120 might be a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer chemoresistance.National Natural Science Foundation of China, Ministry of Science and Technology of China, Program of Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality.",

     "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains difficult to be targeted. SET and cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) are intrinsic protein-interacting inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and frequently overexpressed in cancers, whereas reactivating PP2A activity has been postulated as an anti-cancer strategy. Here we explored this strategy in TNBC.Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed. TNBC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. The apoptotic cells were examined by flow cytometry and Western blot. A SET-PP2A protein-protein interaction antagonist TD19 was used to disrupt signal transduction. In vivo efficacy of TD19 was tested in MDA-MB-468-xenografted animal model.TCGA data revealed upregulation of SET and CIP2A and positive correlation of these two gene expressions in TNBC tumors. Ectopic SET or CIP2A increased cell viability, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells. Notably ERK inhibition increased PP2A activity. ERK activation is known crucial for Elk-1 activity, a transcriptional factor regulating CIP2A expression, we hypothesized an oncogenic feedforward loop consisting of pERK/pElk-1/CIP2A/PP2A. This loop was validated by knockdown of PP2A and ectopic expression of Elk-1, showing reciprocal changes in loop members. In addition, ectopic expression of SET increased pAkt, pERK, pElk-1 and CIP2A expressions, suggesting a positive linkage between SET and CIP2A signaling. Moreover, TD19 disrupted this CIP2A-feedforward loop by restoring PP2A activity, demonstrating in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity. Mechanistically, TD19 downregulated CIP2A mRNA via inhibiting pERK-mediated Elk-1 nuclear translocation thereby decreased Elk-1 binding to the CIP2A promoter.These findings suggested that a novel oncogenic CIP2A-feedforward loop contributes to TNBC progression and targeting SET to disrupt this oncogenic CIP2A loop showed therapeutic potential in TNBC.",

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and chemoresistance, have been confirmed in endometrial cancer. However, it is still challenging to identify endometrial cancer stem cells to then target for therapy.Flow cytometry was used to identify the endometrial cancer stem cells. Sphere formation assay, western blotting, qRT-PCR assay, cell viability assay, xenograft assay and immunohistochemistry staining analysis were utilized to evaluate the effect of SPARC-related modular calcium binding 2 (SMOC-2) on the cells proliferation and drug resistance. Cell viability assay, qRT-PCR assay, immunofluorescence staining, Co-IP assay and luciferase reporter gene assay were performed to explore the possible molecular mechanism by which SMOC-2 activates WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway.We found the expression of SPARC-related modular calcium binding 2 (SMOC-2), a member of SPARC family, was higher in endometrial CSCs than that in non-CSCs. SMOC-2 was also more highly expressed in spheres than in monolayer cultures. The silencing of SMOC-2 suppressed cell sphere ability; reduced the expression of the stemness-associated genes SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG; and enhanced chemosensitivity in endometrial cancer cells. By co-culture IP assay, we demonstrated that SMOC-2 directly interacted with WNT receptors (Fzd6 and LRP6), enhanced ligand-receptor interaction with canonical WNT ligands (Wnt3a and Wnt10b), and finally, activated the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway in endometrial cancer. SMOC-2 expression was closely correlated with CSC markers CD133 and CD44 expression in endometrial cancer tissue.Taken together, we conclude that SMOC-2 might be a novel endometrial cancer stem cell signature gene and therapeutic target for endometrial cancer.National Natural Science Foundation of China, Scientific and Technological Innovation Act Program of Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, Scientific and Technological Innovation Act Program of Fengxian Science and Technology Commission, Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai.",

A radiomics nomogram based on radiomic features and clinical variables was developed for DM risk assessment in each patient, and it showed a significant predictive ability in the training [area under the curve (AUC), 0\u00b7827; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.754\u20130.900] and validation (AUC, 0.792; 95% CI, 0.633\u20130.952) cohorts.DMMM can serve as a visual prognostic tool for DM prediction in NPC, and it can improve treatment decisions by aiding in the differentiation of patients with high and low risks of DM.This research received financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81571664, 81871323, 81801665, 81771924, 81501616, 81671851, and 81527805); the National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018B030311024); the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (2016A020216020); the Scientific Research General Project of Guangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission (201707010328); the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M600145); and the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFA0205200, 2017YFC1308700, and 2017YFC1309100).",

     "abstract": "As part of the tumor microenvironment, the gastric microbiota play vital roles in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis, but stomach microhabitats are not always uniform. We aimed to characterize differences of gastric microbiota in stomach microhabitats associated with gastric cancer (GC) development.A cohort of 276 GC patients without preoperative chemotherapy was enrolled retrospectively, and 230 normal, 247 peritumoral and 229 tumoral tissues were obtained for gastric microbiota analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene by MiSeq sequencing. The microbial diversity and composition, bacterial co-occurrence correlations and predictive functional profiles were compared across different microhabitats.GC-specific stomach microhabitats, not GC stages or types, determine the composition and diversity of the gastric microbiota. Most notably, bacterial richness was decreased in peritumoral and tumoral microhabitats, and the correlation network of abundant gastric bacteria was simplified in tumoral microhabitat. Helicobacter pylori (HP), Prevotella copri and Bacteroides uniformis were significantly decreased, whereas Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus anginosus and Propionibacterium acnes were increased in tumoral microhabitat. Higher HP colonisation influenced the overall structure of the gastric microbiota in normal and peritumoral microhabitats. PiCRUSt analysis revealed that genes associated with nucleotide transport and metabolism and amino acid transport and metabolism were significantly enriched in tumoral microbiota, while gastric acid secretion was significantly higher in HP positive group of the tumoral microbiota.Our present study provided new insights into the roles of gastric microbiota in different stomach microhabitats in gastric carcinogenesis, especially the pathogenesis of HP.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

Expression of truncated O-glycans, such as the Sialyl-Tn (STn) antigen, is a common feature shared by many cancers and is associated with cancer aggressiveness and poor-prognosis.Glycoengineered cell lines were used to evaluate the impact of truncated O-glycans in cancer cell biology using in vitro functional assays, transcriptomic analysis and in vivo models. Tumor patients \u2018samples and datasets were used for clinical translational significance evaluation.In the present study, we demonstrated that gastric cancer cells expressing truncated O-glycans display major phenotypic alterations associated with higher cell motility and cell invasion. Noteworthy, the glycoengineered cancer cells overexpressing STn resulted in tumor xenografts with less cohesive features which had a critical impact on mice survival. Furthermore, truncation of O-glycans induced activation of EGFR and ErbB2 receptors and a transcriptomic signature switch of gastric cancer cells. The disclosed top activated genes were further validated in gastric tumors, revealing that SRPX2 and RUNX1 are concomitantly overexpressed in gastric carcinomas and its expression is associated with patients' poor-survival, highlighting their prognosis potential in clinical practice.This study discloses novel molecular links between O-glycans truncation frequently observed in cancer and key cellular regulators with major impact in tumor progression and patients' clinical outcome.",

Preclinical studies with orthotopic PC demonstrated dramatic synergy between radiotherapy (RT) and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1/2 inhibitor (PARPi), veliparib. We conducted a phase I trial of gemcitabine, radiotherapy and dose-escalated veliparib in LAPC.This was a single institution investigator-initiated open-label, single-arm phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01908478). Weekly gemcitabine with daily IMRT and veliparib dose escalated using a Bayesian adaptive design were administered in treatment na\u00efve LA or borderline resectable PC.

Secondary endpoints included efficacy, characterization of PAR levels using ELISA, DDR alterations with targeted next generation sequencing and transcriptome analysis, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status.Thirty patients were enrolled. The MTD of veliparib was 40\u202fmg BID with gemcitabine 400\u202fmg/m2 and RT (36\u202fGy/15 fractions). Sixteen DLTs were identified in 12 patients.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is one of the most aggressive cancers affecting human health. It is essential to identify candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PC. The present study aimed to investigate the diagnosis and prognosis biomarkers of PC.Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the mRNA expression profiles of GSE62452, GSE28735 and GSE16515. Functional analysis and the protein-protein interaction network analysis was performed to explore the biological function of the identified DEGs. Diagnosis markers for PC were identified using ROC curve analysis. Prognosis markers were identified via survival analysis of TCGA data. The protein expression pattern of the identified genes was verified in clinical tissue samples. A retrospective clinical study was performed to evaluate the correlation between the expression of candidate proteins and survival time of patients. Moreover, comprehensive analysis of the combination of multiple genes/proteins for the prognosis prediction of PC was performed using both TCGA data and clinical data. In vitro studies were undertaken to elaborate the potential roles of these biomarkers in clonability and invasion of PC cells.In total, 389 DEGs were identified. These genes were mainly associated with pancreatic secretion, protein digestion and absorption, cytochrome P450 drug metabolism, and energy metabolism pathway. The top 10 genes were filtered out following Fisher's exact test. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that TMPRSS4, SERPINB5, SLC6A14, SCEL, and TNS4 could be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of PC. Survival analysis of TCGA data and clinical data suggested that TMC7, TMPRSS4, SCEL, SLC2A1, CENPF, SERPINB5 and SLC6A14 can be potential biomarkers for the prognosis of PC. Comprehensive analysis show that a combination of identified genes/proteins can predict the prognosis of PC. Mechanistically, the identified genes attributes to clonability and invasiveness of PC cells.We synthesized several sets of public data and preliminarily clarified pathways and functions of PC. Candidate molecular markers were identified for diagnosis and prognosis prediction of PC including a novel gene, TMC7. Moreover, we found that the combination of TMC7, TMPRSS4, SCEL, SLC2A1, CENPF, SERPINB5 and SLC6A14 can serve as a promising indicator of the prognosis of PC patients.

Gemcitabine metabolites and response were assessed in several human and murine PDAC cell lines using crystal violet assays, Western blot, viability assays, and liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).NT5C1A was strongly expressed in tumor cells of a large subgroup of resected PDAC patients in two independent patient cohorts (44\u201356% score 2 and 8\u201326% score 3, n\u202f=\u202f414). In contrast, NT5C1A was expressed at very low levels in the tumor stroma, and neither stromal nor tumoral expression was a prognostic marker for postoperative survival. In vitro, NT5C1A overexpression increased gemcitabine resistance by reducing apoptosis levels and significantly decreased intracellular amounts of cytotoxic dFdCTP in +NT5C1A tumor cells. Co-culture experiments with conditioned media from +NT5C1A PSCs improved gemcitabine efficacy in tumor cells. In vivo, therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine was significantly decreased and serum levels of the inactive gemcitabine metabolite dFdU significantly increased in mice bearing NT5C1A overexpressing tumors.NT5C1A is robustly expressed in tumor cells of resected PDAC patients. Moreover, NT5C1A mediates gemcitabine resistance by decreasing the amount of intracellular dFdCTP, leading to reduced tumor cell apoptosis and larger pancreatic tumors in mice. Further studies should clarify the role of NT5C1A as novel predictor for gemcitabine treatment response in patients with PDAC.",

     "abstract": "Even though liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is usually described as a tumor suppressor in a wide variety of tissues, it has been shown that LKB1 aberrant expression is associated with bad prognosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).Herein we have overexpressed LKB1 in human hepatoma cells and by using histidine pull-down assay we have investigated the role of the hypoxia-related post-translational modification of Small Ubiquitin-related Modifier (SUMO)ylation in the regulation of LKB1 oncogenic role. Molecular modelling between LKB1 and its interactors, involved in regulation of LKB1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and LKB1 activity, was performed. Finally, high affinity SUMO binding entities-based technology were used to validate our findings in a pre-clinical mouse model and in clinical HCC.We found that in human hepatoma cells under hypoxic stress, LKB1 overexpression increases cell viability and aggressiveness in association with changes in LKB1 cellular localization. Moreover, by using site-directed mutagenesis, we have shown that LKB1 is SUMOylated by SUMO-2 at Lys178 hampering LKB1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and fueling hepatoma cell growth. Molecular modelling of SUMO modified LKB1 further confirmed steric impedance between SUMOylated LKB1 and the STe20-Related ADaptor cofactor (STRAD\u03b1), involved in LKB1 export from the nucleus. Finally, we provide evidence that endogenous LKB1 is modified by SUMO in pre-clinical mouse models of HCC and clinical HCC, where LKB1 SUMOylation is higher in fast growing tumors.Overall, SUMO-2 modification of LKB1 at Lys178 mediates LKB1 cellular localization and its oncogenic role in liver cancer.This work was supported by grants from NIH (US Department of Health and Human services)-R01AR001576-11A1 (J.M.M and M.L.M-C.), Gobierno Vasco-Departamento de Salud 2013111114 (to M.L.M.-C), ELKARTEK 2016, Departamento de Industria del Gobierno Vasco (to M.L.M.-C), MINECO: SAF2017\u201387301-R and SAF2014\u201352097-R integrado en el Plan Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n Cientifica y T\u00e9cnica y Innovaci\u00f3n 2013\u20132016 cofinanciado con Fondos FEDER (to M.L.M.-C and J.M.M., respectively), BFU2015\u201371017/BMC MINECO/FEDER, EU (to A.D.Q. and I.D.M.), BIOEF (Basque Foundation for Innovation and Health Research): EITB Maratoia BIO15/CA/014; Instituto de Salud Carlos III:PIE14/00031, integrado en el Plan Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n Cientifica y T\u00e9cnica y Innovacion 2013\u20132016 cofinanciado con Fondos FEDER (to M.L.M.-C and J.M.M), Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola contra el C\u00e1ncer (T.C.D, P\u00b7F-T and M.L.M-C), Daniel Alagille award from EASL (to T.C.D), Fundaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica de la Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola Contra el Cancer (AECC Scientific Foundation) Rare Tumor Calls 2017 (to M.L.M and M.A), La Caixa Foundation Program (to M.L.M), Programma di Ricerca Regione-Universit\u00e0 2007\u20132009 and 2011\u20132012, Regione Emilia-Romagna (to E.V.), Ram\u00f3n Areces Foundation and the Andalusian Government (BIO-198) (A.D.Q. and I.D.M.), ayudas para apoyar grupos de investigaci\u00f3n del sistema Universitario Vasco IT971\u201316 (P.A.), MINECO:SAF2015\u201364352-R (P.A.), Institut National du Cancer, FRANCE, INCa grant PLBIO16\u2013251 (M.S.R.), MINECO - BFU2016\u201376872-R to (E.B.).

Knockdown of circPTGR1 expression suppressed the migration and invasion of HepG2 and 97L cells induced by co-culturing with LM3 exosomes. Bioinformatics, co-expression analysis, and a luciferase assay indicated that circPTGR1 competed with MET to target miR449a.Higher metastatic HCC cells can confer this potential on those with lower or no metastatic potential via exosomes with circPTGR1, resulting in increased migratory and invasive abilities in those cells.National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81470870, 81670601, 81570593), Guangdong Natural Science Foundation (No. 2015A030312013, 2015A030313038), Sci-tech Research Development Program of Guangdong Province (2014B020228003), Sci-tech Research Development Program of Guangzhou City (No. 201508020262, 201400000001-3, 201604020001, 201607010024), Innovative Funds for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises of Guangdong Province (2016A010119103), Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou (201710010178), and National 13th Five-Year Science and Technology Plan Major Projects of China (No. 2017ZX10203205-006-001).",

     "abstract": "The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. The current study aimed to clarify the mechanistic effects of targeting TNF-\u03b1 to overcome sorafenib resistance in HCC.A correlation of TNF-\u03b1 expression with the prognosis was analyzed in 62 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection and subsequent received adjuvant sorafenib treatment. The relation of TNF-\u03b1 expression and sorafenib sensitivity was determined in different HCC cell lines. The combined therapeutic effects of sorafenib and ulinastatin, which could inhibit TNF-\u03b1 expression, on HCC were examined in vitro and in vivo.High TNF-\u03b1 expression was correlated with poor outcomes in HCC patients who received adjuvant sorafenib after surgery. In vitro experiments showed that TNF-\u03b1 promotes HCC cell resistant to sorafenib through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, the current study revealed that sorafenib has no significant influence on the expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1, and sorafenib had limited effectiveness on reversing EMT in HCC cells with high TNF-\u03b1 expression. Inhibiting the expression of TNF-\u03b1 with ulinastatin significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib on HCC cells with high expression of TNF-\u03b1 in vitro and in vivo.Interpretation: Our findings indicate that TNF-\u03b1 may serve as a novel predictor of sorafenib sensitivity in HCC patients.

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease with various etiological factors, and ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide due to multi-focal recurrence. We herein identified three major subtypes of HCC by performing integrative analysis of two omics data sets, and clarified that this classification was closely correlated with clinicopathological factors, immune profiles and recurrence patterns.In the test study, 183 tumor specimens surgically resected from HCC patients were collected for unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression signatures and comparative analysis of gene mutations. These results were validated by using genome, methylome and transcriptome data of 373 HCC patients provided from the Cancer Genome Atlas Network. In addition, omics data were obtained from pairs of primary and recurrent HCC.Comprehensive molecular evaluation of HCC by multi-platform analysis defined three major subtypes: (1) mitogenic and stem cell-like tumors with chromosomal instability; (2) CTNNB1-mutated tumors displaying immune suppression; and (3) metabolic disease-associated tumors, which included an immunogenic subgroup characterized by macrophage infiltration and favorable prognosis. Although genomic and epigenomic analysis explicitly distinguished between HCC with intrahepatic metastasis (IM) and multi-centric HCC (MC), the phenotypic similarity between the primary and recurrent tumors was not correlated to the IM/MC origin, but to the classification. Interpretation: Identification of these HCC subtypes provides further insights into patient stratification as well as presents opportunities for therapeutic development.Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (16H02670 and 18K19575), Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (JP15cm0106064, JP17cm0106518, JP18cm0106540 and JP18fk0210040).",

     "abstract": "Redox metabolism is often considered a potential target for cancer treatment, but a systematic examination of redox responses in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is missing.Here, we employed systems biology and biological network analyses to reveal key roles of genes associated with redox metabolism in HCC by integrating multi-omics data.We found that several redox genes, including 25 novel potential prognostic genes, are significantly co-expressed with liver-specific genes and genes associated with immunity and inflammation. Based on an integrative analysis, we found that HCC tumors display antagonistic behaviors in redox responses. The two HCC groups are associated with altered fatty acid, amino acid, drug and hormone metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, and NADPH-independent vs -dependent antioxidant defenses. Redox behavior varies with known tumor subtypes and progression, affecting patient survival. These antagonistic responses are also displayed at the protein and metabolite level and were validated in several independent cohorts. We finally showed the differential redox behavior using mice transcriptomics in HCC and noncancerous tissues and associated with hypoxic features of the two redox gene groups.Our integrative approaches highlighted mechanistic differences among tumors and allowed the identification of a survival signature and several potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC.",

     "abstract": "The injured liver loses normal function, with concomitant decrease of key identity genes. Super-enhancers contribute to mammalian cell identity. Here, we identified core transcription factors (TFs) that are active in hepatocytes, using genome-wide analysis and hierarchical ordering of super-enhancer distribution.Expression of core TFs was assessed in a cohort of patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis and animal models. Quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and hydrodynamic gene delivery methods were used to assess gene regulation and hepatocyte viability. RNA-sequencing data were generated to investigate the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte protection from injury.Network analysis of super-enhancer-associated gene interactions and expression arrays for cohorts of patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis enabled us to identify a super-enhancer-associated network, and LRH1, HNF4\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1, and RXR\u03b1 as core TFs. In mouse models, expression of core TFs was robustly inhibited by single and multiple challenge(s) with liver toxicant. RNA-seq analysis revealed changes in expression in the super-enhancer-associated genes sensitively biased toward repression by intoxication. LRH1 gene delivery prevented the loss of hepatic super-enhancer-associated signaling circuitry in toxicant-challenged mice, and protected the liver from injury, indicating the role of LRH1 in hepatocyte identity and viability. In hepatocytes, overexpression of each core TF promoted induction of other TFs.Overall, this study identified LRH1-driven pathway as a circuitry responsible for hepatocyte identity by using cistromic analysis, improving our understanding of liver pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

     "abstract": "While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and radiotherapy (RT) are currently used together to treat locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa), RT might have the adverse effect of increasing the PCa androgen receptor (AR) protein expression, which might then increase the resistance to continued RT.We used multiple assays for RT sensitivity, protein and RNA expression of AR and related DDR genes, ROS level, DNA damage/repair level, cell cycle and apoptosis. All statistical comparisons were analyzed with t-test or one-way ANOVA.We demonstrated that RT induced AR expression in C4-2 and CWR22Rv-1 cells. We found that combining RT and ASC-J9\u00ae, but not the antiandrogen, Enzalutamide, could increase radiosensitivity via inducing DNA damage, altering the AR mediated and DNA repair pathways, and activating apoptosis. ASC-J9\u00ae had little effects on normal bladder cells.Targeting ionizing radiation (IR)-increased AR with the AR degradation enhancer, ASC-J9\u00ae, could increase the radiosensitivity while sparing adjacent normal tissue. Mechanism dissection revealed that ASC-J9\u00ae, but not Enzalutamide, treatment could increase radiosensitivity via inducing DNA damage, altering DNA repair pathways, as well as activating the IR-induced apoptosis via suppressing the pATR-CHK1 signals. Importantly, results from preclinical studies using an in vivo mouse model also demonstrated that combining RT with ASC-J9\u00ae to target AR led to better therapeutic efficacy to suppress PCa progression.",

In contrast, plasma cells and switched memory B cells remained stable throughout the study. The observed immunological changes correlated with early, but not late, clinical improvements. Moreover, high baseline B cell counts were predictive of failure to attain low disease activity. In summary, our data unveiled both rapid and gradual later therapy-associated alterations of both known and unforeseen B cell phenotypes.Our results suggest that evaluation of B cell counts might prove useful prior to initiation of belimumab treatment and that early treatment evaluation and discontinuation might underestimate delayed clinical improvements resultant of late B cell changes.",

Protein kinase B (PKB)/AKT regulates diverse cellular responses, but the significance in neutrophilic inflammation and ALI remains unknown.Human neutrophils and neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 (dHL-60) cells were used to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of 5,7-dimethoxy-1,4-phenanthrenequinone (CLLV-1). The therapeutic potential of CLLV-1 was determined in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.CLLV-1 inhibited respiratory burst, degranulation, adhesion, and chemotaxis in human neutrophils and dHL-60 cells. CLLV-1 inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT (Thr308 and Ser473), but not of ERK, JNK, or p38. Furthermore, CLLV-1 blocked AKT activity and covalently reacted with AKT Cys310 in vitro. The AKT309\u2013313 peptide-CLLV-1 adducts were determined by NMR or mass spectrometry assay. The alkylation agent-conjugated AKT (reduced form) level was also inhibited by CLLV-1. Significantly, CLLV-1 ameliorated LPS-induced ALI, neutrophil infiltration, and AKT activation in mice.Our results identify CLLV-1 as a covalent allosteric AKT inhibitor by targeting AKT Cys310. CLLV-1 shows potent anti-inflammatory activity in human neutrophils and LPS-induced mouse ALI. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework for redox modification of AKT that may serve as a novel pharmacological target to alleviate neutrophilic inflammation.",

The primary endpoints were retention rates and completion rates for planned clinical assessments. Secondary endpoints were safety and change in functional and reported health measures. Associations with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) were explored.Fourteen patients with stable IPF were recruited. The retention rate was 100% with no DQ discontinuation; planned clinical assessments were complete in 13/14 participants. One serious adverse event was reported.

As exosomal miRNAs emerged as promising biomarkers, we investigated the potential of using exosomal miRNAs and EHRs in TB diagnosis.A total of 370 individuals, including pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), tuberculous meningitis (TBM), non-TB disease controls and healthy state controls, were enrolled. Exosomal miRNAs were profiled in the exploratory cohort using microarray and miRNA candidates were selected in the selection cohort using qRT-PCR. EHRs and follow-up information of the patients were collected accordingly. miRNAs and EHRs were used to develop diagnostic models for PTB and TBM in the selection cohort with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. These models were further evaluated in an independent testing cohort.Six exosomal miRNAs (miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-26a, miR-106a, miR-191, miR-486) were differentially expressed in the TB patients. Three SVM models, \"EHR+miRNA\", \"miRNA only\" and \"EHR only\" were compared, and \"EHR\u202f+\u202fmiRNA\" model achieved the highest diagnostic efficacy, with an AUC up to 0.97 (95% CI 0.80\u20130.99) in TBM and 0.97 (0.87\u20130.99) in PTB, respectively. However, \"EHR only\" model only showed an AUC of 0.67 (0.46\u20130.83) in TBM.

Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy was prohibited. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were evaluated up to 100\u202fdays post-infusion. Influenza symptoms were assessed daily for 10\u202fdays using the FLU-PRO tool. Nasopharyngeal virus shedding was assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture through Day 7.Of the 150 patients randomized, 148 received study drug, and 138 were confirmed influenza A positive. Median age was 42\u202fyears; median time from symptom onset to treatment was 42\u202fh; 93% had influenza A subtype H3N2.TEAEs, most commonly diarrhea of mild severity, were dose-related, occurring in 55%, 35%, and 24% of the 4000\u202fmg, 2000\u202fmg, and placebo patients, respectively. Two serious adverse events occurred, both in placebo patients.Baseline FLU-PRO symptom scores were balanced among groups. Mean scores were lower by Days 3 and 4 in the pooled VIS410 treatment group versus placebo (p\u202f<\u202f0.023), with a tendency toward faster resolution by Kaplan-Meier analysis.VIS410 was associated with reduced median nasopharyngeal viral load TCID50 AUCDay7 (days\u202f\u00d7\u202flog10 TCID50/mL) (3.66 pooled VIS410 vs 4.78 placebo, p\u202f=\u202f0.08) and in the subset of patients with baseline hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer \u226440 (overall, 74% of patients) was significantly reduced vs placebo (4.218 pooled VIS410 vs 6.152 placebo, p\u202f=\u202f0.009). Kaplan-Meier estimated time to resolution of viral shedding was reduced (1.9 vs 3.6\u202fdays, p\u202f=\u202f0.03) in VIS410 treated patients. There was a trend toward greater proportion of culture-negative patients by Day 3 (66.7% vs 51.1%, p\u202f=\u202f0.11); when this analysis was limited to the subset of patients with positive baseline cultures, this difference became more pronounced (63.2% vs 42.5%, p\u202f=\u202f0.053).

Natural killer (NK) cells control viral infections in part through the interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their ligands. LASV infection is associated with defective immune responses, including inhibition of NK cell activity in the presence of MHC-class 1+-infected target cells.We compared individual KIR and HLA-class 1 genotypes of 68 healthy volunteers to 51 patients infected with LASV in Sierra Leone, including 37 survivors and 14 fatalities. Next, potential HLA-C1, HLA-C2, and HLA-Bw4 binding epitopes were in silico screened among LASV nucleoprotein (NP) and envelope glycoprotein (GP). Selected 10-mer peptides were then tested in peptide-HLA stabilization, KIR binding and polyfunction assays.LASV-infected patients were similar to healthy controls, except for the inhibitory KIR2DL2 gene. We found a specific increase in the HLA-C1:KIR2DL2 interaction in fatalities (10/11) as compared to survivors (12/19) and controls (19/29). We also identified that strong of NP and GP viral epitopes was only observed with HLA-C molecules, and associated with strong inhibition of degranulation in the presence of KIR2DL+ NK cells. This inhibitory effect significantly increased in the presence of the vGP420 variant, detected in 28.1% of LASV sequences.Our finding suggests that presentation of specific LASV epitopes by HLA-C alleles to the inhibitory KIR2DL2 receptor on NK cells could potentially prevent the killing of infected cells and provides insights into the mechanisms by which LASV can escape NK-cell-mediated immune pressure.",

ARG1, BPI, CD163, IFI27, HP and TNFAIP6 transcript levels correlated positively with lactatemia, and negatively with hemoglobin concentrations.Differences in gene expression profile reflect distinct immunopathological mechanisms of P. falciparum infection. They emerge as potential prognostic markers for early therapeutic measures and need to be validated further.This work was supported by a grant of the NGFN (Nationales Genomforschungsnetz 01GS0114) and by a CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico, Brazil) PhD scholarship for A.

     "abstract": "Astrocytes regulate neuronal function, synaptic formation and maintenance partly through secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs). In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) astrocytes display a toxic phenotype that contributes to motor neuron (MN) degeneration.We used human induced astrocytes (iAstrocytes) from 3 ALS patients carrying C9orf72 mutations and 3 non-affected donors to investigate the role of astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) in ALS astrocyte toxicity. ADEVs were isolated from iAstrocyte conditioned medium via ultracentrifugation and resuspended in fresh astrocyte medium before testing ADEV impact on HB9-GFP+ mouse motor neurons (Hb9-GFP+ MN). We used post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissue from 3 sporadic ALS and 3 non-ALS cases for PCR analysis.We report that EV formation and miRNA cargo are dysregulated in C9ORF72-ALS iAstrocytes and this affects neurite network maintenance and MN survival in vitro. In particular, we have identified downregulation of miR-494-3p, a negative regulator of semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) and other targets involved in axonal maintenance. We show here that by restoring miR-494-3p levels through expression of an engineered miRNA mimic we can downregulate Sema3A levels in MNs and increases MN survival in vitro. Consistently, we also report lower levels of mir-494-3p in cortico-spinal tract tissue isolated from sporadic ALS donors, thus supporting the pathological importance of this pathway in MNs and its therapeutic potential.ALS ADEVs and their miRNA cargo are involved in MN death in ALS and we have identified miR-494-3p as a potential therapeutic target.Funding: Thierry Latran Fondation and Academy of Medical Sciences.",

     "abstract": "Recently, innovative attempts have been made to identify moyamoya disease (MMD) by focusing on the morphological differences in the head of MMD patients. Following the recent revolution in the development of deep learning (DL) algorithms, we designed this study to determine whether DL can distinguish MMD in plain skull radiograph images.Three hundred forty-five skull images were collected as an MMD-labeled dataset from patients aged 18 to 50\u202fyears with definite MMD. As a control-labeled data set, 408 skull images of trauma patients were selected by age and sex matching. Skull images were partitioned into training and test datasets at a 7:3 ratio using permutation. A total of six convolution layers were designed and trained. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were evaluated as classifier performance. To identify areas of attention, gradient-weighted class activation mapping was applied. External validation was performed with a new dataset from another hospital.For the institutional test set, the classifier predicted the true label with 84\u00b71% accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity were both 0\u00b784. AUROC was 0\u00b791. MMD was predicted by attention to the lower face in most cases. Overall accuracy for external validation data set was 75\u00b79%.DL can distinguish MMD cases within specific ages from controls in plain skull radiograph images with considerable accuracy and AUROC. The viscerocranium may play a role in MMD-related skull features.This work was supported by grant no. 18-2018-029 from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Research Fund.",

     "abstract": "Genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of heme oxygenase (HO) are identified as potential therapeutic target for spinal cord injury (SCI); however, the role of carbon monoxide (CO), which is a major product of haem degenerated by HO, in SCI remains unknown. Applying hemin or chemicals which may regulate HO expression or activity to increase CO production are inadequate to elaborate the direct role of CO. Here, we assessed the effect of CO releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3), the classical donor of CO, in SCI and explained its possible protective mechanism.Rat SCI model was performed with a vascular clip (30\u202fg) compressing at T9 vertebral level for 1\u202fmin and CO was delivered immediately after SCI by CORM-3. The neurological deficits and neuron survival were assessed. Inflammasome and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway were measured by western blot and immunofluorescence. For in vitro study, oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) simulated the SCI-inflammasome change in cultured the primary neurons.CORM-3 suppressed inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis occurrence, which consequently alleviated neuron death and improved motor functional recovery following SCI. As a pivotal sensor involving in endoplasmic reticulum stress-medicated inflammasome signaling, IRE1 and its downstream X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were activated in SCI tissues as well as in OGD neurons; while inhibition of IRE1 by STF-083010 in SCI rats or by si-RNA in OGD neurons suppressed inflammasome signaling and pyroptosis. Interestingly, the SCI/OGD-stimulated IRE1 activation was attenuated by CORM-3 treatment.CO may alleviate neuron death and improve motor functional recovery in SCI through IRE1 regulation, and administration of CO could be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI.",

Patients with PKD are generally advised to restrict their dietary sodium intake. This study was aimed at testing the outcomes of dietary salt manipulation in ARPKD.PCK/CrljCrlPkhd1pck/CRL (PCK) rats, a model of ARPKD, were fed a normal (0.4% NaCl; NS), high salt (4% NaCl; HS), and sodium-deficient (0.01% NaCl; SD) diets for 8\u202fweeks. Immunohistochemistry, GFR measurements, balance studies, and molecular biology approaches were applied to evaluate the outcomes of the protocol. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) levels were assessed using LC-MS/MS, and renal miRNA profiles were studied.Both HS and SD diets resulted in an increase in cystogenesis. However, SD diet caused extensive growth of cysts in the renal cortical area, and hypertrophy of the tissue; RAAS components were enhanced in the SD group. We observed a reduction in epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression in the SD group, accompanied with mRNA level increase. miRNA assay revealed that renal miR-9a-5p level was augmented in the SD group; we showed that this miRNA decreases ENaC channel number in CD cells.Our data demonstrate a mechanism of ARPKD progression during salt restriction that involves activity of ENaC. We further show that miR-9a-5p potentially implicated in this mechanism and that miR-9a-5p downregulates ENaC in cultured CD cells. Our findings open new therapeutic possibilities and highlight the importance of understanding salt reabsorption in ARPKD.",

Certain microRNAs regulate EC dysfunction in response to hyperlipidemia and may be suitable therapeutic targets to combat atherosclerosis.miRNA expression in human ECs was analyzed under various conditions to identify key microRNAs. High-cholesterol diet (HCD)-fed Mir652\u2212/\u2212Apoe\u2212/\u2212 (Mir652\u2212/\u2212) mice and matching Mir652+/+Apoe\u2212/\u2212 (Mir652+/+) mice were subjected to carotid injury to analyze the effects of miR-652 knockdown on endothelial repair. In silico analysis followed by in vitro and in vivo experiments were applied to identify miR-652's target gene Ccnd2 and investigate the pair's effects on ECs. miR-652-5p and miR-652-3p antagomir therapies were tested in Mir652+/+ mice under normal and HCD diet to assess their effect on endothelial repair.miR-652-3p, which is upregulated in human and murine atherosclerotic plaques, suppresses expression of the endothelial repair gene Ccnd2, thereby enhancing atherosclerotic lesion formation. Post-denudation recovery of ECs was promoted in Mir652\u2212/\u2212 mice due to enhanced EC proliferation attributable to de-repression of miR-652-3p's (but not miR-652-5p's) regulation of Ccnd2 expression. Under hyperlipidemic conditions at non-predilection sites, miR-652-3p produces anti-proliferative effects in ECs, such that Mir652\u2212/\u2212 mice display reduced atherosclerotic progression. In contrast, neither miR-652-3p nor Ccnd2 displayed significant effects on the endothelium at predilection sites or under disturbed flow conditions.

The therapeutic effect of NVP-BGJ398, an FGFR inhibitor, was tested with both explant cultures and timed pregnant females.Two lethal forms of human SLC26A2-related chondrodysplasias, achondrogenesis type IB (ACG1B) and atelosteogenesis type II (AO2), are phenocopied by slc26a2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Unexpectedly, slc26a2\u2212/\u2212 chondrocytes are defective for collagen secretion, exhibiting intracellular retention and compromised extracellular deposition of ColII and ColIX. As a consequence, the ATF6 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is preferentially triggered to overactivate FGFR3 signaling by inducing excessive FGFR3 in slc26a2\u2212/\u2212 chondrocytes. Consistently, suppressing FGFR3 signaling by blocking either FGFR3 or phosphorylation of the downstream effector favors the recovery of slc26a2\u2212/\u2212 cartilage cultures from impaired growth and unbalanced cell proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, administration of an FGFR inhibitor to pregnant females shows therapeutic effects on pathological features in slc26a2\u2212/\u2212 newborns.

The cross-time phenotypic correlations, 0\u00b752 for the Horvath clock and 0\u00b736 for the Levine clock, were mediated primarily by genetic factors, whereas the person-specific environmental factors were completely different at the two measurement occasions.For both clocks, new sources of person-specific environmental influences emerge with age.

However, our recent studies on the skeletal muscle response upon long-term denervation highlighted the importance of HDAC4 in maintaining muscle integrity.To fully identify the yet uncharacterized HDAC4 functions in ALS, we genetically deleted HDAC4 in skeletal muscles of a mouse model of ALS. Body weight, skeletal muscle, innervation and spinal cord were analyzed over time by morphological and molecular analyses. Transcriptome analysis was also performed to delineate the signaling modulated by HDAC4 in skeletal muscle of a mouse model of ALS.HDAC4 deletion in skeletal muscle caused earlier ALS onset, characterized by body weight loss, muscle denervation and atrophy, and compromised muscle performance, although the main catabolic pathways were not activated. Transcriptome analysis identified the gene networks modulated by HDAC4 in ALS, revealing UCP1 as a top regulator that may be implicated in worsening ALS features.HDAC4 plays an important role in preserving innervations and skeletal muscle in ALS, likely by modulating the UCP1 gene network.

KLF4 is renoprotective in the setting of AKI and is a critical regulator of proteinuria in mice and humans. KLF6 expression in podocytes preserves mitochondrial function and prevents podocyte apoptosis, while KLF5 expression prevents podocyte apoptosis by blockade of ERK/p38 MAPK pathways. KLF15 is a critical regulator of podocyte differentiation and is protective against podocyte injury.

However, the role and underlying mechanisms of HO-1 in cellular senescence in heart are largely unknown.Echocardiography was employed to detect the effect of HO-1 on heart function in adult mice with myocardial infarction (MI) and aged mice. The senescence markers, p53, p16 and LaminB, were analyzed by western blot. The immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were applied to analyze the expression level of p16. SA-\u03b2-Gal staining showed the level of cardiomyocyte senescence.We found that hemin significantly induced the expression of HO-1, which notably suppressed cardiomyocyte senescence containing the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Further studies showed that systemic HO-1 transgenic overexpression improved heart function by inhibiting aging-induced extracellular matrix deposition and fibrogenesis. More importantly, treatment of hemin improved heart function in MI mice. Furthermore, forced expression of HO-1 blunted cardiomyocyte senescence in natural aged mice and in primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes.Our study revealed that HO-1 improved heart function and attenuated cardiomyocyte senescence triggered by ischemic injury and aging. In addition, HO-1 induction alleviated H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte senescence.

However, whether inhibition of AZIN2-sv can simultaneously induce angiogenesis and thus improve prognosis after MI is unclear.We used in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR to determine AZIN2-sv expression in endothelial cells. Knockdown and overexpression were performed to detect the role of AZIN2-sv in endothelial cell function, angiogenesis and prognosis after MI. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were used to determine the interaction with talin1 (Tln1) protein and miRNA-214 (miR-214). DNA pulldown and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to study AZIN2-sv binding to upstream transcription factors.AZIN2-sv was enriched in cardiac endothelial cells. The loss of AZIN2-sv reduced endothelial cell apoptosis and promoted endothelial sprouting and capillary network formation in vitro. Moreover, in vivo, the loss of AZIN2-sv induced angiogenesis and improved cardiac function after MI. Mechanistically, AZIN2-sv reduced Tln1 and integrin \u03b21 (ITGB1) protein levels to inhibit neovascularization. AZIN2-sv activated the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of Tln1 mediated by proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 5 (PSMC5). In addition, AZIN2-sv could bind to miR-214 and suppress the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)/Akt pathway to inhibit angiogenesis. With regard to the upstream mechanism, Bach1, a negative regulator of angiogenesis, bound to the promoter of AZIN2-sv and increased its expression.Bach1-activated AZIN2-sv could participate in angiogenesis by promoting the PSMC5-mediated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of Tln1 and blocking the miR-214/PTEN/Akt pathway.

Here, we aim to determine whether Valproic acid (VPA), a FDA approved inhibitor of histone deacetylation for bipolar disease, could protect heart against myocardial infarction (MI) injury and elucidate key molecular pathways.VPA was administrated to MI rats at different time points, onset and after MI injury. Echocardiography, histology, serum biology assays, and gene expression, inhibition, and over-expression were performed to characterize the systolic function, infarct size, gene and signaling pathways.VPA treatment reduced the infarct size by ~50% and preserved the systolic function of heart after acute MI in rats. Even 60\u202fmin after infarction, VPA treatment significantly decreased infarct size. Furthermore, long-term treatment of VPA markedly improved myocardial performance. VPA regulated gene expression essential for cell survival and anti-inflammatory response. Consequently, oxidative stress and cell death were notably reduced after VPA treatment. Moreover, Foxm1 was identified as a potential key target of VPA. Overexpression of Foxm1 provided similar heart protective effect to VPA treatment. Particularly, both VPA treatment and Foxm1 over-expression repressed inflammatory response after MI for heart protection. In contrast, inhibition of Foxm1 activity abolished the cardiac protective effect of VPA. VPA mediated CM protection through Foxm1 upregulation was also identified in a human ESC derived CM hypoxia/reperfusion system.VPA treatments significantly reduce cardiac damage after MI and the cardioprotective effect of VPA is likely mediated via Foxm1 pathway.This work was mainly supported by 1R01HL109054.",

Phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a differentiated/contractile to a dedifferentiated/synthetic phenotype, accompanied by migration and proliferation of VSMCs play an important role in neointimal hyperplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotype switching of VSMCs have yet to be fully understood.The mouse carotid artery ligation model was established to evaluate Sema3A expression and its role during neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and promoter-luciferase reporter assays were used to examine regulatory mechanism of Sema3A expression. SiRNA transfection and lentivirus infection were performed to regulate Sema3A expression. EdU assays, Wound-healing scratch experiments and Transwell migration assays were used to assess VSMC proliferation and migration.In this study, we found that semaphorin-3A (Sema3A) was significantly downregulated in VSMCs during neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury in mice and in human atherosclerotic plaques. Meanwhile, Sema3A was transcriptionally downregulated by PDGF-BB via p53 in VSMCs. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of Sema3A inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, as well as increasing differentiated gene expression. Mechanistically, Sema3A increased the NRP1-plexin-A1 complex and decreased the NRP1-PDGFR\u03b2 complex, thus inhibiting phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b2. Moreover, we found that overexpression of Sema3A suppressed neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury in vivo.These results suggest that local delivery of Sema3A may act as a novel therapeutic option to prevent in-stent restenosis.",

Plasma levels of 358 proteins were used to generate machine learning models for the presence of CCTA-defined high-risk plaques or complete absence of coronary atherosclerosis. Performance was tested against a clinical model containing generally available clinical characteristics and conventional biomarkers.A total of 196 patients with analyzable protein levels (n\u202f=\u202f332) was included for analysis. A subset of 35 proteins was identified predicting the presence of high-risk plaques.

Considering the high efficacy of EAAT2 for glutamate uptake, we hypothesized that the expression of this transporter in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for systemic administration could yield a cell-based glutamate-grabbing therapy, combining the intrinsic properties of these cells with excitotoxic protection.To address this hypothesis, EAAT2-encoding cDNA was introduced into MSCs and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK cells) as the control cell line. EAAT2 expression and functionality were evaluated by in vitro assays. Blood glutamate-grabbing activity was tested in healthy and ischemic rat models treated with 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 and 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 cells/animal.The expression of EAAT2 in both cell types conferred the expected glutamate-grabbing activity in in vitro and in vivo studies. The functional improvement observed in ischemic rats treated with EAAT2\u2013HEK at low dose, confirmed that this effect was indeed mediated by the glutamate-grabbing activity associated with EAAT2 functionality. Unexpectedly, both cell doses of non-transfected MSCs induced higher protection than transfected EAAT2\u2013MSCs by another mechanism independent of the glutamate-grabbing capacity.Although the transfection procedure most likely interferes with some of the intrinsic protective mechanisms of mesenchymal cells, the results show that the induced expression of EAAT2 in cells represents a novel alternative to mitigate the excitotoxic effects of glutamate and paves the way to combine this strategy with current cell therapies for cerebral ischemia.",

How IFN affects tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) compartment to impact the therapeutic outcomes are not well understood.The effect of an IFN-inducer poly(I:C) on tumor-infiltrating monocytes and TAMs were analyzed using a transplantable mouse tumor model (LLC). In vitro culture systems were utilized to study the direct actions by poly(I:C)-IFN on differentiating monocytes.We found that poly(I:C)-induced IFN targets Ly6C+ monocytes and impedes their transition into TAMs. Such an effect involves miR-155-mediated suppression of M-CSF receptor expression, contributing to restricting tumor growth. Remarkably, further analyses of gene expression profile of IFN-treated differentiating monocytes reveal a strong induction of Arg1 (encoding arginase-1) in addition to other classical IFN targets. Mechanistically, the unexpected Arg1 arm of IFN action is mediated by a prolonged STAT3 signaling in monocytes, in conjunction with elevated macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) signaling. Functionally, induction of ARG1 limited the therapeutic effect of IFN, as inhibition of arginase activity could strongly synergize with poly(I:C) to enhance CD8+ T cell responses to thwart tumor growth in mice.Taken together, we have uncovered two functionally opposing actions by IFN on the TAM compartment.

The lack of a suitable in vivo model also hinders the development of new CAR T cell therapies.We established a humanized mouse (hu-mouse) model with a functional human immune system and genetically-matched (autologous) primary acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that permits modeling of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy in immunocompetent hosts without allogeneic or xenogeneic immune responses.Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were detected in blood of leukemic hu-mice with kinetics and levels similar to those seen in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy. The levels of CAR T cells were correlated inversely with the burden of leukemia cells and positively with the survival times in anti-CD19 CAR T cell-treated leukemic hu-mice.

Patients with high SHP2 expression had an almost 13-month shorter progression-free survival (P\u202f=\u202f.0094) and an 18-month shorter overall survival (P\u202f=\u202f.0182) in comparison to those with low SHP2 mRNA expression.The levels of ILK and SHP2 could be predictive for upfront combinatory therapy of EGFR TKIs plus SHP2 or ILK inhibitors.A grant from La Caixa Foundation, an Instituto de Salud Carlos III grant (RESPONSE, PIE16/00011), an Instituto de Salud Carlos III grant (PI14/01678), a Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks European Grant (ELBA No 765492) and a Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC) grant (PROYE18012ROSE).",

     "abstract": "Therapeutic options for diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) are limited to surgery and locoregional chemotherapy. Despite improvements in survival rates, patients eventually succumb to disease progression. We investigated splicing deregulation both as molecular prognostic factor and potential novel target in DMPM, while we tested modulators of SF3b complex for antitumor activity.Tissue-microarrays of 64 DMPM specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical assessment of SF3B1 expression and correlation to clinical outcome. Two primary cell cultures were used for gene expression profiling and in vitro screening of SF3b modulators. Drug-induced splicing alterations affecting downstream cellular pathways were detected through RNA sequencing. Ultimately, we established bioluminescent orthotopic mouse models to test the efficacy of splicing modulation in vivo.Spliceosomal genes are differentially upregulated in DMPM cells compared to normal tissues and high expression of SF3B1 correlated with poor clinical outcome in univariate and multivariate analysis. SF3b modulators (Pladienolide-B, E7107, Meayamycin-B) showed potent cytotoxic activity in vitro with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Differential splicing analysis of Pladienolide-B-treated cells revealed abundant alterations of transcripts involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and other oncogenic pathways. This was validated by RT-PCR and functional assays. E7107 demonstrated remarkable in vivo antitumor efficacy, with significant improvement of survival rates compared to vehicle-treated controls.SF3B1 emerged as a novel potential prognostic factor in DMPM. Splicing modulators markedly impair cancer cell viability, resulting also in potent antitumor activity in vivo. Our data designate splicing as a promising therapeutic target in DMPM.",

This study investigated FOXP1-mediated regulation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in untreated primary breast cancer (BC).FOXP1 expression was analyzed in tissues from primary untreated breast tumors, BC cell lines and the METABRIC gene expression BC dataset. Cytokine and chemokine expression and lymphocyte migration in response to primary tumor supernatants (SN) was compared between FOXP1hi and FOXP1lo primary BC.FOXP1 expression was higher in estrogen receptor positive compared to negative BC. FOXP1hi tumors were significantly associated with lower TIL and fewer tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) compared to FOXP1lo BC. Silencing FOXP1 in BC cell lines positively impacted cytokine and chemokine expression with the inverse effect associated with overexpression. CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL13, CX3CL, CCL20, IL2, IL21, GZMB and IFNG expression decreased while IL10 and TGF\u03b2 increased in FOXP1hi compared to FOXP1lo primary BC. Lymphocyte migration using primary BC supernatants detected decreased mobility toward FOXP1hi supernatants. FOXP1lo BC expresses higher levels of chemokines driving TIL migration.

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis. Recent advances suggest the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within liver cancer, which are considered to be responsible for tumor relapse, metastasis, and chemoresistance. However, novel therapeutic approaches for eradicating CSCs are yet to be established. Here, we aimed to identify the role of glutaminase 1 (GLS1) in stemness, and the feasibility that GLS1 serves as a therapeutic target for elimination CSCs as well as the possible mechanism.Publicly-available data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was mined to unearth the association between GLS1 and stemness phenotype. Using big data, human tissues and multiple cell lines, we gained a general picture of GLS1 expression in HCC progression. We generated stable cell lines by lentiviral-mediated overexpression or CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout. Sphere formation assays and colony formation assays were employed to analyze the relationship between GLS1 and stemness. A series of bioinformatics analyses and molecular experiments including qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were employed to investigate the role of GLS1 in regulating stemness in vitro and in vivo.We observed GLS1 (both KGA and GAC isoform) is highly expressed in HCC, and that high expression of GAC predicts a poor prognosis. GLS1 is exclusively expressed in the mitochondrial matrix. Upregulation of GLS1 is positively associated with advanced clinicopathological features and stemness phenotype. Targeting GLS1 reduced the expression of stemness-related genes and suppressed CSC properties in vitro. We further found GLS1 regulates stemness properties via ROS/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and that GLS1 knockout inhibits tumorigenicity in vivo.Targeting GLS1 attenuates stemness properties in HCC by increasing ROS accumulation and suppressing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which implied that GLS1 could serve as a therapeutic target for elimination of CSCs.",

In this study, we assessed the expression and prognostic value of gankyrin in RCC patients.The expression of gankyrin was examined in public databases and validated in specimens from two independent centers. The clinical practice and disease correlation of gankyrin in RCC were evaluated in RCC patients, various cell lines and an orthotopic RCC model.Upregulation of gankyrin expression in RCC was corroborated in two independent cohorts. High gankyrin expression positively associated with disease progression and metastasis of RCC patients. A positive correlation between gankyrin and sunitinib-resistance was also observed in RCC cell lines and in an orthotopic RCC model. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with higher gankyrin expression presented worse prognosis of RCC patients in the two cohorts. Gankyrin served as an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients even after multivariable adjustment by clinical variables. Time-dependent AUC and Harrell's c-index analysis presented that the incorporation of the gankyrin classifier into the current clinical prognostic parameters such as TNM stage, Fuhrman nuclear grade or SSIGN score achieved a greater accuracy than without it in predicting prognosis of RCC patients. All results were confirmed in randomized training and validation sets from the two patient cohorts.Gankyrin can serve as a reliable biomarker for disease progression and for prognosis of RCC patients.

The Enhanced Neoplasia Detection and Cancer Prevention in Chronic Colitis (ENDCaP-C) trial is an observational multi-centre test accuracy study to ascertain the role of molecular markers in improving the detection of dysplasia. We aimed to validate previously identified biomarkers of neoplasia in a retrospective cohort and create predictive models for later validation in a prospective cohort.A retrospective analysis using bisulphite pyrosequencing of an 11 marker panel (SFRP1, SFRP2, SRP4, SRP5, WIF1, TUBB6, SOX7, APC1A, APC2, MINT1, RUNX3) in samples from 35 patients with cancer, 78 with dysplasia and 343 without neoplasia undergoing surveillance for UC associated neoplasia across 6 medical centres. Predictive models for UC associated cancer/dysplasia were created in the setting of neoplastic and non-neoplastic mucosa.For neoplastic mucosa a five marker panel (SFRP2, SFRP4, WIF1, APC1A, APC2) was accurate in detecting pre-cancerous and invasive neoplasia (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.83; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.88), and dysplasia (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.88; (0.84, 0.91).

Independent clinicopathologic factors were integrated with the ResNet model to construct the individualized nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated in regard to discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.The ResNet model was significantly associated with RFS. Integrable predictors in the individualized ResNet nomogram included the tumor site, size, and mitotic count.

Some adenomas from carriers of inherited MMR gene mutations have intact MMR protein expression implying other mechanisms accelerating tumorigenesis. We determined roles of DNA methylation changes and somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes as tumorigenic events in LS-associated colorectal adenomas with intact MMR.We investigated 122 archival colorectal specimens of normal mucosae, adenomas and carcinomas from 57 LS patients. MMR-deficient (MMR-D, n\u202f=\u202f49) and MMR-proficient (MMR-P, n\u202f=\u202f18) adenomas were of particular interest and were interrogated by methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and Ion Torrent sequencing.Promoter methylation of CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-associated marker genes and selected colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) increased and LINE-1 methylation decreased from normal mucosa to MMR-P adenomas to MMR-D adenomas. Methylation differences were statistically significant when either adenoma group was compared with normal mucosa, but not between MMR-P and MMR-D adenomas. Significantly increased methylation was found in multiple CIMP marker genes (IGF2, NEUROG1, CRABP1, and CDKN2A) and TSGs (SFRP1 and SFRP2) in MMR-P adenomas already. Furthermore, certain CRC-associated somatic mutations, such as KRAS, were prevalent in MMR-P adenomas.We conclude that DNA methylation changes and somatic mutations of cancer-associated genes might serve as an alternative pathway accelerating LS-associated tumorigenesis in the presence of proficient MMR.Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation, Academy of Finland, Cancer Foundation Finland, Sigrid Juselius Foundation, and HiLIFE.",

The few studies in which small adenomas have been left in situ for a limited period of time, have shown that most lesions remain stable or even completely regress. Specific DNA copy number changes (\u2018cancer associated events\u2019 or CAEs) are associated with progression of adenomas to cancer. In this study we evaluated whether molecular features of progression correlated with growth of small polyps.Small (6\u20139\u202fmm) colorectal precursor lesions detected on CT-colonography (CTC) were left in situ and re-evaluated with CTC after three years. Based on volumetric change, polyps were classified as either grown, stable or regressed. Surveillance CTC was followed by colonoscopy, during which all lesions were resected. Using DNA isolated from FFPE polyp tissues, low-coverage whole genome sequencing was performed to determine DNA copy number profiles, as well as target enrichment mutation analysis and CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) analysis. Expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry. Samples were marked as MMR proficient if all MMR proteins were expressed.Out of 68 polyps resected at colonoscopy, for 65 (96%) material was available. Of these, 31 (48%) had grown, 27 (41%) remained stable and 7 (11%) regressed. Polyps with at least one CAE had higher growth rates compared to polyps without CAEs (difference 91% growth (95% CI 13\u2013169), p\u202f=\u202f.023). CAEs were absent in lesions that had partially regressed.

However, their role in disease progression induced by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains elusive.H. pylori infection was used in in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine its effect on rhythmic genes. The GEO database was used to screen H. pylori affecting rhythm genes, and the effect of rhythm genes on inflammatory factors. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase assays were used to further find out the regulation between molecules. Animal models were used to confirm the relationship between rhythm genes and H. pylori-induced inflammation.BMAL1 disorders aggravate inflammation induced by H. pylori. Specifically, H. pylori induce BMAL1 expression in vitro and in vivo through transcriptional activation of LIN28A, breaking the circadian rhythm. Mechanistically, LIN28A binds to the promoter region of BMAL1 and directly activates its transcription under H. pylori infection. BMAL1 in turn functions as a transcription factor and enhances the expression of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, thereby promoting inflammation. Of note, BMAL1 dysfunction in the rhythm disorder animal model aggravates inflammatory response induced by H. pylori infection in vivo.These findings in this study imply the pathogenic relationship between BMAL1 and H. pylori.

Because of the extent of this health crisis, a number of more serious symptoms have become associated with ZIKV infection than what was initially described. In particular, neuronal and ocular disorders have been characterized, both in infants and in adults. Notably, the macula and the retina can be strongly affected by ZIKV, possibly by a direct effect of the virus. This is supported by the detection of replicative and infectious virus in lachrimal fluid in human patients and mouse models.Here, we used an innovative, state-of-the-art iPSC-derived human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) model to study ZIKV retinal impairment.We showed that the human RPE is highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and that a ZIKV African strain was more virulent and led to a more potent epithelium disruption and stronger anti-viral response than an Asian strain, suggesting lineage differences. Moreover, ZIKV infection led to impaired membrane dynamics involved in endocytosis, organelle biogenesis and potentially secretion, key mechanisms of RPE homeostasis and function.Taken together, our results suggest that ZIKV has a highly efficient ocular tropism, which creates a strong inflammatory environment that could have acute or chronic adverse effects.This work was funded by Retina France, REACTing and La R\u00e9gion Languedoc-Roussillon.",

The mass spectrometry based proteomic data from extra-nuclear fraction of above THP-1 lysate showed the crucial association of PF4 with enhanced DV replication. Our cytokine analysis and immunoblot assay showed significant inhibition of IFN-\u03b1 production in monocytes via p38MAPK-STAT2-IRF9 axis. Blocking PF4 through antibodies or its receptor CXCR3 through inhibitor i.e. AMG487, significantly rescued production of IFN-\u03b1 resulting in potent inhibition of DV replication in monocytes. Further, flow cytometry and ELISA data showed the direct correlation between elevated plasma PF4 with increased viral NS1 in circulating monocytes in febrile DV patients at day-3 of fever than day-9. Similarly, PF4 also showed direct effects in promoting the JEV replication in monocytes and microglia cells in vitro.

However, these measures may have consequences on the evolution of hepatitis A virus (HAV), leading to the emergence of antigenic variants. Cases in vaccinated MSM patients have been detected in Barcelona, opening the possibility to study HAV evolution under immune pressure.We performed deep-sequencing analysis of ten overlapping fragments covering the complete capsid coding region of HAV.

Non-synonymous (NSyn) mutations affecting residues exposed in the capsid surface were located, with respect to epitopes, using the recently described crystal structure of HAV, as an indication of its potential role in escaping to the effect of vaccines.HAV evolution at the quasispecies level, in non-vaccinated and vaccinated patients, revealed higher diversity in epitope-coding regions of the vaccinated group. Although amino acid replacements occurring in and around the epitopes were observed in both groups, their abundance was significantly higher in the quasispecies of vaccinated patients, indicating ongoing processes of fixation.Our data suggest positive selection of antigenic variants in some vaccinated patients, raising concerns for new vaccination polices directed to the MSM group.",

A random sample of 1190 adults was selected and approached for consent, blood samples and structured interview.We found marginally raised CD4/CD3 ratios of participants with malaria parasites, but no difference in CD4/CD3 ratios for participants with common mental disorder (CMD) or psychotic symptoms. People with psychotic symptoms had increased levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, and lower levels of IL-1beta. People with CMD had higher levels of IL-8 and IL-10. People with malaria had higher levels of IL-10 and lower levels of TNF-alpha. At the bivariate level, CMD was associated with log TNF-\u03b1 levels using unadjusted odds ratios, but not after adjusting for malaria. Psychotic symptoms were associated with log IL-10 and log TNF-\u03b1 levels at the bivariate level while in the adjusted analysis, log TNF-\u03b1 levels remained highly significant..This is the first population based study of immune markers in CMD and psychotic symptoms, and the first to examine the 3 way relationship with malaria.

GSK3\u03b2 activity was increased genetically in GSK3\u03b2[S9A] mice. Its effects on neuronal transmission and epileptogenesis induced by kainic acid were assessed by field potential recordings in mice brain slices and video electroencephalography in vivo.

At the biochemical level, higher GSK3\u03b2 activity increased the expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel 4 under basal conditions and in the epileptic mouse brain and decreased phosphorylation of the glutamate \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA1 at Serine 831 under basal conditions. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between higher inhibitory GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation at Serine 9 and higher activating GluA1 phosphorylation at Serine 845 in brain samples from epileptic patients.Our data imply GSK3\u03b2 activity in the protection of neuronal networks from hyper-activation in response to epileptogenic stimuli and indicate that the anti-epileptogenic function of GSK3\u03b2 involves modulation of HCN4 level and the synaptic AMPA receptors pool.",

Although clinical assessments have determined the underlying symptomology of Malan syndrome, the fundamental mechanisms contributing to the enlarged head circumference and intellectual disability in these patients remains undefined.Here, we used Nfix heterozygous mice as a model to investigate these aspects of Malan syndrome. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to calculate the volumes of 20 brain sub regions. Diffusion tensor MRI was used to perform tractography-based analyses of the corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, and anterior commissure, as well as structural connectome mapping of the whole brain. Immunohistochemistry examined the neocortical cellular populations. Two behavioral assays were performed, including the active place avoidance task to assess spatial navigation and learning and memory function, and the 3-chambered sociability task to examine social behaviour.Adult Nfix+/\u2212 mice exhibit significantly increased brain volume (megalencephaly) compared to wildtypes, with the cerebral cortex showing the highest increase. Moreover, all three forebrain commissures, in particular the anterior commissure, revealed significantly reduced fractional anisotropy, axial and radial diffusivity, and tract density intensity. Structural connectome analyses revealed aberrant connectivity between many crucial brain regions. Finally, Nfix+/\u2212 mice exhibit behavioral deficits that model intellectual disability.Collectively, these data provide a significant conceptual advance in our understanding of Malan syndrome by suggesting that megalencephaly underlies the enlarged head size of these patients, and that disrupted cortical connectivity may contribute to the intellectual disability these patients exhibit.Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project Grants, ARC Fellowship, NYSTEM and Australian Postgraduate Fellowships.",

The patient's pain ratings were assessed by a visual analogue scale (10: worst pain, 0: no pain) and treatment effect was objectified by microneurography recordings of the patient's single nerve C-fibers.We identified patient-specific changes in iPSC-derived nociceptor excitability in MEA recordings, which were reverted by the FDA-approved compound lacosamide in vitro. Using this drug for individualized treatment of this patient, the patient's pain ratings decreased from 7.5 to 1.5.

     "abstract": "It is widely accepted that cognitive and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily result from synaptic failure. However, the mechanisms that underlie synaptic and cognitive dysfunction remain unclear.We utilized molecular biology techniques, electrophysiological recordings, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immuno- and Golgi-staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP); lentivirus (LV)-based microRNA overexpression and \u2018sponging\u2019, and behavioral tests to assess upregulated miR-30b causing synaptic and cognitive declines in APP transgenic (TG) mice.We provide evidence that expression of miR-30b, which targets molecules important for maintaining synaptic integrity, including ephrin type-B receptor 2 (ephB2), sirtuin1 (sirt1), and glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2 (GluA2), is robustly upregulated in the brains of both AD patients and APP transgenic (TG) mice, an animal model of AD, while expression of its targets is significantly downregulated. Overexpression of miR-30b in the hippocampus of normal wild-type (WT) mice impairs synaptic and cognitive functions, mimicking those seen in TG mice. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-30b in TG mice prevents synaptic and cognitive decline. We further observed that expression of miR-30b is upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines and A\u03b242 through NF-\u03baB signaling.Our results provide a previously undefined mechanism by which unregulated miR-30b causes synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD, suggesting that reversal of dysregulated miR-30b in the brain may prevent or slow cognitive declines in AD.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01NS076815, R01MH113535, R01AG058621, P30GM103340 Pilot Project, and by the LSUHSC School of Medicine Research Enhancement Program grant (to C.C.).",

     "abstract": "Progression of Alzheimer's disease is thought initially to depend on rising amyloid\u03b2 and its synaptic interactions. Transgenic mice (TASTPM; APPSwe/PSEN1M146V) show altered synaptic transmission, compatible with increased physiological function of amyloid\u03b2, before plaques are detected. Recently, the importance of microglia has become apparent in the human disease. Similarly, TASTPM show a close association of plaque load with upregulated microglial genes.CA1 synaptic transmission and plasticity were investigated using in vitro electrophysiology. Microglial relationship to plaques was examined with immunohistochemistry. Behaviour was assessed with a forced-alternation T-maze, open field, light/dark box and elevated plus maze.The most striking finding is the increase in microglial numbers in TASTPM, which, like synaptic changes, begins before plaques are detected. Further increases and a reactive phenotype occur later, concurrent with development of larger plaques. Long-term potentiation is initially enhanced at pre-plaque stages but decrements with the initial appearance of plaques. Finally, despite altered plasticity, TASTPM have little cognitive deficit, even with a heavy plaque load, although they show altered non-cognitive behaviours.The pre-plaque synaptic changes and microglial proliferation are presumably related to low, non-toxic amyloid\u03b2 levels in the general neuropil and not directly associated with plaques. However, as plaques grow, microglia proliferate further, clustering around plaques and becoming phagocytic. Like in humans, even when plaque load is heavy, without development of neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, these alterations do not result in cognitive deficits. Behaviours are seen that could be consistent with pre-diagnosis changes in the human condition.GlaxoSmithKline; BBSRC; UCL; ARUK; MRC.",

It impacts the structure and function of tissues and organs involved in metabolism, such as the liver, pancreatic islets and the hypothalamus. Brown adipose tissue has emerged as an important component of whole body energy homeostasis, controlling caloric expenditure through the regulation of non-shivering thermogenesis. However, little is known about the impact of systemic inflammation on the structure and function of brown adipose tissue.The relations between IL10 and mitochondria structure/function and also with thermogenesis were evaluated by bioinformatics using human and rodent data. Real-time PCR, immunoblot, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy were employed to determine the effect of IL10 in the brown adipose tissue of wild type and IL10 knockout mice.IL10 knockout mice, a model of systemic inflammation, present severe structural abnormalities of brown adipose tissue mitochondria, which are round-shaped with loss of cristae structure and increased fragmentation. IL10 deficiency leads to newborn cold intolerance and impaired UCP1-dependent brown adipose tissue mitochondrial respiration. The reduction of systemic inflammation with an anti-TNF\u03b1 monoclonal antibody partially rescued the structural but not the functional abnormalities of brown adipose tissue mitochondria. Using bioinformatics analyses we show that in both humans and mice, IL10 transcripts correlate with mitochondrial lipid metabolism and caspase gene expression.IL10 and systemic inflammation play a central role in the regulation of brown adipose tissue by controlling mitochondrial structure and function.Sao Paulo Research Foundation grant 2013/07607-8.",

     "abstract": "The Iroquois homeobox 3 (Irx3) gene has been identified as a functional long-range target of obesity-associated variants within the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) gene. It is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, and both whole-body knockout and hypothalamic restricted abrogation of its expression results in a lean phenotype, which is mostly explained by the resulting increased energy expenditure in the brown adipose tissue. Because of its potential implication in the pathogenesis of obesity, we evaluated the hypothalamic cell distribution of Irx3 and the outcomes of inhibiting its expression in a rodent model of diet-induced obesity.Bioinformatics tools were used to evaluate the correlations between hypothalamic Irx3 and neurotransmitters, markers of thermogenesis and obesity related phenotypes. Droplet-sequencing analysis in >20,000 hypothalamic cells was used to explore the types of hypothalamic cells expressing Irx3. Lentivirus was used to inhibit hypothalamic Irx3 and the resulting phenotype was studied.IRX3 is expressed predominantly in POMC neurons. Its expression is inhibited during prolonged fasting, as well as when mice are fed a high-fat diet. The partial inhibition of hypothalamic Irx3 using a lentivirus resulted in increased diet-induced body mass gain and adiposity due to increased caloric intake and reduced energy expenditure.Contrary to the results obtained when lean mice are submitted to complete inhibition of Irx3, partial inhibition of hypothalamic Irx3 in obese mice causes an exacerbation of the obese phenotype. These data suggest that at least some of the Irx3 functions in the hypothalamus are regulated according to a hormetic pattern, and modulation of its expression can be a novel approach to modifying the body's energy-handling regulation.Sao Paulo Research Foundation grants 2013/07607-8 (LAV) and 2017/02983-2 (JDJ); NIH grants R01DK083567 (YBK).",

We analyzed the hypothetical triggering and aggravating role of iron on NAFLD in patients on dialysis.Liver iron concentration (LIC) and hepatic proton density fat fraction (PDFF) were analyzed prospectively in 68 dialysis patients by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Follow up of LIC and PDFF was performed in 17 dialysis patients during iron therapy.PDFF differed significantly among dialysis patients classified according to LIC: patients with moderate or severe iron overload had increased fat fraction (PDFF: 7.9% (0.5\u201314.8%)) when compared to those with normal LIC (PDFF: 5% (0.27\u201311%)) or mild iron overload (PDFF: 5% (0.30\u201311.6%); P\u202f=\u202f0.0049).

However, the epigenetic mechanism that accounts for hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation in liver fibrosis remains largely unknown.Primary HSCs were used to screen the differentially expressed histone H3 lysine methyltransferases and demethylases during HSC activation. Loss-of-function experiments were applied to determine the cellular functions of KDM4D in HSCs. Transcriptome analysis was applied to explore the downstream targets of KDM4D. Real-time qPCR, western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to uncover the underlying mechanism concerning KDM4D during liver fibrogenesis.KDM4D was identified as a remarkable up-regulated histone H3 demethylase during HSC activation. The overexpression profile of KDM4D was confirmed in three fibrosis animal models and human fibrotic liver tissues. In vitro Kdm4d knockdown impaired the collagen gel contraction and migration capacity of primary HSCs. In established CCl4-induced mice model, Kdm4d knockdown inhibited fibrosis progression, and promoted fibrosis reversal, with enhanced thinning and splitting of fibrotic septa, as well as a dramatic decrease in collagen area. Whole gene transcriptome analysis showed the regulatory role of KDM4D in Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Mechanistically, KDM4D catalyzed histone 3 on lysine 9 (H3K9) di-, and tri-demethylation, which promoted TLR4 expression, and subsequently prompted liver fibrogenesis by activating NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.KDM4D facilitates TLR4 transcription through demethylation of H3K9, thus activating TLR4/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in HSCs, contributing to HSC activation and collagen crosslinking, further, hepatic fibrosis progression.Shanghai New Hundred Talents Program, Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning, Key Developing Disciplines Program, Shanghai Key disciplines program of Health and Family Planning and Shanghai Sailing Program.",

Two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, are the only approved therapeutic options for IPF, but their applications are limited due to their side effects. Thus, curative IPF drugs represent a huge unmet medical need.A mouse hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line was established that could robustly differentiate into myofibroblasts upon treatment with TGF-\u03b2. Eupatilin was assessed in diseased human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients (DHLFs) as well as in human lung epithelial cells (HLECs). The drug's performance was extensively tested in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model (BLM). Global gene expression studies and proteome analysis were performed.Eupatilin attenuated disease severity of BLM in both preventative and therapeutic studies. The drug inhibited the in vitro transdifferantiation of DHLFs to myofibroblasts upon stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. No such induction of the in vitro transdifferantiation was observed in TGF-\u03b2 treated HLECs. Specific carbons of eupatilin were essential for its anti-fibrotic activity. Eupatilin was capable of dismantling latent TGF-\u03b2 complex, specifically by eliminating expression of the latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein 1 (LTBP1), in ECM upon actin depolymerization. Unlike eupatilin, pirfenidone was unable to block fibrosis of DHLFs or HSCs stimulated with TGF-\u03b2. Eupatilin attenuated phosphorylation of Smad3 by TGF-\u03b2. Eupatilin induced myofibroblasts to dedifferentiate into intermediate HCS-like cells.Eupatilin may act directly on pathogenic myofibroblasts, disarming them, whereas the anti-fibrotic effect of pirfenidone may be indirect.

Metatranscriptomic approaches should be key in unraveling how such adjustments occur.We employ metatranscriptomic sequencing analyses to study gene expression in the gut microbiota of infants through their first year of life, and of their mothers days before delivery and one year afterwards.In infants, hallmarks of aerobic metabolism disappear from the microbial metatranscriptome as development proceeds, while the expression of functions related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism increases and diversifies, approaching that observed in non-pregnant women. Butyrate synthesis enzymes are overexpressed at three months of age, even though most butyrate-producing organisms are still rare. In late pregnancy, the microbiota readjusts the expression of carbohydrate-related functions in a manner consistent with a high availability of glucose.Our findings suggest that butyrate production may be ensured in the gut of young infants before the typical butyrate synthesizers of the adult gut become abundant. The late pregnancy gut microbiota may be able to access the high levels of blood glucose characteristic of this period.

     "abstract": "Circulating estrogen (E2) levels are high throughout pregnancy and increase towards term, however its local tissue specific actions vary across gestation. For example, myometrial E2 regulated uterotonic action is disabled until term, whereas it's proliferative function is maintained in the breast. We have identified gestationally regulated splicing events, mediated by hnRNPG and modulated by E2 that generate alternatively spliced estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) variants (ER\u03947 and ER\u03b146) in the myometrium. These variants allow for differential, gestationally regulated, modulation of the uterotonic action of E2.Human myometrium isolated from preterm and term non-laboring and laboring pregnant women were analyzed for ER\u03b1 isoforms and splice factor levels. Lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of hnRNPG and overexpression of ER\u03947 were performed in human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells. Functional 3D collagen contraction assays were executed.ER\u03947 acts as a dominant negative repressor of the uterotonic action of ER\u03b166 and ER\u03b146 isoforms through the regulation of the myometrial gap junction protein GJA1. Elimination of hnRNPG inhibits the generation of ER\u03947 while overexpression of ER\u03947 inhibited GJA1 expression. Moreover in vivo human myometrial hnRNPG levels decline at term in an E2 dependent manner resulting in a withdrawal of ER\u03947 levels and its tocolytic action at term.Our findings implicate the unique role of ER\u03947 as a modulator of myometrial quiescence and define the mechanism of ER\u03947 generation, through hormonally regulated splicing events.This study was supported by NIH OPRU U01 supplement (HD047905), University of Pittsburgh and Wayne State University Perinatal Research Initiative (USA).",

In vitro experiments using dNK cells from early gestation showed that dNK activation (IFNG, IL-8 and CD107a) can be downregulated by Treg cells. The expression of these markers by dNK cells was significantly lower in preeclampsia. We also observed a positive correlation between the expression of dNK activation receptors (NKp30 and NKG2D) and the expression of IFNG in specific dNK subsets. TGFb levels are increased in the decidua of preeclamptic pregnancies. We analyzed co-expression of activation (IFNG/IL-8/CD107a) and angiogenic (VEGF) markers in dNK cells. TGFb treatment reduced while blockade of TGFb increased co-expression of these markers.Our findings suggest that elevated decidual TGFb1 supresses the activation of specific subsets of dNK which in turn contributes to the uteroplacental pathology associated with the onset of preeclampsia.",

However, whether GPR120 is involved in decidualization and pregnancy remains unknown.Decidua tissue from women with normal pregnancy and spontaneous abortion were collected to determine the expression profile of GPR120. Abortion mouse models and artificially induced deciduoma in mice were established to evaluate the effect of GPR120 on pregnancy outcome and in vivo decidualization. HESCs and primary DSCs were used to explore the roles of GPR120 in decidualization and mechanisms involved.We found that GPR120 functioned to promote decidualization by upregulating glucose uptake and pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) of human endometrial stromal cells. Firstly, the expression of GPR120 in decidua of spontaneous abortion was downregulated compared to normal decidua. Lack of GPR120 predisposed mice to LPS or RU486 induced abortion. Decidualization was augmented by GPR120 via improving GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake and G6PD- mediated PPP. FOXO1 was upregulated by GPR120 via activation of ERK1/2 and AMPK signaling and increased the expression of GLUT1. Furthermore, the expression of chemokines and cytokines in decidual stromal cells was enhanced by GPR120. Lastly, GPR120 agonist ameliorated LPS-induced abortion in the mice.GPR120 plays significant roles in decidualization and the maintenance of pregnancy, which might be a potential target for diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous abortion.Ministry of Science and Technology of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Program of Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality.",

In view of clinical application, here we further confirmed the competency of human iPSC-derived retina (hiPSC-retina) to mature in the degenerated retinas of rat and monkey models.Human iPSC-retinas were transplanted in rhodopsin mutant SD-Foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3LavRrrc nude rats and two monkeys with laser-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Graft maturation was studied by immunohistochemistry and its function was examined by multi-electrode array (MEA) recording in rat retinas and visually-guided saccade (VGS) in a monkey.A substantial amount of mature photoreceptors in hiPSC-retina graft survived well in the host retinas for at least 5\u202fmonths (rat) to over 2\u202fyears (monkey).

Target identification of AKBA and metabolomics analysis of psoriasis helped to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying its effect, and provide new target(s) to treat the disease.To explore the targets and molecular mechanism of AKBA, we performed affinity purification, metabolomics analysis of HaCaT cells treated with AKBA, and epidermis of imiquimod (IMQ) induced mouse model of psoriasis and psoriasis patients.AKBA directly interacts with methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), inhibited its enzyme activity, decreased level of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and SAM/SAH ratio, and reprogrammed one\u2011carbon metabolism in HaCaT cells. Untargeted metabolomics of epidermis showed one\u2011carbon metabolism was activated in psoriasis patients.

Arm switching occurs when the strand preference is changed. This preference can be different and can change dynamically depending upon the species, tissue types, or development stages. Due to recent advances in next-generation sequencing methods, arm switching has been observed in a variety of cancers.A tumour miRNA-Seq dataset was collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The support vector machine (SVM) method combined with 5-fold cross validation was applied to select the best combination of arm-switched miRNA tumour markers. Survival analysis was also applied to identify patient survival associated miRNA markers.We observed 51 arm-switched miRNAs and of these, 7 were associated with patient survival.

Expression levels of and prognostic information for SF3B4 and miRNAs were determined based on public genomic data and clinical samples. Then, we examined the possible roles of SF3B4 and miRNA-133b in HCC cells and a xenograft mouse model. Pearson correlation analysis and in vitro experiments verified SF3B4 as a miRNA-133b target. Protein levels of key targets from the SF3B4 signaling pathway were estimated using western blotting.The expression of SF3B4 was upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines whereas, the expression of miRNA-133b was downregulated. MiRNA-133b negatively regulated the expression of SF3B4. Effects of SF3B4 overexpression were partially abolished by miRNA-133b mimics, confirming that SF3B4 is a target of miRNA-133b.

CHAF1A knockdown and overexpression were used to explore its functions in gastric cancer cells. The regulation and potential molecular mechanism of CHAF1A expression in gastric cancer cells were studied by using cell and molecular biological methods.CHAF1A was upregulated in GC tissues and its high expression predicted poor prognosis in GC patients. Overexpression of CHAF1A promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, whereas CHAF1A suppression exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, CHAF1A acted as a co-activator in the Wnt pathway. CHAF1A directly interacted with TCF4 to enhance the expression of c-MYC and CCND1 through binding to their promoter regions. In addition, the overexpression of CHAF1A was modulated by specificity protein 1 (Sp1) in GC. Sp1 transcriptionally enhanced the expression of CHAF1A in GC. Furthermore, CHAF1A expression induced by Helicobacter pylori was Sp1 dependent.CHAF1A is a potential oncogene in GC, and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for GC treatment.",

High endothelial venules (HEVs) are found primarily in lymph nodes or formed de novo in peripheral tissues during inflammatory responses. They express peripheral node addressin (PNAd), which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody MECA79.Here, we demonstrated that HEVs form de novo in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We engineered MECA79 coated nanoparticles (MECA79-NPs) that recognize these ectopic HEVs in PDAC.The trafficking of MECA79-NPs following intravenous delivery to human PDAC implanted in a humanized mouse model was more robust than non-conjugated NPs. Treatment with MECA79-Taxol-NPs augmented the delivery of Paclitaxel (Taxol) to the tumor site and significantly reduced the tumor size. This effect was associated with a higher apoptosis rate of PDAC cells and reduced vascularization within the tumor.Targeting the HEVs of PDAC using MECA79-NPs could lay the ground for the localized delivery of a wide variety of drugs including chemotherapeutic agents.National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants: T32-EB016652 (B\u00b7B.), NIH Cancer Core Grant CA034196 (L.D.S.), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grants R01-AI126596 and R01-HL141815 (R.A.).",

However, the precise mechanism involved remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of APP proteolytic cleavage in breast cancer functions.The presence of APP proteolytic cleavage products was examined in breast cancer cell lines. The functional roles of APP in breast cancer were studied in vitro and tumor xenograft model using siRNA. The effects of full length APP and the \u03b1-secretase cleaved ectodomain fragment, soluble APP\u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1) were further investigated for their overexpression in breast cancers. The \u03b1-secretase involved was identified. The \u03b1-secretase expression together with APP was examined in clinical breast cancers.We showed that APP underwent proteolytic cleavage in breast cancer cells to generate sAPP\u03b1. The sAPP\u03b1 and full length protein mediated breast cancer migration and proliferation, but in different functional extent. This proteolytic cleavage was mediated by ADAM10. Downregulation of APP and ADAM10 brought about similar functional effects. Overexpression of sAPP\u03b1 reversed the effects of ADAM10 downregulation. Interestingly, in patients with non-luminal breast cancers, APP and ADAM10 expression correlated with each other and their co-expression was associated with the worst outcome.These results demonstrated the contributory role of APP cleavage on its oncogenic roles in breast cancer. ADAM10 was the key \u03b1-secretase. APP and ADAM10 co-expression was associated with worse survival in non-luminal breast cancers. Targeting of APP or its processing by ADAM10 might be a promising treatment option in these cancers.",

However, the effects of exosomal miRNAs on cells are not fully understood.To investigate the role of exosomal miR-1246 in ovarian cancer (OC) microenvironment, we performed RPPA as well as many other in vitro functional assays in ovarian cancer cells (sensitive; HeyA8, Skov3ip1, A2780 and chemoresistant; HeyA8-MDR, Skov3-TR, A2780-CP20). Therapeutic effect of miR-1246 inhibitor treatment was tested in OC animal model. We showed the effect of OC exosomal miR-1246 uptake on macrophages by co-culture experiments.Substantial expression of oncogenic miR-1246 OC exosomes was found. We showed that Cav1 gene, which is the direct target of miR-1246, is involved in the process of exosomal transfer. A significantly worse overall prognosis were found for OC patients with high miR-1246 and low Cav1 expression based on TCGA data. miR-1246 expression were significantly higher in paclitaxel-resistant OC exosomes than in their sensitive counterparts. Overexpression of Cav1 and anti-miR-1246 treatment significantly sensitized OC cells to paclitaxel. We showed that Cav1 and multi drug resistance (MDR) gene is involved in the process of exosomal transfer. Our proteomic approach also revealed that miR-1246 inhibits Cav1 and acts through PDGF\u03b2 receptor at the recipient cells to inhibit cell proliferation. miR-1246 inhibitor treatment in combination with chemotherapy led to reduced tumor burden in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that when OC cells are co-cultured with macrophages, they are capable of transferring their oncogenic miR-1246 to M2-type macrophages, but not M0-type macrophages.Our results suggest that cancer exosomes may contribute to oncogenesis by manipulating neighboring infiltrating immune cells.

However, the involvement of alternative splicing in resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy remains elusive. We sought to investigate the key role of the splicing factor SRSF1 in the radioresistance in lung cancer.Lung cancer cell lines, xenograft mice models, and RNA-seq were employed to study the detailed mechanisms of SRSF1 in lung cancer radioresistance. Clinical tumor tissues and TCGA dataset were utilized to determine the expression levels of distinct SRSF1-regulated splicing isoforms. KM-plotter was applied to analyze the survival of cancer patients with various levels of SRSF1-regulated splicing isoforms.Splicing factors were screened to identify their roles in radioresistance, and SRSF1 was found to be involved in radioresistance in cancer cells. The level of SRSF1 is elevated in irradiation treated lung cancer cells, whereas knockdown of SRSF1 sensitizes cancer cells to irradiation. Mechanistically, SRSF1 modulates various cancer-related splicing events, particularly the splicing of PTPMT1, a PTEN-like mitochondrial phosphatase. Reduced SRSF1 favors the production of short isoforms of PTPMT1 upon irradiation, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of AMPK, thereby inducing DNA double-strand break to sensitize cancer cells to irradiation. Additionally, the level of the short isoform of PTPMT1 is decreased in cancer samples, which is correlated to cancer patients' survival.Our study provides mechanistic analyses of aberrant splicing in radioresistance in lung cancer cells, and establishes SRSF1 as a potential therapeutic target for sensitization of patients to radiotherapy.",

Altered levels of circulating microRNAs have been reported in human epilepsy, but most studies collected samples from one clinical site, used a single profiling platform or conducted minimal validation.Using a case-control design, we collected plasma samples from video-electroencephalogram-monitored adult TLE patients at epilepsy specialist centers in two countries, performed genome-wide PCR-based and RNA sequencing during the discovery phase and validated findings in a large (>250) cohort of samples that included patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).After profiling and validation, we identified miR-27a-3p, miR-328-3p and miR-654-3p with biomarker potential. Plasma levels of these microRNAs were also changed in a mouse model of TLE but were not different to healthy controls in PNES patients. We determined copy number of the three microRNAs in plasma and demonstrate their rapid detection using an electrochemical RNA microfluidic disk as a prototype point-of-care device. Analysis of the microRNAs within the exosome-enriched fraction provided high diagnostic accuracy while Argonaute-bound miR-328-3p selectively increased in patient samples after seizures. In situ hybridization localized miR-27a-3p and miR-328-3p within neurons in human brain and bioinformatics predicted targets linked to growth factor signaling and apoptosis.This study demonstrates the biomarker potential of circulating microRNAs for epilepsy diagnosis and mechanistic links to underlying pathomechanisms.",

The investigational drug arimoclomol, which is in phase II/III clinical trials, is a well-characterized HSP amplifier and has been extensively clinically tested. Importantly, arimoclomol efficiently crosses the blood-brain-barrier presenting an opportunity to target the neurological manifestations of GD, which remains without a disease-modifying therapy.We used a range of biological and biochemical in vitro assays to assess the effect of arimoclomol on GCase activity in ex vivo systems of primary fibroblasts and neuronal-like cells from GD patients.We found that arimoclomol induced relevant HSPs such as ER-resident HSP70 (BiP) and enhanced the folding, maturation, activity, and correct cellular localization of mutated GCase across several genotypes including the common L444P and N370S mutations in primary cells from GD patients. These effects where recapitulated in a human neuronal model of GD obtained by differentiation of multipotent adult stem cells.These data demonstrate the potential of HSP-targeting therapies in GCase-deficiencies and strongly support the clinical development of arimoclomol as a potential therapeutic option for the neuronopathic forms of GD.The research was funded by Orphazyme A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.",

Functions of URPL-related eRNAs were further investigated in vitro.We identified lnc-SLC4A1-1, which was transcribed from an active enhancer marked with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 and so-called eRNA, highly expressed in URPL patients. Gain-of-function experiments indicated that lnc-SLC4A1-1 facilitated trophoblast cell migration and apoptosis. Mechanistically, as an eRNA, lnc-SLC4A1-1 was retained in the nuclei and recruited transcription factor NF-\u03baB to bind to CXCL8, resulting in increased H3K27ac in the CXCL8 promoter and subsequent elevation of CXCL8 expression. Activation of CXCL8 exacerbated inflammatory reactions in trophoblast cells by inducing TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which could be blocked by an antagonist of lnc-SLC4A1-1.These findings indicate that an eRNA, lnc-SLC4A1-1, alters trophoblast function via activation of immune responses and by regulating the NF-\u03baB/CXCL8 axis.

Defective metabolism in renal tubules is involved in the pathobiology of kidney diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation in renal tubules remain to be defined.We quantitatively compared the proteomes of the isolated proximal tubules (PT) and distal tubules (DT) from C57BL/6 mouse using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling-based quantitative mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed proteins revealed the significant differences between PT and DT in metabolism pathway. We also performed in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the distant metabolic features in PT and DT.We demonstrate that the renal proximal tubule (PT) has high expression of lipid metabolism enzymes, which is transcriptionally upregulated by abundantly expressed PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3. In contrast, the renal distal tubule (DT) has elevated glycolytic enzyme expression, which is mediated by highly expressed c-Myc. Importantly, PPAR\u03b3 transcriptionally enhances the protease iRhom2 expression in PT, which suppresses EGF expression and secretion and subsequent EGFR-dependent glycolytic gene expression and glycolysis. PPAR\u03b3 inhibition reduces iRhom2 expression and increases EGF and GLUT1 expression in PT in mice, resulting in renal tubule hypertrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and damaged kidney functions, which are rescued by 2-deoxy-d-glucose treatment.These findings delineate instrumental mechanisms underlying the active lipid metabolism and suppressed glycolysis in PT and active glycolysis in DT and reveal critical roles for PPARs and c-Myc in maintaining renal metabolic homeostasis.

We sought to determine if exposure to CIH, modelling human sleep apnoea, adversely affects cardiorespiratory control in guinea-pigs, a species with hypoxia-insensitive carotid bodies. We reasoned that CIH-induced disruption of gut microbiota would evoke cardiorespiratory morbidity.Adult male guinea-pigs were exposed to CIH (6.5% O2 at nadir, 6\u202fcycles.hour\u22121) for 8\u202fh.day\u22121 for 12 consecutive days.CIH-exposed animals established reduced faecal microbiota species richness, with increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and reduced relative abundance of Firmicutes bacteria. Urinary corticosterone and noradrenaline levels were unchanged in CIH-exposed animals, but brainstem noradrenaline concentrations were lower compared with sham. Baseline ventilation was equivalent in CIH-exposed and sham animals; however, respiratory timing variability, sigh frequency and ventilation during hypoxic breathing were all lower in CIH-exposed animals. Baseline arterial blood pressure was unaffected by exposure to CIH, but \u03b2-adrenoceptor-dependent tachycardia and blunted bradycardia during phenylephrine-induced pressor responses was evident compared with sham controls.Increased carotid body chemo-afferent signalling appears obligatory for the development of CIH-induced hypertension and elevated chemoreflex control of breathing commonly reported in mammals, with hypoxia-sensitive carotid bodies. However, we reveal that exposure to modest CIH alters gut microbiota richness and composition, brainstem neurochemistry, and autonomic control of heart rate, independent of carotid body sensitisation, suggesting modulation of breathing and autonomic homeostasis via the microbiota-gut-brainstem axis. The findings have relevance to human sleep-disordered breathing.The Department of Physiology, and APC Microbiome Ireland, UCC.",

This study aimed to investigate the underlying genomic risks of TAPVC through next-generation sequencing (NGS).Rare variants were identified through whole exome sequencing (WES) of 78 sporadic TAPVC cases and 100 healthy controls using Fisher's exact test and gene-based burden test. We then detected candidate gene expression patterns in cells, pulmonary vein tissues, and embryos. Finally, we validated these genes using target sequencing (TS) in another 100 TAPVC cases.We identified 42 rare variants of 7 genes (CLTCL1, CST3, GXYLT1, HMGA2, SNAI1, VAV2, ZDHHC8) in TAPVC cases compared with controls. These genes were highly expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), mouse pulmonary veins and human embryonic hearts. mRNA levels of these genes in human pulmonary vein samples were significantly different between cases and controls. Through network analysis and expression patterns in zebrafish embryos, we revealed that SNAI1, HMGA2 and VAV2 are the most important genes for TAPVC.Our study identifies novel candidate genes potentially related to TAPVC and elucidates the possible molecular pathogenesis of this rare congenital birth defect. Furthermore, SNAI1, HMGA2 and VAV2 are novel TAPVC candidate genes that have not been reported previously in either humans or animals.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that myeloid sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) is a critical determinant of phenotypic switching and the migratory responses of macrophages. Given the prominent role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we tested whether myeloid Sirt6 deficiency affects the development and exacerbation of RA.Arthritis was induced in wild type and myeloid Sirt6 knockout (mS6KO) mice using collagen-induced and K/BxN serum transfer models. Sirt6 expression (or activity) and inflammatory activities were compared in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocytes/macrophages obtained from patients with RA or osteoarthritis.Based on clinical score, ankle thickness, pathology, and radiology, arthritis was more severe in mS6KO mice relative to wild type, with a greater accumulation of macrophages in the synovium. Consistent with these findings, myeloid Sirt6 deficiency increased the migration potential of macrophages toward synoviocyte-derived chemoattractants. Mechanistically, Sirt6 deficiency in macrophages caused an inflammation with increases in acetylation and protein stability of forkhead box protein O1. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Sirt6 in knockout cells reduced the inflammatory responses. Lastly, PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages from RA patients exhibited lower expression of Sirt6 than those from patients with osteoarthritis, and their Sirt6 activity was inversely correlated with disease severity.Our data identify a role of myeloid Sirt6 in clinical and experimental RA and suggest that myeloid Sirt6 may be an intriguing therapeutic target.Medical Research Center Program and Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

The aim of the studies is to evaluate synergistic anti-fibrotic potency of the siRNAs of these genes.The efficacy of the siRNA-combination was evaluated in bleomycin-induced mouse fibrosis. The pathological changes of skin and lungs of the mice were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome stains. The expression of inflammation and fibrosis associated genes and proteins in the tissues were assessed by real-time RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, Western blots and ELISA. Non-crosslinked fibrillar collagen was measured by the Sircol colorimetric assay.The applications of the combined siRNAs in bleomycin-induced mice achieved favorable anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Activation of fibroblasts was suppressed in parallel with inhibition of inflammation evidenced by reduced inflammatory cells and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF and/or the tissues by the treatment. Aberrant expression of the genes normally expressed in fibroblasts, monocytes/ macrophage, endothelial and epithelial cells were significantly restrained after the treatment. In addition, transcriptome profiles indicated that some bleomycin-induced alterations of multiple biological pathways were recovered to varying degrees by the treatment.The application of the combined siRNAs of SPARC, CCR2, and SMAD3 genes ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in bleomycin-induced mice. It systemically reinstated multiple biopathways, probably through controlling on different cell types including fibroblasts, monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells and others.

While their clinical benefits have been proved, concerns regarding the side-effects of their therapeutic use have been raised.

Each acute asthma-like episode was randomized to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10\u202fmg/kg per day or placebo. Azithromycin reduced episode duration by half, which was the primary end-point and reported previously.

Recent studies have revealed that administration of NSC-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-EVs) via non-invasive approaches can also afford therapeutic benefits. This review confers the properties and therapeutic promise of EVs secreted by NSCs. NSC-EVs enriched with specific miRNAs mediate multiple functions in physiological and pathological conditions, which include modulation of the proximate microenvironment, facilitating the entry of viruses into cells, functioning as independent metabolic units, operating as a microglial morphogen and influencing the diverse aspects of brain function in adulthood including the process of aging. Due to their anti-inflammatory, neurogenic and neurotrophic effects, NSC-EVs are also useful for treating multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Although only a few studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NSC-EVs to treat brain impairments, the promise is enormous. Moving forward, the use of well-characterized NSC-EVs generated in specific culture conditions and NSC-EVs that are engineered to carry the desired miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins have great promise for treating brain injury and neurogenerative diseases. Notably, the possibility of targeting NSC-EVs to specific neuronal types or brain regions would enable managing of diverse neurodegenerative conditions with minimal side effects.",

The secretome changes were detected by mass spectrometry.We established a pair of homologous lung-metastasis derived oligometastatic and polymetastatic cell lines from human melanoma cancer cell line M14. Using the two cell lines, we have identified Sec23a, a gene target of miR-200c, suppresses miR-200c augmented oligometastatic to polymetastatic progression via its secretome.

Finally, we overexpressed GLUD2 in-vivo by using zebrafish embryos and monitored the developing central nervous system.GLUD2 expression was found associated to the histopathological classification, prognosis and survival of GBM patients. Moreover, through in-vitro functional studies, we showed that differences in GLUD2 expression level affected cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation abilities, cell cycle phases, mitochondrial function and ROS production. In support of these findings, we also demonstrated, with in-vivo studies, that GLUD2 overexpression affects glial cell proliferation without affecting neuronal development in zebrafish embryos.We concluded that GLUD2 overexpression inhibited GBM cell growth suggesting a novel potential drug target for control of GBM progression.

This study aims to identify the EBV natural variations contributed to the different reactivation potential between NPC endemic and non-endemic areas.1030 subjects were recruited in China, including 303 healthy individuals from two NPC non-endemic areas, 483 healthy people from three endemic areas and 244 NPC patients. Among which, saliva DNA samples from 244 participants were sequenced for the EBV immediate early (IE) genes of BRLF1 and BZLF1, their promoters were included; the rest 786 subjects were used for the validation of significant variations among three different populations. Haplotype and population structure analysis were conducted. Dual-luciferase assay was used to detect the promoter activity.A total of 246 distinct variations were detected, 29 showed significant difference in the frequencies between healthy people from NPC endemic area and non-endemic area. Population structure analysis clustered EBV strains into 9 subgroups mostly in accordance with the geographical origin of samples. Interestingly, two EBV genotypes, Rp-V1 and Rp-V2, were identified according to the linkage relationship of the variations in BRLF1 promoter (Rp). Rp-V1 has higher frequency in NPC endemic areas than in non-endemic areas (52.38% vs 18.15%, P\u202f=\u202f2.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u221214), and was associated with higher oral EBV DNA levels (adjusted OR\u202f=\u202f1.64, 95% CI =\u202f1.21\u20132.24, P\u202f=\u202f.002), suggesting a more powerful activation ability of Rp-V1 than that of the prototype Rp-of the EBV strain; On the contrary, Rp-V2 has higher frequency in NPC non-endemic areas than in endemic areas (18.48% vs 0.38%, P\u202f=\u202f1.17\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127), might represent a reduced activation potential of EBV. Further dual-luciferase assay showed Rp-V1 has higher promoter activity while compared with Rp-V2 (P\u202f<\u202f.0001). Notably, Rp-V1 impaired the transcription repression effect of YY1 while Rp-V2 strengthened the transcription repression effect of EBF1 on Rp. In addition, significant differences of Rta 393\u2013407 CTL epitope which may influence the recognition of Rta by CD8+ T cells were detected between healthy people from NPC endemic area and non-endemic area.This study identified natural variations in cis-acting elements (YY1 and EBF1) of EBV Rp altering Rp transcription activities, which may contribute to the elevated EBV activation level in NPC endemic areas than non-endemic areas.",

This study aimed to evaluate the role of miR-424 in cell cycle regulation and ESCC proliferation.The role of miR-424 in cell proliferation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptional activation of miR-424 was determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation, and binding of miR-424 to targets was verified using miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex immunoprecipitation.miR-424 was upregulated and correlated with poor survival in ESCC patients. Repression or overexpression of miR-424 respectively decreased or increased ESCC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. miR-424 expression is transcriptionally regulated by E2F1 and increased during G1/S transition. Knockdown or overexpression of miR-424 respectively inhibited or promoted both G1/S and G2/M cell cycle transitions in ESCC cells, and these effects were mediated by two newly identified miR-424 targets, PRKCD and WEE1, respectively. Consequently, elevation of PRKCD by miR-424 knockdown led to enhanced stability of the p21Cip1 protein via increased activation of PRKCD and downstream p38 MAPK and JNK signaling to block CDK2 activation and G1/S transition, while elevated WEE1 maintained CDC2 in an inactive state to block G2/M transition. However, circLARP4 could sponge the binding of miR-424 to PRKCD, thus compromising the regulation of G1/S progression by miR-424.miR-424 coordinates a previously unknown, multilayered regulation of ESCC cell cycle progression to promote ESCC proliferation, and may be used as a novel prognostic marker and an effective therapeutic target for ESCCs.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

In this study, we sought to develop and validate a non-invasive nomogram model to preoperatively predict LN metastasis in CRC.Development of the nomogram entailed three subsequent stages with specific patient sets. In the discovery set (n\u202f=\u202f20), LN-status-related miRNAs were screened from high-throughput sequencing data of human CRC serum samples. In the training set (n\u202f=\u202f218), a miRNA panel-clinicopathologic nomogram was developed by logistic regression analysis for preoperative prediction of LN metastasis. In the validation set (n\u202f=\u202f198), we validated the above nomogram with respect to its discrimination, calibration and clinical application.Four differently expressed miRNAs (miR-122-5p, miR-146b-5p, miR-186-5p and miR-193a-5p) were identified in the serum samples from CRC patients with and without LN metastasis, which also had regulatory effects on CRC cell migration. The combined miRNA panel could provide higher LN prediction capability compared with computed tomography (CT) scans (P\u202f<\u202f.0001 in both the training and validation sets). Furthermore, a nomogram integrating the miRNA-based panel and CT-reported LN status was constructed in the training set, which performed well in both the training and validation sets (AUC: 0.913 and 0.883, respectively). Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the nomogram.Our nomogram is a reliable prediction model that can be conveniently and efficiently used to improve the accuracy of preoperative prediction of LN metastasis in patients with CRC.",

We next performed liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry to identify the proteins and selected potential biomarker based on bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA and GEO dataset. We examined SETD7 expression in serum and tissue samples by ELISA and immunohistochemistry respectively and explored the biological function of SETD7 in vitro.85 differentially expressed peptides were identified. Five peptides showing the most significant changes in abundance across paired pre- and post-operation CRC patients, colorectal polyps patients and healthy controls were identified as peptide regions of FGA, MUC5AC and SETD7. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the up-regulation of SETD7 in CRC is relatively specific. Validation studies showed that SETD7 expression increased from healthy controls to those with colorectal polyps and finally CRC patients, and decreased after surgery. The sensitivity and specificity of SETD7 were 92.17% and 81.08%, with a high diagnostic value (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.9477). In addition, SETD7 expression was significantly correlated with tumor stage and microsatellite instability.

     "abstract": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the earliest stage of breast cancer. During DCIS, tumor cells remain inside the mammary duct, growing under a microenvironment characterized by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and waste product accumulation; this harsh microenvironment promotes genomic instability and eventually cell invasion. However, there is a lack of biomarkers to predict what patients will transition to a more invasive tumor or how DCIS cells manage to survive in this harsh microenvironment.In this work, we have developed a microfluidic model that recapitulates the DCIS microenvironment. In the microdevice, a DCIS model cell line was grown inside a luminal mammary duct model, embedded in a 3D hydrogel with mammary fibroblasts. Cell behavior was monitored by confocal microscopy and optical metabolic imaging. Additionally, metabolite profile was studied by NMR whereas gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR.DCIS cell metabolism led to hypoxia and nutrient starvation; revealing an altered metabolism focused on glycolysis and other hypoxia-associated pathways. In response to this starvation and hypoxia, DCIS cells modified the expression of multiple genes, and a gradient of different metabolic phenotypes was observed across the mammary duct model. These genetic changes observed in the model were in good agreement with patient genomic profiles; identifying multiple compounds targeting the affected pathways. In this context, the hypoxia-activated prodrug tirapazamine selectively destroyed hypoxic DCIS cells.The results showed the capacity of the microfluidic model to mimic the DCIS structure, identifying multiple cellular adaptations to endure the hypoxia and nutrient starvation generated within the mammary duct. These findings may suggest new potential therapeutic directions to treat DCIS. In summary, given the lack of in vitro models to study DCIS, this microfluidic device holds great potential to find new DCIS predictors and therapies and translate them to the clinic.",

However, they would be missed when only genome sequences and fusions at DNA level are considered. We performed extensive data mining for chimeric RNAs using both our and TCGA cervical cancer RNA-Seq datasets. Multiple criteria were applied. We analyzed the landscape of chimeric RNAs at various levels, and from different angles.The chimeric RNA landscape changed as different filters were applied. 15 highly frequent (>10%) chimeric RNAs were identified. LHX6-NDUFA8 was detected exclusively in cervical cancer tissues and Pap smears, but not in normal controls. Mechanistically, it is not due to interstitial deletion, but a product of cis-splicing between adjacent genes. Silencing of another recurrent chimera, SLC2A11-MIF, resulted in cell cycle arrest and reduced cellular proliferation. This effect is unique to the chimera, and not shared by the two parental genes.Highly frequent chimeric RNAs are present in cervical cancers. They can be formed by intergenic splicing.

The relevance of S1PR1 expression and STAT3 activation in both tumor tissues and cancer cell lines was also tested. The effect of S1PR1 high expression achieved by persistent STAT3 activation on tumor cell drug resistance was investigated in vitro and in vivo.An enhanced S1PR1 expression was highly related with a reduced overall survival time and a worse response to chemotherapy drug and closer correlation to STAT3 in gastric cancer patients. The issue chip analysis showed that the expressions of S1PR1 and STAT3 activation were increased in higher graded gastric cancer (GC) tissues.

Both epigenetic and genetic changes contribute to the initiation, development and metastasis of NSCLC. Recently, accumulating data have begun to support the notion that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as new crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, including proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis, and play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, further study is warranted to comprehensively determine lncRNAs' functions and potential mechanism.In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the lncRNA expression profile of NSCLC using data from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). PCAT6 expression level in a cohort of 60 pairs of NSCLC tissues using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Additionally, Loss-of-function assays and gain-of-function assays were used to assess the role of PCAT6 in promoting NSCLC progression. Tumor formation assay in a nude mouse model was performed to verity the role of PCAT6 in NSCLC in vivo. Meanwhile, RIP, ChIP, resue experiment and western blot assays were used to highlights the potential molecular mechanism of PCAT6 in NSCLC.We identified that an oncogene, PCAT6, was upregulated in NSCLC, and this upregulation was verified in a cohort of 60 pairs of NSCLC tissues. Additionally, the expression level of PCAT6 was correlated with tumor size (P =\u202f.036), lymph node metastasis (P\u202f=\u202f.029) and TNM stage (P\u202f=\u202f.038). Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays were used to assess the role of PCAT6 in promoting NSCLC progression. The results revealed that PCAT6 knockdown mitigated NSCLC cell growth by inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Whereas, PCAT6 overexpression could promoted tumor cell growth. Meanwhile, PCAT6 additionally promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation demonstrated that the oncogenic activity of PCAT6 is partially attributable to its repression of LATS2 via association with the epigenetic repressor EZH2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2). Overall, our study highlights the essential role of PCAT6 in NSCLC, suggesting that PCAT6 might be a potent therapeutic target for patients with NSCLC.",

Metformin is a drug commonly used in the treatment of diabetes and with anticancer activity.

The cellular proliferation was detected by CCK8 and MTT. The cell migration and invasion growth were analyzed by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The activities of promoter were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation detected the combining ability of IRF-1 and 5\u2032UTR-YAP.Our immunohistochemistry staining and RT-PCR assays showed that the expression of YAP was higher in lung carcinoma samples. Interestingly, metformin was able to downregulate YAP mRNA and protein expression in lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, we found that metformin depressed YAP promoter by competing with the binding of the transcription factor IRF-1 in lung cancer cells. Moreover, combination of metformin and verteporfin synergistically inhibits cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis and suppresses cell migration/invasion by downregulating YAP, therefore reduces the side effects caused by their single use and improve the quality of life for patients with lung cancer.we concluded that metformin depresses YAP promoter by interfering with the binding of the transcription factor IRF-1.

In addition, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis together with microtubule disassembly and mitochondrial translocation of phosphorylated MAP4 was detected prior to the onset of cardiac remodeling, and p38/MAPK was demonstrated to be the possible signaling pathway that mediated MAP4 (S737 and S760) phosphorylation.Our data reveal for the first time that MAP4 drives pathological cardiac remodeling through its phosphorylation.

     "abstract": "C4d is a specific biomarker for the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) after cardiac transplantation. Although strongly recommended, routine C4d surveillance is hindered by the invasive nature of endomyocardial biopsy. Targeted ultrasound (US) has high sensitivity, and C4d is abundantly expressed within the graft of patients experiencing AMR, which makes it possible to visualize C4d deposition in vivo using targeted US.We designed a serial dilution of C4d-targeted microbubbles (MBC4d) using a streptavidin-biotin conjugation system. A rat model of AMR with C4d deposition was established by pre-sensitization with skin transplantation before cardiac transplantation. MBC4d were injected into recipients and then qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using the destruction-replenishment method with a clinical US imaging system and analyzed by software.We successfully obtained qualitative images of C4d deposition in a wide cardiac allograft section, which, for the first time, reflected real-time C4d distribution. Moreover, normal intensity difference was used for quantitative analysis and exhibited an almost nearly linear correlation with the grade of C4d deposition according to the pathologic evidence. In addition, MBC4d injection did not affect the survival and aggravate injury, which demonstrates its safety.This study demonstrates a noninvasive, quantitative and safe evaluation method for C4d. As contrast-enhanced US has been widely used in clinical settings, this technology is expected to be applied quickly to clinical practice.National Natural Science Foundation of China and Guangdong Province, Leading Scientific Talents of Guangdong special support program, the Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City.",

However, the industrial production of SAA is limited due to low yields. In addition, the direct targets of SAA are unknown. Here we explore cardioprotective mechanisms and targets of SAA in the cardiovascular system.Transgelin and actin were identified as targets of SAA using a chemical biology method and were validated by Biacore analysis, microscale thermophoresis and single-molecule imaging. Studies of transgelin (\u2212/\u2212) knockout mice further verify the target. Cardioprotective mechanisms and targets of SAA were studied in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells and transgenic mice.In WT mice, SAA targeted transgelin and had a protective effect on myocardium but did not have the same protective effect on transgelin (\u2212/\u2212) mice. SAA stabilizes the transgelin-actin complex, modulates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, facilitates F-actin bundling, further enhances the contractility and blood flows of coronary arteries, and improves outcomes of myocardial ischemia. Based on the target, a more active SAA derivative offering myocardial protection, SAA-30, was obtained.We report on the direct targets of SAA and mechanisms of myocardial ischemia treatment. We also find that transgelin may act as a novel therapeutic target of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, a more effective derivative of SAA provides the basis for further clinical translational research.",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in ER resulting in a cellular stress response. The role of ER stress in AKI-CKD transition remains unknown.In this study, we examined ER stress in the mouse model of AKI-CKD transition after unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (uIR). To determine the role of ER stress in AKI-CKD transition, we tested the effects of two chemical chaperones: Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA).uIR led to the induction of ER stress in kidneys, as indicated by increased expression of UPR molecules CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) and BiP(binding immunoglobulin protein; also called GRP78\u201378\u202fkDa glucose\u00adregulated protein). Given at 3\u202fdays after uIR, both TUDCA and 4-PBA blocked ER stress in post-ischemic kidneys. Notably, both chemicals promoted renal recovery and suppressed tubulointerstitial injury as manifested by the reduction of tubular atrophy, renal fibrosis and myofibroblast activation. Inhibition of ER stress further attenuated renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, inflammation and autophagy in post-ischemic kidneys.These findings suggest that ER stress contributes critically to the development of chronic kidney pathologies and CKD following AKI, and inhibition of ER stress may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to impede AKI-CKD transition.",

We tested the hypothesis that CKD activates a broad reflex response from the kidneys and the white adipose tissue to impair peripheral glucose uptake and investigated the role of salt intake in this process.5/6-nephrectomized rats were administered normal- or high-salt for 3\u202fweeks. Conclusions were tested in 100 non-diabetic patients with stage 3\u20135 CKD.High-salt in 5/6-nephrectomized rats decreased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake >25% via a sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reflex that linked the IR to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in brain and peripheral tissues. Salt-loading in CKD enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and enhanced the impairment of insulin signaling and Glut4 trafficking. Denervation of the kidneys or adipose tissue or deafferentation of adipose tissue improved IR >40%. In patients with non-diabetic CKD, IR was positively correlated with salt intake after controlling for cofounders (r\u202f=\u202f0.334, P\u202f=\u202f0.001) and was linked to activation of the RAS/SNS and to impaired glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, all of which depended on salt intake.CKD engages a renal/adipose-cerebral-peripheral sympathetic reflex that activates the RAS/ROS axes to promote IR via local inflammation and impaired Glut4 trafficking that are enhanced by high-salt intake.

We sought to determine (1) whether abnormally increased blood BAs in liver cirrhotic patients with HE is caused by elevation of apical sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT)-mediated BA reabsorption; and (2) whether increased BA reabsorption would exacerbate ammonia-induced brain injuries.We quantitatively measured blood BA and ammonia levels in liver cirrhosis patients with or without HE and healthy controls. We characterized ASBT expression, BA profiles, and ammonia concentrations in a chronic liver disease (CLD) mouse model induced by streptozotocin-high fat diet (STZ-HFD) and an azoxymethane (AOM) - induced acute liver failure (ALF) mouse model. These two mouse models were treated with SC-435 (ASBT inhibitor) and budesonide (ASBT activator), respectively.Blood concentrations of ammonia and conjugated BAs were substantially increased in cirrhotic patients with HE (n\u202f=\u202f75) compared to cirrhotic patients without HE (n\u202f=\u202f126). Pharmacological inhibition of the enterohepatic BA circulation using a luminal- restricted ASBT inhibitor, SC-435, in mice with AOM-induced ALF and STZ-HFD -induced CLD effectively reduced BA and ammonia concentrations in the blood and brain, and alleviated liver and brain damages. Budesonide treatment induced liver and brain damages in normal mice, and exacerbated these damages in AOM-treated mice.ASBT mediated BA reabsorption increases intestinal luminal pH and facilitates conversion of intestinal ammonium to ammonia, leading to abnormally high levels of neurotoxic ammonia and cytotoxic BAs in the blood and brain. Inhibition of intestinal ASBT with SC-435 can effectively remove neurotoxic BAs and ammonia from the bloodstream and thus, mitigate liver and brain injuries resulting from liver failure.",

Here we investigated the functional role of miR-221/222 and the therapeutic effects of antimiRs-221/222 in NASH mouse models.We generated the miR-221/222flox/flox mice on a C57BL/6\u202fJ background and the hepatic miR-221/222 knockout (miR-221/222-LKO) mice. The mice were challenged with the methionine and choline deficient diet (MCDD) or chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment to generate experimental steatohepatitis models. Adenovirus-mediated re-expression of miR-221/222 was performed on the MCDD-fed miR-221/222-LKO mice. The MCDD and control diet-fed mice were treated with locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based antimiRs of miR-221/222 to evaluate the therapeutic effects. Histological analysis, RNA-seq, quantitative PCR and Western blot of liver tissues were carried out to study the hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and collagen deposition in mouse models.Hepatic deletion of miR-221/222 resulted in significant reduction of liver fibrosis, lipid deposition and inflammatory infiltration in the MCDD-fed and CCl4-treated mouse models. The hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were dramatically aggravated by miR-221/222 re-expression in MCDD-fed miR-221/222-LKO mice. AntimiRs of miR-221/222 could effectively reduce the MCDD-mediated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Systematically mechanistic study revealed that hepatic miR-221/222 controlled the expression of target gene Timp3 and promoted the progression of NASH.Our findings demonstrate that miR-221/222 are crucial for the regulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis in the liver.

Although pro-apoptotic mechanisms have been extensively explored, less is known about the hepatocyte-specific anti-apoptotic molecular events and it lacks effective approach to combat hepatocyte apoptosis. We investigated the anti-apoptotic effect and mechanism of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and strategies of how to target FXR for inhibiting apoptosis implicated in liver fibrosis.Sensitivity to apoptosis was compared between wild type and Fxr\u2212/\u2212 mice and in cultured cells. Cell-based and cell-free assays were employed to identify the binding protein of FXR and to uncover the mechanism of its anti-apoptotic effect. Overexpression of FXR by adenovirus-FXR was employed to determine its anti-fibrotic effect in CCl4-treated mice. Specimens from fibrotic patients were collected to validate the relevance of FXR on apoptosis/fibrosis.FXR deficiency sensitizes hepatocytes to death receptors (DRs)-engaged apoptosis. FXR overexpression, but not FXR ligands, inhibits apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptotic stimuli lead to drastic reduction of FXR protein levels, a prerequisite for DRs-engaged apoptosis. Mechanistically, FXR interacts with caspase 8 (CASP8) in the cytoplasm, thus preventing the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of CASP8. Adenovirus-FXR transfection impedes liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mice. Specimens from fibrotic patients are characterized with reduced FXR expression and compromised FXR/CASP8 colocalization.FXR represents an intrinsic apoptosis inhibitor in hepatocytes and can be targeted via restoring its expression or strengthening FXR/CASP8 interaction for inhibiting hepatocytes apoptosis in liver fibrosis.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

This was done firstly in two mouse strains (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) to determine the temporal expression profiles in serum over the course of S. japonicum infection, and then within a cohort of 163 schistosomiasis japonica patients with different grades of liver fibrosis.Four miRNAs (miR-150-5p, let-7a-5p, let-7d-5p and miR-146a-5p) were able to distinguish patients with mild versus severe fibrosis. The level of serum miR-150-5p showed the most promising potential for grading hepatic fibrosis in schistosomiasis. The diagnostic performance of miR-150-5p in discriminating mild from severe fibrosis is comparable with that of the ELF test and serum HA level. In addition, the serum levels of the four miRNAs rebounded in infected C57BL/6 mice, after 6\u202fmonths post treatment, following the regression of liver fibrosis, thereby providing further support for the utility of these miRNAs in grading schistosomal hepatic fibrosis.Circulating miRNAs can be a supplementary tool for assessing hepatic fibrosis in human schistosomiasis.National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia (APP1102926, APP1037304 and APP1098244).",

Findings of numerous transmission clusters, mixed-genotype infections and rapid succession of infections with different HCV strains indicate a high rate of HCV spread.

Relative abundances of four genera (Finegoldia, Anaerococcus, Sneathia, and Adlercreutzia) were lower in women with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (all P\u202f<\u202f.01). In women with diabetes, plasma levels of several metabolites in tryptophan catabolism (e,g., kynurenine/tryptophan ratio), branched-chain amino acid and proline metabolism pathways were higher, while glycerophospholipids were lower (all P\u202f<\u202f.05). Results were generally consistent between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, and no significant modification effects by HIV serostatus were observed (all Pinteraction\u202f>\u202f0.05). Anaerococcus, known to produce butyrate which is involved in anti-inflammation and glucose metabolism, showed an inverse correlation with kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.38, P\u202f<\u202f.01).Among women with or at high risk for HIV infection, diabetes is associated with gut microbiota and plasma metabolite alteration, including depletion of butyrate-producing bacterial population along with higher tryptophan catabolism.NHLBI (K01HL129892, R01HL140976) and FMF.",

We aimed to explore the potential genetic influence of Toll-like receptor (TLR) on non-HIV CM.This observational cohort study was done in two stages: a discovery stage and a validation stage. A case-control genetic association study was conducted between 159 non-HIV CM patients and 468 healthy controls. TLR SNPs significantly related to susceptibility went further validation in a second cohort of 583 subjects from a certain district. Associations among TLR SNPs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine concentrations, and clinical severity were explored in a third cohort of 99 previously untreated non-HIV CM patients. Logistic regression model was used to determine the independent predictors for disease severity.In the discovery stage, eight TLR SNPs exhibited significant genetic susceptibility to non-HIV CM, one of which was validated in a population validation of HIV-infected cases while none survived in non-HIV cases. CSF cytokine detections showed that 18 cytokines were significantly over-expressed in severely ill patients. Two of the 8 SNPs (rs5743604 and rs3804099) were also significantly associated with disease severity. Specifically, the rs3804099 C/T genotype was further found to be correlated to 12 of the 18 up-regulated cytokines in severe patients. In addition, high levels of interleukin (IL)-10 in CSF (OR 2\u00b797, 95% CI 1\u00b749\u20135\u00b790; p\u202f=\u202f0\u00b7002) was suggested as an independent predictor for severity after adjusted for possible confounders.TLR participates in both the occurrence and the pathogenesis of non-HIV CM.

     "abstract": "Tracking recent transmission is a vital part of controlling widespread pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Multiple methods with specific performance characteristics exist for detecting recent transmission chains, usually by clustering strains based on genotype similarities. With such a large variety of methods available, informed selection of an appropriate approach for determining transmissions within a given setting/time period is difficult.This study combines whole genome sequence (WGS) data derived from 324 isolates collected 2005\u20132010 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a high endemic setting, with phylodynamics to unveil the timing of transmission events posited by a variety of standard genotyping methods. Clustering data based on Spoligotyping, 24-loci MIRU-VNTR typing, WGS based SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) typing were evaluated.Our results suggest that clusters based on Spoligotyping could encompass transmission events that occurred almost 200\u202fyears prior to sampling while 24-loci-MIRU-VNTR often represented three decades of transmission. Instead, WGS based genotyping applying low SNP or cgMLST allele thresholds allows for determination of recent transmission events, e.g. in timespans of up to 10\u202fyears for a 5 SNP/allele cut-off.With the rapid uptake of WGS methods in surveillance and outbreak tracking, the findings obtained in this study can guide the selection of appropriate clustering methods for uncovering relevant transmission chains within a given time-period. For high resolution cluster analyses, WGS-SNP and cgMLST based analyses have similar clustering/timing characteristics even for data obtained from a high incidence setting.",

Previous reports showed that IL-20 cytokines (IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24) are induced and have an immuno-regulatory function during cutaneous infection. In the current study, our aim was to demonstrate the implication of IL-20 cytokines and their receptors and their role during experimental pneumococcal infection.C57BL/6 mice were infected with S. pneumoniae by intranasal route. The bacterial burden, the immune response and the cytokine production were evaluated after treatment with an anti-IL-20 receptor-b (IL-20Rb) neutralizing antibody (anti-IL-20Rb).Of interest, expression of IL-20 cytokines mRNA and protein were transiently increased in the lung tissue during infection. Blocking of the IL-20Rb decreased the bacterial burden both in the bronchoalveolar lavage and the lung whereas there was no significant drop in the blood. This treatment also reduced the pulmonary damages (as shown by the alveolar wall thickening), the recruitment of neutrophils and dendritic cells, and the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the lung. Administration of the anti-IL-20Rb antibody enhanced the synthesis of the antibacterial peptide LCN2. However, this effect is transient and did not affect the survival of the infected mice.Collectively, this study highlights the implication of IL-20 related cytokines during lung infection by S. pneumoniae and might have therapeutic applications in bacterial pneumonia.This work was supported by CNRS, INSERM, INSERM-transfert, the University of Lille and the Fondation du Souffle (Paris, France).",

The products of L. interrogans vwa-I and vwa-II genes contain vWF-A domains, but their ability to induce hemorrhage has not been determined.Human (Hu)-platelet- and Hu-GPIb\u03b1-binding abilities of the recombinant proteins expressed by L. interrogans strain Lai vwa-I and vwa-II genes (rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II) were detected by flowcytometry, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Hu-platelet aggregation and its signaling kinases and active components were detected by lumiaggregometry, Western analysis, spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy. Hu-GPIb\u03b1-binding sites in rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II were identified by SPR/ITC measurements.Both rLep-vWA-I and rLep-vWA-II were able to bind to Hu-platelets and inhibit rHu-vWF/ristocetin-induced Hu-platelet aggregation, but Hu-GPIb\u03b1-IgG, rLep-vWA-I-IgG and rLep-vWA-II-IgG blocked this binding or inhibition.

One possible reason behind this conundrum is that the bases of clinical variability in malaria caused by either species are complex and poorly understood.Whole-genome transcriptome was analyzed to identify the active and predominant pathways in the PBMC of P. falciparum and P. vivax infected malaria patients. Deregulated genes were identified and annotated using R Bioconductor and DAVID/KEGG respectively. Genetic and functional regulation of CD14, a prioritized candidate, were established by quantitative RT-PCR, genotyping using RFLP and resequencing, mapping of transcription factor binding using CONSITE and TFBIND, dual luciferase assay, western blot analysis, RNAi- mediated gene knockdown and chromatin-immunoprecipation.The study highlighted that deregulation of host immune and inflammatory genes particularly CD14 as a key event in P. falciparum malaria. An abundance of allele-C of rs5744454, located in CD14 promoter, in severe malaria motivated us to establish an allele-specific regulation of CD14 by SP1. An enhancement of SP1 and CD14 expression was observed in artemisinin treated human monocyte cell line.Our data not only reinstates that CD14 of TLR pathway plays a predominant role in P. falciparum malaria, it establishes a functional basis for genetic association of rs5744454 with P. falciparum severe malaria by demonstrating a cis-regulatory role of this promoter polymorphism.

Existing approved or investigational AD drugs did not target products of any of these 67 genes. Drugs for other indications targeted 11 of these genes, including immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs targeting PTK2B gene products.Approved and investigational AD drugs are not targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD.

In this work, we aimed to extend previous studies to explore the internal mediation pathway among genetic factor, brain features and cognitive scores in a large Chinese dataset.Gray matter (GM) volume, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and 4522 schizophrenia-susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 905 Chinese subjects were jointly analyzed, to investigate the multimodal association. Based on the identified imaging-genetic pattern, correlations with cognition and mediation analysis were then conducted to reveal the potential mediation pathways.One linked imaging-genetic pattern was identified to be group discriminative, which was also associated with working memory performance. Particularly, GM reduction in thalamus, putamen and bilateral temporal gyrus in schizophrenia was associated with fALFF decrease in medial prefrontal cortex, both were also associated with genetic factors enriched in neuron development, synapse organization and axon pathways, highlighting genes including CSMD1, CNTNAP2, DCC, GABBR2 etc. This linked pattern was also replicated in an independent cohort (166 subjects), which although showed certain age and clinical differences with the discovery cohort. A further mediation analysis suggested that GM alterations significantly mediated the association from SNP to fALFF, while fALFF mediated the association from SNP and GM to working memory performance.This study has not only verified the impaired imaging-genetic association in schizophrenia, but also initially revealed a potential genetic-brain-cognition mediation pathway, indicating that polygenic risk factors could exert impact on phenotypic measures from brain structure to function, thus could further affect cognition in schizophrenia.",

Effective approaches to modify this imbalance and reinstate non-drug reward responsiveness are urgently needed. Here, we examined whether cocaine users (CU) can use mental imagery of non-drug rewards to self-regulate the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra (VTA/SN). We expected that obsessive and compulsive thoughts about cocaine consumption would hamper the ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN activity and tested if real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback (NFB) can improve self-regulation of the VTA/SN.Twenty-two CU and 28 healthy controls (HC) were asked to voluntarily up-regulate VTA/SN activity with non-drug reward imagery alone, or combined with rtfMRI NFB.On a group level, HC and CU were able to activate the dopaminergic midbrain and other reward regions with reward imagery. In CU, the individual ability to self-regulate the VTA/SN was reduced in those with more severe obsessive-compulsive drug use. NFB enhanced the effect of reward imagery but did not result in transfer effects at the end of the session.CU can voluntary activate their reward system with non-drug reward imagery and improve this ability with rtfMRI NFB. Combining mental imagery and rtFMRI NFB has great potential for modifying the maladapted reward sensitivity and reinstating non-drug reward responsiveness. This motivates further work to examine the use of rtfMRI NFB in the treatment of CUD.",

Yet, the precise molecular mechanism and pathways by which the short form of ITI-H4 carries out its function remain obscure.Human sera and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) were collected from patients and normal controls to compare the expression levels of ITI-H4 and plasma kallikrein (KLKB1). Flow cytometric assay was performed to measure inflammatory markers in sera and culture supernatants. Furthermore, to investigate the functions of the two isoforms of ITI-H4, we performed migration, invasion, and proliferation assays.In the current study, we showed that ITI-H4 as a biomarker of RPL could be regulated by KLKB1 through the IL-6 signaling cascade, indicating a novel regulatory system for inflammation in RPL. In addition, our study indicates that the two isoforms of ITI-H4 possess opposing functions on immune response, trophoblast invasion, and monocytes migration or proliferation.The ITI-H4 (\u2206N688) might be a crucial inflammatory factor which contributes to the pathogenesis of RPL.

     "abstract": "Trauma experienced during surgery can contribute to the development of a systemic inflammatory response that can cause multi-organ dysfunction or even failure. Post-surgical neuroinflammation is a documented phenomenon that results in synaptic impairment, neuronal dysfunction and death, and impaired neurogenesis. Various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, maintain a state of chronic neuroinflammation, manifesting as post-operative cognitive dysfunction and post-operative delirium. Furthermore, elderly patients with post-operative cognitive dysfunction or delirium are three times more likely to experience permanent cognitive impairment or dementia. We conducted a narrative review, considering evidence extracted from various databases including Pubmed, MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as journals and book reference lists. We found that further pre-clinical and well-powered clinical studies are required to delineate the precise pathogenesis of post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Despite the burden of post-operative neurological sequelae, clinical studies investigating therapeutic agents, such as dexmedetomidine, ibuprofen and statins, have yielded conflicting results. In addition, evidence supporting novel therapeutic avenues, such as nicotinic and HMGB-1 targeting and remote ischaemic pre-conditioning, is limited and necessitates further investigation.",

Senescent cells have been demonstrated to play a causal role in driving aging and age-related diseases using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. We previously demonstrated that the combination of dasatinib and the flavonoid quercetin is a potent senolytic improving numerous age-related conditions including frailty, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to identify flavonoids with more potent senolytic activity.A panel of flavonoid polyphenols was screened for senolytic activity using senescent murine and human fibroblasts, driven by oxidative and genotoxic stress, respectively. The top senotherapeutic flavonoid was tested in mice modeling a progeroid syndrome carrying a p16INK4a-luciferase reporter and aged wild-type mice to determine the effects of fisetin on senescence markers, age-related histopathology, disease markers, health span and lifespan. Human adipose tissue explants were used to determine if results translated.Of the 10 flavonoids tested, fisetin was the most potent senolytic. Acute or intermittent treatment of progeroid and old mice with fisetin reduced senescence markers in multiple tissues, consistent with a hit-and-run senolytic mechanism. Fisetin reduced senescence in a subset of cells in murine and human adipose tissue, demonstrating cell-type specificity. Administration of fisetin to wild-type mice late in life restored tissue homeostasis, reduced age-related pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan.The natural product fisetin has senotherapeutic activity in mice and in human tissues. Late life intervention was sufficient to yield a potent health benefit.

     "abstract": "Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been the very frequently used as animal models in the study of human lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, because they have similar lipoprotein metabolism to humans. Most of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis rabbit models are produced by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet. Gene editing or knockout (KO) offered another means of producing rabbit models for study of the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. Even so, apolipoprotein (Apo)E KO rabbits must be fed a high-cholesterol diet to induce hyperlipidemia.In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system anchored exon 7 of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in an attempt to generate KO rabbits. We designed two sgRNA sequences located in E7:g.7055\u20137074 and E7:g.7102\u20137124 of rabbit LDLR gene, respectively. Seven LDLR-KO founder rabbits were generated, and all of them contained biallelic modifications. Various mutational LDLR amino acid sequences of the 7 founder rabbits were subjected to tertiary structure modeling with SWISS-MODEL, and results showed that the structure of EGF-A domain of each protein differs from the wild-type. All the founder rabbits spontaneously developed hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis on a normal chow (NC) diet. Analysis of their plasma lipids and lipoproteins at the age of 12\u202fweeks revealed that all these KO rabbits exhibited markedly increased levels of plasma TC (the highest of which was 1013.15\u202fmg/dl, 20-fold higher than wild-type rabbits), LDL-C (the highest of which was 730.00\u202fmg/dl, 35-fold higher than wild-type rabbits) and TG accompanied by reduced HDL-C levels. Pathological examinations of a founder rabbit showed prominent aortic atherosclerosis lesions and coronary artery atherosclerosis.In conclusion, we have reported the generation LDLR-KO rabbit model for the study of spontaneous hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis on a NC diet. The LDLR-KO rabbits should be a useful rabbit model of human familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) for the simulations of human primary hypercholesterolemia and such models would allow more exact research into cardio-cerebrovascular disease.",

The phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a key event for the initiation and progression of neointimal formation and TA. This study aims to explore the role and underlying mechanism of phosphoinositide 3-kinases \u03b3 (PI3K\u03b3) in VSMC phenotypic modulation and TA.The rat model of aortic transplantation was established to detect PI3K\u03b3 expression and its role in neointimal formation and vascular remodeling in vivo. PI3K\u03b3 shRNA transfection was employed to knockdown PI3K\u03b3 gene. Aortic VSMCs was cultured and treated with TNF-\u03b1 to explore the role and molecular mechanism of PI3K\u03b3 in VSMC phenotypic modulation.Activated PI3K\u03b3/p-Akt signaling was observed in aortic allografts and in TNF-\u03b1-treated VSMCs. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA transfection effectively inhibited PI3K\u03b3 expression in medial VSMCs while restoring the expression of VSMC contractile genes, associated with impaired neointimal formation in aortic allografts. In cultured VSMCs, PI3K\u03b3 blockade with pharmacological inhibitor or genetic knockdown markedly abrogated TNF-\u03b1-induced downregulation of VSMC contractile genes and increase in cellular proliferation and migration. Moreover, SOX9 located in nucleus competitively inhibited the interaction of Myocardin and SRF, while PI3K\u03b3 inhibition robustly reduced SOX9 expression and its nuclear translocation and repaired the Myocardin/SRF association.These results suggest that PI3K\u03b3 plays a critical role in VSMC phenotypic modulation via a SOX9-dependent mechanism. Therefore, PI3K\u03b3 in VSMCs may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of TA.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

     "abstract": "Recent evidence has indicated that the transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is expressed in the cardiovascular system and implicated in the development and progression of several cardiovascular diseases. However, the effects of TRPA1 on cardiac hypertrophy development remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the role of TRPA1 in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis development.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and were orally treated with the TRPA1 selective inhibitors HC-030031 (HC) and TCS-5861528 (TCS). Morphological assessments, echocardiographic parameters, histological analyses and flow cytometry were used to evaluate cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.Human and mouse hypertrophic hearts presented with noticeably increased TRPA1 protein levels. Inhibition of TRPA1 by HC and TCS attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and preserved cardiac function after chronic pressure overload, as evidenced by increased heart weight/body weight ratio, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and mRNA expression of hypertrophic markers, including ANP, BNP and \u03b2-MHC. Dramatic interstitial fibrosis was observed in the mice subjected to TAC surgery, and this was markedly attenuated in the HC and TCS treated mice. Mechanistically, the results revealed that TRPA1 inhibition ameliorated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy by negatively regulating Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin signaling pathways. We also demonstrated that blocking TRPA1 decreased the proportion of M2 macrophages and reduced profibrotic cytokine levels, thereby improving cardiac fibrosis.TRPA1 inhibition protected against cardiac hypertrophy and suppressed cardiac dysfunction via Ca2+-dependent signal pathways and inhibition of the M2 macrophages transition. These results suggest that TRPA1 may represent a potential therapeutic drug target for cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.",

IBIS-3 analyzed lesions in a non-culprit coronary artery with <50% stenosis using radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound (RF-IVUS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Imaging was repeated after a median of 386\u202fdays on rosuvastatin. Associations of antibodies with incident CHD and imaging parameters were assessed in the two sub-studies respectively.From 10,881 NORDIL patients, 87 had serum sampled at baseline and developed CHD over 4.5\u202fyears, matched to 227 controls.

Therefore, the effect was explored at the lesional level in IBIS-3. 143 patients had blood samples and RF-IVUS measurements available, and NIRS was performed in 90 of these. At baseline, IgM anti-MDA-LDL levels had a strong independent inverse relationship with lesional necrotic core volume (p\u202f=\u202f0.027) and percentage of plaque occupied by necrotic core (p\u202f=\u202f0.011), as well as lipid core burden index (p\u202f=\u202f0.024) in the worst 4\u202fmm segment.Our study supports the hypothesis that lower circulating levels of IgM anti-MDA-LDL are associated with clinical CHD development, and for the first time relates these findings to atherosclerotic plaque characteristics that are linked to vulnerability.",

Although a number of innovative systems have been reported that transform mobile phones into potential diagnostic tools, the translational challenge to clinical diagnostics remains a significant hurdle to overcome.A smartphone-based real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (smaRT-LAMP) system was developed for pathogen ID in urinary sepsis patients. The free, custom-built mobile phone app allows the phone to serve as a stand-alone device for quantitative diagnostics, allowing the determination of genome copy-number of bacterial pathogens in real time.A head-to-head comparative bacterial analysis of urine from sepsis patients revealed that the performance of smaRT-LAMP matched that of clinical diagnostics at the admitting hospital in a fraction of the time (~1\u202fh vs. 18\u201328\u202fh). Among patients with bacteremic complications of their urinary sepsis, pathogen ID from the urine matched that from the blood \u2013 potentially allowing pathogen diagnosis shortly after hospital admission. Additionally, smaRT-LAMP did not exhibit false positives in sepsis patients with clinically negative urine cultures.The smaRT-LAMP system is effective against diverse Gram-negative and -positive pathogens and biological specimens, costs less than $100 US to fabricate (in addition to the smartphone), and is configurable for the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. SmaRT-LAMP thus offers the potential to deliver rapid diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections and urinary sepsis with a simple test that can be performed at low cost at the point-of-care.National Institutes of Health, Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) usually have the advantages of single dose, rapid onset of immunity, and durable protection. DNA vaccines have the advantages of chemical stability, ease of production, and no cold chain requirement. The ability to combine the strengths of LAV and DNA vaccines may transform future vaccine development by eliminating cold chain and cell culture with the potential for adventitious agents.A DNA-launched LAV was developed for ZIKV virus (ZIKV), a pathogen that recently caused a global public health emergency. The cDNA copy of a ZIKV LAV genome was engineered into a DNA plasmid. The DNA-LAV plasmid was delivered into mice using a clinically proven device TriGrid\u2122 to launch the replication of LAV.A single-dose immunization as low as 0.5\u202f\u03bcg of DNA-LAV plasmid conferred 100% seroconversion in A129 mice. All seroconverted mice developed sterilizing immunity, as indicated by no detectable infectious viruses and no increase of neutralizing antibody titers after ZIKV challenge. The immunization also elicited robust T cell responses. In pregnant mice, the DNA-LAV vaccination fully protected against ZIKV-induced disease and maternal-to-fetal transmission. High levels of neutralizing activities were detected in fetal serum, indicating maternal-to-fetal humoral transfer. In male mice, a single-dose vaccination completely prevented testis infection, injury, and oligospermia.The remarkable simplicity and potency of ZIKV DNA-LAV warrant further development of this vaccine candidate.

We here investigated the effect of mutations within the epitopes on HLA-B*35:01-restricted CD8+ T cells having abilities to suppress HIV-1 replication.We analyzed 16 HLA-B*35:01-restricted epitope-specific T cells in 63 HIV-1 clade B-infected Japanese B*35:01+ individuals and identified HLA-B*35:01-restricted CD8+ T cells having abilities to suppress HIV-1 replication. We further analyzed the effect of HLA-associated mutations on the ability of these T cells.The breadth of T cell responses to 4 epitopes was inversely associated with plasma viral load (pVL). However, the accumulation of an Y135F mutation in NefYF9 out of the 4 epitopes, which is selected by HLA-A*24:02-restricted T cells, affected the ability of YF9-specific T cells to suppress HIV-1 replication. HLA-B*35:01+ individuals harboring this mutation had much higher pVL than those without it. YF9-specific T cells failed to suppress replication of the Y135F mutant in vitro. These results indicate that this mutation impairs suppression of HIV-1 replication by YF9-specific T cells.These findings indicate that the Y135F mutation is a key factor underlying the detrimental effect of HLA-B*35:01 on disease outcomes in HIV-1 clade B-infected individuals.Grants-in-aid for AIDS Research from AMED and for scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, Japan.",

Here we describe different methods to quantify the HIV reservoir.We developed an optimized quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) to quantify the frequency of cells harboring replication-competent HIV, which is simpler and more sensitive than classical QVOAs. We also developed new inducible RNA assays that concomitantly measure the frequency of cell-associated [ca-] (gag and tat-rev) and cell-free [cf-] HIV RNA after three days of anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation.The median frequency of the infected cells measured after induction was 94 IQR[60\u2013132], 16 IQR [9\u201329] and 2.9 IQR[1.9\u20136.8] cells/106 CD4+ T-cells for ca-RNA gag and tat-rev, and cf-RNA, respectively. There are a large proportion of transcription-competent proviruses (ca-RNA) that seemed unable to form complete virions (cf-RNA), suggesting post-transcriptional blocks or defective proviruses. Importantly, the median frequency of infected CD4+ T-cells as estimated by 3-day inducible cf-RNA assay was not statistically different from the frequency measured by the QVOA (median of 3.3 [1.9\u20136.2] IUPM). The latently infected cells detected by the inducible cf-RNA assay correlated highly with the QVOA (\u202fr=\u202f0.67, p\u202f<\u202f.001), and both assays were equivalent in 60% of the samples tested, suggesting that most cells induced to produce virions are generating replication-competent virus.These inducible RNA assays provide more sensitivity and a greater dynamic range for the monitoring of reduction of the reservoir by eradication strategies.

In such cases, drug-induced hepatotoxicity is often thought to be the primary cause of the observed liver injury, and this can be a major concern in antimalaria drug development. We investigated liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in patients with imported uncomplicated malaria, and in Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) studies.Clinical and laboratory data from 484 imported malaria cases and 254 CHMI participants were obtained from the Rotterdam Malaria Cohort database, and the Radboud University Medical Center database (between 2001 and 2017), respectively. Routine clinical LFTs, clinical profiles, parasite densities, hematological, and inflammation parameters were assessed in 217 patients with imported falciparum malaria upon admission, and from longitudinal data of 187 CHMI participants.Upon admission, the proportion of patients with imported uncomplicated malaria and elevated liver enzymes was 128/186 (69%). In CHMI, 97/187 (52%) participants showed LFT abnormalities, including mild (64%, >1.0\u202f\u2264\u202f2.5\u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN)), moderate (20%, >2.5\u202f\u2264\u202f5.0xULN) or severe (16%, >5.0xULN). LFT abnormalities were primarily ALT/AST elevations and to a lesser extent \u03b3GT and ALP. LFT abnormalities peaked shortly after initiation of treatment, regardless of drug regimen, and returned to normal within three to six weeks.

This study was aimed to determine the effects and mechanisms of AMSC-derived exosomes (AMSC-Exo) for acute liver failure (ALF) treatment.AMSC-Exo were intravenously administrated into the mice immediately after lipopolysaccharide and D-galactosamine (LPS/GalN)-exposure and their effects were evaluated by liver histological and serum biochemical analysis. To elucidate its mechanisms in ALF therapy, the expression levels of miRNAs and inflammasome-related genes in macrophages were evaluated by qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. The exosomes from miR-17-knockdowned AMSCs (AMSC-ExomiR-17-KD) were used for further determine the role of miR-17 in AMSC-Exo-based therapy.AMSC-Exo administration significantly ameliorated ALF as determined by reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels and hepatic inflammasome activation. Further experiments revealed that AMSC-Exo were colocalized with hepatic macrophages and could reduce inflammatory factor secretion by suppressing inflammasome activation in macrophages. Moreover, miR-17, which can suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation by targeting TXNIP, was abundant in AMSC-Exo cargo. While, the therapeutic effects of AMSC-ExomiR-17-KD on ALF were significantly abolished as they could not effectively suppress TXNIP expression and consequent inflammasome activation in vitro and in vivo.Interpretation: Exosome-shuttled miR-17 plays an essential role in AMSC-Exo therapy for ALF by targeting TXNIP and suppressing inflammasome activation in hepatic macrophages. AMSC-Exo-based therapy may present as a promising approach for TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome-related inflammatory liver diseases.Key R&D projects of Zhejiang province (2018C03019) and National Natural Science Fund (81470851 and 81500616).",

This study aims to develop and validate a radiomics-based model as a noninvasive method for accurate detection of CSPH in cirrhosis.The prospective multicenter diagnostic trial (CHESS1701, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03138915) involved 385 patients with cirrhosis from five liver centers in China between August 2016 and September 2017. Patients who had both HVPG measurement and contrast-enhanced CT within 14\u202fdays prior to the catheterization were collected. The noninvasive radiomics model, termed rHVPG for CSPH was developed based on CT images in a training cohort consisted of 222 consecutive patients and the diagnostic performance was prospectively assessed in 163 consecutive patients in four external validation cohorts.rHVPG showed a good performance in detection of CSPH with a C-index of 0\u00b7849 (95%CI: 0\u00b7786\u20130\u00b7911).

     "abstract": "MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a pivotal liver-specific miRNA, is frequently repressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR has been proved to function as an oncogene in multiple cancers including HCC. However, the relationship between HOTAIR and miR-122 in HCC remains largely unknown.We investigated the function of HOTAIR and miR-122 in HCC cell models and a xenograft mouse model. The regulatory network between HOTAIR and miR-122 was further detected following overexpression or knockdown of HOTAIR. DNA methylation status of miR-122 promoter region, as well as expression levels of DNMTs, EZH2 and Cyclin G1 were analyzed.In this study, we found that HOTAIR was highly expressed whereas miR-122 was suppressed in HCC, and HOTAIR negatively regulated miR-122 expression in HCC cells. Furthermore, knockdown of HOTAIR dramatically inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo by upregulating miR-122 expression. Mechanistically, a CpG island was located in the miR-122 promoter region. HOTAIR epigenetically suppressed miR-122 expression via DNMTs-mediated DNA methylation. Moreover, HOTAIR upregulated DNMTs expression via EZH2. In addition, suppression of miR-122 induced by HOTAIR directly reactivated oncogene Cyclin G1 expression. Collectively, our results suggest that HOTAIR epigenetically suppresses miR-122 expression via DNA methylation, leading to activation of Cyclin G1 and promotion of tumorigenicity in HCC, which provide new insight into the mechanism of HOTAIR-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis via suppressing miR-122.",

In this multicenter retrospective analysis, we analyzed the radiomics features of portal venous-phase computed tomography in 1591 consecutive patients. A radiomics signature was generated by using the Lasso-Cox regression model in 228 patients and validated in internal and external validation cohorts. Radiomics nomograms integrating the radiomics signature were constructed, demonstrating the incremental value of the radiomics signature to the traditional staging system for individualized survival estimation. The performance of the nomograms was assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. The radiomics signature consisted of 19 selected features and was significantly associated with DFS (disease-free survival) and OS (overall survival). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the radiomics signature was an independent prognostic factor. Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics-based nomograms resulted in better performance for the estimation of DFS and OS than the clinicopathological nomograms and TNM staging system, with improved accuracy of the classification of survival outcomes. Further analysis showed that stage II and III patients with higher radiomics scores exhibited a favorable response to chemotherapy. In conclusion, the newly developed radiomics signature is a powerful predictor of DFS and OS, and it may predict which patients with stage II and III GC benefit from chemotherapy.",

Systematic analysis of alternative splicing in colorectal cancer (CRC) is lacking and greatly needed.RNA-Seq data and corresponding clinical information of CRC cohort were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. Then, a java application, known as SpliceSeq, was used to evaluate the RNA splicing patterns and calculate the Percent Spliced In (PSI) value. Differently expressed AS events (DEAS) were identified based on PSI value between paired CRC and adjacent tissues. DEAS and its splicing networks were further analyzed by bioinformatics methods. Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional regression and unsupervised clustering analysis were used to evaluate the association between DEAS and patients' clinical features.After strict filtering, a total of 34,334 AS events were identified, among which 421 AS events were found expressed differently. Parent genes of these DEAS play a important role in regulating CRC-related processes such as protein kinase activity (FDR<0.0001), PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (FDR\u202f=\u202f0.0024) and p53 signaling pathway (FDR\u202f=\u202f0.0143). 37 DEAS events were found to be associated with OS, and 68 DEAS events were found to be associated with DFS. Stratifying patients according to the PSI value of AT in CXCL12 and RI in CSTF3 formed significant Kaplan-Meier curves in both OS and DFS survival analysis. Unsupervised clustering analysis using DEAS revealed four clusters with distinct survival patterns, and associated with consensus molecular subtypes.Large differences of AS events in CRC appear to exist, and these differences are likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and biological regulation. Our identified CRC-related AS events and uncovered splicing networks are valuable in deciphering the underlying mechanisms of AS in CRC, and provide clues of therapeutic targets to further validations.",

The heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant LUAD has been an obstacle for the drug discovery.We integrated multiplatform datatypes and identified two corresponding subtypes in the patients and cell lines. We further characterized the features of these two subtypes and performed drug screening to identify subtype-specific drugs. Finally, we used the defining features of the KRAS subtypes for drug sensitivity prediction.Patient-Subtype 1 (PS1) was characterized by increased smoking-related mutational signature activity, a low tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-associating score and STK11/KEAP1 co-mutations. Patient-Subtype 2 (PS2) was characterized by an increased smoking-related methylation signature activity, a high TIL-associating score and increased KRAS dependency. The cell line subtypes faithfully recapitulated all the patients' features. Drug screening of the two cell line subtypes yielded several potential candidates, such as cytarabine and enzastaurin for Cell-line-Subtype 1 (CS1) and a BTK inhibitor QL-XII-61 for Cell-line-Subtype 2 (CS2). The defining features, such as smoking-related methylation signature, were significantly associated with the sensitivity to several drugs.The heterogeneity of KRAS-mutant LUAD is associated with smoking-related genomic and epigenomic aberration along with other features such as immunogenicity, KRAS dependency and STK11/KEAP1 co-mutations.

Our aim was to clarify the role of microRNA encapsulated in the exosomes derived from CAFs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).We examined the microRNA expression profiles of exosomes derived from CAFs and donor-matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from patients with OSCC. We used confocal microscopy to examine the transportation of exosomal miR-34a-5p between CAFs and OSCC cells. Next, luciferase reporter and its mutant plasmids were used to confirm direct target gene of miR-34a-5p. Phenotypic assays and in vivo tumor growth experiments were used to investigate the functional significance of exosomal miR-34a-5p.We found that the expression of miR-34a-5p in CAF-derived exosomes was significantly reduced, and fibroblasts could transfer exosomal miR-34a-5p to OSCC cells. In xenograft experiments, miR-34a-5p overexpression in CAFs could inhibit the tumorigenesis of OSCC cells. We further revealed that miR-34a-5p binds to its direct downstream target AXL to suppress OSCC cell proliferation and metastasis. Stable ectopic expression of AXL in OSCC cells overexpressing miR-34a-5p restored proliferation and motility abolished by the miRNA. The miR-34a-5p/AXL axis promoted OSCC progression via the AKT/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which could induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote cancer cells metastasis.

The prognostic predictors are multifactorial, and there is no validated prognostic model for eyelid SC.This study included 238 consecutive patients with eyelid SC. All eligible patients were followed up for metastasis and mortality. The predictors of tumor-related survival were explored by Cox analyses. A prognostic nomogram was developed and validated using bootstrap resampling. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability were compared between the nomogram and the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system.After a median follow-up period of 55.5\u202fmonths, 27 (11.3%) patients died of metastatic SC, with a median survival time of 48.0\u202fmonths. The 5-year and 10-year tumor-related survival rates were 88.1% and 77.9%, respectively. Orbital involvement (HR: 3.11, p\u202f=\u202f.022), the greatest tumor basal diameter (HR: 1.06, p =\u202f.003), the presence of pagetoid spread (HR: 2.90, p\u202f=\u202f.017), and having lymph node metastasis at initial diagnosis (HR: 13.66, p\u202f<\u202f.001) were independent risk factors for tumor-related death.

Human rhomboid family-1 (RHBDF1) facilitates the secretion of TGF\u03b1, an EGFR ligand, in breast cancer; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We evaluated the role for RHBDF1 in clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV)-dependent pro-TGF\u03b1 membrane trafficking in breast cancer cells upon stimulation by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists.RHBDF1 was silenced in various breast cancer cells using shRNA. TGF\u03b1 levels, subcellular localization, and secretion were evaluated using ELISA, immunofluorescent staining, and coimmunoprecipitation. Phosphorylation and expression of relevant proteins were measured by western blotting. RHBDF1-dependent cell viability and invasion were measured.RHBDF1 mediates GPCR agonist-induced EGFR phosphorylation by promoting TGF\u03b1 secretion in various types of breast cancer cells. RHBDF1 not only mediates ADAM17-dependent shedding of TGF\u03b1, but is essential in membrane trafficking of pro-TGF\u03b1. RHBDF1 silencing results in blocking of clathrin uncoating from CCV, a crucial step for the plasma membrane release of pro-TGF\u03b1. Interaction of RHBDF1 with auxilin-2, a CCV protein, determines the recruitment of HSC70 to CCV to facilitate clathrin uncoating. RHBDF1 function is required for the proliferation and mobility of breast cancer cells upon stimulation by Sphingosine 1 Phosphate (S1P), a GPCR agonist. We demonstrate a significant correlation between RHBDF1 overexpression and EGFR activation in breast cancer tissues.RHBDF1 is an indispensable component of the protein trafficking machinery involved in GPCR-mediated EGFR transactivation, and is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer.National Natural Science Foundation of China (81,672,740 to ZSZ, 81,272,356 and 81,330,029 to LYL).",

Cdc7 has been found overexpressed in human cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, and the knockdown of Cdc7 expression causes an p53-independent apoptosis, suggesting that Cdc7 is a target for cancer therapy. Only a handful Cdc7 kinase inhibitors have been reported. All Cdc7 kinase inhibitors, including PHA-767491, were identified and characterized as ATP-competitive inhibitors. Unfortunately, these ATP-competitive Cdc7 inhibitors have no good effect on clinical trial.Here, we have developed a novel drug-screening platform to interrupt the interaction between Cdc7 and Dbf4 based on Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc)-linked protein-fragment complementation assay (Rluc-PCA). Using drug repositioning approach, we found several promising Cdc7 inhibitors for cancer therapy from a FDA-approved drug library.Our data showed that dequalinium chloride and clofoctol we screened inhibit S phase progression, accumulation in G2/M phase, and Cdc7 kinase activity. In addition, in vivo mice animal study suggests that dequalinium chloride has a promising anti-tumor activity in oral cancer. Interestingly, we also found that dequalinium chloride and clofoctol sensitize the effect of platinum compounds and radiation due to synergistic effect. In conclusion, we identified non-ATP-competitive Cdc7 kinase inhibitors that not only blocks DNA synthesis at the beginning but also sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damage agents.The inhibitors will be a promising anti-cancer agent and enhance the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy and radiation for current cancer therapy.This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan.",

The expression and sub-cellular localization of merlin and p53-MDM2 were assessed by immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to reveal the effects of Nutlin-3 (a MDM2 inhibitor) and/or MG-132(a proteasome inhibitor) on schwannomas. The proliferation of schwannoma cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining and Flow cytometry analysis.Double genetic hits of NF2 tended to occur in fast-growing tumours, characterized by the absence of merlin. The deregulation of p53-MDM2 was demonstrated to mediate merlin-deficient tumour growth, characterized by a nuclear accumulation of stabilized MDM2, contributing to a nuclear export of p53 for degradation. Nutlin-3 blocked the proliferation of schwannoma cells via a cooperative recovery of merlin and p53, accompanied by the shuttling of both proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We further demonstrated a difference in the sensitivity to Nutlin-3 between schwannoma cells with and without merlin expression. Nutlin-3 combined with MG-132 narrowed this between-group difference and triggered stronger inhibitory effects on the growth of schwannomas through coordinated reactivation of p53.These findings present treatment strategies directed on the pathogenesis of sporadic schwannomas.National Natural Science Foundation of China.",

TRTICs were characterized by neurosphere clonogenicity and self-renewal, serial xenotransplantation, differentiation potential, and mRNA & miRNA transcriptomic profiling. We use an unbiased approach to identify antigens encoding TRTIC and glioma stem cells (GSC) populations. Co-culture experiments of TRTIC and differentiated cells were conducted to evaluate the reliance of TRTIC differentiation on the secretome of differentiated cells.TRTICs acquire stem-like gene expression signatures and increased side population staining resulting from the activation of multi-drug resistance genes. Genetic and functional characterization of TRTICs shows a striking resemblance with GSCs. TRTICs can differentiate towards specific progeny in the neural stem cell lineage. TRTIC-derived tumors display all the histological hallmarks of glioblastoma (GBM) and exhibit a miRNA-transcript and mRNA-transcriptomic profile associated with aggressiveness. We report that CD24+/CD44+ antigens are expressed in TRTICs and patient-derived GSCs. Double positive CD24+/CD44+ exhibit treatment resistance and enhanced tumorigenicity. Interestingly, co-culture experiments with TRTICs and differentiated cells indicated that the regulation of TRTIC differentiation could rely on the secretome in the tumor niche.Radiation and temozolomide treatment enriches a population of cells that have increased iPSC gene expression.

     "abstract": "Adapted ketogenic diet (AKD) and caloric restriction (CR) have been suggested as alternative therapeutic strategies for inflammatory, hyperproliferative and neurodegenerative diseases. Pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis since they augment vascular permeability and induce leukocyte migration into the brain. We explored the impact of ketogenic diets on gene expression of biosynthetic enzymes for pro- (ALOX5, COX1, COX2) and anti-inflammatory (ALOX15) eicosanoids in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.60 adults were prospectively recruited for this six months randomized controlled trial and the impact of dietary treatment on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 index (ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01538355) has previously been published. Here we explored 24 patients (8 controls, 5 on CR and 11 on AKD). For statistical analysis we combined the two diet groups to a single pooled treatment group.Inter-group comparison indicated that expression of the pro-inflammatory ALOX5 in the pooled treatment group was significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) reduced when compared with the control group. Moreover, intra-group comparison (same individuals before and after dietary treatment) suggested significantly impaired expression of other pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as COX1 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and COX2 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, pretreatment cross-group analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between expression of pro-inflammatory ALOX5 and COX2 and an inverse correlation of ALOX5 and COX1 expression with the MSQoL-54 index.Ketogenic diets can reduce the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. Pharmacological interference with eicosanoid biosynthesis might constitute a strategy supplementing current therapeutic approaches for MS.",

X/A-like cells, a group of unique endocrine cells in gastric oxyntic mucosa, produce and secret ghrelin to influence energy balance. Whether gastric X/A-like cells affect pancreatic fibrosis and subsequent glucose homeostasis remains unclear.We established a Ghrl-cre transgene in which the cre enzyme is expressed in X/A-like cells under the control of ghrelin-promoter. TSC1flox/flox mice were bred with Ghrl-cre mice to generate Ghrl-TSC1\u2212/\u2212 (TG) mice, within which mTORC1 signaling was activated in X/A-like cells. Pancreatic fibrosis and insulin secretion were analyzed in the TG mice.Activation of mTORC1 signaling by deletion of TSC1 gene in gastric X/A-like cells induced spontaneous pancreatic fibrosis. This alteration was associated with reduced insulin expression and secretion, as well as impaired glucose metabolism. Activation of mTORC1 signaling in gastric X/A-like cells reduced gastric and circulating ghrelin levels. Exogenous ghrelin reversed pancreatic fibrosis and glucose intolerance induced by activation of mTORC1 signaling in these cells. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, reversed the decrease of ghrelin levels and pancreatic fibrosis.Activation of mTORC1 signaling in gastric X/A-like cells induces spontaneous pancreatic fibrosis and subsequently impairs glucose homeostasis via suppression of ghrelin.",

Results demonstrate that nuclear-mitochondrial genetic background combination significantly alters metabolic efficiency and body composition. Comparative RNA sequencing analysis in adipose tissues also showed a clear influence of the mtDNA on regulating nuclear gene expression on the same nuclear background (up to a 10-fold change in the number of differentially expressed genes), revealing that neither Mendelian nor mitochondrial genetics unilaterally control gene expression. Additional analyses indicate that nuclear-mitochondrial genome combination modulates gene expression in a manner heretofore not described.

However, clinical and animal studies have not shown the changes of the total glomeruli in the whole kidney treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.We performed computed tomography (CT) imaging on mice using synchrotron radiation to investigate the impact of luseogliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, on the number and volume of glomeruli in the whole kidney.We did not observe a significant difference in the total glomerular number (Nglom) among mice. Luseogliflozin redistributed the number of glomeruli in different regions, accompanied by the normalization of diabetes-augmented renal volume (Vkidney). Diabetic db/db mice had a larger glomerular volume in the mid-cortex than did control db/m mice, and luseogliflozin increased the glomerular volume in all renal cortical zones of the whole kidney in db/db mice. According to the multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin A1c level was the most relevant determinant of Vkidney, not Nglom or mean glomerular volume (Vglom), indicating that hyperglycemia induced renal (tubular) hypertrophy, but not glomerular enlargement. Luseogliflozin increased hypoxia in the juxtamedullary region, sustained upregulated renal renin expression and plasma renin activity, and failed to decrease albuminuria by downregulating megalin in db/db mice.Based on our findings, SGLT2 inhibitors may alter glomerular distribution and size in addition to their glucose-lowering effects, presumably by affecting oxygen metabolism and humoral factors.Funding for this research was provided by The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Japan Diabetes Foundation, and Asahikawa Medical University.",

A total of 955 malonylation sites on 434 proteins and 1377 succinylation sites on 429 proteins were identified and quantitated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that malonylation was the major SIRT5 target in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, whereas succinylation was the preferred SIRT5 target in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway.Hepatic overexpression of SIRT5 ameliorated the metabolic abnormalities of ob/ob mice, probably through demalonylating and desuccinylating proteins in the main metabolic pathways.

Cytokine-induced PDL1 expression in the human beta cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H1, and in primary human pancreatic islets was determined by real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry and Western blot. Specific and previously validated small interference RNAs were used to inhibit STAT1, STAT2, IRF1 and JAK1 signaling. Key results were validated using the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib.PDL1 was present in insulin-positive cells from twelve T1D individuals (6 living and 6 deceased donors) but absent from insulin-deficient islets or from the islets of six non-diabetic controls. Interferons-\u03b1 and -\u03b3, but not interleukin-1\u03b2, induced PDL1 expression in vitro in human islet cells and EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells.

The study included a sub-study to investigate mutations in the genes listed above. PCR products from genomic blood cell DNA were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. DNA variants were classified as pathogenic according to the recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Demographic, auxologic, and endocrine data at baseline and during GH treatment were documented and related to the genotyping results.The analysis comprised 917 patients. In 92 patients (10%) 33 mutations were found, 16 previously described and 17 novel (52%). Mutation carriers were significantly younger, shorter, and more slowly growing than non-carriers. In general, their peak values in GH stimulation tests were very low; however, in 15/77 (20%) patients with GH1, PROP1, and SOX3 mutations they were only moderately diminished (3-6\u202f\u03bcg/L). Two patients with a GH1 mutation developed TSH deficiency and one ADH deficiency. Using logistic multi-regression analysis, significant indicators of a mutation were combined pituitary hormone deficiency, greater patient-parent height difference (SDS), low GH peak, and young age.

Brain alterations in gray matter (GM) related to SAD have been previously reported, but it remains to be elucidated whether GM measures are candidate endophenotypes of SAD. Endophenotypes are measurable characteristics on the causal pathway from genotype to phenotype, providing insight in genetically-based disease mechanisms. Based on a review of existing evidence, we examined whether GM characteristics meet two endophenotype criteria, using data from a unique sample of SAD-patients and their family-members of two generations. First, we investigated whether GM characteristics co-segregate with social anxiety within families genetically enriched for SAD. Secondly, heritability of the GM characteristics was estimated.Families with a genetic predisposition for SAD participated in the Leiden Family Lab study on SAD; T1-weighted MRI brain scans were acquired (n\u202f=\u202f110, 8 families). Subcortical volumes, cortical thickness and cortical surface area were determined for a-priori determined regions of interest (ROIs). Next, associations with social anxiety and heritabilities were estimated.Several subcortical and cortical GM characteristics, derived from frontal, parietal and temporal ROIs, co-segregated with social anxiety within families (uncorrected p-level) and showed moderate to high heritability.These findings provide preliminary evidence that GM characteristics of multiple ROIs, which are distributed over the brain, are candidate endophenotypes of SAD. Thereby, they shed light on the genetic vulnerability for SAD. Future research is needed to confirm these results and to link them to functional brain alterations and to genetic variations underlying these GM changes.Leiden University Research Profile \u2018Health, Prevention and the Human Life Cycle\u2019.",

The parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the data. Patients were treated with olanzapine for 8\u202fweeks.Compared with healthy controls, patients showed lower PAS scores in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)/inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus and left angular gyrus, and higher PAS scores in the left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus. Unaffected siblings also showed lower PAS scores in the left MTG/ITG and left PCC/precuneus relative to healthy controls.

Adult-specific abnormal amygdala rsFC in MDD patients compared to that in controls was located mainly within the affective network, including increased connectivity with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus and bilateral ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex and decreased connectivity with the bilateral insula and the left caudate. Adolescent MDD patients specifically demonstrated decreased amygdala rsFC within the cognitive control network encompassing the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and imbalanced amygdala rsFC within the default mode network, which was manifested as hyperconnectivity in the right precuneus and hypoconnectivity in the right inferior temporal gyrus. Additionally, direct comparison between the two groups showed that adult patients had strengthened amygdala rsFC with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus as well as the right inferior temporal gyrus and weakened amygdala rsFC with the bilateral insula compared to that in adolescent patients.Distinct impairments of amygdala-centered rsFC in adult and adolescent patients were related to different network dysfunctions in MDD. Adult-specific amygdala rsFC dysfunction within the affective network presumably reflects emotional dysregulation in MDD, whereas adolescent-specific amygdala rsFC abnormalities in networks involved in cognitive control might reflect the neural basis of affective cognition deficiency that is characteristic of adolescent MDD.This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81671669) and by a Sichuan Provincial Youth Grant (2017JQ0001).",

Adjusted mixed effects logistic regression analyses tested whether sleep disturbance predicted depression (CES-D\u202f\u2265\u202f16) at the immediate subsequent visit, and so on over 12\u202fyears, in non-depressed HIV+(N\u202f=\u202f1054; 9556 person-visits) and non-depressed HIV- (N\u202f=\u202f1217; 12,680 person-visits). In HIV+ vs. HIV- MSM, linearly estimated average incidence of depression and normalized cumulative rate of depression over 12\u202fyears were compared.In the HIV+ MSM, sleep disturbance was associated with a significant increase in depression 6\u202fmonths later (OR\u202f=\u202f1.6; 95% CI, 1.30, 1.96), which was significantly greater (P\u202f<\u202f.05) than in HIV- MSM (OR\u202f=\u202f1.16; 95% CI, 0.94, 1.44). HIV status and sleep disturbance interacted (P\u202f<\u202f.001), such that incidence of depression and normalized cumulative rate of depression were greater in HIV+ with sleep disturbance than in HIV+ without sleep disturbance and HIV- groups (all P's\u202f<\u202f0.001).HIV+ persons who report sleep disturbance represent a high risk group to be monitored for depression, and possibly targeted for insomnia treatment to prevent depression.National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",

     "abstract": "Despite compelling data describing pro-regenerative effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in pre-clinical models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical trials using retinoids for emphysema patients have failed. Crucial information about the specific role of RA signaling in adult rodent and human lung epithelial progenitor cells is largely missing.Adult lung organoid cultures were generated from isolated primary mouse and human lung epithelial cells, and incubated with pharmacological pathway modulators and recombinant proteins. Organoid number and size were measured, and differentiation was assessed with quantitative immunofluorescence and gene expression analyses.We unexpectedly found that ATRA decreased lung organoid size, whereas RA pathway inhibition increased mouse and human lung organoid size. RA pathway inhibition stimulated mouse lung epithelial proliferation via YAP pathway activation and epithelial-mesenchymal FGF signaling, while concomitantly suppressing alveolar and airway differentiation. HDAC inhibition rescued differentiation in growth-augmented lung organoids.In contrast to prevailing notions, our study suggests that regenerative pharmacology using transient RA pathway inhibition followed by HDAC inhibition might hold promise to promote lung epithelial regeneration in diseased adult lung tissue.This project is funded by the Lung Foundation Netherlands (Longfonds) grant 6.1.14.009 (RG, MK, JS, PSH) and W2/W3 Professorship Award by the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, Germany (MK).",

     "abstract": "There is considerable discordance in the curve progression of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients between monozygotic (MZ) twins, indicating that nongenetic factors must be involved in the curve progression of AIS patients. Epigenetic processes may constitute one of these factors and have not yet been investigated in relation to curve progression in AIS patients.The genome and methylome of peripheral monocytes were compared between MZ twins discordant for curve progression. Sets of differentially methylated sites were validated using the MassARRAY platform of Sequenome on additional samples.In the discovery study, we found evidence suggesting a lack of differences at the genome sequence level and the presence of epigenetic differences related to the curve progression of AIS patients. The top 4 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with curve severity were tested, and only site cg01374129 (CpG site located at chr8:122583383, Hg19) was confirmed in two replication cohorts. The methylation levels of site cg01374129 were significantly lower in the progression group than in the nonprogression group. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that hypo-methylation of site cg01374129 was an independent prognostic factor for curve severity. Site cg01374129 methylation as a marker achieved a sensitivity of 76.4% and a specificity of 85.6% in differentiating between samples from patients with and without curve progression (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.827; 95% CI: 0.780 to 0.876).Increased curvature is associated with decreased methylation at site cg01374129.

Through production of prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) affects inflammation and epithelial regeneration and may in this way be implicated in treatment resistance to TNF inhibitors.In this study, COX-2 expression was analyzed in human intestinal biopsies and patient-derived monocytes, and the downstream consequences of COX-2 activity was evaluated by assessing the influence of the down-stream effector, PGE2, on intestinal epithelial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation using primary human intestinal organoids (\u201cmini-guts\u201d).We found that TNF stimulation induced COX-2 expression in monocytes isolated from responders (Rs), whereas COX-2 expression was constitutively high and non-inducible in monocytes from PNRs. Additionally, PGE2 in combination with proliferative signals transformed human intestinal epithelial cells to a proinflammatory state akin to flaring UC, whereas PGE2 in combination with differentiation signals supported robust mucin induction.Our work indicates that COX-2-PGE2 signaling could be a novel target for the management of PNRs to TNF inhibitors. We additionally demonstrate that COX-2\u2013PGE2 signaling has dual functions during tissue repair and normal lineage differentiation, explaining in part the lack of response to TNF inhibitors among PNRs.This work was funded by grants from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Lundbeck Foundation, the Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Research Center, NIH Grants, Aase and Ejnar Danielsen's Foundation and the A.P.

     "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin which serves as a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS signaling and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. While, the only well-established functional domain in the NF1 protein is the GAP-related domain (GRD), most of the identified non-truncating disease-causing variants are located outside of this domain, supporting the existence of other important disease-associated domains. Identifying these domains may reveal novel functions of NF1.By implementing inferential statistics combined with machine-learning methods, we developed a novel NF1-specific functional prediction model that focuses on nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs). The model enables annotating all possible NF1 nonsynonymous variants, thus mapping the range of pathogenic non-truncating variants at the codon level across the NF1 gene.The generated model demonstrates high absolute prediction value for missense and splice-site variations (area under the ROC curve of 0.96) outperforming 14 other established models.By reviewing the entire dataset of nonsynonymous variants, two novel domains (Armadillo type fold 1 and 2) were identified as being associated with pathogenicity (OR 1.86; CI 1.04 to 3.34 and OR 2.08; CI 1.08 to 4.04, respectively; P\u202f<\u202f.05). Specific exons and codons associated with increased pathogenicity were also detected along the gene inside and outside the GRD domain.The developed model, enabled better prediction of pathogenicity for variants in NF1 gene, as well as elucidation of novel NF1-associated domains in addition to the GRD.This work was partially supported by the Kahn foundation.

Then we generated TYR-K373T knock-in (KI) rabbits by microinjection of ssDNA and synthesized RNAs targeting C1118A using CRISPR/Cas9-HDR to observe the formation of melanin.We demonstrated that the T373K mutation in TYR can reduce tyrosinase activity, leading to an absence of melanin synthesis at the cell-level.

We performed in vitro experiments in KGN cells to verify the molecular mechanisms. Additionally, we conducted in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies using EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus and recombinant EPHA7-Fc protein injection to identify the ovulation effects of EPHA7.EPHA7 functions as a critically positive upstream factor for the expression of ERK1/2-mediated C/EBP\u03b2. This protein, in turn, induced the expression of KLF4 and then ADAMTS1. Moreover, decreased abundance of EPHA7 was positively correlated with that of its downstream factors in hGCs of PCOS patients. Additionally, a 1-week functional EPHA7 shRNA lentivirus in rat ovaries contributed to decreased numbers of retrieved oocytes, and a 3-week functional lentivirus led to menstrual disorders and morphological polycystic changes in rat ovaries.

The involvement of inflammatory cells has also been observed in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiac injury. This study aimed to investigate whether IL-12p35 KO affects DOX-induced cardiac injury and the underlying mechanisms.First, the effect of DOX treatment on cardiac IL-12p35 expression was assessed. In addition, to investigate the effect of IL-12p35 KO on DOX-induced cardiac injury, IL-12p35 KO mice were treated with DOX. Because IL-12p35 is the mutual subunit of IL-12 and IL-35, to determine the cytokine that mediates the effect of IL-12p35 KO on DOX-induced cardiac injury, mice were given phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), mouse recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) or rIL-35 before treatment with DOX.DOX treatment significantly increased the level of cardiac IL-12p35 expression. In addition, IL-12p35 KO mice exhibited higher serum and heart lactate dehydrogenase levels, higher serum and heart creatine kinase myocardial bound levels, and greater cardiac dysfunction than DOX-treated mice. Furthermore, IL-12p35 KO further increased M1 macrophage and decreased M2 macrophage differentiation, aggravated the imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants, and further activated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress autophagy pathway. Both rIL-12 and rIL-35 protected against DOX-induced cardiac injury by alleviating the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy.IL-12p35 KO aggravated DOX-induced cardiac injury by amplifying the levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy.

We aimed to compare the efficacies and uncover the advantages associated with each treatment approach.A randomised single-blinded non-inferiority trial (Number: NCT 02089828) was performed. NO-CLI patients were 1:1 randomised to the PBMNCs and PCCs groups, and compared in relation to safety and efficacy outcomes. The primary efficacy outcomes included major amputation and total amputation over 12\u202fmonths. The major amputation-free survival (MAFS) and total amputation-free survival (TAFS) rates were calculated.Fifty patients (25 per group, 47 with thromboangiitis obliterans and 3 with other angiitis) were enrolled, with a median follow-up period of 24.5\u202fmonths (interquartile range: 17\u201334\u202fmonths). One patient in the PCCs group was lost at 2\u202fmonths and one major amputation occurred in the PBMNCs group at 3\u202fmonths post-transplantation. The total amputation rates at 6\u202fmonths post-transplantation were 28.0% in the PCCs group and 16.0% in the PBMNCs group (p\u202f=\u202f0.343), and remained unchanged at 12\u202fmonths. The groups did not differ regarding the MAFS and TAFS (Breslow-Wilcoxon test: p\u202f=\u202f0.3014 and p\u202f=\u202f0.3414). The PCCs group had a significantly higher probability of rest pain relief than the PBMNCs group (Breslow-Wilcoxon test: p\u202f=\u202f0.0454).PCCs was not inferior to PBMNCs at limb salvage in the treatment of angiitis-induced NO-CLI and appeared to induce earlier ischaemia relief.

Using a proteomic discovery approach, 92 proteins biomarkers were assessed using Proximity Extension Assay technology to determine the effects of statins on key atherosclerosis and CVD pathways among PWH. 225 participants had specimens available for biomarker analysis pre- and post-baseline.The mean age was 49.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.0 (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD), LDL-C 155\u202f\u00b1\u202f25\u202fmg/dl and CD4 count 620\u202f\u00b1\u202f243 cell/mm3. Among all participants, three proteins significantly decreased: tissue factor pathway inhibitor [TFPI; t-statistic\u202f=\u202f\u22126.38, FDR p-value<0.0001], paraoxonase 3 [PON3; t-statistic\u202f=\u202f\u22124.64, FDR p-value\u202f=\u202f0.0003], and LDL-receptor [LDLR; t-statistic\u202f=\u202f\u22124.45, FDR p-value\u202f=\u202f0.0004]; and two proteins significantly increased galectin-4 [Gal-4; t-statistic\u202f=\u202f3.50, FDR p-value\u202f=\u202f0.01] and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 [IGFBP-2; t-statistic\u202f=\u202f3.21, FDR p-value\u202f=\u202f0.03]. The change in TFPI was significantly different between the pitavastatin and pravastatin groups. Among all participants, change in TFPI related to the change in LDL-C (r\u202f=\u202f0.43, P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and change in Lp-PLA2 (r\u202f=\u202f0.29, P\u202f<\u202f0.0001).Using a proteomics approach, we demonstrated that statins led to a significant reduction in the levels of TFPI, PON3, and LDLR and an increase in Gal-4 and IGFBP-2, key proteins involved in coagulation, redox signaling, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism. Pitavastatin led to a greater reduction in TFPI than pravastatin.

We examined the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of VR942, a dry-powder formulation containing CDP7766, a high-affinity anti-human-IL-13 antigen-binding antibody fragment being developed for the treatment of asthma.We conducted a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose study at Hammersmith Medicines Research, London, UK, which is now complete. Healthy adults aged 18\u201350 years (n = 40) were randomized 3:1 to a single inhaled dose of VR942 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10, or 20 mg, or placebo. Adults aged 18\u201350 years who were diagnosed with asthma for \u22656 months before screening, and had forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) values \u226570% of the predicted values at screening (n = 45), were randomized to once-daily inhaled VR942 0.5 or 10 mg, or placebo (2:2:1), or VR942 20 mg or placebo (3:2), for 10 days. All participants were randomized to receive VR942 or placebo based on a randomization list prepared by an independent HMR statistician using SAS\u00ae software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of VR942 (safety population, defined as all who received at least one dose of VR942 or placebo). This study is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02473939).In the VR942 and placebo groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 10/30 (33%) and 0/10 (0%) healthy participants, and in 16/29 (55%) and 9/16 (56%) participants with asthma, respectively. Mild intermittent wheezing occurred in 7 participants (VR942 20 mg, n = 4; corresponding placebo, n = 3), resolving spontaneously within 1 h. All TEAEs were mild or moderate; there were no deaths, serious adverse events, or clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, or laboratory parameters. There was no clinically significant immunogenicity, with only one participant with asthma considered positive for treatment-related immunogenicity for CDP7766.This study, considered to be the only example of a dry powder anti-IL-13 fragment antibody being administered via inhalation, demonstrated that single and repeat doses were well tolerated over a period of up to 10 days in duration. Rapid and durable inhibition of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (secondary outcome) provided evidence of pharmacological engagement with the IL-13 target in the airways of participants diagnosed with mild asthma. These data, together with the numerical improvements observed for predose FEV1, justify further clinical evaluation of VR942 in a broader population of patients with asthma, and continue to support the development of an inhaled anti-IL-13 antibody fragment as a potential future treatment that is alternative to monoclonal antibodies delivered via the parenteral route.Study funding and funding for the medical writing and editorial support for preparation of the manuscript were split equally between the two study co-funders (Vectura Ltd and UCB Pharma).",

Cox regression was used to estimate risks of the primary endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality within 30\u202fdays from the initial blood culture. Six multivariate analysis models were constructed in accordance to the clinical importance and intra- and inter-component multicollinearity.Among the 1492 E. coli BSI cases, 9.5% (n\u202f=\u202f141) patients expired within 30\u202fdays. Six models of multivariate analysis indicated risk factors of critical illness, primary infection of peritoneum, and chronic liver disease including cirrhosis for host variables; of phylogenetic group B2, ST131-sublineage H30Rx, multidrug resistance, group 1 CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, and having either of fyuA, afa, and sfa/foc virulence genes for causative E. coli pathogen variables; and of delayed definitive therapy for antimicrobial treatment variables. In addition, as a protective factor, primary urinary tract infection was identified.Despite decades' effort searching for the risk factors for E. coli BSI, systemic understanding covering the entire tripartite component is still lacking. This study detailed the organic impact of host-pathogen-treatment tripartite components for early mortality in patients with E. coli BSI.",

H. pylori-positive patients were randomly assigned to group A (14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy) and group B (quadruple therapy supplemented with Clostridium butyricum). Stool samples of group A and B were collected on day 0, 14 and 56 while stool samples of group C were collected on day 0. Gut microbiota was investigated by 16S rRNA sequencing.The Sobs index (richness estimator) was significantly higher in H. pylori-positive samples than H. pylori-negative samples (p\u202f<\u202f.05). Several metabolic pathways were more abundant in H. pylori-positive communities while some disease-associated pathways had higher potential in H. pylori-negative community through KEGG pathway analysis. Abundances of most butyrate-producing bacteria significantly decreased, while several detrimental bacteria increased after eradication therapy. Probiotic supplementation was associated with improved gastrointestinal symptoms as well as increased Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio.While H. pylori infection may not be necessarily detrimental in all patients, eradication of H. pylori was associated with widespread changes in gut microbial ecology and structure. Probiotic supplementation could relieve more gastrointestinal symptoms by inducing alterations in gut microbiota and host immune responses. As such, the decision to eradicate H. pylori should be based on comprehensive analysis of individual patients.",

An alternative approach is to achieve prophylaxis with long-term expression of potent biologic HIV-1 inhibitors with Adeno-associated Virus (AAV), which could however be limited by hosts' humoral and cellular responses. An approach that facilitates in vivo production of these complex molecules independent of viral-vectored delivery will be a major advantage.We used synthetic DNA and electroporation (DNA/EP) to deliver an anti-HIV-1 immunoadhesin eCD4-Ig in vivo. In addition, we engineered a TPST2 enzyme variant (IgE-TPST2), characterized its intracellular trafficking patterns and determined its ability to post-translationally sulfate eCD4-Ig in vivo.With a single round of DNA injection, a peak expression level of 80-100\u03bcg/mL was observed in mice 14 days post injection (d.p.i). The engineered IgE-TPST2 enzyme trafficked efficiently to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN). Co-administrating low dose of plasmid IgE-TPST2 with plasmid eCD4-Ig enhanced the potency of eCD4-Ig by three-fold in the ex vivo neutralization assay against the global panel of HIV-1 pseudoviruses.This work provides a proof-of-concept for delivering anti-HIV-1 immunoadhesins by advanced nucleic acid technology and modulating protein functions in vivo with targeted enzyme-mediated post-translational modifications.This work is supported by NIH IPCAVD Grant U19 Al109646-04, Martin Delaney Collaboration for HIV Cure Research and W.W.

To establish a functional hiPSC-LO, we cultured hiPSC-derived endodermal, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells with a chemically defined medium in a three-dimensional microwell culture system. Based on cell-cell interactions, these cells could organize themselves and gradually differentiate into a functional organoid, which exhibited stronger hepatic functions than hiPSC derived hepatic like cell (HLC). Moreover, the functional LO demonstrated more susceptibility to HBV infection than hiPSC-HLC, and could maintain HBV propagation and produce infectious virus for a prolonged duration. Furthermore, we found that virus infection could cause hepatic dysfunction of hiPSC-LOs, with down-regulation of hepatic gene expression, induced release of early acute liver failure markers, and altered hepatic ultrastructure. Therefore, our study demonstrated that HBV infection in hiPSC-LOs could recapitulate virus life cycle and virus induced hepatic dysfunction, suggesting that hiPSC-LOs may provide a promising individualized infection model for the development of individualized treatment for hepatitis.",

In vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function studies were performed to reveal the effects and related mechanism of microRNA-590-5p/YAP1 axis in the chemoresistant phenotype of HCC cells.We identified yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) as the major dysregulated molecules in adriamycin (ADR)-resistant HCC cells. YAP1 was profoundly implicated in the chemoresistant phenotype of HCC cells. Furthermore, microRNA-590-5p was revealed as a functional modulator of YAP1. Importantly, YAP1-mediated chemoresistant phenotype was closely related to increased expression of stemness markers and ATP-binding cassette transporters. HCC patients with poor response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment had higher protein level of YAP1 than that in the responsive patients.The microRNA-590-5p/YAP axis plays an important role in the chemotherapeutic resistance of HCC cells, suggesting new adjuvant chemotherapeutic directions in HCC.National Natural Science Foundation of China, Zhejiang Province Medical and Health Care Key Project, Experimental Animal Science and Technology Projects of Zhejiang Province, Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project of Lishui, Chinese Medicine Science and Technology Projects of Zhejiang Province.",

However, the regulatory effects of AR on epigenetic mediators in HCC remain ill-defined. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an oncogene responsible for the tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), was identified to be overexpressed in approximate 70\u201390% of HCC cases, which prompted us to investigate whether or how AR regulates EZH2 expression.Colony formation, soft agar assay, xenograft and orthotopic mouse models were used to determine cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of gene-manipulated HCC cells. Gene regulation was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Clinical relevance of candidate proteins in patient specimens was examined in terms of pathological parameters and postsurgical survival rates.In this study, we found that AR upregulated EZH2 expression by binding to EZH2 promoter and stimulating its transcriptional activity. EZH2 overexpression increased H3K27me3 levels and thereby silenced the expression of Wnt signal inhibitors, resulting in activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and subsequently induction of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. In a cohort of human HCC patients, concordant overexpression of AR, EZH2, H3K27me3 and active \u03b2-catenin was observed in tumor tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues, which correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. These findings demonstrate a novel working model in which EZH2 mediates AR-induced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling activation through epigenetic modification, and support the application of EZH2-targeted reagents for treating HCC patients.",

     "abstract": "Prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPC) cells can undergo lineage switching to neuroendocrine cells and develop into therapy-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). While genomic/epigenetic alterations are shown to induce neuroendocrine differentiation via an intermediate stem-like state, RNA splicing factor SRRM4 can transform AdPC cells into NEPC xenografts through a direct neuroendocrine transdifferentiation mechanism. Whether SRRM4 can also regulate a stem-cell gene network for NEPC development remains unclear.Multiple AdPC cell models were transduced by lentiviral vectors encoding SRRM4. SRRM4-mediated RNA splicing and neuroendocrine differentiation of cells and xenografts were determined by qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. Cell morphology, proliferation, and colony formation rates were also studied. SRRM4 transcriptome in the DU145 cell model was profiled by AmpliSeq and analyzed by gene enrichment studies.SRRM4 induces an overall NEPC-specific RNA splicing program in multiple cell models but creates heterogeneous transcriptomes. SRRM4-transduced DU145 cells present the most dramatic neuronal morphological changes, accelerated cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. The derived xenografts show classic phenotypes similar to clinical NEPC. Whole transcriptome analyses further reveal that SRRM4 induces a pluripotency gene network consisting of the stem-cell differentiation gene, SOX2. While SRRM4 overexpression enhances SOX2 expression in both time- and dose-dependent manners in DU145 cells, RNA depletion of SOX2 compromises SRRM4-mediated stimulation of pluripotency genes. More importantly, this SRRM4-SOX2 axis is present in a subset of NEPC patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts, and clinically relevant transgenic mouse models.We report a novel mechanism by which SRRM4 drives NEPC progression via a pluripotency gene network.Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Nature Science Foundation of China, and China Scholar Council.",

     "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in colorectal tumor tissue are significantly correlated with a favorable prognosis, such as CD8+ lymphocytes, which are also called tumor-reactive lymphocytes. However, not all tumor-infiltrating T cells confer benefit to patients. Therefore, it is of substantial benefit to identify a biomarker to demarcate these tumor-reactive lymphocytes.We investigated whether ITGAE could be used to discriminate reactive CD8+ lymphocytes in colorectal cancer (CRC). TCGA colorectal cancer data sets (n1\u202f=\u202f492, n2\u202f=\u202f386) and FUSCC set (n3\u202f=\u202f276) were used in this study. Further phenotyping of ITGAE+ cells and the mechanistic basis were investigated.In the training and testing sets from TCGA, ITGAE expression, which is strongly correlated with cytotoxic T cell markers (CD8/CD3/PD1), independently predicted longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In line with this, the association between ITGAE+ lymphocytes and survival has been confirmed in the FUSCC cohort for validation (P\u202f=\u202f.026). ITGAE + cells in the series always co-stained with CD8 were preferentially located in the tumor. Interestingly, ITGAE+ lymphocytes tended to associate with the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) with decreased Snail and increased E-cadherin expression accompanied. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis showed that immune activation was significantly enriched in the high ITGAE+ TIL group, accompanied by enriched EMT-related pathways.Because of the specified expression of tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cells, ITGAE may be a promising biomarker for the rapid identification of immune infiltration in CRC.",

Current prognostic biomarkers are insufficient to predict recurrence of CRC and provide little forecast information about what patients are likely to receive benefit from the adjuvant chemotherapy. As microRNAs (miRNAs) constantly exist in human serum and being used to predict the prognosis of a various cancers, this study was designed to identify miRNA-based circulating biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes of CRC.A serum-focused miRNA expression was used to investigate if miRNA expression profiles could predict the clinical outcomes of patients with CRC. We created miRNA signature profiles associated in the training set (n =\u202f40), and further validated its prediction in two independent testing cohorts.Using Cox regression and risk-score analysis, we identified a four-miRNA signature (miR-652-3p, miR-342-3p, miR-501-3p and miR-328-3p) for the prediction of tumor relapse and the overall survival(OS) of patients with CRC in the training set (n\u202f=\u202f40). This miRNA signature was further validated in a testing set (n\u202f=\u202f226) and another independent cohort (n\u202f=\u202f56). A high-risk signature score was significantly associated with CRC tumor recurrence and poor treatment outcome. Multivariable Cox regression models indicated that the risk score, based on the four-miRNA signature, was an independent prognostic classifier for patients with CRC.The serum miRNA signature may serve as a minimally invasive predictor for tumor relapse and treatment outcome in patients with CRC and provide a useful reference for treatment selection.",

In this study, we found that miR-495 was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissue specimens. This study aimed to elucidate the functions, direct target genes, and molecular mechanisms of miR-495 in lung cancer. miR-495 downregulated its substrate UBE2C through direct interaction with UBE2C 3\u2032- untranslated region. UBE2C is a proto-oncogene activated in lung cancer; however, its role in chemotherapeutic resistance is unclear. Herein, UBE2C expression levels were higher in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells; this was associated with the proliferation, invasion, and DDP resistance in induced cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitions (EMT) contributed to DDP resistance. Moreover, UBE2C knockdown downregulated vimentin. In contrast, E-cadherin was upregulated. Importantly, miR-495 and UBE2C were associated with cisplatin resistance. We attempted to evaluate their effects on cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance. We also performed EMT, cell migration, and invasion assays in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells overexpressing miR-495 and under-expressing UBE2C. Furthermore, in silico assays coupled with western blotting and luciferase assays revealed that UBE2C directly binds to the 5\u2032-UTR of the drug-resistance genes ABCG2 and ERCC1. Furthermore, miR-495 downregulated ABCG2 and ERCC1 via regulation of UBE2C. Together, the present results indicate that the miR495-UBE2C-ABCG2/ERCC1 axis reverses DDP resistance via downregulation of anti-drug genes and reducing EMT in DDP-resistant NSCLC cells.",

However, the role of CMTM6 has so far remained unclear in glioma. To investigate the role of CMTM6 in gliomas, we analyzed the transcriptome level, genomic profiles and its relationship with clinical practice. 1862 glioma samples with transcriptome data were enrolled in this study, including CGGA RNA-seq, TCGA RNA-seq, CGGA-microarray, GSE16011 and IVY GBM databases. Clinical information and genomic profiles containing somatic mutations and DNA copy numbers were also obtained. We found that CMTM6 expression was highly correlated with major clinical and molecular characteristics. Cases with high CMTM6 expression were more likely to be predicted as malignant entities and frequent with genomic aberrations of driver oncogenes. Moreover, gene ontology analysis based on significantly correlated genes of CMTM6 expression exhibited that CMTM6 was associated with immune responses and inflammatory activities. CMTM6 was synthetic with other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, CMTM6 was involved in immune functions via modulating T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Finally, high CMTM6 expression was associated with reduced survival time and may serve as a strong indicator of poor prognosis in gliomas. In brief, High level of CMTM6 expression is closely related to high malignant gliomas. Meanwhile, CMTM6 plays an important role in regulating T cell activation and antitumor responses. Therefore, CMTM6 is a promising target for developing immunotherapy of gliomas.",

Additionally, the models were validated using an independent dataset both on Day-7 and Day-90. Significant correlations were detected between the mismatch ratio and clinical assessments in both the training and validation datasets.

The sensitivity and specificity were 76.3% and 81.6%, respectively in semi-lab nomogram, and 72.1% and 67.3% in non-lab nomogram at the optimal cut off point. The decision curve analysis also revealed a bigger decrease of avoidable OGTT test (52 per 100 subjects) in the semi-lab model compared to the non-lab model (36 per 100 subjects) and the existed New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score (NCDRS, 35 per 100 subjects).The non-lab and semi-lab nomograms appear to be reliable tools for diabetes screening, especially in developing countries. However, the semi-lab model outperformed the non-lab model and NCDRS prediction systems and might be worth being adopted as decision support in diabetes screening in China.",

     "abstract": "Bile acid metabolism plays an important role in metabolism but it is uncertain whether bile acid metabolites in early pregnancy are associated with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).We organized a 1:1 case-control study nested in a prospective cohort of 22,302 pregnant women recruited from 2010 to 2012 in China: 243 women with GDM were matched with 243 non-GDM controls on age (\u00b11\u202fyear). Conditional logistic regression and restricted cubic spline were used to examine full-range associations of bile acid metabolites with GDM.All the 9 detectable bile acids were inversely associated with the risk of GDM, among them, 8 in nonlinear and one in largely linear manners in multivariable analysis. Glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) at \u22640.07\u202fnmol/mL and deoxycholic acid (DCA) at \u22640.28\u202fnmol/mL had threshold effects and their decreasing levels below the cutoff points were associated with rapid rises in the risk of GDM.

We examined the association between plasma fatty acids quantified in pregnancy and subsequent risk of early preterm birth.In a case-control design nested in the Danish National Birth Cohort, we identified 376 early preterm cases (<34 gestational weeks, excluding preeclampsia cases) and 348 random controls. Plasma eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (EPA+DHA% of total fatty acids), were measured twice in pregnancy, at gestation weeks 9 and 25 (medians).

However, the precise role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy and its underlying regulatory mechanisms in the intestinal epithelium in response to inflammation and oxidative stress remain poorly understood.The levels of p-mTOR, LC3B, p62 and autophagy in mice and LPS-treated cells were examined by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We evaluated the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, SOD and T-AOC by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and commercially available kits after silencing of mTOR and ATG5. In vivo modulation of mTOR and autophagy was achieved by using AZD8055, rapamycin and 3-methyladenine. Finally, to verify the involvement of TLR4 signalling and the NF-\u03baB pathway in cells and active ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and TEM were performed to determine TLR4 signalling relevance to autophagy and inflammation.The mTOR-dependent autophagic flux impairment in a murine model of colitis, human intestinal epithelial cells and active UC patients is probably regulated by TLR4-MyD88-MAPK signalling and the NF-\u03baB pathway. Silencing mTOR remarkably attenuated, whereas inhibiting ATG5 aggravated, LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative injury. Pharmacological administration of mTOR inhibitors and autophagy stimulators markedly ameliorated experimental colitis and oxidative stress in vivo.Our findings not only shed light on the regulatory mechanism of mTOR-dependent autophagy, but also provided potential therapeutic targets for intestinal inflammatory diseases such as refractory inflammatory bowel disease.",

Automated ROP detection system is urgent and it appears to be a safe, reliable, and cost-effective complement to human experts.An automated ROP detection system called DeepROP was developed by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). ROP detection was divided into ROP identification and grading tasks. Two specific DNN models, i.e., Id-Net and Gr-Net, were designed for identification and grading tasks, respectively. To develop the DNNs, large-scale datasets of retinal fundus images were constructed by labeling the images of ROP screenings by clinical ophthalmologists.On the test dataset, the Id-Net achieved a sensitivity of 96.62%(95%CI, 92.29%\u201398.89%) and a specificity of 99.32% (95%CI, 96.29%\u20139.98%) for ROP identification while the Gr-Net attained sensitivity and specificity values of 88.46% (95%CI, 96.29%\u201399.98%) and 92.31% (95%CI, 81.46%\u201397.86%), respectively, on the ROP grading task.

A wide array of genome-wide expression profiles generated by gene perturbation have been widely used to capture causal links between perturbed genes and response genes. Through annotating >600 gene perturbation profiles, over 354,000 causal relationships between perturbed genes and lncRNAs were identified. This large-scale resource of causal relations inspired us to develop a novel computational approach LnCAR for inferring lncRNAs' functions, which showed a higher accuracy than the co-expression based approach. By application of LnCAR to the cancer hallmark processes, we identified 38 lncRNAs involved in distinct carcinogenic processes. The \u201cactivating invasion & metastasis\u201d related lncRNAs were strongly associated with metastatic progression in various cancer types and could act as a predictor of cancer metastasis. Meanwhile, the \u201cevading immune destruction\u201d related lncRNAs showed significant associations with immune infiltration of various immune cells and, importantly, can predict response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, suggesting their potential roles as biomarkers for immune therapy. Taken together, our approach provides a novel way to systematically reveal functions of lncRNAs, which will be helpful for further experimental exploration and clinical translational research of lncRNAs.",

For a unit decrease in outcome quartile categories, multivariable OR in the lowest (vs highest) OGN expression was 0.17 (95% CI 0.08\u20130.33). Consistently, immunofluorescence validated that OGN was preferentially expressed with CD8+ cells in both normal epithelium and cancer tissue. Xenograft tumors arising from MC38 cells with OGN-over-expression displayed a significant increase in CD8+ cells recruitment. Hence, high expression of OGN was associated with a profound longer survival (P\u202f=\u202f.009). In mechanism, elevated OGN expression inhibited the activation of the transcriptional genes HIF-1\u03b1 in CRC cells, then significantly impeded the expression of VEGF.

ULK1 dysregulation has recently been found in several human cancers.mRNA expression levels of ULK1 and clinical information were analysed from The Cancer Genome Atlas data. ULK1 expression levels were verified in 36 paired fresh ccRCC tissue specimens by western blot analysis. Expression of ULK1 was knockdown by shRNA lentivirus. ULK1 activity was inhibited by SBI-0206965. The effect of inhibition of ULK1 was measured by detecting the apoptotic rate, autophagy, and the ratio of ROS and NADPH. The efficacy of SBI-0206965 in vivo was assessed by the murine xenograft model.ULK1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and overexpression of ULK1 correlated with poor outcomes. We found that ULK1 was highly expressed in 66.7% of ccRCC tumours (p\u202f<\u202f0\u00b705). Knockdown of ULK1 and selective inhibition of ULK1 by SBI-0206965 induced cell apoptosis in ccRCC cells. We demonstrated that SBI-0206965 triggered apoptosis by preventing autophagy and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux. Furthermore, blocking the kinase activity of ULK1 with SBI-0206965 resulted in a level of anticancer effect in vivo.Taken together, our results suggested that ULK1 was upregulated in ccRCC tumours and may be a potential therapeutic target. Therefore, SBI-0206965 should be further considered as an anti-ccRCC agent.This work was supported in part by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81570748) and Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (No. 2018J01345, 2017XQ1194).",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are involved in the formation, maintenance, and metastasis of urologic cancer. Here, we aim to gather and evaluate all of the evidence regarding the potential role of miRNAs as novel predictors of urologic cancer survival.A systematic review was performed to identify and score all of the published studies that evaluated the prognostic effects of miRNAs in kidney (KCa), bladder (BCa) or prostate cancer (PCa). Where appropriate, the summary effects of miRNAs on urologic cancer were meta-analysed. The reliability of those results was then further validated by an integrated analysis of the TCGA cohort and miRNA panel.Of 151 datasets, 80 miRNAs were enrolled in this systematic review. A meta-analysis of the prognostic qualities of each miRNA identified an objective association between miRNA and prognosis. miR-21 was identified as an unfavourable miRNA with the overall survival (HR:2.699, 1.76\u20134.14, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) across various prognostic events. Our further meta-analyses, integrating a parallel TCGA analysis, confirmed these partial previous results and further revealed different summary effects, such as the moderate effect of miR-21 in BCa. The refined miRNA panel (KCa-6: miR-27b, \u2212942, \u2212497, \u2212144, \u2212141 and -27a) was more capable of predicting the overall survival than was any single miRNAs included in it (HR: 3.214, 1.971\u20135.240, P\u202f<\u202f0.01).A miRNA panel may be able to determine the prognosis of urologic tumour more effectively and compensate for the unreliability of individual miRNA in estimating prognosis. More large-scale studies are therefore required to evaluate the unbiased prognostic value of miRNAs in urologic cancer effectively.",

     "abstract": "The relationship between obesity and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been widely investigated. However, the effect of estrogen on this relationship in female RCC patients has not been evaluated. We conducted a case-control study to investigate the role of estrogen as a potential modifier of the association between obesity and RCC risk in Chinese women.A total of 497 consecutive female patients with pathologically confirmed RCC, including 364 clear cell RCC (ccRCC), were enrolled. Age-matched controls were selected from cancer-free females seeking physical examination in our institution. Estrogen receptor-\u03b2 (ER-\u03b2) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression levels were detected in RCC tissues. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by logistic regression models.We observed a positive association between overweight and RCC risk in pre-menopausal but not post-menopausal women. Similar association was also observed between overweight and ccRCC risk. Overweight pre-menopausal women had an increased risk of RCC (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.01\u20132.76), as well as an increased risk of ccRCC (OR: 1.73, 95%CI: 1.02\u20132.99), after adjusting for potential confounders. IGF-1R expression levels were higher in pre-menopausal compared with post-menopausal cases (P\u202f=\u202f0.015).These results suggest that estrogen plays an important role in RCC etiology and may modify the association between obesity and RCC risk in women. We hypothesize that estrogen may up-regulate IGF-1R and potentiate the deleterious effects of obesity-related elevations of insulin and IGFs.",

Although CMV might be a risk factor for BKV and EBV, the effects of combined reactivations remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the interaction and effects on graft function of these reactivations.3715 serum samples from 540 kidney transplant recipients were analysed for viral load by qPCR. Measurements were performed throughout eight visits during the first post-transplantation year. Clinical characteristics, including graft function (GFR), were collected in parallel.BKV had the highest prevalence and viral loads. BKV or CMV viral loads over 10,000 copies\u00b7mL\u22121 led to significant GFR impairment. 57 patients had BKV-CMV combined reactivation, both reactivations were significantly associated (p\u202f=\u202f0.005).

For EBV, a significant association was found with CMV reactivation (p\u202f=\u202f0.02), but no GFR reduction was found. Long cold ischaemia times were a further risk factor for high CMV load.BKV-CMV combined reactivation has a deep impact on renal function one year post-transplantation and therefore most likely on long-term allograft function, even at low viral loads. Frequent viral monitoring and subsequent interventions for low BKV and/or CMV viraemia levels and/or long cold ischaemia time are recommended.Investigator Initiated Trial; financial support by German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).",

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is known to deliver greater specificity, but no quantitative prospective comparison has yet been undertaken.We studied isolates from the English Midlands, sampled consecutively between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2015. In addition to routinely performed MIRU-VNTR typing, DNA was extracted from liquid cultures and sequenced using Illumina technology. Demographic and epidemiological data for the relevant patients were extracted from the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system run by Public Health England. Closely related samples, defined using a threshold of five single nucleotide variants (SNVs), were compared to samples with identical MIRU-VNTR profiles, to samples from individuals with shared epidemiological risk factors, and to those with both characteristics.1999 patients were identified for whom at least one M. tuberculosis isolate had been MIRU-VNTR typed and sequenced. Comparing epidemiological risk factors with close genetic relatedness, only co-residence had a positive predictive value of over 5%. Excluding co-resident individuals, 18.6% of patients with identical MIRU-VNTR profiles were within 5 SNVs. Where patients also shared social risk factors and ethnic group, this rose to 48%. Only 8% of MIRU-VNTR linked pairs in lineage 1 were within 5 SNV, compared to 31% in lineage 4.In the setting studied, this molecular epidemiological study shows MIRU-VNTR typing and epidemiological risk factors are poorly predictive of close genomic relatedness, assessed by SNV.

Precise analysis of transmission networks is the basis to trace outbreak M/XDR clones and improve TB control. However, classical genotyping tools lack discriminatory power due to the high similarity of strains of particular successful lineages, e.g. Beijing or outbreak strains. This can be overcome by whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches, but these are not yet standardized to facilitate larger investigations encompassing different laboratories or outbreak tracing across borders.We established and improved a whole genome gene-by-gene multi locus sequence typing approach encompassing a stable set of core genome genes (cgMLST) and linked it to a web-based nomenclature server (cgMLST.org) facilitating assignment and storage of allele numbers.We evaluated and refined a previously suggested cgMLST schema by using a reference strain set (n\u202f=\u202f251) reflecting the global diversity of the Mtbc. A set of 2891 genes showed excellent performance with at least 97% of the genes reliably identified in strains of all Mtbc lineages and in discriminating outbreak strains. cgMLST allele numbers were automatically retrieved from and stored at cgMLST.org.The refined cgMLST schema provides high resolution genome-based typing of clinical strains of all Mtbc lineages. Combined with a web-based nomenclature server, it facilitates rapid, high-resolution, and harmonized tracing of clinical Mtbc strains needed for prospective local and global surveillance.",

Transferable colistin resistance gene, mcr-3, first identified in Shandong, China, has already been found in several countries in multidrug-resistant human infections. Here we track the spread of mcr-3 within 13 provinces in China and provide a complete characterization of its evolution, structure and function.A total of 6497 non-duplicate samples were collected from thirteen provinces in China, from 2016 to 2017 and then screened for the presence of mcr-3 gene by PCR amplification. mcr-3-positive isolates were analyzed for antibiotic resistance and by southern blot hybridization, transfer analysis and plasmid typing. We then examined the molecular evolution of MCR-3 through phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, we also characterized the structure and function of MCR-3 through circular dichroism analyses, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS), confocal microscopy and chemical rescue tests.49 samples (49/6497\u202f=\u202f0.75%) were mcr-3 positive, comprising 40 samples (40/4144\u202f=\u202f0.97%) from 2017 and 9 samples (9/2353\u202f=\u202f0.38%) from 2016. Overall, mcr-3-positive isolates were distributed in animals and humans in 8 of the 13 provinces. Three mcr-3-positive IncP-type and one mcr-1-bearing IncHI2-like plasmids were identified and characterized. MCR-3 clusters with PEA transferases from Aeromonas and other bacteria and forms a phylogenetic entity that is distinct from the MCR-1/2/P(M) family, the largest group of transferable colistin resistance determinants. Despite that the two domains of MCR-3 not being exchangeable with their counterparts in MCR-1/2, structure-guided functional mapping of MCR-3 defines a conserved PE-lipid recognizing cavity prerequisite for its enzymatic catalysis and its resultant phenotypic resistance to colistin. We therefore propose that MCR-3 uses a possible \u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism to transfer the moiety of PEA from its donor PE to the 1(or 4\u2032)-phosphate of lipid A via an adduct of MCR-3-bound PEA. Additionally, the expression of MCR-3 in E. coli prevents the colistin-triggered formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interferes bacterial growth and viability.Our results provide an evolutionary, structural and functional definition of MCR-3 and its epidemiology in China, paving the way for smarter policies, better surveillance and effective treatments.",

Although the mechanism underlying this gender difference remains unknown, the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) gene, which shows sex-specific patterns in some neurodevelopmental disorders, has attracted extensive attention. This study aimed to explore whether CNTNAP2 shows a sex-specific association with DD in a Chinese population.Using genomic DNA samples of 726 students [372 cases (282 male, 90 female), 354 controls (267 male, 87 female)], we genotyped five SNPs of CNTNAP2. Gender-stratified logistic regression models were used to determine the relationships between the CNTNAP2 variants and DD.After adjustment for the false discovery rate (FDR), two SNPs (rs3779031, rs987456) of CNTNAP2 were associated with DD risk in females but not in males. Female participants carrying the rs3779031 G allele had a lower risk of DD than those with the A genotype [GG vs AA: OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.281 (0.097\u20130.814)].

Furthermore, the interaction between CNTNAP2 (rs987456) and environmental factors (scheduled reading time) played a protective role in females [OR (95%CI)\u202f=\u202f0.431 (0.188\u20130.987)].We performed a genetic association study on CNTNAP2 variants and DD. The sex specificity of CNTNAP2 in DD, along with the gene-environment interaction may help us to understand gender differences in DD.",

The analyses were performed using summary statistics obtained for the variants identified from the genome-wide association meta-analyses of fasting glucose levels (up to 133,010 individuals), HbA1c (up to 153,377 individuals), fasting insulin levels (up to 108,557 individuals), type 2 diabetes (up to 659,316 individuals), and schizophrenia (up to 108,341 individuals). The association between each variant and schizophrenia was weighted by its association with each studied condition, and estimates were combined using an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.Using information from thirteen variants related to fasting insulin levels, the causal effect of fasting insulin levels increases (per 1-SD) on the risk of schizophrenia was estimated at an odds ratio (OR) of 2\u00b733 (p =\u202f0\u00b7001), which is consistent with findings from the observational studies. The fasting glucose associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had no effect on the risk of schizophrenia in Europeans and East Asians (p\u202f>\u202f0\u00b705). Nonsignificant effects on the risk of schizophrenia was observed with raised HbA1c and type 2 diabetes, and consistent estimates were obtained across different populations.Our results suggest a causal role of elevated fasting insulin levels in schizophrenia pathogenesis.",

NMDA receptor (NMDAR)\u2013dependent inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) at GABAergic postsynapses requires an increase in surface GABAARs through promoted exocytosis; however, the regulatory mechanisms and the neuropathological significance remain unclear. Here we report that the autism-related protein PX-RICS is involved in GABAAR transport driven during NMDAR\u2013dependent GABAergic iLTP. Chemically induced iLTP elicited a rapid increase in surface GABAARs in wild-type mouse hippocampal neurons, but not in PX-RICS/RICS\u2013deficient neurons. This increase in surface GABAARs required the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14\u20133-3 complex, as revealed by gene knockdown and rescue studies. iLTP induced CaMKII\u2013dependent phosphorylation of PX-RICS to promote PX-RICS\u201314-3-3 assembly. Notably, PX-RICS/RICS\u2013deficient mice showed impaired amygdala\u2013dependent fear learning, which was ameliorated by potentiating GABAergic activity with clonazepam. Our results suggest that PX-RICS\u2013mediated GABAAR trafficking is a key target for GABAergic plasticity and its dysfunction leads to atypical emotional processing underlying autism.",

Quercetin markedly reduced the GABA-activated currents in a noncompetitive manner in cultured cortical neurons, and moderately inhibited spontaneous and electrically-evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current in mouse prefrontal cortical slices. Notably, systemic and prefrontal-specific delivery of quercetin reduced basal locomotor activity in addition to alleviated the MK-801-induced hyperactivity. The effects of quercetin were not exclusively dependent on \u03b15-subunit-containing A type GABA receptors (GABAARs), as viral-mediated, region-specific genetic knockdown of the \u03b15-subunit in prefrontal cortex improved the MK-801-evoked psychotic symptom but reserved the pharmacological responsivity to quercetin.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the role of goal-directed behaviors, and the related use of self-control, in binge-related food choices in patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN).While undergoing fMRI, women aged 18\u201335 with BN (N\u202f=\u202f35) and healthy control women (N\u202f=\u202f26) rated foods for healthiness and tastiness and then made food choices on a 5 points Likert scale between two conflicting options: one food with lower healthiness and higher tastiness (defined as uncontrolled choice) than the other food (defined as controlled choice).BN and healthy participants made more uncontrolled than controlled choices (63% vs 24% and 65% vs 18% respectively). While healthy participants used only food tastiness (chose tastier foods more often) to make food choices (p\u202f<\u202f.001), BN patients used both food healthiness (chose unhealthy food more often, p\u202f<\u202f.001) and food tastiness (p\u202f<\u202f.001) to make binge-related food choices. Activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which correlated with food choices (pFWE\u202f=\u202f0.02), reflected this difference in the integration of food healthiness and food tastiness into a decision value. Functional connectivity analysis showed that the activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was coupled with vmPFC activity in uncontrolled food choices (pFWE\u202f=\u202f0.03).Contrary to what might be expected, not only food tastiness but also unhealthiness (a more abstract cognitive-based attribute than food tastiness) plays a role in uncontrolled choices in BN. These choices are likely goal-directed behaviors and recruit self-control.",

New prediction models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and multivariate logistic regression-based nomogram for BA were created and externally validated in an independent set of 508 infant patients.Fiver predictors, including gender, weight, direct bilirubin (DB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) were significantly different between the BA and non-BA groups (P\u202f<\u202f.05), from which DT, RF, and nomogram models were developed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value for the nomogram was 0.898, which was greater than that of a single biomarker in the prediction of BA. Performance comparison of the three diagnostic models showed that the nomogram displayed better discriminative ability (sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 80.3%; PPV, 0.969) at the optimal cut-off value compared with DT and RF, which had relatively similar high sensitivity and PPV (0.941 and 0.947, respectively), but low specificity in the modeling group. In sub-analysis of the discriminative capacity between the nomogram and GGT (<300 or\u202f\u2265\u202f300), we found that the nomogram was superior to the GGT alone in the preoperative diagnosis of BA.The nomogram has demonstrated better performance for the prediction of BA, holding promise for future clinical application.",

Berberine inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, but the mechanism is incompletely understood. This study aims to investigate whether berberine could reduce excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) by limiting mitochondrial import of pyruvate through MPC1.High-fat diet (HFD) feeding augmented HGP. The effects of berberine on hepatic fatty acid oxidation, sirtuin3 (SIRT3) induction and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) function were examined.HFD feeding increased hepatic acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) accumulation with impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC) induction. Berberine reduced acetyl CoA accumulation by limiting fatty acid oxidation and prevented mitochondrial pyruvate shift from oxidation to gluconeogenesis through carboxylation. Upon pyruvate response, SIRT3 binded to MPC1 and stabilized MPC1 protein via deacetylation modification, facilitating mitochondrial import of pyruvate. Berberine preserved the acetylation of MPC1 by suppression of SIRT3 induction and impaired MPC1 protein stabilization via protein degradation, resultantly limiting mitochondrial pyruvate supply for gluconeogenesis.Berberine reduced acetyl CoA contents by limiting fatty acid oxidation and increased MPC1 degradation via preserving acetylation, thereby restraining HGP by blocking mitochondrial import of pyruvate. These findings suggest that limitation of mitochondrial pyruvate import might be a therapeutic strategy to prevent excessive hepatic glucose production.",

Previous studies showed that increased mitochondrial fission occurred in ovarian cancer cells. However, several pharmacological interventions and therapeutic strategies, which modify the mitochondrial dynamics through the promotion of mitochondrial fission and apoptosis of cancer cells, have been shown to potentially provide beneficial effects in ovarian cancer treatment.

Overexpression of GRP78 is observed in many types of cancers, with the cell-surface GRP78 being preferentially present in cancer cells and cancer blood vessel endothelial cells. Isthmin (ISM) is a secreted high-affinity proapoptotic protein ligand of cell-surface GRP78 that suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth in mice. The C-terminal AMOP (adhesion-associated domain in MUC4 and other proteins) domain of ISM is critical in mediating its interaction with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In this work, we report novel cyclic peptides harboring the RKD motif in the ISM AMOP domain that function as proapoptotic ligands of cell-surface GRP78. The most potent peptide, BC71, binds to GRP78 and converge to tumor in mice. Intravenous administration of BC71 suppressed xenograft tumor growth in mice as a single agent, with significant reduction in tumor angiogenesis and upsurge in apoptosis. Fluorescent-labeled BC71 accumulates in tumor in mice by targeting cell-surface GRP78. We show that BC71 triggers apoptosis via cell-surface GRP78 and activates caspase-8 and p53 signaling pathways in HUVECs. Using amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS), we identified that BC71 preferentially binds to ATP-bound GRP78 via amino acid residues 244\u2013257 of GRP78. Hence, BC71 serves as a valuable prototype for further development of peptidomimetic anticancer drugs targeting cell-surface GRP78 as well as PET imaging agents for cancer prognosis.",

Expression of miR-101 was analyzed by clinical samples of lung adenocarcinomas.We discovered a functional link between p53 and miR-101, which form a molecular circuit in response to nucleolar stress. Inhibition of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription resulted in the post-transcriptional activation of miR-101 in a p53-dependent manner. miR-101 induced G2 phase\u2013specific feedback regulation of p53 through direct repression of its target, EG5, resulting in elevated phosphorylation of ATM. In lung cancer patients, low expression of miR-101 was associated with significantly poorer prognosis exclusively in p53 WT cases. miR-101 sensitized cancer cells to Pol I transcription inhibitors and strongly repressed xenograft growth in mice. Interestingly, the most downstream targets of this circuit included the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Repression of cIAP1 by a selective inhibitor, birinapant, promoted activation of the apoptosis induced by Pol I transcription inhibitor in p53 WT cancer cells.Our findings indicate that the p53\u2013miR-101 circuit is a component of an intrinsic TS network formed by nucleolar stress, and that mimicking activation of this circuit represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy.National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports & Technology of Japan, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.",

Compared to the GCB subtype, the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype was associated with significantly increased expression of multiple pro-inflammatory gene signatures and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory gene signatures. Instead of affecting the pro-inflammatory genes, MYC protein overexpression showed a negative correlation with the expression of T-cell receptor (TCR) and T regulatory genes as well as the OX40 gene. Regardless of COO, higher PD-L1 or IDO1 gene expression correlated with increased expression of T effector and Interferon-\u03b3 gene signatures while the expression of multiple oncogenes including ACTR3B, ERBB2, AKT2 and SMARCD1 was down-regulated. Our findings may thus be helpful in guiding further development of immunotherapies for the different subsets of Chinese DLBCL patients.",

     "abstract": "An endogenous molecular clockwork drives various cellular pathways including metabolism and the cell cycle. Its dysregulation is able to prompt pathological phenotypes including cancer. Besides dramatic metabolic alterations, cancer cells display severe changes in the clock phenotype with likely consequences in tumor progression and treatment response. In this study, we use a comprehensive systems-driven approach to investigate the effect of clock disruption on metabolic pathways and its impact on drug response in a cellular model of colon cancer progression. We identified distinctive time-related transcriptomic and metabolic features of a primary tumor and its metastatic counterpart. A mapping of the expression data to a comprehensive genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism allowed for the in-depth functional characterization of 24\u202fh-oscillating transcripts and pointed to a clock-driven metabolic reprogramming in tumorigenesis. In particular, we identified a set of five clock\u2013regulated glycolysis genes, ALDH3A2, ALDOC, HKDC1, PCK2, and PDHB with differential temporal expression patterns. These findings were validated in organoids and in primary fibroblasts isolated from normal colon and colon adenocarcinoma from the same patient. We further identified a reciprocal connection of HKDC1 to the clock in the primary tumor, which is lost in the metastatic cells. Interestingly, a disruption of the core-clock gene BMAL1 impacts on HKDC1 and leads to a time-dependent rewiring of metabolism, namely an increase in glycolytic activity, as well as changes in treatment response. This work provides novel evidence regarding the complex interplay between the circadian clock and metabolic alterations in carcinogenesis and identifies new connections between both systems with pivotal roles in cancer progression and response to therapy.",

In this study, mucosal injury was observed in MTX-treated mice, leading to significant changes in macrophages (i.e., M1/M2 ratio, P\u202f<\u202f0.05) but not in dendritic cells. Moreover, the population, diversity and principal components of the gut microbiota in mice were dramatically altered after MTX treatment in a time-dependent manner, and Bacteroidales exhibited the most distinct variation among all the taxa (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Bacteroides fragilis was significantly decreased with MTX treatment (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) and tended to decrease proportionately with increasing macrophage density. Gavage of mice with B. fragilis ameliorated MTX-induced inflammatory reactions and modulate macrophage polarization.

However, little is known how a balanced mucus system is maintained. By investigating the involvement of proteases in colonic mucus dynamics we identified metalloprotease activity to be a key contributor to mucus expansion. The effect was mediated by calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA1) as application of recombinant CLCA1 on intestinal mucus in freshly dissected tissue resulted in increased mucus thickness independently of ion and mucus secretion, but dependent on its metallohydrolase activity. Further, CLCA1 modulated mucus dynamics in both human and mouse, and knock-out of CLCA1 in mice was compensated for by cysteine proteases. Our results suggest that CLCA1 is involved in intestinal mucus homeostasis by facilitating processing and removal of mucus to prevent stagnation. In light of our findings, we suggest future studies to investigate if upregulation of CLCA1 in diseases associated with mucus accumulation could facilitate removal of mucus in an attempt to maintain homeostasis.",

We evaluated the effects of short-term hypoxia on systemic inflammation, and show that it potently attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during murine endotoxemia. These effects are independent of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), but involve augmented adenosine levels, in turn resulting in an adenosine 2B receptor-mediated post-transcriptional increase of interleukin (IL)-10 production. We translated our findings to humans using the experimental endotoxemia model, where short-term hypoxia resulted in enhanced plasma concentrations of adenosine, augmentation of endotoxin-induced circulating IL-10 levels, and concurrent attenuation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Again, HIFs were shown not to be involved. Taken together, we demonstrate that short-term hypoxia dampens the systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine response through enhanced purinergic signaling in mice and men. These effects may contribute to outcome and provide leads for immunomodulatory treatment strategies for critically ill patients.",

They play pivotal roles in governing cell behaviors and are indispensable in numerous biological processes. HDAC11, the last identified and sole member of class IV HDACs, was reported over a decade ago. However, its physiological function remains poorly understood. Here, we report that HDAC11 knockout mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome, suggesting that HDAC11 functions as a crucial metabolic regulator. Depletion of HDAC11 significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, attenuated hypercholesterolemia, and decreased hepatosteatosis and liver damage. Mechanistically, HDAC11 deficiency boosts energy expenditure through promoting thermogenic capacity, which attributes to the elevation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression and activity in brown adipose tissue. Moreover, loss of HDAC11 activates the adiponectin-AdipoR-AMPK pathway in the liver, which may contribute to a reversal in hepatosteatosis. Overall, our findings distinguish HDAC11 as a novel regulator of obesity, with potentially important implications for obesity-related disease treatment.",

     "abstract": "The identification of blood-based biomarkers specific to the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an active field of academic and clinical research. While inheritance studies have advanced the field, a majority of patients do not have a known genetic link to the disease, making direct sequence-based genetic testing for ALS difficult. The ability to detect biofluid-based epigenetic changes in ALS would expand the relevance of using genomic information for disease diagnosis.Assessing differences in chromosomal conformations (i.e. how they are positioned in 3-dimensions) represents one approach for assessing epigenetic changes. In this study, we used an industrial platform, EpiSwitch\u2122, to compare the genomic architecture of healthy and diseased patient samples (blood and tissue) to discover a chromosomal conformation signature (CCS) with diagnostic potential in ALS. A three-step biomarker selection process yielded a distinct CCS for ALS, comprised of conformation changes in eight genomic loci and detectable in blood.We applied the ALS CCS to determine a diagnosis for 74 unblinded patient samples and subsequently conducted a blinded diagnostic study of 16 samples. Sensitivity and specificity for ALS detection in the 74 unblinded patient samples were 83\u221933% (CI 51\u221959 to 97\u221991%) and 76\u221992% (46\u221919 to 94\u221996%), respectively.

The present study aimed to use the novel limitless-arity multiple-testing procedure to filter these 50 clinical factors and thus yield combinations of no more than four factors that could potentially predict the onset of cardiovascular events. A Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to investigate the importance of the combinations.In a multi-centre observational trial, we prospectively enrolled 213 patients with HF who were hospitalized because of exacerbation, discharged according to HF treatment guidelines and observed to monitor cardiovascular events. After the observation period, we stratified patients according to whether they experienced cardiovascular events (rehospitalisation or cardiovascular death).Among 77,562 combinations of fewer than five clinical parameters, we identified 151 combinations that could potentially explain the occurrence of cardiovascular events. Of these, 145 combinations included the use of inotropic agents, whereas the remaining 6 included the use of diuretics without bradycardia or tachycardia, suggesting that the high probability of cardiovascular events is exclusively determined by these two clinical factors. Importantly, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves demonstrated that the use of inotropes or of diuretics without bradycardia or tachycardia were independent predictors of a markedly worse cardiovascular prognosis.Patients treated with either inotropic agents or diuretics without bradycardia or tachycardia were at a higher risk of cardiovascular events. The uses of these drugs, regardless of heart rate, are the strongest clinical predictors of cardiovascular events in patients with HF.",

     "abstract": "IL-33 may play a role in the vascular remodelling of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (PH) but the precise mechanisms are still unclear. We hypothesized that hypoxia promotes expression of IL-33 and its receptor ST2 on vascular endothelial cells, which in turn leads to dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells contributing to PH. Immunohistochemistry showed that immunoreactivity for IL-33 and ST2 was significantly increased in lung tissue of murine model of hypoxia-induced PH (HPH) and of subjects with bronchiectasis-PH. trans-Thoracic echocardiography showed that haemodynamic changes and right ventricular hypertrophy associated with HPH were significantly abrogated in St2\u2212/\u2212 compared with WT mice. Administration of IL-33 further exacerbated these changes in the hypoxia-exposed WT mice. In vitro, hypoxia significantly increased IL-33/ST2 expression by human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs), while exogenous IL-33 enhanced proliferation, adhesiveness and spontaneous angiogenesis of HPAECs. Knockdown of endogenous Il33 or St2 using siRNA transfection significantly suppressed these effects in both normoxic and hypoxic culture-conditions. Deletion of the St2 gene attenuated hypoxia-induced, elevated lung expression of HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA/VEGFR-2/ICAM-1, while administration of exogenous VEGFA partially reversed the attenuation of the haemodynamic indices of PH. Correspondingly, knockdown of the St2 or Hif1\u03b1 genes almost completely abrogated IL-33-induced expression of HIF-1\u03b1/VEGFA/VEGFR-2 by HPAECs in vitro. Further, IL-33-induced angiogenesis by HPAECs was extensively abrogated by knockdown of the Hif1\u03b1/Vegfa or Vegfr2 genes. These data suggest that hypoxia induces elevated expression of IL-33/ST2 by HPAECs which, at least partly by increasing downstream expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF initiates vascular remodelling resulting in HPH.",

There was no change in mRNA levels for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. Levels of \u03b1-SMA protein expression in patients treated with 40\u202fmg adalimumab (1.09\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fng per \u03bcg of total protein) were significantly lower (p\u202f=\u202f0.006) compared to placebo treated patients (1.51\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fng/\u03bcg). The levels of procollagen type I protein expression were also significantly lower (p\u202f<\u202f0.019) in the sub group treated with 40\u202fmg adalimumab (474\u202f\u00b1\u202f84\u202fpg/\u03bcg total protein) compared with placebo (817\u202f\u00b1\u202f78\u202fpg/\u03bcg). There were two serious adverse events, both considered unrelated to the study drug.In this dose-ranging study, injection of 40\u202fmg of adalimumab in 0.4\u202fml resulted in down regulation of the myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by reduction in expression of \u03b1-SMA and type I procollagen proteins at 2\u202fweeks. These data form the basis of an ongoing phase 2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intranodular injection of 40\u202fmg adalimumab in 0.4\u202fml compared to an equivalent volume of placebo in patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease.Health Innovation Challenge Fund (Wellcome Trust and Department of Health) and 180 Therapeutics LP.",

Although prior studies have explored the functional consequences of macrophage aging, less is known about its cellular basis or what defines the transition from physiologic aging to disease. Here, we show that despite their frequent self-renewal, macrophages from old mice exhibited numerous signs of aging, such as impaired oxidative respiration. Transcriptomic profiling of aged murine macrophages revealed dysregulation of diverse cellular pathways, especially in cholesterol homeostasis, that manifested in altered oxysterol signatures. Although the levels of numerous oxysterols in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma exhibited age-associated changes, plasma 24-hydroxycholesterol levels were specifically associated with AMD. These novel findings demonstrate that oxysterol levels can discriminate disease from physiologic aging. Furthermore, modulation of cholesterol homeostasis may be a novel strategy for treating age-associated diseases in which macrophage aging is pathogenic.",

Here we show that significantly elevated C5a and C5b-9 were found in patients with LN, which were notably correlated with proteinuria and different renal pathological indexes of LN. MSCs suppressed systemic and intrarenal activation of C5, increased the plasma levels of factor H (FH), and ameliorated renal disease in lupus mice. Importantly, MSCs transplantation up-regulated the decreased FH in patients with LN. Mechanistically, interferon-\u03b1 enhanced the secretion of FH by MSCs. These data demonstrate that MSCs inhibit the activation of pathogenic C5 via up-regulation of FH, which improves our understanding of the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment of lupus nephritis.",

Thus the mechanism involved in inflammation requires further elucidation. To explore the mechanisms by which MSCs respond to inflammatory stimuli, we investigated whether MSCs employed inflammasomes to participate in inflammation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that canonical NLRP3 and non-canonical caspase-11 inflammasomes were activated in bone-associated MSCs (BA-MSCs) to promote the inflammatory response. The NLRP3 inflammasome was activated to mainly elicit IL-1\u03b2/18 release, whereas the caspase-11 inflammasome managed pyroptosis. Furthermore, we sought a small molecule component (66PR) to inhibit the activation of inflammasomes in BA-MSCs, which consequently improved their survival and therapeutic potential in inflammation bowel diseases. These current findings indicated that MSCs themselves could directly promote the inflammatory response by an inflammasome-dependent pathway.

Thirty AR and 30 healthy children with or without obesity were enrolled. Serum leptin and OPN levels were measured and their relationship with TH1/2 cytokines was analyzed. TH cell differentiation and cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by leptin and/or OPN were analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Obese AR mice models were established to verify the effect of obesity on leptin and OPN as well TH regulation. Immunoprecipitation was performed to confirm the interaction between OPN and leptin in CD4+ T cells. Our results showed elevated serum leptin and OPN in AR children correlated with TH2 cytokines expression. Leptin and OPN enhanced TH2 inflammation in house dust mite stimulated PBMCs from AR children synergistically. Obese AR mice showed as more severe inflammatory reaction, symptoms and expression of nasal leptin and OPN compared with other groups. Immunoprecipitation suggested that OPN and leptin may interact with each other and this process may be mediated by \u03b14 integrin and PI3K/AKT pathway in CD4+ T cells.

However, little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the evolution of microinfarcts and potential treatment and prevention against these microvascular ischemic lesions. In the present study, the \u201csingle cortical microinfarct model\u201d generated via occluding a penetrating arteriole by femtosecond laser ablation and the \u201cmultiple diffuse microinfarcts model\u201d induced by unilateral injection of cholesterol crystals through the internal carotid artery were established to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the evolution of microinfarcts and the effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-3 PUFAs) on alleviating microinfarct burdens and functional deficits. The occlusion of a single penetrating arteriole led to a distinct cortical microinfarct, which manifested as neuronal loss and occupation of activated glial cells in the ischemic core. Using Fat-1 transgenic mice and fish oil supplements, we demonstrated that both endogenously-generated and exogenously-delivered \u03c9-3 PUFAs significantly inhibited the activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinases 1 (RIPK1) and its downstream apoptosis-associated proteins, mitigated cell apoptosis, and anatomically reduced the microinfarct size. The protective effects of \u03c9-3 PUFAs against microinfarcts were further verified in a multiple diffuse microinfarcts model, where \u03c9-3 PUFAs significantly attenuated cell apoptosis as revealed by TUNEL staining, alleviated the diffuse microinfarct burdens and remarkably improved the functional deficits as evidenced by reduced spontaneous anxiety, increased preference for the novel object, and improved hippocampal-based learning and short-term memory. Together, these findings demonstrate that enriched brain \u03c9-3 PUFAs are effective for reducing microinfarct burdens and improving the function deficits, which support the clinical research and application of \u03c9-3 PUFAs in the treatment or prophylaxis in vascular dementia.",

To test if reductions of KCC2 activity directly contribute to the pathophysiology of mTLE, we locally ablated KCC2 expression in a subset of principal neurons within the adult hippocampus. Deletion of KCC2 resulted in compromised GABAergic inhibition and the development of spontaneous, recurrent generalized seizures.

     "abstract": "Although psychotropic drugs act on neurons and glial cells, how glia respond, and whether glial responses are involved in therapeutic effects are poorly understood. Here, we show that fluoxetine (FLX), an anti-depressant, mediates its anti-depressive effect by increasing the gliotransmission of ATP. FLX increased ATP exocytosis via vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT). FLX-induced anti-depressive behavior was decreased in astrocyte-selective VNUT-knockout mice or when VNUT was deleted in mice, but it was increased when astrocyte-selective VNUT was overexpressed in mice. This suggests that VNUT-dependent astrocytic ATP exocytosis has a critical role in the therapeutic effect of FLX. Released ATP and its metabolite adenosine act on P2Y11 and adenosine A2b receptors expressed by astrocytes, causing an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor in astrocytes. These findings suggest that in addition to neurons, FLX acts on astrocytes and mediates its therapeutic effects by increasing ATP gliotransmission.",

However, clinical targeting of PGE2 with current non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase inhibitors has been limited due to risk of adverse side effects. By specifically targeting microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) activity with a small molecule inhibitor we could block CAF-derived PGE2 production leading to reduced tumor growth, impaired angiogenesis, inhibited CAF migration and infiltration, reduced tumor cell proliferation and a favorable shift in the M1/M2 macrophage ratio.

Therefore, we conducted an integrative analysis of multi-omic datasets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to search for association patterns beyond the genome and transcriptome. A large, complex, and robust gene network containing well-known lung cancer-related genes, including EGFR and TERT, was identified from combined gene lists for lung adenocarcinoma. Members of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) gene family were at the center of this network. Subsequent sequencing of network hub genes within a subset of samples from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung-International Lung Cancer Consortium (TRICL-ILCCO) consortium revealed a SNP (rs12614710) in EPAS1 associated with NSCLC that reached genome-wide significance (OR\u202f=\u202f1.50; 95% CI: 1.31\u20131.72; p\u202f=\u202f7.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129).

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations were evaluated and compared among hormone receptor (HR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) subgroups.The baseline gene mutation pattern (at the time of recruitment) varied among HR/HER2 subtypes. BRCA1 and MED12 were frequently mutated in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, PIK3CA and FAT1 mutations were frequent in HR+ patients, and PIK3CA and ERBB2 mutations were frequent in HER2+ patients.

     "abstract": "Previous transcriptomic analyses suggested that the 1918 influenza A virus (IAV1918), one of the most devastating pandemic viruses of the 20th century, induces a dysfunctional cytokine storm and affects other innate immune response patterns. Because all viruses are obligate parasites that require host cells for replication, we globally assessed how IAV1918 induces host protein dysregulation. We performed quantitative mass spectrometry of IAV1918-infected cells to measure host protein dysregulation. Selected proteins were validated by immunoblotting and phosphorylation levels of members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed. Compared to mock-infected controls, >170 proteins in the IAV1918-infected cells were dysregulated. Proteins mapped to amino sugar metabolism, purine metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, transmembrane receptors, phosphatases and transcription regulation. Immunoblotting demonstrated that IAV1918 induced a slight up-regulation of the lamin B receptor whereas all other tested virus strains induced a significant down-regulation. IAV1918 also strongly induced Rab5b expression whereas all other tested viruses induced minor up-regulation or down-regulation. IAV1918 showed early reduced phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway members and was especially sensitive to rapamycin. These results suggest the 1918 strain requires mTORC1 activity in early replication events, and may explain the unique pathogenicity of this virus.",

Principal components of exRNAs were associated with LVRm phenotypes post-MI; specifically, LV mass, LV ejection fraction, LV end systolic volume index, and fibrosis. We then investigated the temporal regulation and cellular origin of exRNAs in murine and cell models and found that: 1) plasma and tissue miRNA expression was temporally regulated; 2) the majority of the miRNAs were increased acutely in tissue and at sub-acute or chronic time-points in plasma; 3) miRNA expression was cell-specific; and 4) cardiomyocytes release a subset of the identified miRNAs packaged in exosomes into culture media in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation. In conclusion, we find that plasma exRNAs are temporally regulated and are associated with measures of post-MI LVRm.",

Moreover, transplantation of c-kit+ CPCs with miR-143 inhibitor improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction.

Inhibition of ileal mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin significantly attenuated the stimulation of bile acid secretion, TGR5 expression and GLP-1 synthesis induced by RYGB in lean and diet-induced obese mice. GLP-1 production and ileal TGR5-mTORC1 signaling were positively correlated with plasma deoxycholic acid (DCA) in mice. Treatment of STC-1 cells with DCA stimulated the production of GLP-1. This effect was associated with a significant enhancement of TGR5-mTORC1 signaling. siRNA knockdown of mTORC1 or TGR5 abolished the enhancement of GLP-1 synthesis induced by DCA.

Tissue engineering has emerged as a compelling strategy for the creation of blood vessels for reconstructive surgeries.One promising method to obtain a suitable vessel scaffold is decellularization of donor vascular tissue followed by recellularization with autologous cells. To prevent thrombosis of vascular grafts, a confluent and functional autologous endothelium is required, and researchers are still looking for the optimal cell source and recellularization procedure.Recellularization of a decellularized scaffold with only a small volume of whole blood was recently put forward as a feasible option. Here we show that, in contrast to the published results, this method fails to re-endothelialize decellularized veins. Only occasional nucleated cells were seen on the luminal surface of the scaffolds. Instead, we saw fibrin threads, platelets and scattered erythrocytes. Molecular remnants of the endothelial cells were still attached to the scaffold, which explains in part why earlier results were misinterpreted.Decellularized vascular tissues may still be the best scaffolds available for vascular tissue engineering. However, for the establishment of an adequate autologous endothelial lining, methods other than exposure to autologous whole blood need to be developed.",

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been widely used as a biomarker for PCa diagnosis, its results can be controversial. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed to enhance the clinical management of PCa. From publicly available microarray data, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by meta-analysis with RankProd. Genetic algorithm optimized artificial neural network (GA-ANN) was introduced to establish a diagnostic prediction model and to filter candidate genes. The diagnostic and prognostic capability of the prediction model and candidate genes were investigated in both GEO and TCGA datasets. Candidate genes were further validated by qPCR, Western Blot and Tissue microarray. By RankProd meta-analyses, 2306 significantly up- and 1311 down-regulated probes were found in 133 cases and 30 controls microarray data. The overall accuracy rate of the PCa diagnostic prediction model, consisting of a 15-gene signature, reached up to 100% in both the training and test dataset. The prediction model also showed good results for the diagnosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.953) and prognosis (AUC of 5\u202fyears overall survival time\u202f=\u202f0.808) of PCa in the TCGA database. The expression levels of three genes, FABP5, C1QTNF3 and LPHN3, were validated by qPCR. C1QTNF3 high expression was further validated in PCa tissue by Western Blot and Tissue microarray. In the GEO datasets, C1QTNF3 was a good predictor for the diagnosis of PCa (GSE6956: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.791; GSE8218: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.868; GSE26910: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.972). In the TCGA database, C1QTNF3 was significantly associated with PCa patient recurrence free survival (P\u202f<\u202f.001, AUC\u202f=\u202f0.57). In this study, we have developed a diagnostic and prognostic prediction model for PCa. C1QTNF3 was revealed as a promising biomarker for PCa.

Chronic allergen exposure sensitized one third of single DR1 transgenic mice, however, without impacting on lung function. Similar treatment led to AHR and Th2-driven lung pathology in >90% of TCR-DR1 mice. Prophylactic and therapeutic expansion of Tregs with IL-2-\u03b1IL-2 mAb complexes blocked the generation and boosting of allergen-specific IgE associated with chronic allergen exposure.We identify genetic restriction of allergen presentation as primary factor dictating allergic sensitization and disease against the major pollen allergen from the weed mugwort, which frequently causes sensitization and disease in humans.

Our analysis revealed that the heterogeneous molecular diversity of disease chapters and the blurred boundary between disease categories in ICD should be further investigated. Here, we propose a new classification of diseases (NCD) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles. With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure. Furthermore, NCD captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations, establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy.",

This study describes how Salmonella Typhi, the pathogen responsible for typhoid fever, uses similar strategies to escape immune defense responses and survive within its human host. To elucidate the early mechanisms of typhoid fever, we performed studies using healthy human intestinal tissue samples and \u201cmini-guts,\u201d organoids grown from intestinal tissue taken from biopsy specimens. We analyzed gene expression changes in human intestinal specimens and bacterial cells both separately and after colonization. Our results showed mechanistic strategies that S. Typhi uses to rearrange the cellular machinery of the host cytoskeleton to successfully invade the intestinal epithelium, promote polarized cytokine release and evade immune system activation by downregulating genes involved in antigen sampling and presentation during infection. This work adds novel information regarding S. Typhi infection pathogenesis in humans, by replicating work shown in traditional cell models, and providing new data that can be applied to future vaccine development strategies.",

Data were analysed against salivary cortisol and maternal diabetes severity and treatment (insulin [N\u202f=\u202f22] or metformin [N\u202f=\u202f23]) during pregnancy.GDM-exposed children had reduced cortical excitability (p\u202f=\u202f.003), LTD-like neuroplasticity (p\u202f=\u202f.005), and salivary cortisol (p\u202f<\u202f.001) when compared with control children. Higher maternal insulin resistance (IR) before and during GDM treatment was associated with a blunted neuroplastic response in children (p\u202f=\u202f.014) and this was not accounted for by maternal BMI. Additional maternal and neonatal measures, including fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers, predicted neurophysiological outcomes. The metformin and insulin treatment groups had similar outcomes.These results suggest that GDM can contribute to subtle differences in child neurophysiology, and possibly cortisol secretion, persisting into early adolescence. Importantly, these effects appear to occur during second trimester, before pharmacologic treatment typically commences, and can be predicted by maternal insulin resistance. Therefore, earlier detection and treatment of GDM may be warranted. Metformin appears to be safe for these aspects of neurodevelopment.",

By resolving the frequency and size distribution of OXPHOS-deficient clones, quantitative analysis shows that, in common with mouse, long-term maintenance of the colonic epithelial crypt relies on stochastic SC loss and replacement mediated by competition for limited niche access. We find that the colonic crypt is maintained by ~5 effective SCs. However, with a SC loss/replacement rate estimated to be slower than once per year, our results indicate that the vast majority of individual SC divisions result in asymmetric fate outcome.

Runt-related transcription factor 1(RUNX1) plays a vital role in hematopoiesis via Endothelial-to-Hematopoietic Transition (EHT), a process that is conceptually similar to EMT, but its role in EMT and renal fibrosis is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that RUNX1 is overexpressed in the processes of TGF-\u03b2-induced partial EMT and renal fibrosis and that the expression level of RUNX1 is SMAD3-dependent. Knockdown of RUNX1 attenuated both TGF-\u03b2-induced phenotypic changes and the expression levels of EMT marker genes in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). In addition, overexpression of RUNX1 promoted the expression of EMT marker genes in renal tubular epithelial cells. Moreover, RUNX1 promoted TGF-\u03b2-induced partial EMT by increasing transcription of the PI3K subunit p110\u03b4, which mediated Akt activation. Specific deletion of Runx1 in mouse RTECs attenuated renal fibrosis, which was induced by both unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and folic acid (FA) treatment.

We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation and copy-number calls from the same DNA assay in a cohort of healthy breast samples and age-matched normal samples collected adjacent to breast cancer. Using statistical methods to adjust for cell type heterogeneity, we show that DNA methylation changes can discriminate normal-adjacent from normal samples better than somatic copy-number variants. We validate this important finding in an independent dataset. These results suggest that DNA methylation alterations in the normal cell of origin may offer better cancer risk prediction and early detection markers than copy-number changes.",

     "abstract": "Although high mortality of lung cancer is greatly due to distant metastasis, the mechanism of this metastasis remains unclear. Here, we investigate in lung cancer that SOX30 is sharply under-expressed in metastatic tumors compared with non-metastatic tumors, and suppresses plenty of metastasis related processes or pathways. SOX30 strongly inhibits tumor cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Sox30 deficiency promotes lung metastasis in Sox30\u2212/\u2212 mice and this uncontrollable lung-metastasis is re-inhibited upon Sox30 re-expression. Mechanistically, SOX30 diminishes Wnt-signaling via directly transcriptional repressing \u03b2-catenin or interacting with \u03b2-catenin to compete with TCF for binding to \u03b2-catenin. The carboxyl-terminus of SOX30 is required for attenuating \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, whereas the amino-terminus of SOX30 is required for its interaction with \u03b2-catenin protein. Enhance of \u03b2-catenin attenuates the anti-metastatic role of SOX30. Moreover, Sox30 deficiency promotes tumor metastasis and reduces survival of mice. In addition, nuclear SOX30 expression is closely associated with metastasis and represents a favorable independent prognostic biomarker of lung cancer patients. Altogether, these results highlight an important role and mechanism of SOX30 in lung cancer metastasis, providing a potential therapeutic target for anti-metastasis.",

How AdPC cells survive these anti-cancer therapies and progress into t-NEPC remains unclear. By comparing the whole transcriptomes between AdPC and t-NEPC, we identified Bif-1, an apoptosis-associated gene, which undergoes alternative RNA splicing in t-NEPC. We found that while Bif-1a is the predominant variant of the Bif-1 gene in AdPC, two neural-specific variants, Bif-1b and Bif-1c, are highly expressed in t-NEPC patients, patient derived xenografts, and cell models. The neural-specific RNA splicing factor, SRRM4, promotes Bif-1b and Bif-1c splicing, and the expression of SRRM4 in tumors is strongly associated with Bif-1b/-1c levels. Furthermore, we showed that Bif-1a is pro-apoptotic, while Bif-1b and Bif-1c are anti-apoptotic in PCa cells under camptothecin and UV light irritation treatments. Taken together, our data indicate that SRRM4 regulates alternative RNA splicing of the Bif-1 gene that enables PCa cells resistant to apoptotic stimuli under anti-cancer therapies, and may contribute to AdPC progression into t-NEPC.",

The enhanced migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation was notably absent in response to hydroxylase activity blockade. Vimentin, a regulator of EMT, interacted with ASPH and likely mediated the effect of ASPH hydroxylase activity with cell migration. The enhanced hydroxylase activity in tumor tissues predicted worse prognoses of HCC patients.

In a mouse model of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, 6% of 6215 proteins and 1.6% of 8183 phosphopeptides changed in abundance, indicating conservation of proteostasis and phosphorylation signaling. The proteomic analysis confirmed changes in abundance of proteins that regulate dopamine synthesis and transport, synaptic activity and integrity, and unearthed changes in mRNA binding, processing and protein translation. Phosphorylation signaling changes centered on axonal and synaptic cytoskeletal organization and structural integrity. Proteostatic responses included a significant increase in the levels of Lmp7, a component of the immunoproteasome. Increased Lmp7 levels and activity were also quantified in postmortem human brains with PD and dementia with Lewy bodies. Functionally, the immunoproteasome degrades \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and generates potentially antigenic peptides.

These ideas include the inflammation-induced activation of the kynurenine pathway and its role in feeding and metabolism by activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and by modulating synaptic transmission in the brain. Evidence for a role of the kynurenine pathway in carcinogenesis then provides a potentially major link between obesity and cancer. A second new hypothesis is based on evidence that serine proteases can deplete cells of the tumour suppressors Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and neogenin. These enzymes include mammalian chymotryptic proteases released by pro-inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages. Blood levels of chymotrypsin itself increase in parallel with food intake. The mechanistically similar bacterial enzyme subtilisin is widespread in the environment, animal probiotics, meat processing and cleaning products. Simple public health schemes in these areas, with selective serine protease inhibitors and AHR antagonists and could prevent a range of intestinal and other cancers.",

Following injury, zebrafish and avian MGCs can efficiently re-enter the cell cycle, proliferate and generate new functional neurons.

Here, we showed that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) damage stimulates murine MGCs to re-enter the cell cycle and de-differentiate back to a progenitor-like stage. These events are dependent on the recruitment of endogenous bone marrow cells (BMCs), which, in turn, is regulated by the stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1)-C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) pathway. BMCs mobilized into the damaged retina can fuse with resident MGCs, and the resulting hybrids undergo reprogramming followed by re-differentiation into cells expressing markers of ganglion and amacrine neurons. Our findings constitute an important proof-of-principle that mammalian MGCs retain their regenerative potential, and that such potential can be activated via cell fusion with recruited BMCs. In this perspective, our study could contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies based on the enhancement of mammalian endogenous repair capabilities.",

Optical structures of the anterior segment of the eyes, such as the lens and cornea, can be readily reconstructed to improve refraction and vision quality. However, the effects of visual restoration on human brain function and structure remain largely unexplored.A prospective, controlled clinical trial was conducted. Twenty-six patients with bilateral age-related cataracts (ARCs) who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation and 26 healthy controls without ARC, matched for age, sex, and education, were recruited. Visual functions (including visual acuity, visual evoke potential, and contrast sensitivity), the Mini-Mental State Examination and functional magnetic resonance imaging (including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and grey matter volume variation) were assessed for all the participants and reexamined for ARC patients after cataract surgery. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02644720).Compared with the healthy controls, the ARC patients presented decreased brain functionality as well as structural alterations in visual and cognitive-related brain areas preoperatively. Three months postoperatively, significant functional improvements were observed in the visual and cognitive-related brain areas of the patients. Six months postoperatively, the patients' grey matter volumes in these areas were significantly increased. Notably, both the function and structure in the visual and cognitive-related brain areas of the patients improved significantly and became comparable to those of the healthy controls 6\u00a0months postoperatively.We demonstrated that ocular reconstruction can functionally and structurally reverse cataract-induced brain changes.

However, deep learning-based cross-site transfer classification, despite less imaging site-specificity and more generalizability of diagnostic models, has not been investigated in schizophrenia.A large multi-site functional MRI sample (n\u202f=\u202f734, including 357 schizophrenic patients from seven imaging resources) was collected, and a deep discriminant autoencoder network, aimed at learning imaging site-shared functional connectivity features, was developed to discriminate schizophrenic individuals from healthy controls.Accuracies of approximately 85\u00b70% and 81\u00b70% were obtained in multi-site pooling classification and leave-site-out transfer classification, respectively.

Moreover, XPF rs2276466 was also associated with increased neuroblastoma risk (GG vs. CC: adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.66, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20132.71, P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). In the combined analysis of ERCC1, we found that carriers with 2\u20133 risk genotypes were more likely to get risk of neuroblastoma, when compared to those with 0\u20131 risk genotype (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.75; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.25\u20132.45, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0012). Our study indicates that common genetic variations in ERCC1/XPF genes predispose to neuroblastoma risk, which needs to be further validated by ongoing efforts.",

By random forest modeling, we nominated a list of urine proteins that could separate lung cancers from other cases. With a feature selection algorithm, we selected a panel of five urinary biomarkers (FTL: Ferritin light chain; MAPK1IP1L: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 Interacting Protein 1 Like; FGB: Fibrinogen Beta Chain; RAB33B: RAB33B, Member RAS Oncogene Family; RAB15: RAB15, Member RAS Oncogene Family) and established a combinatorial model that can correctly classify the majority of lung cancer cases both in the training set (n\u00a0=\u00a046) and the test sets (n\u00a0=\u00a014\u201347 per set) with an AUC ranging from 0.8747 to 0.9853. A combination of five urinary biomarkers not only discriminates lung cancer patients from control groups but also differentiates lung cancer from other common tumors. The biomarker panel and the predictive model, when validated by more samples in a multi-center setting, may be used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool along with imaging technology for lung cancer detection.",

     "abstract": "Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The SEPT9 gene is a key regulator of cell division and tumor suppressor whose hypermethylation is associated with liver carcinogenesis. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a PCR-based assay for the analysis of SEPT9 promoter methylation in circulating cell-free DNA (mSEPT9) for diagnosing HCC among cirrhotic patients.We report two phase II biomarker studies that included cirrhotic patients with or without HCC from France (initial study) and Germany (replication study). All patients received clinical and biological evaluations, and liver imaging according to current recommendations. The primary outcome was defined as the presence of HCC according to guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan and systematically discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting. HCC-free cirrhotic patients were recruited if the screening abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of HCC at the time of blood sampling for the mSEPT9 test and on the next visit six months later. The adjudicating physicians were blinded to patient results associated with the mSEPT9 test.We included 289 patients with cirrhosis (initial: 186; replication: 103), among whom 98 had HCC (initial: 51; replication: 47). The mSEPT9 test exhibited high diagnostic accuracy for HCC diagnosis, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.944 (0.900\u20130.970, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in the initial study (replication: 0.930 [0.862\u20130.971, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001]; meta-analysis: AUROC\u00a0=\u00a00.940 [0.910\u20130.970, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001], no heterogeneity: I2\u00a0=\u00a00%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.67; and no publication bias). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of positive mSEPT9 triplicates was the only independent variable significantly associated with HCC diagnosis (initial: OR\u00a0=\u00a06.30, for each mSEPT9 positive triplicate [2.92\u201313.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001]; replication: OR\u00a0=\u00a06.07 [3.25\u201311.35, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001]; meta-analysis: OR\u00a0=\u00a06.15 [2.93\u20139.38, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001], no heterogeneity: I2\u00a0=\u00a00%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.95; no publication bias).

     "abstract": "The long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is frequently dysregulated in human cancers; however, its roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) development are largely unknown. Here, we reported that MEG3 was down-regulated in CRC tissues and CRC patients with lower MEG3 showed poorer overall survival and disease-free survival than those with higher MEG3 level. MEG3 over-expression represses CRC cells proliferation and migration in vivo and in vitro, while MEG3 knockdown leads to the enhanced proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. In CRC cells, MEG3 over-expression is related to decreased Clusterin mRNA and the corresponding protein levels, and it also directly binds to Clusterin protein through its 732\u20131174 region. In further, Clusterin over-expression rescues the compromised abilities of proliferation and metastasis induced by MEG3 over-expression, suggesting that MEG3 inhibits the CRC progression through regulating the Clusterin activities. Additionally, we found that 1\u03b1,25-(OH)2D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) stimulate MEG3 expression in CRC cells through directly binding to its promoter. These results suggested that MEG3 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC via regulating the Clusterin activities and may underlie the anticancer activities of vitamin D on CRC cells. The VDR/MEG3/Clusterin signaling pathway may serve as potential therapeutic targets and prognosis biomarkers for CRC patients in future.",

The native E. coli l-asparaginase used in Brazil until recently has been manufactured by Medac/Kyowa. Then a decision was taken by the Ministry of Health in 2017 to supply the National Health System with a cheaper alternative l-asparaginase manufactured by Beijing SL Pharmaceutical, called Leuginase\u00ae. As opposed to Medac, the asparaginase that has been in use in Brazil under the trade name of Aginasa\u00ae, it was not possible to find a single entry with the terms Leuginase in the Pubmed repository. The apparent lack of clinical studies and the scarcity of safety information provided to the hospitals by the drug distributor created a debate among Brazilian pediatric oncologists about issues of safety and efficacy that culminated eventually in a court decision to halt the distribution of the new drug all over the country. Boldrini Children's Center, a non-profit pediatric oncohematology hospital, has conducted its own evaluation of Leuginase\u00ae. Mass spectrometry analyses found at least 12 different contaminating host-cell proteins (HCP) in Leuginase\u00ae. The presence of two HCP (beta-lactamase and malate dehydrogenase) was confirmed by orthogonal methodologies. The relative number of HCP peptides ranged from 19 to 37% of the total peptides identified by mass spectrometry. In vivo studies in mice injected with Leuginase\u00ae revealed a 3 times lower plasma bioavailability and the development of higher antibody titres against l-asparaginase in comparison to Aginasa\u00ae-injected animals. The decision to buy a new drug based on its price alone is not safe. Developing countries are especially vulnerable to cheaper alternatives that lack solid quality assurance.",

Breast milk is an important route of HCMV transmission in humans and we hypothesized that mammary epithelial cells could be one of the main cellular targets of HCMV infection.The infectivity of primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) was assessed following infection with the HCMV-DB strain, a clinical isolate with a marked macrophage-tropism. The impact of HCMV-DB infection on expression of p53 and retinoblastoma proteins, telomerase activity and oncogenic pathways (c-Myc, Akt, Ras, STAT3) was studied. Finally the transformation of HCMV-DB infected HMECs was evaluated using soft agar assay. CTH cells (CMV Transformed HMECs) were detected in prolonged cultures of infected HMECs. Tumor formation was observed in NOD/SCID Gamma (NSG) mice injected with CTH cells. Detection of long non coding RNA4.9 (lncRNA4.9) gene was assessed in CTH cells, tumors isolated from xenografted NSG mice and biopsies of patients with breast cancer using qualitative and quantitative PCR.We found that HCMV, especially a clinical strain named HCMV-DB, infects HMECs in vitro. The clinical strain HCMV-DB replicates productively in HMECs as evidenced by detection of early and late viral transcripts and proteins. Following infection of HMECs with HCMV-DB, we observed the inactivation of retinoblastoma and p53 proteins, the activation of telomerase activity, the activation of the proto-oncogenes c-Myc and Ras, the activation of Akt and STAT3, and the upregulation of cyclin D1 and Ki67 antigen. Colony formation was observed in soft agar seeded with HCMV-DB-infected HMECs. Prolonged culture of infected HMECs resulted in the development of clusters of spheroid cells that we called CTH cells (CMV Transformed HMECs). CTH cells when injected in NOD/SCID Gamma (NSG) mice resulted in the development of tumors. We detected in CTH cells the presence of a HCMV signature corresponding to a sequence of the long noncoding RNA4.9 (lncRNA4.9) gene. We also found the presence of the HCMV lncRNA4.9 sequence in tumors isolated from xenografted NSG mice injected with CTH cells and in biopsies of patients with breast cancer using qualitative and quantitative PCR.Our data indicate that key molecular pathways involved in oncogenesis are activated in HCMV-DB-infected HMECs that ultimately results in the transformation of HMECs in vitro with the appearance of CMV-transformed HMECs (CTH cells) in culture. CTH cells display a HCMV signature corresponding to a lncRNA4.9 genomic sequence and give rise to fast growing triple-negative tumors in NSG mice. A similar lncRNA4.9 genomic sequence was detected in tumor biopsies of patients with breast cancer.",

It remained unknown whether environmental factors were associated with the levels of other EBV antibodies, such as Zta-IgA, EA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA, and LMP1-IgA, in the lytic and latent infection periods. We aimed to investigate the possible environmental inducers that could affect EBV antibody levels in two independent healthy male populations from endemic NPC areas in South China (N\u00a0=\u00a01498) and non-endemic NPC areas in North China (N\u00a0=\u00a01961).

     "abstract": "The inflammatory properties of the enteric microbiota of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals are of considerable interest because of strong evidence that bacterial translocation contributes to chronic immune activation and disease progression. Altered enteric microbiota composition occurs with HIV infection but whether altered microbiota composition or increased intestinal permeability alone drives peripheral immune activation is controversial. To comprehensively assess the inflammatory properties of HIV-associated enteric microbiota and relate these to systemic immune activation, we developed methods to purify whole fecal bacterial communities (FBCs) from stool for use in in vitro immune stimulation assays with human cells. We show that the enteric microbiota of untreated HIV-infected subjects induce significantly higher levels of activated monocytes and T cells compared to seronegative subjects. FBCs from anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-treated HIV-infected individuals induced intermediate T cell activation, indicating an only partial correction of adaptive immune cell activation capacity of the microbiome with ART. In vitro activation levels correlated with activation levels and viral load in blood and were particularly high in individuals harboring specific gram-positive opportunistic pathogens. Blockade experiments implicated Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and Toll-Like Receptor-2 (TLR2), which recognizes peptidoglycan, as strong mediators of T cell activation; This may contradict a previous focus on lipopolysaccharide as a primary mediator of chronic immune activation. These data support that increased inflammatory properties of the enteric microbiota and not increased permeability alone drives chronic inflammation in HIV.",

     "abstract": "Anti-retroviral therapy successfully suppresses HIV-1 infection, but fails to provide a cure. During infection Type 1 IFNs normally play an essential role in viral clearance, but in vivo IFN-\u03b1 only has a modest impact on HIV-1 infection, suggesting its possible targeting by HIV. Here, we report that the HIV protein, Vif, inhibits effective IFN-\u03b1 signalling via degradation of essential JAK/STAT pathway components. We found that STAT1 and STAT3 are specifically reduced in HEK293T cells expressing Vif and that full length, infectious HIV-1 IIIB strain promotes their degradation in a Vif-dependent manner. HIV-1 IIIB infection of myeloid ThP-1 cells also reduced the IFN-\u03b1-mediated induction of the anti-viral gene, ISG15, but not MxA, revealing a functional consequence of this HIV-1-mediated immune evasion strategy. Interestingly, while total STAT levels were not reduced upon in vitro IIIB infection of primary human PBMCs, IFN-\u03b1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ISG induction were starkly reduced, with removal of Vif (IIIB\u0394Vif), partially restoring pSTATs, ISG15 and MxB induction. Similarly, pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 expression and IFN-\u03b1-induced ISG15 were reduced in PBMCs from HIV-infected patients, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b1 pre-treatment of a CEM T lymphoblast cells significantly inhibited HIV infection/replication (measured by cellular p24), only in the absence of Vif (IIIB\u0394Vif), but was unable to suppress full length IIIB infection. When analysing the mechanism by which Vif might target the JAK/STAT pathway, we found Vif interacts with both STAT1 and STAT3, (but not STAT2), and its expression promotes ubiquitination and MG132-sensitive, proteosomal degradation of both proteins. Vif's Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box binding motif enables the formation of an active E3 ligase complex, which we found to be required for Vif's degradation of STAT1 and STAT3. In fact, the E3 ligase scaffold proteins, Cul5 and Rbx2, were also found to be essential for Vif-mediated proteasomal degradation of STAT1 and STAT3. These results reveal a target for HIV-1-Vif and demonstrate how HIV-1 impairs the anti-viral activity of Type 1 IFNs, possibly explaining why both endogenous and therapeutic IFN-\u03b1 fail to activate more effective control over HIV infection.",

Patients with aqueous humor that tested negative for EBOV RNA were eligible to proceed with manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS).We screened 137 EVD survivors from June 2016 \u2013 August 2017 for enrolment. We enrolled 50 EVD survivors; 46 with visually significant cataract, 1 with a subluxated lens, 2 with active uveitis and 1 with a blind painful eye due to uveitis. The median age was 24.0\u00a0years (IQR 17\u201335) and 35 patients (70%) were female. The median logMAR visual acuity (VA) was 3.0 (Snellen VA Hand motions; Interquartile Range, IQR: 1.2-3.0, Snellen VA 20/320 \u2013 Hand motions). All patients tested negative for EBOV RNA by RT-PCR in aqueous humor/vitreous fluid and conjunctiva at a median of 19\u00a0months (IQR 18-20) from EVD diagnosis in Phase 1 of ocular fluid sampling and 34\u00a0months (IQR 32-36) from EVD diagnosis in Phase 2 of ocular fluid sampling.

Certain inflammatory cytokines showed correlation with the chemokine CCL2 and VEGF-A in visceral adipose tissues. Our findings suggest that the inflammatory cytokine profile in metabolic syndrome is more complex than what is currently perceived and that chronic inflammation in obese patients likely results from incremental contribution from different cytokines and possibly other inflammatory mediators from within and outside the adipose tissues. It is possible that this obesity associated chronic inflammation is not predicted by a single mediator, but rather includes a large spectrum of possible profiles.",

     "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) belong to a recently discovered class of molecules proposed to regulate various cellular processes. Here, we systematically analyzed their expression in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) and found that a limited set was differentially expressed in obesity and/or the insulin resistant state. Two lncRNAs herein termed adipocyte-specific metabolic related lncRNAs, ASMER-1 and ASMER-2 were enriched in adipocytes and regulated by both obesity and insulin resistance. Knockdown of either ASMER-1 or ASMER-2 by antisense oligonucleotides in in vitro differentiated human adipocytes revealed that both genes regulated adipogenesis, lipid mobilization and adiponectin secretion. The observed effects could be attributed to crosstalk between ASMERs and genes within the master regulatory pathways for adipocyte function including PPARG and INSR. Altogether, our data demonstrate that lncRNAs are modulators of the metabolic and secretory functions in human fat cells and provide an emerging link between WAT and common metabolic conditions.",

Thus, longevity of model organisms is increased by extra supply of the most abundant natural cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, but not by that of the most abundant saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid. Here, we systematically compared the capacity of different saturated, cis-unsaturated and alien (industrial or ruminant) trans-unsaturated fatty acids to provoke cellular stress in vitro, on cultured human cells expressing a battery of distinct biosensors that detect signs of autophagy, Golgi stress and the unfolded protein response. In contrast to cis-unsaturated fatty acids, trans-unsaturated fatty acids failed to stimulate signs of autophagy including the formation of GFP-LC3B-positive puncta, production of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, and activation of the transcription factor TFEB. When combined effects were assessed, several trans-unsaturated fatty acids including elaidic acid (the trans-isomer of oleate), linoelaidic acid, trans-vaccenic acid and palmitelaidic acid, were highly efficient in suppressing autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by palmitic, but not by oleic acid. Elaidic acid also inhibited autophagy induction by palmitic acid in vivo, in mouse livers and hearts. We conclude that the well-established, though mechanistically enigmatic toxicity of trans-unsaturated fatty acids may reside in their capacity to abolish cytoprotective stress responses induced by saturated fatty acids.",

CD4+ T cells from ND individuals were grouped into responder or non-responder T cells according to effects of GABA (100\u00a0nM, 500\u00a0nM) on the cell proliferation.

GABA concentrations in plasma from T1D patients and ND individuals were correlated with 10 cytokines where 7 were increased in plasma of T1D patients. GABA inhibited secretion of 5 of these cytokines from both T1D PBMCs and ND responder T cells.

However, the generalizability of such metabolic remodeling to other modes of M1 macrophage stimulation, e.g. type II interferons (IFNs) such as IFN\u03b3, has remained unknown as has the functional significance of aerobic glycolysis during macrophage activation. Here we demonstrate that IFN\u03b3 induces a rapid activation of aerobic glycolysis followed by a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation in M1 macrophages. Elevated glycolytic flux sustains cell viability and inflammatory activity, while limiting reliance on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) distributed by aerobic glycolysis is critical for sustaining IFN-\u03b3 triggered JAK (Janus tyrosine kinase)-STAT-1 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1) signaling with phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT-1 as its signature trait. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis not only blocks the M1 phenotype and pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in murine macrophages and also human monocytes/macrophages.

Here we investigated the possible dependence of brain gray matter volume reduction in the absence of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele DRB1*13:02 which prevents brain atrophy in Gulf War Illness (James et al., 2017).Seventy-one cognitively healthy women (32\u201369\u00a0years old) underwent a structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) scan to measure the volumes of total gray matter, cerebrocortical gray matter, and subcortical gray matter. Participants were assigned to two groups, depending on whether they lacked the DRB1*13:02 allele (No DRB1*13:02 group, N\u00a0=\u00a060) or carried the DRB1*13:02 allele (N\u00a0=\u00a011). We assessed the change of brain gray matter volume with age in each group by performing a linear regression where the brain volume (adjusted for total intracranial volume) was the dependent variable and age was the independent variable.In the No DRB1*13:02 group, the volumes of total gray matter, cerebrocortical gray matter, and subcortical gray matter were reduced highly significantly. In contrast, none of these volumes showed a statistically significant reduction with age in the DRB1*13:02 group.These findings document the protective effect of DRB1*13:02 on age-dependent reduction of brain gray matter in healthy individuals. Since the role of this allele is to connect to matching epitopes of external antigens for the subsequent production of antibodies and elimination of the offending antigen, we hypothesize that its protective effect may be due to the successful elimination of such antigens to which we are exposed during the lifespan, antigens that otherwise would persist causing gradual brain atrophy. In addition, we consider a possible beneficial role of DRB1*13:02 attributed to its binding to cathepsin S, a known harmful substance in brain aging (Wendt et al., 2008). Of course, other factors covarying with the presence of DRB1*13:02 could be involved.",

In order to understand hippocampal epileptogenesis in MTLE, it seems important to clarify any discrepancies between the clinical and pathological features of affected patients. Here we investigated epileptiform activities ex vivo using living hippocampal tissue taken from patients with MTLE. Flavoprotein fluorescence imaging and local field potential recordings revealed that epileptiform activities developed from the subiculum. Moreover, physiological and morphological experiments revealed possible impairment of K+ clearance in the subiculum affected by HS. Stimulation of mossy fibers induced recurrent trans-synaptic activity in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, suggesting that mossy fiber sprouting in HS also contributes to the epileptogenic mechanism.

Samples from 64 children and adolescents were analyzed: 10 with Pdmx-NT1, 6 with sNT1, 16 Pandemrix-vaccinated, 16 H1N1 infected, and 16 unvaccinated healthy individuals. The diagnosis of NT1 was defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine international criteria of sleep disorders v3.Our data showed that although the immunoprofiles toward vaccination were generally similar in study groups, there were also striking differences in immunoprofiles between sNT1 and Pdmx-NT1 groups as compared with controls. Prominent immune response was observed to a peptide epitope derived from prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1), as well as peptides homologous to B cell lymphoma 6 protein. Further validation confirmed that these can act as true antigenic targets in discriminating NT1 diseased along with a novel epitope of hemagglutinin of H1N1 to delineate exposure to H1N1.We propose that DP1 is a novel molecular target of autoimmune response and presents a potential diagnostic biomarker for NT1. DP1 is involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and thus alterations in its functions could contribute to the disturbed sleep regulation in NT1 that warrants further studies.

Retarded resolution was linked to the loss of M2-type resident macrophages, which secreted MMP-12 through IL-4 and IL-13-mediated phospho-STAT6 activation. We conclude that IL-4R\u03b1 signaling regulates macrophage functional polarization in a context-dependent manner. Pharmacological targeting of macrophage polarization therefore requires disease stage-specific treatment strategies.Alternative (M2-type) macrophage activation through IL-4R\u03b1 promotes liver inflammation and fibrosis progression but speeds up fibrosis reversal. This demonstrates context dependent, opposing roles of M2-type macrophages. During reversal IL-4R\u03b1 induces fibrolytic MMPs, especially MMP-12, through STAT6. Liver-specific antisense oligonucleotides efficiently block IL-4R\u03b1 expression and attenuate fibrosis progression.",

In humans, AAT is encoded by the SERPINA1 (hSERPINA1) gene in which a point mutation (commonly referred to as PiZ) causes aggregation of the miss-folded protein in hepatocytes resulting in subsequent liver damage. In an attempt to rescue the pathologic liver phenotype of a mouse model of human AAT deficiency (AATD), we used adenovirus to deliver Cas9 and a guide-RNA (gRNA) molecule targeting hSERPINA1. Our single dose therapeutic gene editing approach completely reverted the phenotype associated with the PiZ mutation, including circulating transaminase and human AAT (hAAT) protein levels, liver fibrosis and protein aggregation. Furthermore, liver histology was significantly improved regarding inflammation and overall morphology in hSERPINA1 gene edited PiZ mice. Genomic analysis confirmed significant disruption to the hSERPINA1 transgene resulting in a reduction of hAAT protein levels and quantitative mRNA analysis showed a reduction in fibrosis and hepatocyte proliferation as a result of editing. Our findings indicate that therapeutic gene editing in hepatocytes is possible in an AATD mouse model.",

Secondary outcomes at the 1-month follow-up were percentage days abstinent (PDA) from cocaine, and longest period (days) of continuous abstinence (LPA) in the prior 28\u00a0days.Outcomes were analysed as an unadjusted group mean difference (with Hedge's g effect size [ES]) and a 95% Confidence Interval [CI] for the primary outcome and a 90% CI for the secondary outcomes. Exploratory, multivariable linear (primary outcome) and Poisson regression models (secondary outcomes), with sex, age, months of regular cocaine use, baseline outcome score, and group estimated the effectiveness of the intervention. The trial is registered with the ISCRTN (ISRCTN16462783).Between July 15, 2015, and November 27, 2016, 58 patients were assessed for eligibility and 30 participants were randomised (14 to the control group and 16 to the intervention). With outcome data collected for all participants at the endpoint, the intervention group mean CEQ-F score (14\u00b777; SD 21\u00b747) was lower than the control group mean (51\u00b775; SD 22\u00b772); ES -1\u00b762; 95% CI -2\u00b745 to \u22120\u00b780.MFCT was associated with more cocaine abstinence in the intervention group (PDA 85\u00b794; SD 18\u00b796) than the control group (PDA 54\u00b759; SD 30\u00b729); ES 1\u00b719; 90% CI 0\u00b754 to 1\u00b784.

Constitutively active EGFR mutations, including in-frame deletion in exon 19 and L858R point mutation in exon 21, contribute about 90% of all EGFR-activating mutations in NSCLC. Although oral EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), gefitinib and erlotinib, show dramatic clinical efficacy with significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients harboring these EGFR-activating mutations, most of these patients will eventually develop acquired resistance. Researchers have recently named genomic instability as one of the hallmarks of cancer. Genomic instability usually involves a transient phase of polyploidization, in particular tetraploidization. Tetraploid cells can undergo asymmetric cell division or chromosome loss, leading to tumor heterogeneity and multidrug resistance. Therefore, identification of signaling pathways involved in tetraploidization is crucial in overcoming drug resistance. In our present study, we found that gefitinib could activate YAP-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK-STAT3 signaling and induce tetraploidization in gefitinib-resistance cells. Using p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB203580 and losmapimod, we could eliminate gefitinib-induced tetraploidization and overcome gefitinib-resistance. In addition, shRNA approach to knockdown p38\u03b1 MAPK could prevent tetraploidy formation and showed significant inhibition of cancer cell growth. Finally, in an in vivo study, losmapimod could successfully overcome gefitinib resistance using an in-house established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model. Overall, these findings suggest that losmapimod could be a potential clinical agent to overcome gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.",

However, the clinical relevance and biological insight of TET1 expression in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) is unknown. In this study, quantification of TET1 transcript by real-time quantitative PCR in bone marrow blasts was performed in 360 CN-AML patients. As a result, high TET1 expression was more common in M0/M1 morphology and genes of NPM1 mutations, and underrepresented in CEBPA double allele mutations in our AML patients. In addition, we found overexpression of TET1 was associated with an inferior overall survival and event free survival in the two independent cohorts. Notably, mRNA and miRNA integrative analyses showed aberrant expression of several hub oncogenes appear to be regulated by some miRNAs like miR-127-5p, miR-494, miR-21 and miR-616 in high TET1 expressers. In conclusion, the TET1 gene expression might serve as a reliable predictor for patients survival in AML.",

Molecular HAdV monitoring of serial stool samples using RQ-PCR was performed in 304 children undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Analysis of stool and peripheral blood specimens was performed pre-transplant and at short intervals until day 100 post-HSCT. The virus was detected in the stool of 129 patients (42%), and 42 tested positive already before HSCT. The patients displaying HAdV shedding pre-transplant showed a significantly earlier increase of intestinal HAdV levels above the critical threshold associated with high risk of invasive infection (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In this subset of patients, the occurrence of invasive infection characterized by viremia was significantly higher than in patients without HAdV shedding before HSCT (33% vs 7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The data demonstrate that intestinal HAdV shedding before HSCT confers a greatly increased risk for invasive infection and disseminated disease post-transplant, and highlights the need for timely HAdV monitoring and pre-emptive therapeutic considerations in HSCT recipients.",

Incident case data was obtained from the Chinese Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System. The relative risk of scarlet fever in recent outbreak years 2011\u20132016 was calculated using the median age-standardised incidence rate, compared to years 2003\u20132010 prior this outbreak. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 32 emm12 scarlet fever isolates and 13 emm12 non-scarlet fever isolates collected from different geographic regions of China, and compared with 203 published emm12 S. pyogenes genomes predominantly from scarlet fever outbreaks in Hong Kong (n\u00a0=\u00a0134) and the United Kingdom (n\u00a0=\u00a063).

Myeloid cells required Hck for the vesicle-associated release of ADAM17.

The other contents of HIV-pEV, however, including miRNA and effector protein profiles, as well as the presence of haptoglobin suggested hepatocytes as a possible cellular source.

Each child had participated in a training programme consisting of active training of the involved hand for 2\u00a0h every day during a 2-month training period. The training outcome was measured using Assisting Hand Assessment before and after the training period. Saliva was collected for genotyping of COMT, DAT, DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, and BDNF. Regression analyses were used to examine associations between genetic variation and training outcome.There was a statistically significant association between variation in dopamine genes and treatment outcome. Children with a high polygenic dopamine gene score including polymorphisms of five dopamine genes (COMT, DAT, DRD1, DRD2, and DRD3), and reflecting higher endogenous dopaminergic neurotransmission, had the greatest functional outcome gains after intervention.Naturally occurring genetic variation in the dopamine system can influence treatment outcomes in children with cerebral palsy.

Sequence analysis indicated the importance of p.Ile154, p.Arg679 and p.Lys687 in maintaining class specificity. Thus the observed association of PCDHG genes encoding neural adhesion proteins reinforces the hypothesis of aberrant neuronal connectivity in the pathophysiology of dyslexia.

Although dysregulation of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is viewed as a pathogenic factor in the development of fatty liver its role has not been directly demonstrated. Unexpectedly, we show here that liver-specific AMPK KO mice display normal hepatic lipid homeostasis and are not prone to fatty liver development, indicating that the decreases in AMPK activity associated with hepatic steatosis may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of changes in hepatic metabolism. In contrast, we found that pharmacological re-activation of downregulated AMPK in fatty liver is sufficient to normalize hepatic lipid content. Mechanistically, AMPK activation reduces hepatic triglyceride content both by inhibiting lipid synthesis and by stimulating fatty acid oxidation in an LKB1-dependent manner, through a transcription-independent mechanism. Furthermore, the effect of the antidiabetic drug metformin on lipogenesis inhibition and fatty acid oxidation stimulation was enhanced by combination treatment with small-molecule AMPK activators in primary hepatocytes from mice and humans. Overall, these results demonstrate that AMPK downregulation is not a triggering factor in fatty liver development but in contrast, establish the therapeutic impact of pharmacological AMPK re-activation in the treatment of fatty liver disease.",

     "abstract": "The circadian system controls the behavior and multiple physiological functions. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acts as the master pacemaker and regulates the circadian clocks of peripheral tissues. The SCN receives information regarding the light-dark cycle and is thus synchronized to the external 24-hour environment. In contrast, peripheral clocks, such as the liver clock, receive information from the SCN and other factors; in particular, food intake which leads to insulin secretion induces strong entrainment of the liver clock. On the other hand, the liver clock of insulin-depleted mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ) has been shown to be entrained by scheduled feeding, suggesting that insulin is not necessary for entrainment of the liver clock by feeding. In this study, we aimed to elucidate additional mechanism on entraining liver clock by feeding a protein-only diet and/or amino-acid administration which does not increase insulin levels. We demonstrated that protein-only diet and cysteine administration elicit entrainment of the liver clock via glucagon secretion and/or insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) production. Our findings suggest that glucagon and/or IGF-1 production are additional key factors in food-induced entrainment.",

However, systemic activation of LXRs triggers excessive lipogenesis in the liver and infusion of HDL downregulates cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Here we describe an enlightened strategy using phospholipid reconstituted apoA-I peptide (22A)-derived synthetic HDL (sHDL) to deliver LXR agonists to the atheroma and examine their effect on atherosclerosis regression in vivo. A synthetic LXR agonist, T0901317 (T1317) was encapsulated in sHDL nanoparticles (sHDL-T1317). Similar to the T1317 compound, the sHDL-T1317 nanoparticles upregulated the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters and increased cholesterol efflux in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. The sHDL nanoparticles accumulated in the atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE-deficient mice. Moreover, a 6-week low-dose LXR agonist-sHDL treatment induced atherosclerosis regression while avoiding lipid accumulation in the liver. These findings identify LXR agonist loaded sHDL nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis by targeting RCT in a multifaceted manner: sHDL itself serving as both a drug carrier and cholesterol acceptor and the LXR agonist mediating upregulation of ABC transporters in the aorta.",

In this study, we profiled plasma metabolites and proteins of 10 normal glucose-tolerant obese (NO) and 9 diabetic obese (DO) patients before and 1-week, 3-months, 1-year after RYGB. 146 proteins and 128 metabolites from both NO and DO groups at all four stages were selected for further analysis. By analyzing a set of bi-molecular associations among the corresponding network of the subjects with our newly developed computational method, we defined the represented physiological states (called the edge-states that reflect the interactions among the bio-molecules), and the related molecular networks of NO and DO patients, respectively. The principal component analyses (PCA) revealed that the edge states of the post-RYGB NO subjects were significantly different from those of the post-RYGB DO patients. Particularly, the time-dependent changes of the molecular hub-networks differed between DO and NO groups after RYGB. In conclusion, by developing molecular network-based systems signatures, we for the first time reveal that RYGB generates a unique path for diabetes remission independent of weight loss.",

Relative to RYGB, EDGB demonstrated modest body weight control, identical improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice. Blood glucose increased significantly 15 and 30\u00a0min after oral glucose administration, then markedly decreased in both EDGB and RYGB groups relative to the sham surgery, indicating a quicker absorption of oral glucose and improvement in glucose uptake by insulin targeted tissues. Insulin sensitivity was identically improved. EDGB significantly decreased plasma and hepatic triglyceride levels, while increased browning in visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissue to the extent identical to RYGB.

In this study, we aimed to identify the effect of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 priming on immunomodulation by MSCs and elucidate the possible mechanism underlying their properties for the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts. Infusion of MSCs primed with IFN-\u03b3 significantly reduced the symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in NOD-SCID mice, thereby increasing survival rate when compared with na\u00efve MSC-infused mice. However, infusion of IFN-\u03b3-primed MSCs in which indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was downregulated did not elicit this effect. The IDO gene was expressed in MSCs via the IFN-\u03b3-Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway, and the infusion of IDO-over-expressing MSCs increased survival rate in an in vivo GVHD model, similar to infusion of IFN-\u03b3-primed MSCs. These data indicate that IFN-\u03b3 production by activated T-cells is correlated with the induction of IDO expression in MSCs via the IFN-\u03b3-JAK-STAT1 pathway, which in turn results in the suppression of T-cell proliferation. Our findings also suggest that cell therapy based on MSCs primed with IFN-\u03b3 can be used for the clinical treatment of allogeneic conflicts, including GVHD.",

A cohort study was conducted and confirmed that children with AC had a higher incidence and subsequent risk of myopia (hazard ratio 2.35, 95%CI 2.29\u20132.40) compared to those without AC. Lower refractive error and longer axial length were observed in an AC animal model. Myopia progression was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or interleukin (IL)-6 administration, two cytokines secreted by mast cell degranulation. The TNF-\u03b1 or IL-6 weakened the tight junction formed by corneal epithelial (CEP) cells and inflammatory cytokines across the layer of CEP cells, which increased the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted by retinal pigment epithelial cells. The expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and nuclear factor kappa B were up-regulated in eyes with AC, whereas IL-10 and the inhibitor of kappa B were down-regulated.

We validated the findings in a European ancestry adult twin cohort of 1880 individuals (TwinsUK), and in a study of 1235 individuals of African American and Hispanic ancestry. We used genomics to elucidate the mechanisms targeted by acetaminophen.We identified a distinctive pattern of depletion of sulfated sex hormones with use of acetaminophen across all populations. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to characterize the role of Sulfotransferase Family 2A Member 1 (SULT2A1) as the site of the interaction. Although CYP3A7-CYP3A51P variants also modified levels of some sulfated sex hormones, only acetaminophen use phenocopied the effect of genetic variants of SULT2A1. Overall, acetaminophen use, age, gender and SULT2A1 and CYP3A7-CYP3A51P genetic variants are key determinants of variation in levels of sulfated sex hormones in blood. The effect of taking acetaminophen on sulfated sex hormones was roughly equivalent to the effect of 35\u00a0years of aging.These findings raise concerns of the impact of acetaminophen use on hormonal homeostasis. In addition, it modifies views on the mechanism of action of acetaminophen in pain management as sulfated sex hormones can function as neurosteroids and modify nociceptive thresholds.",

Second, we found that the magnitude of PBMC circRNAs in TB patients was higher than that in the paired healthy controls. Compared with host linear transcripts, the circRNAs within several pathways are disproportionately upregulated in active TB patients, including \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d, \u201cChemokine signaling pathway\u201d, \u201cNeurotrophin signaling pathway\u201d, and \u201cBacterial invasion of epithelial cells\u201d.

Here, using a mouse model of aerosol Mtb infection, we show that memory immunity to H56/CAF01 subunit vaccination conferred sustained protection in contrast to the transient natural immunity conferred by Mtb infection. Loss of protection to re-infection in natural Mtb memory was temporally linked to an accelerated differentiation of ESAT-6- and to a lesser extent, Ag85B-specific CD4 T cells in both the lung parenchyma and vasculature. This phenotype was characterized by high KLRG1 expression and low, dual production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF. In contrast, H56/CAF01 vaccination elicited cells that expressed low levels of KLRG1 with copious expression of IL-2 and IL-17A. Co-adoptive transfer studies revealed that H56/CAF01 induced memory CD4 T cells efficiently homed into the lung parenchyma of mice chronically infected with Mtb. In comparison, natural Mtb infection- and BCG vaccine-induced memory CD4 T cells exhibited a poor ability to home into the lung parenchyma. These studies suggest that impaired lung migratory capacity is an inherent trait of the terminally differentiated memory responses primed by mycobacteria/mycobacterial vectors.",

HIV-1-specific (CD4 and CD8 activation markers and immune check points) and NK cells responses were assessed; KIRs haplotypes and HLA alleles were determined.Two HIV-1 RNA copies/mL of plasma were detected in 2009, using an ultra-sensitive assay. HIV-DNA was detected at 1.1 and 2 copies/106 PBMCs in 2009 and 2015 respectively, at 1.2 copies/106 cells in rectal cells in 2011. WBs showed weak reactivity with antibodies to gp160, p55 and p25 from 2007 to 2014, remaining incomplete in 2017. CD4 T cells were susceptible to various strains including HIVKON, a primary isolate of his own CRF02_AG variant. CD8 T cells showed a strong poly-functional response against HIV-Gag, producing mainly IFN-\u03b3; a robust capacity of antibody-dependant cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) was observed in NK cells. Case patient was group B KIR haplotype. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected. CD4 and CD8 blood T cells showed normal proportions without increased activation markers. Phylogenetic analyses identified the same CRF02_AG variant in his partner. The patient and his partner were heterozygous for the CCR5\u0394D32 deletion and shared HLA-B*07, C*07 non-protective alleles.This thorough description of the natural history of an individual controlling HIV-1 in various compartments for ten years despite lack of protective alleles, and of his partner, may have implications for strategies to cure HIV-1 infection.",

The genetic construct consists of the prM and envelope structural protein genes of ZIKV placed downstream from a heterologous signal sequence. To better understand the humoral responses and correlates of protection (CoP) induced by the VLP vaccine, we evaluated VLP immunogenicity with and without alum in immune-competent mice (C57Bl/6 x Balb/c) and observed efficient induction of neutralizing antibody as well as a dose-sparing effect of alum. To assess the efficacy of the immune sera, we performed passive transfer experiments in AG129 mice. Mice that received the immune sera prior to ZIKV infection demonstrated significantly reduced viral replication as measured by viral RNA levels in the blood and remained healthy, whereas control mice succumbed to infection. The results underscore the protective effect of the antibody responses elicited by this ZIKV VLP vaccine candidate. These studies will help define optimal vaccine formulations, contribute to translational efforts in developing a vaccine for clinical development, and assist in the definition of immunologic CoP.",

Although many cells are disrupted in a response to injury, the relevance of degenerating cells in pathological angiogenesis is unclear. Here, we show that the release of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) from degenerating neurons drives central nervous system (CNS) angiogenesis. Silencing neuronal LDHA expression suppressed angiogenesis around experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)- and controlled cortical impact-induced lesions. Extracellular LDHA-mediated angiogenesis was dependent on surface vimentin expression and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) phosphorylation in vascular endothelial cells. Silencing vimentin expression in vascular endothelial cells prevented angiogenesis around EAE lesions and improved survival in a mouse model of glioblastoma. These results elucidate novel mechanisms that may mediate pathologic angiogenesis and identify a potential molecular target for the treatment of CNS diseases involving angiogenesis.",

Drug and alcohol use was reassessed during follow-up interviews 2\u20133\u00a0years later.The effects of alcohol (versus placebo) ingestion depended upon the task and risk group. In response to negative (versus neutral) faces, alcohol diminished amygdala (AMYG) activations in HAS but not HSS subjects. In response to psychosocial evaluative stress, alcohol enhanced activations of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens in HAS male subjects (HASMS), but decreased mOFC activity in HSS male subjects (HSSMS). At follow-up, a greater alcohol versus placebo differential for threat-related AMYG activations predicted escalating drinking and/or illicit drug use among HAS but not HSS participants, whereas a greater differential for mOFC activations during acute social stress predicted escalating substance use among HSS but not HAS participants.This double dissociation provides evidence of distinct neurobiological profiles in a priori identified personality trait-based risk groups for AUDs, and links these signatures to clinically relevant substance use outcomes at follow-up. AUD subtypes might benefit from motivationally and personality-specific ameliorative and preventative interventions.",

     "abstract": "Thirty-percent of patients with epilepsy are drug-resistant, and might benefit from effective noninvasive therapeutic interventions. Evidence is accumulating on the efficacy of autonomic biofeedback therapy using galvanic skin response (GSR; an index of sympathetic arousal) in treating epileptic seizures. This study aimed to extend previous controlled clinical trials of autonomic biofeedback therapy with a larger homogeneous sample of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. In addition, we used neuroimaging to characterize neural mechanisms of change in seizure frequency following the therapy.Forty patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (age: 18 to 70\u00a0years old), on stable doses of anti-epileptic medication, were recruited into a controlled and parallel-group trial from three screening centers in the UK. Patients were allocated to either an active intervention group, who received therapy with GSR biofeedback, or a control group, who received treatment as usual. Allocation to the group was informed, in part, by whether patients could travel to attend repeated therapy sessions (non-randomized). Measurement of outcomes was undertaken by an assessor blinded to the patients' group membership. Resting-state functional and structural MRI data were acquired before and after one month of therapy in the therapy group, and before and after a one-month interval in the control group. The percentage change of seizure frequency was the primary outcome measure. The analysis employed an intention\u2013to\u2013treat principle. The secondary outcome was the change in default mode network (DMN) and limbic network functional connectivity tested for effects of therapy. The trial was registered with the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio (ID 15967).Data were acquired between May 2014 and October 2016. Twenty participants were assigned to each group. Two patients in the control group dropped out before the second scan, leaving 18 control participants. There was a significant difference in reduction of seizure frequency between the therapy and control groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001: Mann Whitney U Test). The seizure frequency in the therapy group was significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001: Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) following GSR biofeedback, with a mean seizure reduction of 43% (SD\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b1 32.12, median\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a037.26, 95% CI -58.02% to \u2212\u00a027.96%). No significant seizure reduction was observed in the control group, with a mean increase in seizure frequency of 31% (SD\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088.27, median\u00a0=\u00a00, 95% CI \u2212\u00a012.83% to 74.96%). The effect size of group comparison was 1.14 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.82). 45% of patients in the therapy group showed a seizure reduction of >\u00a050%. Neuroimaging analysis revealed that post-therapy seizure reduction was linearly correlated with enhanced functional connectivity between right amygdala and both the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and frontal pole (FP).Our clinical study provides evidence for autonomic biofeedback therapy as an effective and potent behavioral intervention for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.

The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. Subjects were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on the severity of the suicidal behavior. We included CpG sites located within 2000 basepairs away from transcriptional start site of the following HPA-axis coupled genes: corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1).

Nevertheless, also after adjusting for obesity and plasma BCAA, 3-HIB levels were associated with future risk of incident T2D. We also examined the effect of 3-HIB on fatty acid uptake in human cells and found that both HUVEC and human cardiac endothelial cells respond to 3-HIB whereas human adipose tissue-derived endothelial cells do not respond to 3-HIB.

First, AMARETTO identifies potential cancer driver genes through integration of copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data. Then AMARETTO connects these driver genes with co-expressed target genes that they control, defined as regulatory modules. Thirdly, we connect AMARETTO modules identified from different cancer sites into a pancancer network to identify cancer driver genes. Here we applied AMARETTO in a pancancer study comprising eleven cancer sites and confirmed that AMARETTO captures hallmarks of cancer. We also demonstrated that AMARETTO enables the identification of novel pancancer driver genes.

ADAR edits millions of adenosines to inosines within the transcriptome, and while previous studies of ADAR in cancer have solely focused on protein-coding edits, >\u00a099% of edits occur in non-protein coding regions. Here, we develop a pipeline to discover the regulatory potential of RNA editing sites across the entire transcriptome and apply it to lung adenocarcinoma tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This method predicts that 1413 genes contain regulatory edits, predominantly in non-coding regions. Genes with the largest numbers of regulatory edits are enriched in both apoptotic and innate immune pathways, providing a link between these known functions of ADAR and its role in cancer. We further show that despite a positive association between ADAR RNA expression and apoptotic and immune pathways, ADAR copy number is negatively associated with apoptosis and several immune cell types' signatures.",

The recent STAMPEDE and CHAARTED trials showed that docetaxel in combination with ADT increased survival in hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients, suggesting cross-talk between AR signaling and chemotherapy efficacy. We hypothesized that a similar interaction may also apply for CRPC that is treated with cabazitaxel. We studied the impact of androgen status on the efficacy, pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of cabazitaxel in a unique and clinically relevant patient derived xenograft model of castration resistant disease. We found that cabazitaxel is highly effective in a castrate setting with strongly reduced AR activation, while tumor growth inhibition by cabazitaxel was completely abolished in the presence of high AR pathway activity. Moreover, additional experiments showed that intratumoral cabazitaxel levels were 3.5 times higher in tumors from castrated mice as compared to tumors from androgen-supplemented animals. We confirmed that cabazitaxel pharmacokinetics were not affected by testosterone, suggesting that androgen status might influence cabazitaxel tumor uptake directly.

Because of the difficulty of discriminating PFIC1 from other subtypes of PFIC based on its clinical and histological features and genome sequencing, an alternative method for diagnosing PFIC1 is desirable. Herein, we analyzed human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and found predominant expression of ATP8B1 in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-induced M2c, a subset of alternatively activated macrophages. SiRNA-mediated depletion of ATP8B1 in IL-10-treated HMDM markedly suppressed the expression of M2c-related surface markers and increased the side scatter (SSC) of M2c, likely via impairment of the IL-10/STAT3 signal transduction pathway. These phenotypic features were confirmed in IL-10-treated HMDM from four PFIC1 patients with disease-causing mutations in both alleles, but not in those from four patients with other subtypes of PFIC. This method identified three PFIC1 patients in a group of PFIC patients undiagnosed by genome sequencing, an identical diagnostic outcome to that achieved by analysis of liver specimens and in vitro mutagenesis studies. In conclusion, ATP8B1 deficiency caused incomplete polarization of HMDM into M2c. Phenotypic analysis of M2c helps to identify PFIC1 patients with no apparent disease-causing mutations in ATP8B1.",

Here we utilized unbiased metabolomics to identify 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) as a significant metabolite of the \u03c9-3-acid ethyl ester prescription Lovaza\u2122 in humans. Administration of CMPF to mice before or after high-fat diet feeding at exposures equivalent to those observed in humans increased whole-body lipid metabolism, improved insulin sensitivity, increased beta-oxidation, reduced lipogenic gene expression, and ameliorated steatosis. Mechanistically, we find that CMPF acutely inhibits ACC activity, and induces long-term loss of SREBP1c and ACC1/2 expression. This corresponds to an induction of FGF21, which is required for long-term steatosis protection, as FGF21KO mice are refractory to the improved metabolic effects. Thus, CMPF treatment in mice parallels the effects of human Lovaza\u2122 supplementation, revealing that CMPF may contribute to the improved metabolic effects observed with \u03c9-3 fatty acid prescriptions.",

Homozygous Ldlr KO hamsters on a chow diet developed hypercholesterolemia with LDL as the dominant lipoprotein and spontaneous atherosclerosis. On a high-cholesterol/high-fat (HCHF) diet, these animals exhibited severe hyperlipidemia and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta and coronary arteries. Moreover, the heterozygous Ldlr KO hamsters on a short-term HCHF diet also had overt hypercholesterolemia, which could be effectively ameliorated with several lipid-lowering drugs. Importantly, heterozygotes on 3-month HCHF diets developed accelerated lesions in the aortas and coronary arteries.Our findings demonstrate that the Ldlr KO hamster is an animal model of choice for human FH and has great potential in translational research of hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease.",

However, most experimental assays assessing angiogenesis rely on animal models. We report an in vitro model using a microvessel-on-a-chip. It mimics an effective endothelial sprouting angiogenesis event triggered from an initial microvessel using a single angiogenic factor, VEGF-A. The angiogenic sprouting in this model is depends on the Notch signaling, as observed in vivo. This model enables the study of anti-angiogenic drugs which target a specific factor/receptor pathway, as demonstrated by the use of the clinically approved sorafenib and sunitinib for targeting the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 pathway. Furthermore, this model allows testing simultaneously angiogenesis and permeability. It demonstrates that sorafenib impairs the endothelial barrier function, while sunitinib does not.

The function of midkine in arteriogenesis, the growth of natural bypasses from pre-existing collateral arteries, compensating for the loss of an occluded artery has never been investigated. Arteriogenesis is an inflammatory process, which relies on the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. We show that midkine deficiency strikingly interferes with the proliferation of endothelial cells in arteriogenesis, thereby interfering with the process of collateral artery growth. We identified midkine to be responsible for increased plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), necessary and sufficient to promote endothelial cell proliferation in growing collaterals. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that leukocyte domiciled midkine mediates increased plasma levels of VEGFA relevant for upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase 1 and 3, necessary for proper endothelial cell proliferation, and that non-leukocyte domiciled midkine additionally improves vasodilation.The data provided on the role of midkine in endothelial proliferation are likely to be relevant for both, the process of arteriogenesis and angiogenesis.

This study sought to elucidate the effect of glucocorticoids on the development and progression of aortic dissection, and the potential mechanism involved. Serum cortisol in aortic dissection patients was significantly higher than that in non-ruptured aortic aneurysm patients and healthy volunteers by radioimmunoassay. In modified C57BL/6 mouse model of aortic dissection, glucocorticoids reduced the incidence of aortic dissection and protected the collagen from degradation. Furthermore, glucocorticoids inhibited the TNF-\u03b1 secretion of THP-1 monocytes, decreased the migration, phenotype switch from contractile type to synthetic type, and the apoptosis of human aortic smooth muscle cells induced by TNF-\u03b1. Finally, TNF-sRII was identified as an important cytokine in cellular interaction that participated in vascular remodeling by targeting the p38 MAPK-HSP27 pathway. These results indicate that glucocorticoids inhibit the incidence of aortic dissection by decreasing the TNF-\u03b1 secretion and increasing the uncombined TNF-sRII, positively participating in vascular remodeling.",

Here, we developed hfRPE (human fetal retinal pigment epithelial) cell culture model where cells fully differentiated into a polarized functional monolayer. In this model, we fine-tuned the cellular levels of HtrA1 by targeted overexpression. Our data show that HtrA1 enzymatic activity leads to intracellular degradation of tubulin with a corresponding reduction in the number of microtubules, and consequently to an altered mechanical cell phenotype. HtrA1 overexpression further leads to impaired apical processes and decreased phagocytosis, an essential function for photoreceptor survival. These cellular alterations correlate with the AMD phenotype and thus highlight HtrA1 as an intracellular target for therapeutic interventions towards AMD treatment.",

We combined a metabolomic approach with genetic marker analyses using urine from individuals undergoing scheduled cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass to investigate the feasibility and significance of monitoring the ER stress response in the kidney. We developed an original method based on fragment analysis that measures urinary levels of the spliced X-box binding protein 1 (sXBP1) mRNA as a proxy of inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) activity because sXBP1 is absolutely sensitive and specific for ER stress. The early engagement of the ER stress response after ischemic stress is critical for protecting against tissue damage, and individuals who mount a robust adaptive response are protected against AKI.

Although antibody-mediated disease mechanisms in pemphigus are extensively characterized, the T cell aspect of this autoimmune disease still remains poorly understood. Herein, we utilized a mouse model of CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmunity against Dsg3 to show that acquisition of Dsg3 and subsequent presentation to T cells by LCs depended on the C-type lectin langerin. The lack of LCs led to enhanced autoimmunity with impaired Dsg3-specific regulatory T cell expansion. LCs expressed the IL-2 receptor complex and the disruption of IL-2 signaling in LCs attenuated LC-mediated regulatory T cell expansion in vitro, demonstrating that direct IL-2 signaling shapes LC function. These data establish that LCs mediate peripheral tolerance against an epidermal autoantigen and point to langerin and IL-2 signaling pathways as attractive targets for achieving tolerogenic responses particularly in autoimmune blistering diseases such as pemphigus.",

However, the contributory roles of other substances and transporters in the regulation of CF airway pathogenesis remain unelucidated. Here, we identified a novel connection between CFTR/ENaC expression and the intracellular Zn2\u00a0+ concentration in the regulation of MUC5AC, a major secreted mucin that is highly expressed in CF airway. CFTR-defective and ENaC-hyperactive airway epithelial cells specifically and highly expressed a unique, alternative splice isoform of the zinc importer ZIP2/SLC39A2 (\u0394C-ZIP2), which lacks the C-terminal domain. Importantly, \u0394C-ZIP2 levels correlated inversely with wild-type ZIP2 and intracellular Zn2\u00a0+ levels. Moreover, the splice switch to \u0394C-ZIP2 as well as decreased expression of other ZIPs caused zinc deficiency, which is sufficient for induction of MUC5AC; while \u0394C-ZIP2 expression per se induced ENaC expression and function. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the novel splicing switch contributes to CF lung pathology via the novel interplay of CFTR, ENaC, and ZIP2 transporters.",

The present study was aimed to evaluate specific parameters of innate, cellular and humoral immune responses in SDC. Specifically, plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines, HIV-specific T-cell responses, gp120-specific IgG and IgA antibodies, and HIV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity were assessed in nine HIV-exposed seronegative individuals (ESN) and their corresponding HIV seropositive partners (HIV+-P), in eighteen chronically infected HIV subjects (C), nine chronically infected subjects known to be HIV transmitters (CT) and ten healthy HIV\u2212 donors (HD). Very low magnitude HIV-specific cellular responses were found in two out of six ESN. Interestingly, HIV+-P had the highest ADCC magnitude, the lowest IgA levels and the highest IgG/IgA ratio, all compared to CT. Positive correlations between CD4+ T-cell counts and both IgG/IgA ratios and %ADCC killing uniquely distinguished HIV+-P. Additionally, evidence of IgA interference with ADCC responses from HIV+-P and CT is provided. These data suggest for the first time a potential role of ADCC and/or gp120-specific IgG/IgA balance in modulating heterosexual transmission. In sum, this study provides key information to understand the host factors that influence viral transmission, which should be considered in both the development of prophylactic vaccines and novel immunotherapies for HIV-1 infection.",

Tacrolimus is an FDA-approved immunosuppressive drug with known neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties in the CNS. However, tacrolimus is typically administered systemically and blood levels required to effectively treat CNS injuries can lead to lethal, off-target organ toxicity. Thus, delivering tacrolimus locally to CNS tissues may provide therapeutic control over tacrolimus levels in CNS tissues while minimizing off-target toxicity. Herein we show an electrospun poly(ester urethane) urea and tacrolimus elastomeric matrix (PEUU-Tac) can deliver tacrolimus trans-durally to CNS tissues. In an acute CNS ischemia model in rat, the optic nerve (ON) was clamped for 10s and then PEUU-Tac was used as an ON wrap and sutured around the injury site. Tacrolimus was detected in PEUU-Tac wrapped ONs at 24\u00a0h and 14\u00a0days, without significant increases in tacrolimus blood levels. Similar to systemically administered tacrolimus, PEUU-Tac locally decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at the injury site and increased growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression in ischemic ONs from the globe to the chiasm, consistent with decreased astrogliosis and increased retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth signaling pathways.

We observed increased urine citrate excretion (+\u00a074%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00009) and plasma 2-oxoglutarate concentrations (+\u00a012%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) in CKD patients during treatment with a vitamin-D receptor agonist in a randomized trial. In conclusion, urinary excretion of citric acid cycle metabolites and renal expression of genes regulating these metabolites were reduced in non-diabetic CKD. This supports the emerging view of CKD as a state of mitochondrial dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "Nexvax2\u00ae is a novel, peptide-based, epitope-specific immunotherapy intended to be administered by regular injections at dose levels that increase the threshold for clinical reactivity to natural exposure to gluten and ultimately restore tolerance to gluten in patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease patients administered fixed intradermal doses of Nexvax2 become unresponsive to the HLA-DQ2\u00b75-restricted gluten epitopes in Nexvax2, but gastrointestinal symptoms and cytokine release mimicking gluten exposure, that accompany the first dose, limit the maximum tolerated dose to 150\u00a0\u03bcg. Our aim was to test whether stepwise dose escalation attenuated the first dose effect of Nexvax2 in celiac disease patients.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at four community sites in Australia (3) and New Zealand (1) in HLA-DQ2\u00b75 genotype positive adults with celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet. Participants were assigned to cohort 1 if they were HLA-DQ2\u00b75 homozygotes; other participants were assigned to cohort 2, or to cohort 3 subsequent to completion of cohort 2. Manual central randomization without blocking was used to assign treatment for each cohort. Initially, Nexvax2-treated participants in cohorts 1 and 2 received an intradermal dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg (consisting of 10\u00a0\u03bcg of each constituent peptide), followed by 60\u00a0\u03bcg, 90\u00a0\u03bcg, 150\u00a0\u03bcg, and then eight doses of 300\u00a0\u03bcg over six weeks, but this was amended to include doses of 3\u00a0\u03bcg and 9\u00a0\u03bcg and extended over a total of seven weeks. Nexvax2-treated participants in cohort 3 received doses of 3\u00a0\u03bcg, 9\u00a0\u03bcg, 30\u00a0\u03bcg, 60\u00a0\u03bcg, 90\u00a0\u03bcg, 150\u00a0\u03bcg, 300\u00a0\u03bcg, 450\u00a0\u03bcg, 600\u00a0\u03bcg, 750\u00a0\u03bcg, and then eight of 900\u00a0\u03bcg over nine weeks. The dose interval was 3 or 4\u00a0days. Participants, care providers, data managers, sponsor personnel, and study site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the number of adverse events and percentage of participants with adverse events during the treatment period. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02528799.From the 73 participants who we screened from 19 August 2015 to 31 October 2016, 24 did not meet eligibility criteria, and 36 were ultimately randomized and received study drug. For cohort 1, seven participants received Nexvax2 (two with the starting dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg and then five at 3\u00a0\u03bcg) and three received placebo. For cohort 2, 10 participants received Nexvax2 (four with starting dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg and then six at 3\u00a0\u03bcg) and four received placebo. For cohort 3, 10 participants received Nexvax2 and two received placebo. All 36 participants were included in safety and immune analyses, and 33 participants completed treatment and follow-up; in cohort 3, 11 participants were assessed and included in pharmacokinetics and duodenal histology analyses. Whereas the maximum dose of Nexvax2 had previously been limited by adverse events and cytokine release, no such effect was observed when dosing escalated from 3\u00a0\u03bcg up to 300\u00a0\u03bcg in HLA-DQ2\u00b75 homozygotes or to 900\u00a0\u03bcg in HLA-DQ2.5 non-homozygotes. Adverse events with Nexvax2 treatment were less common in cohorts 1 and 2 with the starting dose of 3\u00a0\u03bcg (72 for 11 participants) than with the starting dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg (91 for six participants). Adverse events during the treatment period in placebo-treated participants (46 for nine participants) were similar to those in Nexvax2-treated participants when the starting dose was 3\u00a0\u03bcg in cohort 1 (16 for five participants), cohort 2 (56 for six participants), and cohort 3 (44 for 10 participants). Two participants in cohort 2 and one in cohort 3 who received Nexvax2 starting at 3\u00a0\u03bcg did not report any adverse event, while the other 33 participants experienced at least one adverse event. One participant, who was in cohort 1, withdrew from the study due to adverse events, which included abdominal pain graded moderate or severe and associated with nausea after receiving the starting dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg and one 60\u00a0\u03bcg dose. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the Nexvax2 participants were headache (52%), diarrhoea (48%), nausea (37%), abdominal pain (26%), and abdominal discomfort (19%). Administration of Nexvax2 at dose levels from 150\u00a0\u03bcg to 900\u00a0\u03bcg preceded by dose escalation was not associated with elevations in plasma cytokines at 4\u00a0h. Nexvax2 treatment was associated with trends towards improved duodenal histology. Plasma concentrations of Nexvax2 peptides were dose-dependent.We show that antigenic peptides recognized by CD4-positive T cells in an autoimmune disease can be safely administered to patients at high maintenance dose levels without immune activation if preceded by gradual dose escalation. These findings facilitate efficacy studies that test high-dose epitope-specific immunotherapy in celiac disease.",

Symptoms were analyzed by questionnaire at ages 4, 8 and 16\u00a0years. Clinically and independent relevant allergen molecules accounting for \u2265\u00a090% of IgE reactivities in sensitized individuals and at all time-points were identified as risk molecules and used to predict respiratory allergy. The data was replicated in the Manchester Asthma and Allergy Study (MAAS) birth cohort by studying IgE reactivity with the use of a commercial IgE microarray. Sera were obtained from children at the ages of 3, 5, 8 and 11\u00a0years (N\u00a0=\u00a0248) and the outcome was studied at 11\u00a0years.In the BAMSE cohort 4 risk molecules could be identified, i.e.: Ara h 1 (peanut), Bet v 1 (birch), Fel d 1 (cat), Phl p 1 (grass). For MAAS the corresponding number of molecules was 5: Der p 1 (dust mite), Der f 2 (dust mite), Phl p 1 (grass), Phl p 5 (grass), Fel d 1 (cat). In BAMSE, early IgE reactivity to \u2265\u00a03 of 4 allergen molecules at four years predicted incident and persistent asthma and/or rhinitis at 16\u00a0years (87% and 95%, respectively). The corresponding proportions in the MAAS cohort at 16\u00a0years were 100% and 100%, respectively, for IgE reactivity to \u2265\u00a03 of 5 risk molecules.IgE reactivity to a few allergen molecules early in life identifies children with a high risk of asthma and/or rhinitis at 16\u00a0years.

In the present study, we found that Aurora B is overexpressed in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high levels of Aurora B protein were associated with a worse overall survival rate in ESCC patients. Depleting of Aurora B blunted the malignant phenotypes in ESCC cells. Importantly, we demonstrated that a natural compound, deguelin, has a profound anti-tumor effect on ESCC via inhibiting Aurora B activity. Deguelin potently inhibited in vitro Aurora B kinase activity. The in silico docking study further indicated that deguelin was docked into the ATP-binding pocket of Aurora B. Inhibition of Aurora B activity attenuated growth of ESCC cells, resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest, polyploidy cells formation, and apoptosis induction. Knocking down of Aurora B decreased the sensitivity of ESCC cells to deguelin. The in vivo results showed that deguelin blocked the phosphorylation of histone H3 and inhibited the growth of ESCC tumor xenografts. Overall, we identified deguelin as an effective Aurora B inhibitor, which deserves further studies in other animal models and ESCC treatment.",

MPN and post-MPN AML are dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, but the role of serine STAT1 phosphorylation remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that Mediator kinase inhibitor cortistatin A (CA) reduced proliferation of JAK2-mutant AML in vitro and in vivo and also suppressed CDK8-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727. Here we report that phosphorylation of STAT1 S727 promotes the proliferation of AML cells with JAK-STAT pathway activation. Inhibition of serine phosphorylation by CA promotes growth arrest and differentiation, inhibits colony formation in MPN patient samples and reduces allele burden in MPN mouse models. These results reveal that STAT1 pS727 regulates growth and differentiation in JAK-STAT activated neoplasms and suggest that Mediator kinase inhibition represents a therapeutic strategy to regulate JAK-STAT signaling.",

     "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multisystem disorder that has affected a substantial number of veterans who served in the 1990\u201391 Gulf War. The brain is prominently affected, as manifested by the presence of neurological, cognitive and mood symptoms. We reported previously on the protective role of six Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles in GWI (Georgopoulos et al., 2016) and their association with regional brain function (James et al., 2016). More recently, we reported on the presence of subcortical brain atrophy in GWI (Christova et al., 2017) and discussed its possible relation to immune mechanisms. Here we focused on one of the six HLA GWI-protective HLA alleles, DRB1*13:02, which has been found to have a protective role in a broad range of autoimmune diseases (Furukawa et al., 2017), and tested its effects on brain volumes.Seventy-six Gulf War veterans (55 with GWI and 21 healthy controls) underwent a structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) scan to measure the volumes of 9 subcortical brain regions to assess differences between participants with (N\u00a0=\u00a011) and without (N\u00a0=\u00a065) HLA class II allele DRB1*13:02.We found that DRB1*13:02 spared subcortical brain atrophy in Gulf War veterans; overall subcortical volume was 6.6% higher in carriers of DRB1*13:02 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The strongest effect was observed in the volume of cerebellar gray matter which was 9.6% higher (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) in carriers of DRB1*13:02 than in non-carriers. By contrast, DRB1*13:01 had no effect.These findings document the protective effect of DRB1*13:02 on brain atrophy in Gulf War veterans and are in keeping with recent results documenting sharing of brain mechanisms between GWI and other immune-related diseases (Georgopoulos et al., 2017). We hypothesize that the protective role of DRB1*13:02 is due to its successful elimination of external antigens to which Gulf War veterans were exposed, antigens that otherwise would persist causing low-grade inflammation and possibly leading to autoimmunity.U.S. Department of Defense (W81XWH-15-1-0520), Department of Veterans Affairs, American Legion Brain Sciences Chair, and University of Minnesota.",

     "abstract": "In 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on metoclopramide (MCP) due to the increased risks and prevalence of tardive dyskinesia (TD). In this study, we developed a multi-step biomedical informatics screening (MSBIS) approach leveraging publicly available bioactivity and drug safety data to identify concomitant drugs that mitigate the risks of MCP-induced TD. MSBIS includes (1) TargetSearch (http://dxulab.org/software) bioinformatics scoring for drug anticholinergic activity using CHEMBL bioactivity data; (2) unadjusted odds ratio (UOR) scoring for indications of TD-mitigating effects using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS); (3) adjusted odds ratio (AOR) re-scoring by removing the effect of cofounding factors (age, gender, reporting year); (4) logistic regression (LR) coefficient scoring for confirming the best TD-mitigating drug candidates. Drugs with increasing TD protective potential and statistical significance were obtained at each screening step. Fentanyl is identified as the most promising drug against MCP-induced TD (coefficient: \u22122.68; p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The discovery is supported by clinical reports that patients fully recovered from MCP-induced TD after fentanyl-induced general anesthesia. Loperamide is identified as a potent mitigating drug against a broader range of drug-induced movement disorders through pharmacokinetic modifications. Using drug-induced TD as an example, we demonstrated that MSBIS is an efficient in silico tool for unknown drug-drug interaction detection, drug repurposing, and combination therapy design.",

The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) regulates the cellular response to cardiac tissue damage in I/R, an effect potentially mediated by the binding of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain to the diaphanous-related formin, DIAPH1. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DIAPH1 in the physiological response to experimental myocardial I/R in mice. After subjecting wild-type mice to experimental I/R, myocardial DIAPH1 expression was increased, an effect that was echoed following hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in H9C2 and AC16 cells. Further, compared to wild-type mice, genetic deletion of Diaph1 reduced infarct size and improved contractile function after I/R. Silencing Diaph1 in H9C2 cells subjected to H/R downregulated actin polymerization and serum response factor-regulated gene expression. Importantly, these changes led to increased expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ ATPase and reduced expression of the sodium calcium exchanger. This work demonstrates that DIAPH1 is required for the myocardial response to I/R, and that targeting DIAPH1 may represent an adjunctive approach for myocardial salvage after acute infarction.",

     "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE), the third leading cardiovascular complication, requires more understanding at molecular levels. Here, we have identified miR-145 as a key molecule for regulating thrombus formation in venous thrombosis (VT) employing network based bioinformatics approach and in vivo experiments. Levels of miR-145 showed an inverse correlation with thrombus load determined by coagulation variables. MiRNA target prediction tools and in vitro study identified tissue factor (TF) as a target gene for miR-145. The restoration of miR-145 levels in thrombotic animals via in vivo miR-145 mimic delivery resulted in decreased TF level and activity, accompanied by reduced thrombogenesis. MiR-145 levels were also reduced in VT patients and correlated with increased TF levels in patients, thereby, confirming our preclinical findings. Our study identifies a previously undescribed role of miRNA in VT by regulating TF expression. Therefore, restoration of miR-145 levels may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for management of VT.",

     "abstract": "An increased rate of cell death by apoptosis has been implicated in both diabetes and atherosclerosis. Apoptosis can be induced through activation of the death receptors TNF receptor 1 (TNFR-1), TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAILR-2) and Fas. Soluble forms of these receptors are found in plasma. The objective of this study was to determine if soluble death receptors are markers of receptor-activated apoptosis and predict risk for development of diabetes and cardiovascular events.Fas ligand was used to induce apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and INS-1 pancreatic \u03b2-cells and release of TNFR-1, TRAILR-2 and Fas measured by ELISA. Proximity Extension Assay was used to analyze plasma levels of TNFR-1, TRAILR-2 and Fas in baseline samples of 4742 subjects in the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study and related to development of diabetes and cardiovascular events during 19.2\u00a0years of follow-up.Activation of apoptosis by Fas ligand was associated with release of soluble Fas, TNFR-1 and TRAILR-2 in both cell types. Circulating levels of all three receptors were higher in subjects with diabetes and correlated with markers of impaired glucose metabolism in non-diabetic subjects. Among the latter, those in the highest tertile of soluble Fas, TNFR-1 and TRAILR-2 had increased risk for development of diabetes and cardiovascular events. These associations became weaker when adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors in Cox regression models, but remained significant for TRAILR-2 with incident diabetes, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, and for TNFR-1 with myocardial infarction.The present study demonstrates an association between several cardiovascular risk factors and elevated levels of circulating markers of apoptotic cell death. It also shows that subjects with high levels of these biomarkers have increased risk of diabetes and CVD. This implies that soluble death receptors are markers of \u03b2-cell and vascular injury and potentially could be used as surrogate markers of therapeutic efficiency in risk factor interventions.",

The primary end point was the overall response rate (ORR). Serum metabolomic profiles were assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, with specific metabolites quantified by targeted metabolic analysis.Forty patients were enrolled and the ORR was 92.1% (95%CI, 83.1%\u2013100.0%). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 89.1% and overall survival (OS) rate was 92.0%.

This study investigated the prognostic and predictive significance of these SNPs.This study evaluated associations between Aurora A SNPs and overall survival (OS) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The Aurora A SNPs were also evaluated as predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes to alisertib in two phase 2 studies (NCT01045421 and NCT01091428). Aurora A SNP genotyping was obtained from 85 patients with advanced solid tumors receiving single-agent alisertib and 122 patients with advanced recurrent ovarian cancer treated with alisertib plus weekly paclitaxel (n\u00a0=\u00a062) or paclitaxel alone (n\u00a0=\u00a060). Whole blood was collected prior to treatment and genotypes were analyzed by PCR.TCGA data suggested prognostic significance for codon 57 SNP; solid tumor patients with VV and VI alleles had significantly reduced OS versus those with II alleles (HR 1.9 [VI] and 1.8 [VV]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In NCT01045421, patients carrying the VV alleles at codon 57 (n\u00a0=\u00a053, 62%) had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than patients carrying IV or II alleles (n\u00a0=\u00a032, 38%; HR 0.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0195). In NCT01091428, patients with the VV alleles at codon 57 who received alisertib plus paclitaxel (n\u00a0=\u00a047, 39%) had a trend towards improved PFS (7.5\u00a0months) vs paclitaxel alone (n\u00a0=\u00a032, 26%; 3.8\u00a0months; HR 0.618; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0593).

Offspring infected in utero showed ZIKV in their fetal membranes collected after birth. Some in utero affected piglets were small, depressed, had undersized brains, and showed seizures.

Biomarker assays were specifically developed for this study and quantified using a novel, multiplexed electrochemiluminescence assay. We evaluated the association of biomarkers with baseline characteristics, as well as with detailed microbiologic data, using Bonferroni-adjusted, linear regression models. Across numerous analyses, seven proteins, SAA1, PCT, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CRP, PTX-3 and MMP-8, showed recurring strong associations with markers of baseline disease severity, smear grade and cavitation; were strongly modulated by tuberculosis treatment; and had responses that were greater for patients who culture-converted at 8\u00a0weeks.

We show that human oligodendrocytes (OL), derived from the NKX2.1-GFP human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter line, express MCT8. Moreover, treatment of these cultures with DITPA (an MCT8-independent TH analog), up-regulates OL differentiation transcription factors and myelin gene expression. DITPA promotes hESC-derived OL myelination of retinal ganglion axons in co-culture. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of MCT8 induces significant OL apoptosis, impairing myelination. DITPA treatment limits OL apoptosis mediated by SLC16A2 down-regulation primarily signaling through AKT phosphorylation, driving myelination.

VLDLR mRNA expression in peripheral WBC and plasma VLDL-C levels were measured in 747 participants from a community-based study. Plaque prevalence and total plaque area (TPA) were used to evaluate the burden of carotid atherosclerosis. VLDL-C was positively associated with atherosclerosis risk, whereas this association was modified by VLDLR mRNA level. In participants with the lowest VLDL-C but the highest VLDLR mRNA expression, the risk for plaque prevalence unexpectedly was the highest. This association was also observed for TPA. Moreover, this association remained unchanged after adjusting for WBC or monocytes. Our findings described an atherogenic phenotype characterized by low VLDL-C but high VLDLR mRNA expression in peripheral WBCs, which suggested that VLDLR in all types of peripheral WBCs may be involved in lipid deposition, and VLDL-C and VLDLR may co-determine the development of atherosclerosis.",

Using mass spectrometry, we detected glycation of haemoglobin with d-ribose produces 10 carboxylmethyllysines (CMLs). The first-order rate constant of fructosamine formation for d-ribose was approximately 60 times higher than that for d-glucose at the initial stage. Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat, a common model for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), had high levels of d-ribose and HbA1c, accompanied by a decrease of transketolase (TK) in the liver. The administration of benfotiamine, an activator of TK, significantly decreased d-ribose followed by a decline in HbA1c. In clinical investigation, T2DM patients with high HbA1c had a high level of urine d-ribose, though the level of their urine d-glucose was low. That is, d-ribose contributes to HbA1c, which prompts future studies to further explore whether d-ribose plays a role in the pathophysiological mechanism of T2DM.",

Integration with the FANTOM5 promoter-level expression atlas, which includes transcriptome profiles of various human tissues and cells, enabled us to identify 45 promoters at 28 gene loci that are specifically expressed in CECs. We further discovered that the expression of transcription factor POU class 6 homeobox 2 (POU6F2) is restricted to CECs, and upregulated during human CEC differentiation, suggesting that POU6F2 is pivotal to terminal differentiation of CECs.

Among the tested DNA damaging drugs were various inhibitors of Aurora and Polo-like mitotic kinases, as well as traditional chemotherapy. Mitotic kinase inhibition causes mitotic slippage, DNA re-replication, and polyploidy. Here we show that re-replication of the polyploid genome generates replicative stress which leads to DNA damage. MDM2-p53 antagonists relieve replicative stress via the p53-dependent activation of p21 which inhibits DNA replication. Loss of p21 promoted drug-induced DNA damage in melanoma cells and enhanced anti-tumor activity of therapy combining MDM2 antagonist with mitotic kinase inhibitor in mice. In summary, MDM2 antagonists may reduce DNA damaging effects of anti-cancer drugs if they are administered together, while targeting p21 can improve the efficacy of such combinations.",

We analyzed the data from an official (registered at ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02324127), large-scale (1647 enrollments), and multicenter (three independent hospitals) clinical trial, which quantitatively measured plasma Hsp90\u03b1 by ELISA for patients with liver cancer, patients with at-risk liver diseases (including hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, focal nodular hyperplasia), and healthy individuals.

In a parallel study compared with AFP20, plasma Hsp90\u03b1 exhibited a significantly higher diagnostic performance (sensitivity 93.3% vs 61.1%) in discriminating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from the control. Furthermore, plasma Hsp90\u03b1 measurement maintained distinctly excellent diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AFP-negative HCC patients (sensitivity 93.9%, specificity 91.3%) and AFP-limited liver cancer (sensitivity 96.6%, specificity 90.3%).

The browning capacity of primary preadipocytes was assessed with IRX3 knockdown. Luciferase reporter analysis and ChIP assay were applied to investigate IRX3's effects on UCP1 transcriptional activity. Moreover, genetic analysis of IRX3 was performed in 861 young obese subjects and 916 controls.IRX3 expression was induced in the browning process and was positively correlated with the browning markers. IRX3 knockdown remarkably inhibited UCP1 expression in induced mouse and human beige adipocytes, and also repressed the uncoupled oxygen consumption rate.

The Brain Shuttle (BS) technology is capable of shuttling large molecules into the brain. This allows for new types of therapeutic modalities engineered for optimal efficacy on the molecular target in the brain independent of brain penetrating properties. To this end, we designed BACE1 peptide inhibitors with varying lipid modifications with single-digit picomolar cellular potency. Secondly, we generated active-exosite peptides with structurally confirmed dual binding mode and improved potency. When fused to the BS via sortase coupling, these BACE1 inhibitors significantly reduced brain A\u03b2 levels in mice after intravenous administration. In plasma, both BS and non-BS BACE1 inhibitor peptides induced a significant time- and dose-dependent decrease of A\u03b2.

Mutant FUS transgenic mice showed hyperactivity, social interactional deficits, and impaired fear memory retrieval, all of which are compatible with FTD phenotypes. Histological analyses showed decreased dendritic spine and synaptic density in the frontal cortex before neuronal loss. Examination of cultured cells confirmed that mutant but not wild-type FUS was associated with decreased dendritic growth, mRNA levels, and protein synthesis in dendrites.

In addition, transplantated EPCs from chronic antibiotic-treated mice showed a lower therapeutic effect on cerebral ischemic injury reduction and local angiogenesis promotion compared to those from control mice, and EPCs from the donor animals could integrate into the recipient ischemic brain in mice. Furthermore, transplanted EPCs might exert paracrine effects on cerebral ischemic injury reduction in mice, which could be impaired by chronic antibiotic exposure. In conclusion, chronic subtherapeutic antibiotic exposure aggravated cerebral ischemic injury in mice, which might be partly attributed to the impairment of both EPC-mediated angiogenesis and EPCs' paracrine effects.

Gene expression analyses indicate that Lkb1 KO upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in interscapular BAT and epineurial brown adipocytes surrounding the sciatic nerve. This is followed by peripheral neuropathy characterized by infiltration of macrophages into the sciatic nerve, axon degeneration, reduced nerve conductance, and hindlimb paralysis. Mechanistically, Lkb1 KO reduces AMPK phosphorylation and amplifies mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent inflammatory signaling specifically in BAT but not WAT.

However, understanding noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcription and regulation during this process remains elusive. Here, we constructed transcriptomes for both long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in four important developmental stages ranging from early embryonic to cardiomyocyte based on high-throughput sequencing datasets, which indicate the high stage-specific expression patterns of two ncRNA types. Additionally, higher similarities of samples within each stage were found, highlighting the divergence of samples collected from distinct cardiac developmental stages. Next, we developed a method to identify numerous lncRNA and circRNA regulators whose expression was significantly stage-specific and shifted gradually and continuously during heart differentiation. We inferred that these ncRNAs are important for the stages of cardiac differentiation. Moreover, transcriptional regulation analysis revealed that the expression of stage-specific lncRNAs is controlled by known key stage-specific transcription factors (TFs). In addition, circRNAs exhibited dynamic expression patterns independent from their host genes. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that lncRNAs and circRNAs play critical roles in pathways that are activated specifically during heart differentiation. We further identified candidate TF-ncRNA-gene network modules for each differentiation stage, suggesting the dynamic organization of lncRNAs and circRNAs collectively controlled cardiac differentiation, which may cause heart-related diseases when defective.

Here we show that a reduction in the relative abundance of very particular bacterial taxa in the BTBR gut \u2013 namely, bile-metabolizing Bifidobacterium and Blautia species, - is associated with deficient bile acid and tryptophan metabolism in the intestine, marked gastrointestinal dysfunction, as well as impaired social interactions in BTBR mice. Together these data support the concept of targeted manipulation of the gut microbiota for reversing gastrointestinal and behavioral symptomatology in ASD, and offer specific plausible targets in this endeavor.",

     "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for depression and anxiety, but their efficacy relative to placebo has been questioned. We aimed to test how manipulation of verbally induced expectancies, central for placebo, influences SSRI treatment outcome and brain activity in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD).We did a randomized clinical trial, within an academic medical center (Uppsala, Sweden), of individuals fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria for SAD, recruited through media advertising. Participants were 18\u00a0years or older and randomized in blocks, through a computer-generated sequence by an independent party, to nine weeks of overt or covert treatment with escitalopram (20\u00a0mg daily). The overt group received correct treatment information whereas the covert group was treated deceptively with the SSRI described, by the psychiatrist, as active placebo. The treating psychiatrist was necessarily unmasked while the research staff was masked from intervention assignment. Treatment efficacy was assessed primarily with the self-rated Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR), administered at week 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9, also yielding a dichotomous estimate of responder status (clinically significant improvement). Before and at the last week of treatment, brain activity during an emotional face-matching task was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and during fMRI sessions, anticipatory speech anxiety was also assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State version (STAI-S). Analyses included all randomized patients with outcome data at posttreatment. This study is registered at ISRCTN, number 98890605.Between March 17th 2014 and May 22nd 2015, 47 patients were recruited. One patient in the covert group dropped out after a few days of treatment and did not provide fMRI data, leaving 46 patients with complete outcome data. After nine weeks of treatment, overt (n\u00a0=\u00a024) as compared to covert (n\u00a0=\u00a022) SSRI administration yielded significantly better outcome on the LSAS-SR (adjusted difference 21.17, 95% CI 10.69\u201331.65, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with more than three times higher response rate (50% vs. 14%; \u03c72(1)\u00a0=\u00a06.91, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and twice the effect size (d\u00a0=\u00a02.24 vs. d\u00a0=\u00a01.13) from pre-to posttreatment. There was no significant between-group difference on anticipatory speech anxiety (STAI-S), both groups improving with treatment. No serious adverse reactions were recorded. On fMRI outcomes, there was suggestive evidence for a differential neural response to treatment between groups in the posterior cingulate, superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri (all z thresholds exceeding 3.68, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Reduced social anxiety with treatment correlated significantly with enhanced posterior cingulate (z threshold 3.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0006) and attenuated amygdala (z threshold 2.70, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) activity.The clinical and neural effects of escitalopram were markedly influenced by verbal suggestions.

We also demonstrated that CQ attenuates ZIKV-associated morbidity and mortality in mice. Finally, we proved that CQ protects fetal mice from microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection. Our methodology of focusing on previously identified antivirals in screens for effectiveness against ZIKV proved to be a rapid and efficient means of discovering new ZIKV therapeutics.

We therefore investigated if adhesin types of S.mutans with sucrose-independent adhesion to host DMBT1 (i.e. SpaP A, B or C) and collagen (i.e. Cnm, Cbm) match and predict individual differences in caries development. The adhesin types were measured in whole saliva by qPCR in 452 12-year-old Swedish children and related to caries at baseline and prospectively at a 5-year follow-up. Strains isolated from the children were explored for genetic and phenotypic properties. The presence of SpaP B and Cnm subtypes coincided with increased 5-year caries increment, and their binding to DMBT1 and saliva correlated with individual caries scores. The SpaP B subtypes are enriched in amino acid substitutions that coincided with caries and binding and specify biotypes of S. mutans with increased acid tolerance. The findings reveal adhesin subtypes of S. mutans that match and predict individual differences in caries development and provide a rationale for individualized oral care.",

A CD4 T cell-targeted deletion of the gene that encodes Bcl6, the master transcription factor for the Tfh program, resulted in complete disruption of the Tfh response to Plasmodium chabaudi in C57BL/6 mice and consequent disruption of GC responses and IgG responses and the inability to eliminate the otherwise self-resolving chronic P. chabaudi infection. On the other hand, and contrary to previous observations in immunization and viral infection models, Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAM)-Associated Protein (SAP)-deficient mice were able to activate Tfh cells, GC B cells, and IgG responses to the parasite. This study demonstrates the critical role for Tfh cells in controlling this systemic infection, and highlights differences in the signals required to activate GC B cell responses to this complex parasite compared with those of protein immunizations and viral infections. Therefore, these data are highly pertinent for designing malaria vaccines able to activate broadly protective B-cell responses.",

However, the Chinese (SjC) and Philippine (SjP) strains of S. japonicum express a number of clear phenotypic differences, including aspects of host immune responses. This feature thereby emphasized the requirement to determine whether antigens identified as having diagnostic value for SjC infection are also suitable for the diagnosis of SjP infection.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that CXCL14 transports various types of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into the endosomes and lysosomes of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs), thereby activating Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). A combination of CpG ODN (ODN2395) plus CXCL14 induced robust production of IL-12 p40 by wild-type, but not Tlr9-knockout, DCs. Consistent with this, ODN2395-mediated activation of DCs was significantly attenuated in Cxcl14-knockout mice. CXCL14 bound CpG ODN with high affinity at pH\u00a07.5, but not at pH\u00a06.0, thereby enabling efficient delivery of CpG ODN to TLR9 in the endosome/lysosome. Furthermore, the CXCL14-CpG ODN complex specifically bound to high affinity CXCL14 receptors on DCs. Thus, CXCL14 serves as a specific carrier of CpG DNA to sensitize TLR9-mediated immunosurveillance.",

Gene expression profiling has recently gained popularity as an important new tool for precision medicine approaches. Here we used unbiased and directed approaches to understand how gene expression captures different CKD manifestations in patients with diabetic and hypertensive CKD.Transcriptome data from ninety-five microdissected human kidney samples with a range of demographics, functional and structural changes were used for the primary analysis. Data obtained from 41 samples were available for validation. Using the unbiased Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) we identified 16 co-expressed gene modules.We found that modules that strongly correlated with eGFR primarily encoded genes with metabolic functions. Gene groups that mainly encoded T-cell receptor and collagen pathways, showed the strongest correlation with fibrosis level, suggesting that these two phenotypic manifestations might have different underlying mechanisms. Linear regression models were then used to identify genes whose expression showed significant correlation with either structural (fibrosis) or functional (eGFR) manifestation and mostly corroborated the WGCNA findings.We concluded that gene expression is a very sensitive sensor of fibrosis, as the expression of 1654 genes correlated with fibrosis even after adjusting to eGFR and other clinical parameters. The association between GFR and gene expression was mostly mediated by fibrosis. In conclusion, our transcriptome-based CKD trait dissection analysis suggests that the association between gene expression and renal function is mediated by structural changes and that there may be differences in pathways that lead to decline in kidney function and the development of fibrosis, respectively.",

This includes the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) mature mesothelin, a 40\u00a0kDa cell surface-bound antigen that is overexpressed in several malignancies including lung ovarian and pancreatic cancer. We examined in an observational, prospective study the survival of patients with brain metastases in association with clinical parameters and cellular immune responses to molecularly defined TAAs or viral (control) target antigens.Immune cells in peripheral blood obtained from thirty-six patients with brain metastases were tested for cytokine production in response to a broad panel of defined viral and TAA target antigens, including full-length mesothelin. Incubation of immune cells with antigenic targets was carried out in i) medium alone, (ii) in a cytokine cocktail of interleukin (IL)-2/IL-15/IL-21, or (iii) IL-2/IL-7. Supernatants were tested for interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production, after which univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox stepwise regression model) were performed to identify independent clinical and immunological factors associated with patient survival. Patients were followed-up for at least 500\u00a0days after surgery or until death.Univariate analysis identified age, gender, radiotherapy and mutational load as clinical parameters affecting survival of patients with brain metastases. Cox multivariate analysis showed that radiotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7004), age (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7029) and IFN-\u03b3 responses to mature mesothelin, conditioned by IL-2/IL-7 (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7045) were independent predictors of the survival of patients from surgery up to follow-up or death.This is the first evidence that immune responses to mesothelin serve as a marker of increased overall survival in patients with brain metastases, regardless of the primary tumor origin. Analyses of immunological markers could potentially serve as prognostic markers in patients with brain metastases and help to select patients in need for adjunct, immunological, treatment strategies.",

     "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is known to be caused by Th1 cell-dependent autoimmunity. Recently, we reported that TYK2 promoter variant serves as a putative virus-induced diabetes susceptibility gene associated with deteriorated interferon-dependent antiviral response. TYK2 is also related to HIES, that is, Th2 cell-dependent. Therefore, TYK2 promoter variant may be also associated with the pathogenesis of T1D, modulating Th1/Th2 balance.We assessed the association between anti- GAD Ab, IgE levels, and TYK2 promoter variant among 313 T1D patients, 184 T2D patients, and 264 YH controls in the Japanese.T1D patients had elevated IgE (median, 56.7\u00a0U/ml; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) compared with T2D patients (22.5\u00a0U/ml) and controls (43.3\u00a0U/ml). Contrary to our expectations, there was no correlation between TYK2 promoter variant and IgE levels. We found that T1D could be subtyped as four groups based on anti-GAD Ab and IgE profile: Subtype 1, anti-GAD Ab positive and non-elevated IgE (47.0%); Subtype 2, anti-GAD Ab negative and non-elevated IgE (35.1%); Subtype 3, anti-GAD Ab positive and elevated IgE (10.9%); and Subtype 4, anti-GAD Ab negative and elevated IgE (7.0%). In Subtype 2, a significantly higher incidence was observed in T1D cases carrying the TYK2 promoter variant (OR, 2.60; 95%CI, 1.03\u20136.97; p\u00a0=\u00a00.032), and also showing a flu-like syndrome at diabetes onset (OR, 2.34; 95%CI, 1.27\u20134.35; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).Anti-GAD Ab and IgE profiling helps classifying T1D into four groups that recognize variable pathogenic bases of T1D.",

To demonstrate that the latency reversing agent vorinostat (VOR) induces a window of vulnerability in the latent HIV reservoir, defined as the triggering of viral antigen production sufficient in quantity and duration to allow for recognition and clearance of persisting infection, we developed a latency clearance assay (LCA). The LCA is a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) that includes the addition of immune effectors capable of clearing cells expressing viral antigen. Here we show a reduction in the recovery of replication-competent virus from VOR exposed resting CD4 T cells following addition of immune effectors for a discrete period. Take home message: VOR exposure leads to sufficient production of viral protein on the cell surface, creating a window of vulnerability within this latent reservoir in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV-infected individuals that allows the clearance of latently infected cells by an array of effector mechanisms.",

During thalidomide treatment, a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), a decrease in CD4 count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), an increase in cell activation calculated by the percentage of CD38 +/HLA-DR+ CD8 cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and an increase in US-CRP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were observed in the Thalidomide group, with all parameters returning to baseline levels after thalidomide interruption. We confirmed that thalidomide increased HIV replication in vitro of 6 of 7 samples from long-term antiretroviral suppressed individuals.Harms: No class 3/4 adverse events occurred.Short-term use of thalidomide led to an intense transient increase in T cell activation and inflammation, with a decrease in the CD4+ cell count without changes to the CD8+ cell count.

PCSK9 concentrations were significantly increased in SVRs, suggesting that PCSK9 may help impede viral infection.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-fibrotic effect of PRI-724, a small-molecule modulator of Wnt signaling, in patients with HCV cirrhosis.In this single-center, open-label, phase 1 trial, we sequentially enrolled patients with HCV cirrhosis who were classified as Child-Pugh (CP) class A or B. PRI-724 was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of 10, 40, or 160\u00a0mg/m2/day for six cycles of 1\u00a0week on and 1\u00a0week off. The primary endpoints were frequency and severity of adverse events. The secondary endpoint was efficacy of PRI-724 in treating cirrhosis based on CP score and liver biopsy. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no. NCT02195440).Between Sept 3, 2014 and May 2, 2016, 14 patients were enrolled: CP class A:B, 6:8; median age, 62 (range: 43 to 74) years; male:female, 10:4. Twelve of the 14 patients completed six cycles of treatment; one was withdrawn from the study due to possible study drug-related liver injury (grade 3) in the 160\u00a0mg/m2/day dose cohort and one withdrew for personal reasons. Serious adverse events occurred in three patients [21% (3/14)], one of which was possibly related to PRI-724. The most common adverse events were nausea [29% (4/14)] and fatigue [21% (3/14)].After PRI-724 administration, the CP scores worsened by 1 point in two patients in the 10\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort, improved in three patients at 1, 1, and 2 points in the 40\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort, and improved in one patient by 3 points in the 160\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort. The histology activity index scores of the liver tissue improved in two patients and exacerbated in two patients in the 10\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort, and improved in one patient in the 40\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort.This study showed that administration of 10 or 40\u00a0mg/m2/day intravenous PRI-724 over 12\u00a0weeks was well-tolerated by patients with HCV cirrhosis; however, liver injury as a possible related serious adverse event was observed in the 160\u00a0mg/m2/day cohort.AMED.",

Here, we determined that neutrophils express IL-17 in an autocrine IL-6- and IL-23-dependent manner during MTB infection. MTB H37Rv-induced IL-6 production was dependent on the NF-\u03baB, p38, and JNK signaling pathways; however, IL-23 production was dependent on NF-\u03baB and EKR in neutrophils. Furthermore, we found that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 mediated the activation of the kinases NF-\u03baB, p38, ERK, and JNK and the production of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17 in neutrophils infected with MTB H37Rv. Autocrine IL-17 produced by neutrophils played a vital role in inhibiting MTB H37Rv growth by mediating reactive oxygen species production and the migration of neutrophils in the early stages of infection. However, IL-17 production by neutrophils contributed to collagen-induced arthritis development during MTB infection.

Using biochemical approaches and imaging we demonstrate that Chlamydia-induced PDPK1-MYC signaling induces host hexokinase II (HKII), which becomes enriched and translocated to the mitochondria. Strikingly, preventing the HKII interaction with mitochondria using exogenous peptides triggers apoptosis of infected cells as does inhibiting either PDPK1 or MYC, which also disrupts intracellular development of Chlamydia trachomatis. These findings identify a previously unknown pathway activated by Chlamydia infection, which exhibits pro-carcinogenic features.

We have previously shown that inactivation of the Escherichia coli cysB gene is the major cause of mecillinam resistance (MecR) in clinical isolates. In this study, we used different E. coli strains (laboratory and clinical isolates) that were MecR due to cysB mutations to determine how mecillinam susceptibility was affected during growth in urine compared to growth in the commonly used growth medium Mueller Hinton (MHB). We also examined mecillinam susceptibility when bacteria were grown in urine obtained from 48 different healthy volunteers. Metabolome analysis was done on the urine samples and the association between the mecillinam susceptibility patterns of the bacteria and urine metabolite levels was studied.Two major findings with clinical significance are reported. First, MecR E. coli cysB mutant strains (both laboratory and clinical isolates) were always more susceptible to mecillinam when grown in urine as compared to laboratory medium, with many strains showing complete phenotypic susceptibility in urine. Second, the degree of reversion to susceptibility varied between urine samples obtained from different individuals. This difference was correlated with osmolality such that in urine with low osmolality the MecR mutants were more susceptible to mecillinam than in urine with high osmolality.This is the first example describing conditional resistance where a genetically stable antibiotic resistance can be phenotypically reverted to susceptibility by metabolites present in urine. These findings have several important clinical implications regarding the use of mecillinam to treat UTIs. First, they suggest that mecillinam can be used to treat also those clinical strains that are identified as MecR in standard laboratory tests. Second, the results suggest that testing of mecillinam susceptibility in the laboratory ought to be performed in media that mimics urine to obtain clinically relevant susceptibility testing results. Third, these findings imply that changes in patient behavior, such as increased water intake or use of diuretics to reduce urine osmolality and increased intake of cysteine, might induce antibiotic susceptibility in an infecting MecR E. coli strain and thereby increase treatment efficiency.",

In the clinical genotyping analysis of 1182 \u03b2-thalassemia subjects, we identified a group of additional variants that can be used for accurate diagnosis. In the molecular screening analysis of the 10,111 couples, we detected 4180 individuals in total who carried 4840 mutant alleles, and identified 186 couples at risk of having affected offspring. 12.1% of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified by our NGS assay, which were undetectable by traditional methods. Compared with the traditional methods, our assay identified an additional at-risk 35 couples. We describe a comprehensive NGS-based test that offers advantages over the traditional screening/molecular testing methods. To our knowledge, this is among the first large-scale population study to systematically evaluate the application of an NGS technique in carrier screening and molecular diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies.",

Nonselective induction of Hsp70 upregulation for inflammation therapy could cause extensive interference in inflammation-unrelated protein functions, potentially resulting in side effects. Nevertheless, direct pharmacological activation of Hsp70 via targeting specific functional amino acid residue may provide an insight into precise Hsp70 function regulation and a more satisfactory treatment effect for inflammation, which has not been extensively focused. Here we show a cysteine residue (Cys306) for selective Hsp70 activation using natural small-molecule handelin. Covalent modification of Cys306 significantly elevates Hsp70 activity and shows more satisfactory anti-neuroinflammation effects. Mechanism study reveals Cys306 modification by handelin induces an allosteric regulation to facilitate adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis capacity of Hsp70, which leads to the effective blockage of subsequent inflammation signaling pathway. Collectively, our study offers some insights into direct pharmacological activation of Hsp70 by specially targeting functional cysteine residue, thus providing a powerful tool for accurately modulating neuroinflammation pathogenesis in human with fewer undesirable adverse effects.",

Cholesterol, a structural component of neutrophil plasma membranes influences cell adhesion, a key step in transmigration. The effect of chronic inflammation on neutrophil membrane cholesterol content in patients with CF (PWCF) remains unclear. To address this we examined neutrophils of PWCF to evaluate the cause and consequence of altered membrane cholesterol and identified the effects of lung transplantation and ion channel potentiator therapy on the cellular mechanisms responsible for perturbed membrane cholesterol and increased cell adhesion.PWCF homozygous for the \u0394F508 mutation or heterozygous for the G551D mutation were recruited (n\u00a0=\u00a048). Membrane protein expression was investigated by mass spectrometry. The effect of lung transplantation or ivacaftor therapy was assessed by ELISAs, and calcium fluorometric and \u03bc-calpain assays.Membranes of CF neutrophils contain less cholesterol, yet increased integrin CD11b expression, and respond to inflammatory induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by activating \u03bc-calpain. In vivo and in vitro, increased \u03bc-calpain activity resulted in proteolysis of the membrane cholesterol trafficking protein caveolin-1. The critical role of caveolin-1 for adequate membrane cholesterol content was confirmed in caveolin-1 knock-out mice. Lung transplant therapy or treatment of PWCF with ivacaftor, reduced levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and actuated increased caveolin-1 and membrane cholesterol, with concurrent normalized neutrophil adhesion.Results demonstrate an auxiliary benefit of lung transplant and potentiator therapy, evident by a reduction in circulating inflammation and controlled neutrophil adhesion.",

The contradictory contributions of NFIB to both the inhibition and promotion of tumour development and progression, corroborates its diverse and context-dependent roles in many tissues and cell types. Considering the frequent involvement of NFIB in cancer, a better understanding of its multifaceted nature may ultimately benefit the development of novel strategies for the management of a broad spectrum of malignancies.

Within the scope of those inflammatory pathways and in understanding the pathogenesis of disease, we suggest that viruses, in particular Coxsackieviruses, act by causing a type 1 interferonopathy within the pancreas and the microenvironment of the islet.

Surprisingly, our analysis using genome-wide differential allele-specific expression (DASE), an indicator for breast cancer susceptibility, suggested that the genetic alterations of CCDC170, but not ESR1, account for GWAS-associated breast cancer risk at this locus. Breast cancer-associated CCDC170 nonsense mutations and rearrangements have also been detected, with the latter being specifically implicated in driving breast cancer. Here we report that the wild type CCDC170 protein localizes to the region of the Golgi apparatus and binds Golgi-associated microtubules (MTs), and that breast cancer-linked truncations of CCDC170 result in loss of Golgi localization. Overexpression of wild type CCDC170 triggers Golgi reorganization, and enhances Golgi-associated MT stabilization and acetyltransferase ATAT1-dependent \u03b1-tubulin acetylation. Golgi-derived MTs regulate cellular polarity and motility, and we provide evidence that dysregulation of CCDC170 affects polarized cell migration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that CCDC170 plays an essential role in Golgi-associated MT organization and stabilization, and implicate a mechanism for how perturbations in the CCDC170 gene may contribute to the hallmark changes in cell polarity and motility seen in breast cancer.",

This occurs in a protein kinase C and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-dependent manner. Tim-3 participates in galectin-9 secretion and is also released in a free soluble form. Galectin-9 impairs the anti-cancer activity of cytotoxic lymphoid cells including natural killer (NK) cells. Soluble Tim-3 prevents secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) required for the activation of cytotoxic lymphoid cells.

The application of immunotherapy, a promising approach for HCC is urgently needed. Macrophage infiltration, mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 axis, is a potential immunotherapeutic target. Here, we report that a natural product from Abies georgei, named 747 and related in structure to kaempferol, exhibits sensitivity and selectivity as a CCR2 antagonist. The specificity of 747 on CCR2 was demonstrated via calcium flux, the binding domain of CCR2 was identified in an extracellular loop by chimera binding assay, and in vivo antagonistic activity of 747 was confirmed through a thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. In animals, 747 elevated the number of CD8\u00a0+ T cells in tumors via blocking tumor-infiltrating macrophage-mediated immunosuppression and inhibited orthotopic and subcutaneous tumor growth in a CD8\u00a0+ T cell-dependent manner. Further, 747 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of low-dose sorafenib without obvious toxicity, through elevating the numbers of intra-tumoral CD8\u00a0+ T cells and increasing death of tumor cells. Thus, we have discovered a natural CCR2 antagonist and have provided a new perspective on development of this antagonist for treatment of HCC. In mouse models of HCC, 747 enhanced the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment and potentiated the therapeutic effect of sorafenib, indicating that the combination of an immunomodulator with a chemotherapeutic drug could be a new approach for treating HCC.",

In this model, various cell surface receptors were upregulated on macrophages, and phagocytosis of live cells was induced in a Rac1-dependent manner. Subsequent inhibition of the ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and both of these receptors abolished in vitro and in vivo phagocytosis of live T cells, myeloid cells, and B cells, respectively. Specifically, the reduction in lymphocyte numbers due to in vivo activation of macrophages was ameliorated in Icam-1-deficient mice. In addition, overexpression of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 in non-phagocytic NIH3T3 cells led to active phagocytosis of live cells. These data indicate molecular mechanisms underlying live cell phagocytosis induced by hyper-inflammation, and this experimental model will be useful to clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms of hemophagocytosis and to indicate therapeutic targets.",

C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with DMT adjuvant ed CMFO (CMFO-DMT) were protected more significantly than by CTT3H-DMT, and efficacy was similar to that of the only licensed vaccine, Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and A1D4-DMT in the M. tuberculosis primary infection model. In the setting of BCG priming and latent TB infection, M. tuberculosis in the lung and spleen was eliminated more effectively in mice boosted with CMFO-DMT rather than with BCG, A1D4-DMT, or CTT3H-DMT. In particular, sterile immunity was only conferred by CMFO-DMT, which was associated with expedited homing of interferon-gamma+\u00a0CD4+ TEM and interleukin-2+ TCM cells from the spleen to the infected lung. CMFO-DMT represents a promising candidate to prevent the occurrence of adult TB through both prophylactic and therapeutic methods, and warrants assessment in preclinical and clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "Pneumocystis jirovecii is an airborne human-specific ascomycetous fungus responsible for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in immunocompromised patients, affecting >\u00a0500,000 patients per year (www.gaffi.org). The understanding of its epidemiology is limited by the lack of standardised culture. Recent genotyping data suggests a limited genetic diversity of P. jirovecii. The objective of the study was to assess the diversity of P. jirovecii across European hospitals and analyse P. jirovecii diversity in respect to clinical data obtained from the patients.Genotyping was performed using six already validated short tandem repeat (STR) markers on 249 samples (median: 17 per centre interquartile range [11\u00a0\u2212\u00a020]) from PCP patients of 16 European centres.Mixtures of STR markers (i.e., \u2265\u00a02 alleles for \u2265\u00a01 locus) were detected in 67.6% (interquartile range [61.4; 76.5]) of the samples. Mixture was significantly associated with the underlying disease of the patient, with an increased proportion in HIV patients (78.3%) and a decreased proportion in renal transplant recipients (33.3%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The distribution of the alleles was significantly different (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) according to the centres in three out of six markers. In analysable samples, 201 combinations were observed corresponding to 137 genotypes: 116 genotypes were country-specific; 12 in two; six in three; and two in four and one in five countries. Nine genotypes were recorded more than once in a given country. Genotype 123 (Gt123) was significantly associated with France (14/15, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Gt16 with Belgium (5/5, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). More specifically, Gt123 was observed mainly in France (14/15/16 patients) and in renal transplant patient (13/15).Our study showed the wide population diversity across Europe, with evidence of local clusters of patients harbouring a given genotype. These data suggest a specific association between genotype and underlying disease, with evidence of a different natural history of PCP in HIV patients and renal transplant recipients.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 164,000 deaths yearly are due to shigellosis, primarily in developing countries. Thus, a safe and affordable Shigella vaccine is an important public health priority. The GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) developed a candidate Shigella sonnei vaccine (1790GAHB) using the Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) technology. The paper reports results of 1790GAHB Phase 1 studies in healthy European adults.To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity profiles of 1790GAHB, we performed two parallel, phase 1, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation studies in France (\u201cstudy 1\u201d) and the United Kingdom (\u201cstudy 2\u201d) between February 2014 and April 2015 (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02017899 and NCT02034500, respectively) in 18\u201345\u00a0years old subjects (50 in study 1, 52 in study 2). Increasing doses of Alhydrogel adsorbed 1790, expressed by both O Antigen (OAg) and protein quantity, or placebo were given either by intramuscular route (0.059/1, 0.29/5, 1.5/25, 2.9/50, 5.9/100\u00a0\u03bcg of OAg/\u03bcg of protein; study 1) or by intradermal (ID), intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) route of immunization (0.0059/0.1, 0.059/1, 0.59/10\u00a0\u03bcg ID, 0.29/5, 1.2/20, 4.8/80\u00a0\u03bcg IN and 0.29/5\u00a0\u03bcg IM, respectively; study 2). In absence of serologic correlates of protection for Shigella sonnei, vaccine induced immunogenicity was compared to anti-LPS antibody in a population naturally exposed to S. sonnei.Vaccines were well tolerated in both studies and no death or vaccine related serious adverse events were reported. In study 1, doses \u2265\u00a01.5/25\u00a0\u03bcg elicited serum IgG median antibody greater than median level in convalescent subjects after the first dose. No vaccine group in study 2 achieved median antibody greater than the median convalescent antibody.Intramuscularly administered Shigella sonnei GMMA vaccine is well tolerated, up to and including 5.9/100\u00a0\u03bcg and induces antibody to the OAg of at least the same magnitude of those observed following natural exposure to the pathogen. Vaccine administered by ID or IN, although well tolerated, is poorly immunogenic at the doses delivered. The data support the use of the GMMA technology for the development of intramuscular multivalent Shigella vaccines.",

The health implications have not been examined.We reanalysed data from Matlab, Bangladesh, to examine the influence of co-administration on mortality; 37,894 children born 1986-1999 were followed with registration of vaccinations and survival.Using Cox models, survival was analysed from 6\u00a0weeks to 9\u00a0months of age when measles vaccine is given; 712 children died in this age group. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for children starting the vaccination schedule with BCG-first, BCG\u00a0+\u00a0DTP1-first or DTP1-first.Only 17% followed the WHO-schedule with BCG-first. Mortality was 16/1000 person-years for children who initiated the vaccination schedule with BCG\u00a0+\u00a0DTP1 but 32/1000 and 20/1000 for children who received BCG-first or DTP-first, respectively. Compared with BCG\u00a0+\u00a0DTP1-first and adjusting for background factors, the BCG-first-schedule was associated with 2-fold higher mortality (MRR\u00a0=\u00a01.94 (1.42\u20132.63)). DTP1 administered after BCG-first was associated with higher mortality than receiving DTP1 with BCG (MRR\u00a0=\u00a01.78 (1.03\u20133.03)).Co-administration of BCG and DTP may further reduce mortality. Since all observational studies support this trend, co-administration of BCG and DTP should be tested in randomised trials.",

     "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication secondary to diabetes and is the number one cause of blindness among working age individuals worldwide. Despite recent therapeutic breakthroughs using pharmacotherapy, a cure for DR has yet to be realized. Several clinical trials have highlighted the vital role dyslipidemia plays in the progression of DR. Additionally, it has recently been shown that activation of Liver X receptor (LXR\u03b1/LXR\u03b2) prevents DR in diabetic animal models. LXRs are nuclear receptors that play key roles in regulating cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. In this manuscript, we show insight into DR pathogenesis by demonstrating an innovative signaling axis that unifies key metabolic regulators, Sirtuin 1 and LXR, in modulating retinal cholesterol metabolism and inflammation in the diabetic retina. Expression of both regulators, Sirtuin 1 and LXR, are significantly decreased in diabetic human retinal samples and in a type 2 diabetic animal model. Additionally, activation of LXR restores reverse cholesterol transport, prevents inflammation, reduces pro-inflammatory macrophages activity and prevents the formation of diabetes-induced acellular capillaries. Taken together, the work presented in this manuscript highlights the important role lipid dysregulation plays in DR progression and offers a novel potential therapeutic target for the treatment of DR.",

     "abstract": "It has been suggested that the increase in carbohydrate at the expense of fat has contributed to the obesity epidemic in North America and some European countries. However, obesity rates in China have increased rapidly in parallel with a transition from the traditional low fat, high carbohydrate diet to a diet relatively high in fat and reduced in carbohydrate. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine whether the traditional Chinese diet was likely to be more effective than a diet with higher fat and lower carbohydrate \u2014 which is consumed in most Western societies, at weight control among a non-obese healthy population in China.The 6-month, two-center, three-arm, randomized, parallel-group, controlled-feeding trial was conducted at People's Liberation Army General Hospital in north China and Zhejiang University in south China. We recruited healthy young adults (aged 18\u201335\u00a0years, body mass index <\u00a028) who lived in the university campus or the hospital dormitory during the whole study intervention period. They were required to eat only the foods provided, and to avoid excessive or unusual strenuous exercise during the trial. Participants were simultaneously enrolled and randomized using a computer-generated number (stratified by clinic center, age, sex, and body mass index) by data manager to one of the three isocaloric diets (1:1:1): a lower fat, higher carbohydrate diet (fat 20%, carbohydrate 66% energy); a moderate fat, moderate carbohydrate diet (fat 30%, carbohydrate 56% energy); a higher fat, lower carbohydrate diet (fat 40%, carbohydrate 46% energy). Protein provided 14% energy in all diets. We provided all food and beverages throughout the 6-month intervention. Laboratory personnel were masked to treatment allocation. Body weight was the primary outcome and measured each month. Data were primarily analyzed according to an intention-to-treat approach, supplemented with per-protocol analysis. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Zhejiang University. Each participant provided written informed consent. The study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02355795.Between April 30, 2016, and October 30, 2016, 307 participants were randomly assigned to the lower fat diet (n\u00a0=\u00a0101), the moderate fat diet (n\u00a0=\u00a0105) and the higher fat diet (n\u00a0=\u00a0101), and 245 (79.8%) participants completed the study. Reduction in body weight was significantly greater in the lower fat, higher carbohydrate group throughout the intervention (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for the interaction between diet group and time) than in the two other groups. Weight change at 6\u00a0months was \u2212\u00a01.6\u00a0kg (95% CI \u2212\u00a01.8 to \u2212\u00a01.4) in the lower fat, higher carbohydrate group; \u2212\u00a01.1\u00a0kg (95% CI \u2212\u00a01.3 to \u2212\u00a00.9) in the moderate fat, moderate carbohydrate group, and \u2212\u00a00.9\u00a0kg (95% CI \u2212\u00a01.1 to \u2212\u00a00.6) in the higher fat, lower carbohydrate group. Reduction in waist circumference, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on the lower fat, higher carbohydrate group were greater than those observed on the other two diet groups.A lower fat, relatively higher carbohydrate diet, similar in macronutrient composition to that traditionally eaten in China appears to be less likely to promote excessive weight gain and be associated with a lower cardiometabolic risk profile than a diet more typical of that eaten in Western countries in healthy non-obese Chinese. Findings from studies in European and North American populations suggesting possible benefits of carbohydrate restriction may not apply to people of other ethnicities.",

We have recently created small chemicals, KUSs (Kyoto University Substances), which can reduce cellular ATP consumption. By contrast, agonistic ligands of ERRs (estrogen receptor-related receptors) are expected to raise cellular ATP levels via enhancing ATP production. Here, we show that esculetin functions as an ERR agonist, and its addition to culture media enhances glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, leading to elevated cellular ATP levels. Subsequently, we show the neuroprotective efficacies of KUSs, esculetin, and GSK4716 (an ERR\u03b3 agonist) against cell death in Parkinson's disease models. In the surviving neurons, ATP levels and expression levels of \u03b1-synuclein and CHOP (an ER stress-mediated cell death executor) were all rectified. We propose that maintenance of ATP levels, by inhibiting ATP consumption or enhancing ATP production, or both, would be a promising therapeutic strategy for Parkinson's disease.",

Interestingly, abnormalities in the thalamus and medial orbitofrontal cortex were present in medicated patients whereas entirely absent in premotor and ventral striatum.

Subjects initially received IM oxytocin 10 international units (IU) on day 1, IH placebo on day 2, and IH oxytocin 50\u00a0\u03bcg on day 3. Subjects were then randomized 4:1 using validated GSK internal software to IH placebo or ascending doses of IH oxytocin (200, 400, 600\u00a0\u03bcg). PK was assessed by comparing systemic exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration, area under the concentration-time curve, and plasma concentrations at 10 and 30\u00a0min post dose) for IH versus IM oxytocin. Adverse events (AEs), spirometry, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and cardiac telemetry were assessed.Subjects were recruited between September 14, 2015 and October 12, 2015. Of the 16 subjects randomized following initial dosing, 15 (IH placebo n\u00a0=\u00a03; IH oxytocin n\u00a0=\u00a012) completed the study. IH (all doses) and IM oxytocin PK profiles were comparable in shape. However, systemic exposure with IH oxytocin 400\u00a0\u03bcg most closely matched IM oxytocin 10\u00a0IU. Systemic exposure was approximately dose proportional for IH oxytocin. No serious AEs were reported. No clinically significant findings were observed for any safety parameters.These data suggest that similar oxytocin systemic exposure can be achieved with IM and IH administration routes, and no safety concerns were identified with either route.

     "abstract": "Cell senescence is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to the loss of health and fitness associated with aging. Senescent cells accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria; oxidative phosphorylation efficiency is decreased and reactive oxygen species production is increased. In this review we will discuss how the turnover of mitochondria (a term referred to as mitophagy) is perturbed in senescence contributing to mitochondrial accumulation and Senescence-Associated Mitochondrial Dysfunction (SAMD). We will further explore the subsequent cellular consequences; in particular SAMD appears to be necessary for at least part of the specific Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) and may be responsible for tissue-level metabolic dysfunction that is associated with aging and obesity. Understanding the complex interplay between these major senescence-associated phenotypes will help to select and improve interventions that prolong healthy life in humans.Data for this review were identified by searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms \u201cmitochondria AND senescence\u201d, \u201c(autophagy OR mitophagy) AND senescence\u201d, \u201cmitophagy AND aging\u201d and related terms.

Telomeres shorten as a result of cellular replication, leading to a permanent cell cycle arrest, also known as replicative senescence. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in mammalian tissue with age and in a number of age-related diseases, suggesting that they might contribute to the loss of tissue function observed with age. In this review, we will first describe evidence suggesting a key role for senescence in the ageing process and elaborate on some of the mechanisms by which telomeres can induce cellular senescence. Furthermore, we will present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that telomeres can act as sensors of both intrinsic and extrinsic stress as well as recent data indicating that telomere\u2013induced senescence may occur irrespectively of the length of telomeres.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence entails essentially irreversible replicative arrest, apoptosis resistance, and frequently acquisition of a pro-inflammatory, tissue-destructive senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues with aging and at sites of pathogenesis in many chronic diseases and conditions. The SASP can contribute to senescence-related inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, stem cell dysfunction, aging phenotypes, chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes, and loss of resilience. Delaying senescent cell accumulation or reducing senescent cell burden is associated with delay, prevention, or alleviation of multiple senescence-associated conditions. We used a hypothesis-driven approach to discover pro-survival Senescent Cell Anti-apoptotic Pathways (SCAPs) and, based on these SCAPs, the first senolytic agents, drugs that cause senescent cells to become susceptible to their own pro-apoptotic microenvironment. Several senolytic agents, which appear to alleviate multiple senescence-related phenotypes in pre-clinical models, are beginning the process of being translated into clinical interventions that could be transformative.",

Advances in the fields of molecular biology have increased the variety of potential candidate biomarkers that may be considered as biological age predictors. In this review, we summarize current state-of-the-art findings considering six potential types of biological age predictors: epigenetic clocks, telomere length, transcriptomic predictors, proteomic predictors, metabolomics-based predictors, and composite biomarker predictors. Promising developments consider multiple combinations of these various types of predictors, which may shed light on the aging process and provide further understanding of what contributes to healthy aging. Thus far, the most promising, new biological age predictor is the epigenetic clock; however its true value as a biomarker of aging requires longitudinal confirmation.",

Aging research as a discipline is necessarily broad; in part because aging itself is multi-faceted and in part because different model systems are employed to define the underlying biology. In this review we outline aspects of aging research that are likely to uncover the pivotal events leading to age-related disease vulnerability. We focus on studies of human aging and discuss the value of research on caloric restriction, an intervention with proven efficacy in delaying aging.

Co-expression of GNL1 and altGNL1 was validated by transfection in HEK293 and HeLa cells with an expression plasmid containing a GNL1-FLAG(V5) construct.

Aggressive breast cancers are characterized by loss of cellular differentiation. Defining molecular mechanisms/targets contributing to cancer aggressiveness is needed to guide the design of new screening and targeted treatments. Here, we describe a novel tumor promoting function for the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor-6 (CPSF6). Importantly, aggressive breast cancer cells of luminal B, HER2-overexpressing and triple negative subtypes show dependency on CPSF6 for viability and tumorigenic capacity. Mechanistically, we found CPSF6 to interact with components of the A-to-I RNA editing machinery, paraspeckles and ADAR1 enzyme, and to be required for their physical integrity. Clinically, we found CPSF6 and all core paraspeckles proteins to be overexpressed in human breast cancer cases and their expression to correlate with poor patient outcomes. Finally, we found prolactin, a key mammary differentiation factor, to suppress CPSF6/RNA editing activity. Together, this study revealed CPSF6 as a molecular target with clinical relevance for prognosis and therapy in breast cancer.",

Three most common EGFR mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletion, and T790M) are known to be major selection markers for EGFR-TKIs therapy. Here, we developed a multiplex picodroplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to detect 3 common EGFR mutations in 1 reaction. Serial-dilution experiments with genomic DNA harboring EGFR mutations revealed linear performance, with analytical sensitivity ~\u00a00.01% for each mutation. All 33 EGFR-activating mutations detected in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by the conventional method were also detected by this multiplex assay. Owing to the higher sensitivity, an additional mutation (T790M; including an ultra-low-level mutation, <\u00a00.1%) was detected in the same reaction. Regression analysis of the duplex assay and multiplex assay showed a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9986 for L858R, 0.9844 for an exon 19 deletion, and 0.9959 for T790M. Using ddPCR, we designed a multiplex ultrasensitive genotyping platform for 3 common EGFR mutations.

The electroneutral Na+-K+-2Cl\u2212 co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) is an important cell volume regulator that participates in cell migration. We have shown that inhibition of NKCC1 in GBM cells leads to decreased cell migration, in vitro and in vivo. We now report on the role of NKCC1 on cytoskeletal dynamics. We show that GBM cells display a significant decrease in F-actin content upon NKCC1 knockdown (NKCC1-KD). To determine the potential actin-regulatory mechanisms affected by NKCC1 inhibition, we studied NKCC1 protein interactions. We found that NKCC1 interacts with the actin-regulating protein Cofilin-1 and can regulate its membrane localization. Finally, we analyzed whether NKCC1 could regulate the activity of the small Rho-GTPases RhoA and Rac1. We observed that the active forms of RhoA and Rac1 were decreased in NKCC1-KD cells. In summary, we report that NKCC1 regulates GBM cell migration by modulating the cytoskeleton through multiple targets including F-actin regulation through Cofilin-1 and RhoGTPase activity. Due to its essential role in cell migration NKCC1 may serve as a specific therapeutic target to decrease cell invasion in patients with primary brain cancer.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) development and progression, and most studies have been focused on aberrant DNA methylation and histone modifying enzymes. However, the histone H3\u2013H4 chaperone ASF1A is an important factor regulating chromatin assembling and gene transcription, while it is currently unclear whether ASF1A is involved in cancer pathogenesis. The present study is thus designed to address this issue. Here we showed that ASF1A expression was widespread in GIC-derived cell lines and up-regulated in primary GIC. Higher levels of ASF1A expression predicted significantly shorter patient overall survival in colorectal cancer (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0012). The further analyses of the GEO dataset validate higher ASF1A expression as a prognostic factor for CRC patients. Mechanistically, ASF1A interacted with \u03b2-catenin and promoted the transcription of \u03b2-catenin target genes including c-MYC, cyclin D1, ZEB1 and LGR5, thereby stimulating proliferation, stemness and migration/invasion of GIC cells. \u03b2-Catenin inhibition abolished these effects of ASF1A. Moreover, the ASF1A-\u03b2-catenin-ZEB1 axis down-regulated E-Cadherin expression, thereby contributing to enhanced migration/invasion of GIC cells. ASF1A over-expression and depletion facilitated and inhibited in vivo tumor growth and/or metastasis in mouse xenograft models, respectively. Taken together, ASF1A is aberrantly over-expressed in GIC tumors and plays key roles in GIC development and progression by stimulating the transcription of \u03b2-catenin target genes. ASF1A may thus be a novel target for GIC therapy and a potential prognostic marker.",

There were no significant differences between patients with positive and negative clinical, endoscopic and histological outcomes concerning their IFX trough levels (TLs), area under the IFX concentration vs. time curve (AUC), clearance and antibodies to infliximab (ATI) levels.

     "abstract": "Besides its essential role in the activation of HIV-1 gene expression, the viral Tat protein has the unusual property of trafficking in and out of cells. In contrast to Tat internalization, the mechanism involved in extracellular Tat release has so far remained elusive. Here we show that Tat secretion occurs through a Golgi-independent pathway requiring binding of Tat with three short, non-consecutive intracytoplasmic loops at the C-terminus of the cellular Na+,K+-ATPase pump alpha subunit. Ouabain, a pump inhibitor, blocked this interaction and prevented Tat secretion; virions produced in the presence of this drug were less infectious, consistent the capacity of virion-associated Tat to increase HIV-1 infectivity. Treatment of CD4\u00a0+ T-cells with short peptides corresponding to the Tat-binding regions of the pump alpha subunit impaired extracellular Tat release and blocked HIV-1 replication. Thus, non canonical, extracellular Tat secretion is essential for viral infectivity.",

     "abstract": "The most recent European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2016 Guidelines on treatment of hepatitis C (HCV), allowed for shortening the course of treatment for some subsets of patients with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and with grazoprevir/elbasvir based on cutoff baseline HCV RNA values. We hypothesized that it would be prudent to also consider an objectively assuring very rapid, on-treatment, virologic response to therapy at week 2 (vRVR) before taking the decision of shortening the treatment duration. So we planned this study to test whether a dual sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) treatment duration tailored according to achieving vRVR to 8 or 12\u00a0weeks is non-inferior to the recommended fixed 12\u00a0weeks course in non-cirrhotic Egyptian chronic HCV genotype-4 patients.The study was conducted in an outpatient setting according to a prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative, non-inferiority study design. A hundred twenty eligible, non-cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily doses in the form of one Gratisovir 400\u00a0mg table (generic sofosbuvir produced by Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Alexandria, Egypt) plus one Daktavira 60\u00a0mg tablet (generic daclatasvir produced by Dawood Pharm, Egypt) for either a fixed 12\u00a0weeks duration (reference group) or a response tailored duration (test group). In the test group the treatment duration was tailored according to the virus load tested by real time PCR into 8\u00a0weeks for patients who had undetectable HCV RNA level in their serum by the end of the second week of treatment (vRVR)), or 12\u00a0weeks for those who did not show vRVR. The primary outcome of the trial was the proportions of patients achieving SVR12 (HCV RNA below lower level of quantification at week 12 after end of treatment). The comparison between groups was based on testing the null hypothesis of inferiority of the response-tailored group with a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority (NI-m) of 0.1 (10%).The protocol was registered with a WHO Clinical Trial Registration ID: ACTRN12617000263392. https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372041Starting from Jun, 5 2016, a hundred twenty eligible patients from 4 outpatient clinics in Alexandria, Egypt were randomized to either a fixed duration group (reference group: n\u00a0=\u00a060 patients) or a response tailored duration group (test group: n\u00a0=\u00a060 patients). During the whole period of the study, only 1 patient dropped-out from each group. Both were lost to follow-up after the 4th week's visit. Baseline characteristics in both groups were almost matching. Fifty eight out of the total 60 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients in the reference group achieved SVR12 (96.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 88.64\u201399%). Whereas, 59 out of the total 60 (ITT) patients in the test group achieved SVR12 (98.33% (CI: 91.14\u201399.71%). The per-protocol (PP) analysis, excluding patients who dropped-out before collecting their final result, showed that 58/59 (98.31% (CI: 91\u201399.7%)) of patients in the reference group and 59/59 (100% (CI: 93.89\u2013100%) of the test group achieved SVR12. Non-inferiority was declared since the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of SVR12 between groups (P(reference)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0P(test)) did not exceed the specified non-inferiority margin of +\u00a00.1 (10%), both in ITT population (\u2212\u00a01.67%, CI: \u2212\u00a09.8%\u2013+5.9%), and in the PP population (\u2212\u00a01.69%, CI: \u2212\u00a09%\u2013+\u00a04.58%). No fatalities or serious adverse events were reported during the period of the study. Similar rates of non-serious adverse events were reported in both groups with a trend of higher incidence rate in the fixed 12\u00a0weeks group; all were mild in severity.Shortening the duration of therapy based on observed vRVR could provide a prudent basis to avoid unnecessary long treatment courses. This could not only reduce the drug exposure and the risk of adverse drug reactions, but also cut the cost of full treatment course with such expensive medications by one third. This could economize the treatment budget at the individual out-of-pocket level as well as the public health services and insurance levels and allow for better utilization of public health resources.",

However, the genetic effects of SMAD4 in the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) are still largely unknown. Here we identified a functional variant of SMAD4 which might be involved in the pathological progression of TAAD. Five tagging SNPs of SMAD4 were genotyped in 202 TAAD cases and 400 controls using MALDI-TOF. rs12455792 CT or TT variant genotypes was associated with an significantly elevated TAAD risk (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.58, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20132.30) under a dominant genetic model. It was located in the 5\u2019UTR and predicted to influence transcription activity and RNA folding of SMAD4. In luciferase reporter assay, rs12455792 T allele markedly decreased luciferase activities. Accordingly, SMAD4 expression in tissues was lower in patients with CT or TT genotypes, compared with CC. Movat's pentachrome showed that rs12455792 T allele enhanced SMCs loss and fibers accumulation. With angiotensin II induction, rate of Apoptotic SMCs was significantly higher while SMAD4 silenced. Moreover, rs12455792 T allele also increased Versican degradation via ADAMTS-4. In conclusion, this variant might promote SMCs apoptosis and proteoglycans degradation, and further facilitate the progress of TAAD. Our findings identified rs12455792 as a predictor for progression of vascular media pathological changes related thoracic aortic disorders.",

Besides heart failure, angina and myocardial ischemia occurred following administration of CFZ, which is not contraindicated in patients with recent myocardial infarction/unstable angina excluded from the safety trials.To test the effects of CFZ (10\u2212\u00a09 to 10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0mol/L) on vascular tone and reactivity in the isolated rabbit heart and aorta.CFZ administered by bolus injection to the isolated heart increased coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) at all tested concentrations and mildly raised left ventricular pressure and heart rate, only at the highest concentration. Addition of CFZ directly into the organ bath increased the basal tone of isolated aortic strips with contraction plateau reached after 10\u00a0min. This spasmogenic effect doubled following ablation of the endothelium. Pretreatment with CFZ amplified the vasospastic action exerted by KCl, noradrenaline (NA) and angiotensin II (A) on aortic strips, and impaired vasodilation following administration of nitroglycerin (NTG) and nifedipine (NFP) on the contraction plateau induced by KCl, NA and A. Aortic strips pretreated with CFZ exhibited impaired relaxation, as compared to untreated strips, following administration of acetylcholine (Ach), an endothelium-dependent vasodilating agent, on the plateau of NA contraction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).CFZ increased CPP, resting vasoconstricting tone and the spasmogenic effect of different agents. Preincubation with CFZ decreased the anti-spasmogenic activity of NTG and NFP, as well as reduced by over 50% the vasodilating effect of Ach, suggesting that CFZ can impair vasodilation via an endothelium dependent mechanism. Further studies are warranted to establish its clinical safety in patients with known CAD and prior history of coronary spasm.",

However, the molecular relationship between p150Glued and TDP-43 is largely unknown. Here, we report that a reduction in TDP-43 protein levels alleviates the synaptic defects of neurons expressing the Perry mutant p150G50R in Drosophila. Dopaminergic expression of p150G50R, which decreases dopamine release, disrupts motor ability and reduces the lifespan of Drosophila. p150G50R expression also causes aggregation of dense core vesicles (DCVs), which contain monoamines and neuropeptides, and disrupts the axonal flow of DCVs, thus decreasing synaptic strength. The above phenotypes associated with Perry syndrome are improved by the removal of a copy of Drosophila TDP-43 TBPH, thus suggesting that the stagnation of axonal transport by dynactin mutations promotes TDP-43 aggregation and interferes with the dynamics of DCVs and synaptic activities.",

However, few studies have directly compared the brain structures of the two disorders. The aim of this study was to assess the gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness alterations between non-comorbid medication-naive MDD patients and SAD patients.High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired from 37 non-comorbid MDD patients, 24 non-comorbid SAD patients and 41 healthy controls (HCs). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of the GMV (corrected with a false discovery rate of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and vertex-based analysis of cortical thickness (corrected with a clusterwise probability of p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were performed, and group differences were compared by ANOVA followed by post hoc tests.Relative to the HCs, both the MDD patients and SAD patients showed the following results: GMV reductions in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), putamen, and thalamus; cortical thickening in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, left temporal pole, and right superior parietal cortex; and cortical thinning in the left lateral OFC and bilateral rostral middle frontal cortex. In addition, MDD patients specifically showed a greater thickness in the left fusiform gyrus and right lateral occipital cortex and a thinner thickness in the bilateral lingual and left cuneus. SAD patients specifically showed a thinner cortical thickness in the right precentral cortex.Our results indicate that MDD and SAD share common patterns of gray matter abnormalities in the orbitofrontal-striatal-thalamic circuit, salience network and dorsal attention network. These consistent structural differences in the two patient groups may contribute to the broad spectrum of emotional, cognitive and behavioral disturbances observed in MDD patients and SAD patients. In addition, we found disorder-specific involvement of the visual processing regions in MDD and the precentral cortex in SAD. These findings provide new evidence regarding the shared and specific neuropathological mechanisms that underlie MDD and SAD.",

However, the clinical significance of Ep-CAM expression in CRC is not clear. This study evaluated whether Ep-CAM provided valuable insight as a molecular biomarker for CRC diagnosis and prognosis and the potential of Ep-CAM as a novel therapeutic target in CRC.Publications were selected online using electronic databases. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and the combined sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated and summarized.Eleven eligible articles published in English involving 4561 cases were analyzed in this study. Ep-CAM expression was significantly higher in CRC compared with normal controls, and its overexpression was negatively linked to tumor differentiation, tumor stage, vascular invasion, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and tumor budding in CRC patients.

Multivariate analysis of loss of Ep-CAM expression correlated with a poor prognosis in disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC values of Ep-CAM expression in patients with CRC vs. normal controls were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.94, respectively.The present findings suggest that Ep-CAM expression may be associated with CRC carcinogenesis, while the loss of Ep-CAM expression is correlated with the progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis of CRC.

Cereblon is probably targeted by both lenalidomide and dexamethasone, which leads to synergistic cytotoxicity in MCL by inhibiting the interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/STAT3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and AKT2/Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3A)/BCL2-like 11 (BIM) pathways. The two drugs synergistically inhibit the same pathways, but through different sites. Cereblon was found expressed in most of the MCL tissues (91.3% positivity). Moreover, cereblon expression is positively correlated with LD regimen sensitivity: long-term lenalidomide exposure downregulates cereblon and induces multi-drug resistance against lenalidomide, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin, and methotrexate in vitro. Removal of lenalidomide resensitizes lenalidomide-resistant MCL cells to lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Our work suggests that rotating the LD regimen with other regimens would improve MCL maintenance therapy.",

We investigated the role of these atypical kinases in different cancer cells. Using isogenic colon-, breast- and lung cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that knockdown of RIOK1, but not of RIOK2 or RIOK3, strongly impairs proliferation and invasiveness in conventional and 3D culture systems. Interestingly, these effects were mainly observed in RAS mutant cancer cells. In contrast, growth of RAS wildtype Caco-2 and Bcr-Abl-driven K562 cells is not affected by RIOK1 knockdown, suggesting a specific requirement for RIOK1 in the context of oncogenic RAS signaling. Furthermore, we show that RIOK1 activates NF-\u03baB signaling and promotes cell cycle progression. Using proteomics, we identified the pro-invasive proteins Metadherin and Stathmin1 to be regulated by RIOK1. Additionally, we demonstrate that RIOK1 promotes lung colonization in vivo and that RIOK1 is overexpressed in different subtypes of human lung- and breast cancer. Altogether, our data suggest RIOK1 as a potential therapeutic target, especially in RAS-driven cancers.",

Using T cell-specific deletion, we showed here that in thymus CD147 is indispensable for the stable \u03b1\u03b2 T cell lineage commitment: loss of CD147 biases both multipotent DN (double negative) and fully committed DP (double positive) cells into innate NK-like lineages. Mechanistically, CD147 deficiency results in impaired Wnt signaling and expression of BCL11b, a master transcription factor in determining T cell identity. In addition, functional blocking of CD147 by antibody phenocopies genetic deletion to enrich NK-like cells in the periphery. Furthermore, using a melanoma model and orthotopic liver cancer transplants, we showed that the augmentation of NK-like cells strongly associates with resistance against tumor growth upon CD147 suppression. Therefore, besides its original function in tumorigenesis, CD147 is also an effective surface target for immune modulation in tumor therapy.",

Although generally considered an axonal protein, Tau is found in the somato-dendritic compartment of degenerating neurons and this redistribution is thought to be a trigger of neurodegeneration in AD. Here, we show the presence of tau mRNA in a dendritic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that includes Ca2+-calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CaMK)II\u03b1 mRNA and that is translated locally in response to glutamate stimulation. Further, we show that Tau mRNA is a component of mRNP granules that contain RNA-binding proteins, and that it interacts with Myosin Va, a postsynaptic motor protein; these findings suggest that tau mRNA is transported into dendritic spines. We also report that tau mRNA localized in the somato-dendritic component of primary hippocampal cells and that a sub-toxic concentration of glutamate enhances local translation and hyperphosphorylation of tau, effects that are blocked by the gluatamatergic antagonists MK801 and NBQX. These data thus demonstrate that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) stimulation redistributes tau to the somato-dendritic region of neurons where it may trigger neurodegeneration.",

Even when the circadian rhythms were entrained by light and dark cycles, these mice showed a significant attenuation of behavioral onset intensity at the start of the dark period. Further, we hypothesized that the combination of hypercholesterolemia and circadian abnormalities may affect cardiovascular disease progression. To examine this possibility, we generated LDLR-deficient mice with impaired circadian rhythms by simultaneously introducing a mutation into Period2, a core clock gene, and found that these mice showed a significant enlargement of artery plaque area with an increase in inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels.

C57BL/6J mice were pair-fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a HFD with empagliflozin for 16\u00a0weeks. Empagliflozin administration increased UGE in the DIO mice, whereas it suppressed HFD-induced weight gain, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, empagliflozin shifted energy metabolism towards fat utilization, elevated AMP-activated protein kinase and acetyl-CoA carbolxylase phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, and increased hepatic and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 levels. Importantly, empagliflozin increased energy expenditure, heat production, and the expression of uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat and in inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, empagliflozin reduced M1-polarized macrophage accumulation while inducing the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype of macrophages within WAT and liver, lowering plasma TNF\u03b1 levels and attenuating obesity-related chronic inflammation. Thus, empagliflozin suppressed weight gain by enhancing fat utilization and browning and attenuated obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by polarizing M2 macrophages in WAT and liver.",

Here, we report that planarians display a form of instructed immunity to primo-infection by Staphylococcus aureus that consists of a transient state of heightened resistance to re-infection that persists for approximately 30\u00a0days after primo-infection. We established the involvement of stem cell-like neoblasts in this instructed immunity using the complementary approaches of RNA-interference-mediated cell depletion and tissue grafting-mediated gain of function. Mechanistically, primo-infection leads to expression of the peptidoglycan receptor Smed-PGRP-2, which in turn promotes Smed-setd8-1 histone methyltransferase expression and increases levels of lysine methylation in neoblasts. Depletion of neoblasts did not affect S. aureus clearance in primo-infection but, in re-infection, abrogated the heightened elimination of bacteria and reduced Smed-PGRP-2 and Smed-setd8-1 expression. Smed-PGRP-2 and Smed-setd8-1 sensitize animals to heightened expression of Smed-p38 MAPK and Smed-morn2, which are downstream components of anti-bacterial responses. Our study reveals a central role of neoblasts in innate immunity against S. aureus to establish a resistance state facilitating Smed-sted8-1-dependent expression of anti-bacterial genes during re-infection.",

Short hairpin RNA-based knockdown of ATF4 in p32 deficient MEFs markedly inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production.

Notably, AST performed in media mimicking host environments succeeded in identifying specific antibiotics that were effective in bacterial clearance and host survival, even though these same antibiotics failed in results using standard test media. Similarly, our revised media further identified antibiotics that were ineffective in vivo despite passing the AST standard for clinical use. Supplementation of AST medium with sodium bicarbonate, an abundant in vivo molecule that stimulates global changes in bacterial structure and gene expression, was found to be an important factor improving the predictive value of AST in the assignment of appropriate therapy.

Based on these findings, we hypothesized that Tnmd might be an important factor in the functional performance of tendons. Firstly, we revealed that Tnmd is a mechanosensitive gene and that the C-terminus of the protein co-localize with collagen I-type fibers in the extracellular matrix. Secondly, using an endurance training protocol, we compared Tnmd knockout mice with wild types and showed that Tnmd deficiency leads to significantly inferior running performance that further worsens with training. In these mice, endurance running was hindered due to abnormal response of collagen I cross-linking and proteoglycan genes leading to an inadequate collagen I fiber thickness and elasticity. In sum, our study demonstrates that Tnmd is required for proper tendon tissue adaptation to endurance running and aids in better understanding of the structural-functional relationships of tendon tissues.",

Conversely, early antimicrobial exposure was associated with different patterns of colonisation, specifically a relative abundance of Proteobacteria.These findings highlight that the potential influence of probiotics on the microbiome of preterm infants remains unclear whereas the modulatory effect of antibiotic exposure on microbial colonisation requires further research.",

Herein, we systematically assessed the prognostic effects of these gene signatures and identified valuable prognostic biomarkers by integrating these gene signatures. With two independent HCC datasets (GSE14520, N\u00a0=\u00a0242 and GSE54236, N\u00a0=\u00a078), 30 published gene signatures were evaluated, and 11 were significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of postoperative HCC patients in both datasets. The random survival forest models suggested that the gene signatures were superior to clinical characteristics for predicting the prognosis of the patients. Based on the 11 gene signatures, a functional protein-protein interaction (PPI) network with 1406 nodes and 10,135 edges was established. With tissue microarrays of HCC patients (N\u00a0=\u00a060), we determined the prognostic values of the core genes in the network and found that RAD21, CDK1, and HDAC2 expression levels were negatively associated with OS for HCC patients. The multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that CDK1 was an independent prognostic factor, which was validated in an independent case cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a078). In cellular models, inhibition of CDK1 by siRNA or a specific inhibitor, RO-3306, reduced cellular proliferation and viability for HCC cells. These results suggest that the prognostic predictive capacities of these gene signatures are reproducible and that CDK1 is a potential prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.",

Pyruvate levels were elevated and pyruvate metabolism was altered in some tumor sections. These observations indicated that pyruvate metabolism may constitute a possible vulnerability of kidney cancer; indeed, pyruvate stimulated the growth of primary kidney cancer cells and pharmacological inhibition of pyruvate transporters slowed the growth of patient-derived kidney tumors in mice.

This property is clinically relevant for the improvement of T cell-based antitumor therapies. Diacylglycerol kinase \u03b1 and \u03b6 (DGK\u03b1/\u03b6) metabolize the diacylglycerol generated following antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Enhanced expression of these two lipid kinases in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells promotes a hyporesponsive state that contributes to tumor immune escape. Inhibition of these two enzymes might thus be of interest for potentiating conventional antigen-directed tumor elimination. In this study, we sought to characterize the contribution of DGK\u03b1 and \u03b6 to antigen-independent cytotoxic functions of CD8+ T cells. Analysis of DGK\u03b6-deficient mice showed an increase in bystander memory-like CD8+ T cell populations not observed in DGK\u03b1-deficient mice. We demonstrate that DGK\u03b6 limits cytokine responses in an antigen-independent manner. Cytokine-specific expansion of DGK\u03b6-deficient CD8+ T cells promoted enhanced differentiation of innate-like cytotoxic cells in vitro, and correlated with the more potent in vivo anti-tumor responses of DGK\u03b6-deficient mice engrafted with the murine A20 lymphoma. Our studies reveal a isoform-specific function for DGK\u03b6 downstream of IL-2/IL-15-mediated expansion of innate-like cytotoxic T cells, Pharmacological manipulation of DGK\u03b6 activity is of therapeutic interest for cytokine-directed anti-tumor treatments.",

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and the most frequently prescribed cholesterol-lowering agents, have been reported to inhibit tumor progression and induce autophagy in cancer cells. However, the effects of statin and role of autophagy by statin on bone metastasis are unknown. In this study, we report that fluvastatin effectively prevented lung adenocarcinoma bone metastasis in a nude mouse model. We further reveal that fluvastatin-induced anti-bone metastatic property was largely dependent on its ability to induce autophagy in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Atg5 or Atg7 deletion, or 3-methyadenine (3-MA) or Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) treatment prevented the fluvastatin-induced suppression of bone metastasis.

An association between ANRIL methylation and adiposity was also observed in three additional populations; in birth tissues from ethnically diverse neonates, in peripheral blood from adolescents, and in adipose tissue from adults. Additionally, CpG methylation was associated with ANRIL expression in vivo, and CpG mutagenesis in vitro inhibited ANRIL promoter activity. Furthermore, CpG methylation enhanced binding to an Estrogen Response Element within the ANRIL promoter.

     "abstract": "Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease. Glomerular mesangial expansion and fibrosis are hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy and this is thought to be promoted by infiltration of circulating macrophages. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been shown to attract macrophages in kidney diseases. P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) are highly expressed on macrophages and are essential components of pro-inflammatory signaling in multiple tissues. Here we show that in diabetic patients, renal P2X7R expression is associated with severe mesangial expansion, impaired glomerular filtration (\u2264\u00a040\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0sq.\u00a0m.), and increased interstitial fibrosis. P2X7R activation enhanced the release of MCP-1 in human mesangial cells cultured under high glucose conditions. In mice, P2X7R-deficiency prevented glomerular macrophage attraction and collagen IV deposition; however, the more severe interstitial inflammation and fibrosis often seen in human diabetic kidney diseases was not modelled. Finally, we demonstrate that a P2X7R inhibitor (AZ11657312) can reduce renal macrophage accrual following the establishment of hyperglycemia in a model of diabetic nephropathy. Collectively these data suggest that P2X7R activation may contribute to the high prevalence of kidney disease found in diabetics.",

In two instances, paired single lung transplant recipients manifested infection, and in one of these pairs, isolates were indistinguishable by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).

Review of the literature revealed an additional 15 cases of M. hominis in lung transplant recipients, most with similar clinical presentations to our cases. We recommend that M. hominis should be considered in post-cardiothoracic transplant infections presenting with pleuritis, surgical site infection, or mediastinitis.

The production of intrathecal IgA has been noted in patients with the late Lyme disease manifestation, neuroborreliosis, but production of antigen-specific IgA during early disease has not been evaluated. In the current study, we assessed serum IgA binding to the B. burgdorferi peptide antigens, C6, the target of the FDA-cleared C6 EIA, and FlaB(211-223)-modVlsE(275-291), a peptide containing a Borrelia flagellin epitope linked to a modified VlsE sequence, in patients with early and late Lyme disease. Specific IgA was detected in 59 of 152 serum samples (38.8%) from early Lyme disease patients. Approximately 50% of early Lyme disease patients who were seropositive for peptide-specific IgM and/or IgG were also seropositive for peptide-specific IgA. In a subpopulation of patients, high peptide-specific IgA could be correlated with disseminated disease, defined as multiple erythema migrans lesions, and neurological disease complications. These results suggest that there may be an association between elevated levels of antigen-specific IgA and particular disease manifestations in some patients with early Lyme disease.",

A nationwide survey was conducted in China covering a total of 1105 CRE strains collected from 25 geographical locales with results showing that acquisition of two carbapenemase genes, blaKPC-2 and blaNDM, was responsible for phenotypic resistance in 90% of the CRE strains tested (58% and 32% respectively), among which several major strain types, such as ST11 of K. pneumoniae and ST131/ST167 of E. coli, were identified, suggesting that dissemination of specific resistant clones is mainly responsible for emergence of new CRE strains. Prevalence of the fosA3 gene which mediates fosfomycin resistance, was high, while the colistin resistance determinant mcr-1 was rarely present in these isolates. Consistently, the majority of the blaNDM-bearing plasmids recoverable from the test strains belonged to IncX3, which contained a common core structure, blaNDM-blaMBL-trpF. Likewise, the core structure of ISKpn27-blaKPC-2-ISKpn2 was observed among plasmids harboring the blaKPC-2 gene, although they were genetically more divergent. In conclusion, the increasing prevalence of CRE strains in China is attributed to dissemination of conservative mobile elements carrying blaNDM or blaKPC-2 on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids.",

So far, correlates of immune protection are incompletely understood and the role of cell-mediated immune responses has not been comprehensively investigated to date.Methods: We recruited 30 healthy subjects aged 18\u201355 into an open-label, dose-escalation phase I trial testing three doses of rVSV-ZEBOV (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 plaque-forming units (PFU), 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 PFU, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 PFU) (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02283099). Main study objectives were safety and immunogenicity, while exploratory objectives included lymphocyte dynamics, cell-mediated immunity and cytokine networks, which were assessed using flow cytometry, ELISpot and LUMINEX assay.Findings: Immunization with rVSV-ZEBOV was well tolerated without serious vaccine-related adverse events. Ebola virus-specific neutralizing antibodies were induced in nearly all individuals. Additionally, vaccinees, particularly within the highest dose cohort, generated Ebola glycoprotein (GP)-specific T cells and initiated a cascade of signaling molecules following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ebola GP peptides.Interpretation: In addition to a benign safety and robust humoral immunogenicity profile, subjects immunized with 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 PFU elicited higher cellular immune responses and stronger interlocked cytokine networks compared to lower dose groups. To our knowledge these data represent the first detailed cell-mediated immuneprofile of a clinical trial testing rVSV-ZEBOV, which is of particular interest in light of its potential upcoming licensure as the first Ebola vaccine.VEBCON trial Hamburg, Germany (NCT02283099).",

This study investigated the correlation of RASSF1A promoter methylation with clinicopathological features and its utility as a diagnostic biomarker in NPC. A total of 926 patients with NPC and 495 non-tumor controls were analyzed in this study. RASSF1A promoter methylation was notably higher in NPC compared with non-tumor tissue, brushing and blood samples. RASSF1A promoter methylation was associated with clinical stage, lymph node status, distant metastasis, and T classification of patients with NPC, although it was not linked to age and sex. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (area under the curve) of RASSF1A promoter methylation were determined in NPC samples vs. non-tumor samples (tissue: sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.72, specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.99, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.98; brushing: sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.56, specificity\u00a0=\u00a01.00, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.94; blood: sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.11, specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.98, AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.97). Our findings show that RASSF1A promoter methylation may be correlated with the development, progression and metastasis of NPC. RASSF1A promoter methylation is a promising noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis of NPC from tissue and brushing samples.",

No significant difference in cytoplasmic PD-L1 expression was observed between NIFTP and benign nodules.PD-L1 expression may serve as a useful biomarker in predicting invasiveness of EFVPTC and distinguishing NIFTP from invasive EFVPTC.

Pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been associated with outcome in IPI-treated patients, but has not been studied during treatment or in BRAFi-treated patients.Using a prospectively maintained database, patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma treated with IPI or a BRAFi (vemurafenib or dabrafenib as monotherapy) from 2006 to 2011 were identified. NLR was calculated before treatment and at 3-week intervals after treatment initiation until 9\u00a0weeks. Baseline NLR was tested for association with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and clinical response to treatment. On-treatment NLRs were tested for association with the same outcomes using landmark survival analyses and time-dependent Cox regression models. The association of relative change of NLR from baseline with outcomes was also examined. A multivariate model tested the association of NLR and OS/PFS with additional clinical factors.There were 197 IPI patients and 65 BRAFi patients. In multivariable analysis adjusting for M stage, and disease type (in OS)/gender (in PFS), an NLR value of 5 or above at every timepoint was associated with worse OS (HR 2.03\u20133.37, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), PFS (HR 1.81\u20132.51, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and response to therapy (OR 3.92\u20139.18, p\u00a0<\u00a00.007), in the IPI cohort. In addition, a >\u00a030% increase in NLR above baseline at any timepoint was associated with a worse OS and PFS (HR 1.81 and 1.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.004). In BRAFi patients, NLR was not consistently associated with outcomes.A high NLR, whether measured prior to or during treatment with IPI, is associated with worse OS, PFS, and clinical response in patients with advanced melanoma. An increasing NLR from baseline during treatment was correlated with worse OS and PFS in IPI-treated patients. In comparison, as NLR was not associated with outcomes in BRAFi patients, NLR may have a uniquely predictive value in patients treated with immunotherapy.",

     "abstract": "We previously reported that overexpression of DHX32 contributes to the growth and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanism is not largely characterized. Herein, we reported that DHX32 in CRC cells upregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) at the transcription level through interacting with and stabilizing \u03b2-catenin. This promoted the recruitment of host endothelial cells to the tumor, and therefore, formation of microvessel in the tumor. Xenograft model revealed that depletion of DHX32 in CRC cells significantly reduced the microvessel density in the grafts and suppressed the growth of grafts. Furthermore, the expression level of DHX32 was positively associated with microvessel density in human CRC and poor outcome of CRC patients. Therefore, the report demonstrates that DHX32 is a pro-angiogenic factor, that inhibition of DHX32-\u03b2-catenin pathway can provide a strategy for CRC treatment, and that the expression level of DHX32 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for CRC diagnosis and prognosis.",

New data regarding the molecules contributing to the metastatic phenotype, the pathways they control and the genes they regulate are very important for understanding the processes of metastasis prognosis and prevention in the clinic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) in the promotion of colorectal cancer metastasis. TOPK is highly expressed in human metastatic colorectal cancer tissue compared with malignant adenocarcinoma. We identified p53-related protein kinase (PRPK) as a new substrate of TOPK. TOPK binds with and phosphorylates PRPK at Ser250 in vitro and ex vivo. This site plays a critical role in the function of PRPK. Cell lines stably expressing mutant PRPK (S250A), knockdown TOPK, knockdown PRPK or knockdown of both TOPK and PRPK significantly inhibited liver metastasis of human HCT116 colon cancer cells in a xenograft mouse model. Therefore, we conclude that TOPK directly promotes metastasis of colorectal cancer by modulating PRPK. Thus, these findings may assist in the prediction of prognosis or development of new therapeutic strategies against colon cancer.",

The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, constitutes the main drug target for advanced cases of the disease. However, a variety of other transcription factors and signaling networks have been shown to be altered in patients and to influence AR activity. Amongst these, the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc has been studied extensively in multiple malignancies and elevated protein levels of c-Myc are commonly observed in PCa. Its impact on AR activity, however, remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the impact of c-Myc overexpression on AR activity and transcriptional output in a PCa cell line model and validated the antagonistic effect of c-MYC on AR-targets in patient samples. We found that c-Myc overexpression partially reprogrammed AR chromatin occupancy and was associated with altered histone marks distribution, most notably H3K4me1 and H3K27me3. We found c-Myc and the AR co-occupy a substantial number of binding sites and these exhibited enhancer-like characteristics. Interestingly, c-Myc overexpression antagonised clinically relevant AR target genes. Therefore, as an example, we validated the antagonistic relationship between c-Myc and two AR target genes, KLK3 (alias PSA, prostate specific antigen), and Glycine N-Methyltransferase (GNMT), in patient samples. Our findings provide unbiased evidence that MYC overexpression deregulates the AR transcriptional program, which is thought to be a driving force in PCa.",

However, the results of reported studies are controversial. To ascertain whether polymorphisms in XRCC genes are associated with the risk of urological neoplasms, we conducted present updated meta-analysis and systematic review. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the association. Finally, 54 publications comprising 129 case-control studies for twelve polymorphisms in five XRCC genes were enrolled. We identified that XRCC1-rs25489 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of urological neoplasms in heterozygote and dominant models. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis by cancer type, we found that XRCC1-rs25489 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (BC) in heterozygote model. Although overall analyses suggested a null result for XRCC1-rs25487 polymorphism, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, an increased risk of urological neoplasms for Asians in allelic and homozygote models was identified. While for other polymorphisms in XRCC genes, no significant association was uncovered. To sum up, our results indicated that XRCC1-rs25489 polymorphism is a risk factor for urological neoplasms, particularly for BC. Further studies with large sample size are needed to validate these findings.",

A theory-driven systems model to critically evaluate pathways through which enteropathogens, gut permeability, and intestinal and systemic inflammation affect child growth was conducted within the framework of the Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development (MAL-ED) birth cohort study that included children from eight countries.Non-diarrheal stool samples (N\u00a0=\u00a022,846) from 1253 children from multiple sites were evaluated for a panel of 40 enteropathogens and fecal concentrations of myeloperoxidase, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and neopterin. Among these same children, urinary lactulose:mannitol (L:M) (N\u00a0=\u00a06363) and plasma alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) (N\u00a0=\u00a02797) were also measured. The temporal sampling design was used to create a directed acyclic graph of proposed mechanistic pathways between enteropathogen detection in non-diarrheal stools, biomarkers of intestinal permeability and inflammation, systemic inflammation and change in length- and weight- for age in children 0\u20132\u00a0years of age.Children in these populations had frequent enteric infections and high levels of both intestinal and systemic inflammation. Higher burdens of enteropathogens, especially those categorized as being enteroinvasive or causing mucosal disruption, were associated with elevated biomarker concentrations of gut and systemic inflammation and, via these associations, indirectly associated with both reduced linear and ponderal growth. Evidence for the association with reduced linear growth was stronger for systemic inflammation than for gut inflammation; the opposite was true of reduced ponderal growth. Although Giardia was associated with reduced growth, the association was not mediated by any of the biomarkers evaluated.The large quantity of empirical evidence contributing to this analysis supports the conceptual model of EE. The effects of EE on growth faltering in young children were small, but multiple mechanistic pathways underlying the attribution of growth failure to asymptomatic enteric infections had statistical support in the analysis. The strongest evidence for EE was the association between enteropathogens and linear growth mediated through systemic inflammation.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

In mouse primary preadipocytes and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, WNK4 was markedly induced in the early phase of adipocyte differentiation. WNK4 expression preceded the expression of key transcriptional factors PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. WNK4-siRNA-transfected 3T3-L1 cells and human mesenchymal stem cells showed reduced expression of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 and lipid accumulation. WNK4 protein affected the DNA-binding ability of C/EBP\u03b2 and thereby reduced PPAR\u03b3 expression.

Moreover, it is believed that the metabolic effects of SRT1720 occur independently of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an important metabolic regulator that increases mitochondrial function. Here, we show that SRT1720 activates AMPK in a Sirt1-independent manner and SRT1720 activates AMPK by inhibiting a cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE) in a competitive manner. Inhibiting the cAMP effector protein Epac prevents SRT1720 from activating AMPK or Sirt1 in myotubes. Moreover, SRT1720 does not increase mitochondrial function or improve glucose tolerance in AMPK\u03b12 knockout mice. Interestingly, weight loss induced by SRT1720 is not sufficient to improve glucose tolerance.

Control HLCs exhibited robust cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and formed nascent HDL particles. ABCA1-deficient HLCs failed to mediate lipid efflux or nascent HDL formation, but had elevated triglyceride (TG) secretion. Global transcriptome analysis revealed significantly increased ANGPTL3 expression in ABCA1-deficient HLCs. Angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3) was enriched in plasma of TD relative to control subjects.

Similar alterations were observed with chemically-induced ER stress. Transgenic mice expressing E4BP4 under the control of the mouse insulin I gene promoter (MIP), in which E4BP4 in \u03b2-cells is expected to compete with DBP for D-box, displayed remarkable glucose intolerance with severely impaired insulin secretion. Basal ATP/ADP ratios in MIP-E4BP4 islets were elevated without the circadian oscillations observed in wild-type islets. Neither elevation of the ATP/ADP ratio nor an intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ response was observed after glucose stimulation. RNA expressions of genes involved in insulin secretion gradually increase in wild-type islets early in the feeding period. In MIP-E4BP4 islets, however, these increases were not observed. Thus, molecular clock output DBP transcriptional activity, susceptible to ER stress, plays pivotal roles in \u03b2-cell priming for insulin release by regulating \u03b2-cell metabolism and gene expressions.

In addition to reducing androgen levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and correcting the reproductive cycle, metformin treatment induced morphological changes in the PCOS-like uterus. At the molecular and cellular levels, metformin normalized the androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional program and restored epithelial\u2013stromal interactions. In contrast to glucose transport, uterine inflammatory gene expression was suppressed through the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013NF\u03baB network, but without affecting apoptosis. These effects appeared to be independent of AMPK subunit and autophagy-related protein regulation. We found that when metformin treatment partially restored implantation, several implantation-related genes were normalized in the PCOS-like rat uterus. These results improve our understanding of how metformin rescues the disruption of the implantation process due to the uterine defects that result from hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance.

     "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and AMP\u00adactivated protein kinase \u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1) play critical roles in the process of cardiac hypertrophy. Previous studies have demonstrated that piperine activates AMPK\u03b1 and reduces the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). However, the effect of piperine on cardiac hypertrophy remains completely unknown. Here, we show that piperine-treated mice had similar hypertrophic responses as mice treated with vehicle but exhibited significantly attenuated cardiac fibrosis after pressure overload or isoprenaline (ISO) injection. Piperine inhibited the transformation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts induced by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) or angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro. This anti-fibrotic effect was independent of the AMPK\u03b1 and MAPK pathway. Piperine blocked activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and, downstream, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). The overexpression of constitutively active AKT or the knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 completely abolished the piperine-mediated protection of cardiac fibroblasts. The cardioprotective effects of piperine were blocked in mice with constitutively active AKT. Pretreatment with GW9662, a specific inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), reversed the effect elicited by piperine in vitro. In conclusion, piperine attenuated cardiac fibrosis via the activation of PPAR-\u03b3 and the resultant inhibition of AKT/GSK3\u03b2.",

We immunized rhesus macaques intramuscularly and rectally using a heterologous adenovirus vectored SIV vaccine regimen encoding normally weakly immunogenic tat, vif, rev and vpr antigens fused to the MHC class II associated invariant chain. Immunizations induced broad T cell responses in all vaccinees. Following up to 10 repeated low-dose intrarectal challenges, vaccinees suppressed early viral replication (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and prevented the peak viremia in 5/6 animals. Despite consistently undetectable viremia in 2 out of 6 vaccinees, all animals showed evidence of infection induced immune responses indicating that infection had taken place. Vaccinees, with and without detectable viremia better preserved their rectal CD4\u00a0+ T cell population and had reduced immune hyperactivation as measured by na\u00efve T cell depletion, Ki-67 and PD-1 expression on T cells. These results indicate that vaccination towards SIV accessory antigens vaccine can provide a level of acute control of SIV replication with a suggestion of beneficial immunological consequences in infected animals of unknown long-term significance.In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that a vaccine encoding subdominant antigens not normally associated with virus control can exert a significant impact on acute peak viremia.",

     "abstract": "HIV-1 superinfection, in which an infected individual acquires a second HIV-1 infection from a different partner, is one of the only settings in which HIV acquisition occurs in the context of a pre-existing immune response to natural HIV infection. There is evidence that initial infection provides some protection from superinfection, particularly after 6\u00a0months of initial infection, when development of broad immunity occurs. Comparison of the immune response of superinfected individuals at the time of superinfection acquisition to that of individuals who remain singly infected despite continued exposure can shed light on immune correlates of HIV acquisition to inform prophylactic vaccine design. We evaluated a panel of humoral immune responses in the largest published group of superinfected individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a021), compared to a set of 3:1 matched singly infected controls from the same cohort. The immune functions studied included plasma neutralization, plasma and cervical antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and plasma IgG and IgA binding to a panel of 18 envelope antigens, including correlates of HIV acquisition in the RV144 vaccine trial, IgG binding to V1V2 and IgA binding to gp140. Association between each immune function and HIV superinfection was evaluated using conditional logistic regression. No significant associations were detected between any of the immune functions and superinfection acquisition. This study constitutes the most comprehensive and detailed characterization of multiple immune correlates of superinfection to date. The results suggest that immune responses not commonly measured in current HIV studies may be important in protection from HIV infection, and these or a more robust humoral response than that seen in naturally infected women may be needed for a protective vaccine.",

We found that serotype 4 and serotype 6A strains deficient in SpGlpO have significantly reduced capacity to colonize the nasopharynx of mice, and were significantly defective in adherence to human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro. We also demonstrate that intranasal immunization with recombinant SpGlpO significantly protects mice against subsequent nasal colonization by wild type serotype 4 and serotype 6A strains. Furthermore, we show that SpGlpO binds strongly to lacto/neolacto/ganglio host glycan structures containing the GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b2 disaccharide, suggesting that SpGlpO enhances colonization of the nasopharynx through its binding to host glycoconjugates.

We validated the anti-NFAT5 activity of 198 primary hit compounds using an NFAT5-dependent reporter assay and identified the novel NFAT5 suppressor KRN2, 13-(2-fluoro)-benzylberberine, and its derivative KRN5. KRN2 inhibited NFAT5 upregulation in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and repressed the formation of NF-\u03baB p65-DNA complexes in the NFAT5 promoter region. Interestingly, KRN2 selectively suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including Nos2 and Il6, without hampering high-salt-induced NFAT5 and its target gene expressions. Moreover, KRN2 and KRN5, the latter of which exhibits high oral bioavailability and metabolic stability, ameliorated experimentally induced arthritis in mice without serious adverse effects, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Particularly, orally administered KRN5 was stronger in suppressing arthritis than methotrexate, a commonly used anti-rheumatic drug, displaying better potency and safety than its original compound, berberine.

     "abstract": "Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in infants may present as one of two distinct syndromic forms: non-edematous (marasmus), with severe wasting and no nutritional edema; or edematous (kwashiorkor) with moderately severe wasting. These differences may be related to developmental changes prior to the exposure to SAM and phenotypic changes appear to persist into adulthood with differences between the two groups. We examined whether the different response to SAM and subsequent trajectories may be explained by developmentally-induced epigenetic differences.We extracted genomic DNA from muscle biopsies obtained from adult survivors of kwashiorkor (n\u00a0=\u00a021) or marasmus (n\u00a0=\u00a023) and compared epigenetic profiles (CpG methylation) between the two groups using the Infinium\u00ae 450\u00a0K BeadChip array.We found significant differences in methylation of CpG sites from 63 genes in skeletal muscle DNA. Gene ontology studies showed significant differential methylation of genes in immune, body composition, metabolic, musculoskeletal growth, neuronal function and cardiovascular pathways, pathways compatible with the differences in the pathophysiology of adult survivors of SAM.These findings suggest persistent developmental influences on adult physiology in survivors of SAM. Since children who develop marasmus have lower birth weights and after rehabilitation have different intermediary metabolism, these studies provide further support for persistent developmentally-induced phenomena mediated by epigenetic processes affecting both the infant response to acute malnutrition and later life consequences.Supported by a Grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Global Health OPP1066846), Grand Challenge \u201cDiscover New Ways to Achieve Healthy Growth.\u201dPrevious research has shown that infants who develop either kwashiorkor or marasmus in response to SAM differ in birth weight and subsequently have different metabolic patterns in both infancy and adulthood.This study demonstrates epigenetic differences in the skeletal muscle of adult survivors of marasmus versus kwashiorkor and these differences are in genes that may underlie the longer-term consequences.These data are compatible with the different clinical responses to SAM arising from developmentally-induced epigenetic changes laid down largely before birth and provide evidence for the predictive adaptive response model operating in human development.",

A twin approach can be valuable, because it allows for the investigation of specific illness markers in individuals with a shared genetic background.We linked nationwide registers to identify a cohort of twin pairs born in Denmark from 1951 to 2000 (N\u00a0=\u00a031,524 pairs), where one or both twins had a diagnosis in the schizophrenia spectrum. We defined two groups consisting of; N\u00a0=\u00a0788 twin pairs (affected with schizophrenia spectrum) and a subsample of N\u00a0=\u00a0448 (affected with schizophrenia). Survival analysis was applied to investigate the effect of age at illness onset.We found that early age at illness onset compared to later onset in the first diagnosed twin can be considered a major risk factor for developing schizophrenia in the second twin. Additionally, we found that the stronger genetic component in MZ twins compared to DZ twins is manifested in the proximity of assigned diagnosis within pairs.Early onset schizophrenia could be linked to a more severe genetic predisposition, indicating that age might be perceived as a clinical marker for genetic vulnerability for the illness.",

There is prospective evidence for an association between HSD11\u03b22 methylation and hypertension, and functional evidence of an association between NR3C1 methylation and both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer. Strong associations have been reported between FKBP5 and NR3C1 methylation and PTSD, and biologically-plausible associations have been reported between FKBP5 methylation and Alzheimer's Disease. Mixed associations between NR3C1 methylation and mental health outcomes have been reported according to different social and environmental exposures, and according to varying gene regions investigated.

A consistent evidence base from the observational literature confirms that the quality of individuals' diets is related to their risk for common mental disorders, such as depression. This is the case across countries and age groups. Moreover, new intervention studies implementing dietary changes suggest promise for the prevention and treatment of depression. Concurrently, data point to the utility of selected nutraceuticals as adjunctive treatments for mental disorders and as monotherapies for conditions such as ADHD. Finally, new studies focused on understanding the biological pathways that mediate the observed relationships between diet, nutrition and mental health are pointing to the immune system, oxidative biology, brain plasticity and the microbiome-gut-brain axis as key targets for nutritional interventions. On the other hand, the field is currently limited by a lack of data and methodological issues such as heterogeneity, residual confounding, measurement error, and challenges in measuring and ensuring dietary adherence in intervention studies. Key challenges for the field are to now: replicate, refine and scale up promising clinical and population level dietary strategies; identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the identified associations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and \u2018psychobiotic\u2019 interventions that also examine predictors of treatment response; conduct observational and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and related risk factors and treatments; and continue to advocate for policy change to improve the food environment at the population level.",

We report the crystal structure of the human PD-1 ectodomain and the mapping of the PD-1 binding interface. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the crystallographic interface, and resulted in mutant PD-1 receptors with altered affinity and ligand-specificity. In particular, a high-affinity mutant PD-1 (HA PD-1) exhibited 45 and 30-fold increase in binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively, due to slower dissociation rates. This mutant (A132L) was used to engineer a soluble chimeric Ig fusion protein for cell-based and in vivo studies. HA PD-1 Ig showed enhanced binding to human dendritic cells, and increased T cell proliferation and cytokine production in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay. Moreover, in an experimental model of murine Lewis lung carcinoma, HA PD-1 Ig treatment synergized with radiation therapy to decrease local and metastatic tumor burden, as well as in the establishment of immunological memory responses. Our studies highlight the value of structural considerations in guiding the design of a high-affinity chimeric PD-1 Ig fusion protein with robust immune modulatory properties, and underscore the power of combination therapies to selectively manipulate the PD-1 pathway for tumor immunotherapy.",

These CAF-derived molecules increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) post-radiation, which enhanced PP2A activity, repressing mTOR activation and increasing autophagy in cancer cells. Consistently, the IGF2 neutralizing antibody and the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA reduce the CAF-promoted tumor relapse in mice after radiotherapy. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that CAFs promoted irradiated cancer cell recovery and tumor regrowth post-radiation, suggesting that targeting the autophagy pathway in tumor cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy for radiotherapy sensitization.",

Genetic variability in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes may contribute to the high numbers of adverse drug reactions reported in Africa. We reviewed publications (1995\u2013April 2016) reporting frequencies of known cytochrome P450 (CYP) variants in African populations. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we identified CYP alleles of potential clinical relevance with a marked difference in distribution in Africa, compared with Asian and Caucasian populations. These were CYP2B6*6, CYP2C8*2, CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*17, CYP2D6*29, CYP3A5*6, and CYP3A5*7. We show clearly that there is greater diversity in CYP distribution in Africa than in other continental populations and identify a need for optimization of drug therapy and drug development there. Further pharmacogenetic studies are required to confirm the CYP distributions we identified using PCA, to discover uniquely African alleles and to identify populations at a potentially increased risk of drug-induced adverse events or drug inefficacy.",

Here we describe that the antidiabetic drug pioglitazone (PIO) can improve the phenotype of a mouse Harlequin (Hq) subgroup, presumably due to an inhibition of glycolysis that causes an increase in blood glucose levels. This glycolysis-inhibitory PIO effect was observed in cultured astrocytes from Hq mice, as well as in human skin fibroblasts from patients with AIF mutation. Glycolysis inhibition by PIO resulted from direct competitive inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Moreover, GAPDH protein levels were reduced in the cerebellum and in the muscle from Hq mice that exhibited an improved phenotype upon PIO treatment. Altogether, our results suggest that excessive glycolysis participates to the pathogenesis of mitochondriopathies and that pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis may have beneficial effects in this condition.",

Hence, we evaluated the effects of insulin, glucagon and glucose on plasma proANP in a series of observational and experimental studies.Six healthy men underwent seven days of bed rest. Before and after the bed rest, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps with serial plasma measurements of proANP were performed. Moreover, plasma proANP was quantified in 65 individuals with normal or impaired glucose regulation. Finally, the effects of infusion-induced hyperglucagonemia were examined in ten healthy men.Bed rest decreased insulin sensitivity and plasma proANP. The decrease in proANP was not associated with insulin sensitivity and the peptide concentrations remained constant during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemic hyperglucagonemia. Impaired glucose regulation was not associated with decreased proANP concentrations.Bed rest per se induces a marked decrease in plasma proANP concentrations whereas insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation was not associated with lower proANP concentrations. Neither acute hyperinsulinemia nor hyperglucagonemia seems to affect plasma proANP. Our findings thus suggest that decreased plasma proANP concentrations occur late in the development of insulin resistance.",

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a high-throughput assay for ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) diagnosis that can attain the \u201cgold standard\u201d of the current PRNT assay. The new assay is homogeneous and utilizes luciferase viruses to quantify the neutralizing antibody titers in a 96-well format. Using 91 human specimens, we showed that the reporter diagnostic assay has a higher dynamic range and maintains the relative specificity of the traditional PRNT assay. Besides the improvement of assay throughput, the reporter virus technology has also shortened the turnaround time to less than two days. Collectively, our results suggest that, along with the viral RT-PCR assay, the reporter virus-based serologic assay could be potentially used as the first-line test for clinical diagnosis of ZIKV infection as well as for vaccine clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "Although HIV services are expanding, few have reached the scale necessary to support universal viral suppression of individuals living with HIV. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the qualitative evidence evaluating public health HIV interventions to enhance linkage to care, antiretroviral drug (ARV) adherence, and retention in care. We searched 19 databases without language restrictions. The review collated data from three separate qualitative evidence reviews addressing each of the three outcomes along the care continuum. 21,738 citations were identified and 24 studies were included in the evidence review. Among low and middle-income countries in Africa, men living with HIV had decreased engagement in interventions compared to women and this lack of engagement among men also influenced the willingness of their partners to engage in services. Four structural issues (poverty, unstable housing, food insecurity, lack of transportation) mediated the feasibility and acceptability of public health HIV interventions. Individuals living with HIV identified unmet mental health needs that interfered with their ability to access HIV services. Persistent social and cultural factors contribute to disparities in HIV outcomes across the continuum of care, shaping the context of service delivery among important subpopulations.",

     "abstract": "Infection of respiratory mucosa with viral pathogens triggers complex immunologic events in the affected host. We sought to characterize this response through proteomic analysis of nasopharyngeal lavage in human subjects experimentally challenged with influenza A/H3N2 or human rhinovirus, and to develop targeted assays measuring peptides involved in this host response allowing classification of acute respiratory virus infection. Unbiased proteomic discovery analysis identified 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins, and revealed that infection with H3N2 induces significant alterations in protein expression. These include proteins involved in acute inflammatory response, innate immune response, and the complement cascade. These data provide insights into the nature of the biological response to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, and the proteins that are dysregulated by viral infection form the basis of signature that accurately classifies the infected state. Verification of this signature using targeted mass spectrometry in independent cohorts of subjects challenged with influenza or rhinovirus demonstrates that it performs with high accuracy (0.8623 AUROC, 75% TPR, 97.46% TNR). With further development as a clinical diagnostic, this signature may have utility in rapid screening for emerging infections, avoidance of inappropriate antibacterial therapy, and more rapid implementation of appropriate therapeutic and public health strategies.",

     "abstract": "Many broadly reactive human monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) stem of influenza A virus have been developed for therapeutic applications. These antibodies typically inhibit viral entry steps, especially the HA conformational change that is required for membrane fusion. To better understand the mechanisms by which such antibodies inhibit viral replication, we established broadly reactive human anti-HA stem antibodies and determined the properties of these antibodies by examining their reactivity with 18 subtypes of HA, evaluating their in vivo protective efficacy, identifying their epitopes, and characterizing their inhibitory mechanisms. Among the eight human monoclonal antibodies we generated, which recognized at least 3 subtypes of the soluble HA antigens tested, clone S9-1-10/5-1 reacted with 18 subtypes of HA and protected mice from lethal infection with H1N1pdm09, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses. This antibody recognized the HA2 helix A in the HA stem, and inhibited virus particle release from infected cells but did not block viral entry completely. These results show that broadly reactive human anti-HA stem antibodies can exhibit protective efficacy by inhibiting virus particle release. These findings expand our knowledge of the mechanisms by which broadly reactive stem-targeting antibodies inhibit viral replication and provide valuable information for universal vaccine development.",

A subset of HPV negative HNSCCs occur in patients without smoking history, however, and these etiologically \u2018atypical\u2019 HNSCCs disproportionately occur in the oral cavity, and in female patients, suggesting a distinct etiology.To investigate the determinants of clinical and molecular heterogeneity, we performed unsupervised clustering to classify 528 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into putative intrinsic subtypes based on their profiles of epigenetically (DNA methylation) deregulated genes.HNSCCs clustered into five subtypes, including one HPV positive subtype, two smoking-related subtypes, and two atypical subtypes. One atypical subtype was particularly genomically stable, but featured widespread gene silencing associated with the \u2018CpG island methylator phenotype\u2019 (CIMP).Further distinguishing features of this \u2018CIMP-Atypical\u2019 subtype include an antiviral gene expression profile associated with pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and CD8+ T cell infiltration, CASP8 mutations, and a well-differentiated state corresponding to normal SOX2 copy number and SOX2OT hypermethylation. We developed a gene expression classifier for the CIMP-Atypical subtype that could classify atypical disease features in two independent patient cohorts, demonstrating the reproducibility of this subtype. Taken together, these findings provide unprecedented evidence that atypical HNSCC is molecularly distinct, and postulates the CIMP-Atypical subtype as a distinct clinical entity that may be caused by chronic inflammation.",

Cell-based regenerative therapies become a promising treatment for patients affected by heart failure, but also underline the need for reproducible results in preclinical and clinical studies for safety and efficacy. Enthusiasm has been tempered by poor engraftment, survival and differentiation of the injected adult stem cells. The crucial challenge is identification and selection of the most suitable stem cell type for cardiac regenerative medicine. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have emerged as attractive cell source to obtain cardiomyocytes (CMs), with potential applications, including drug discovery and toxicity screening, disease modelling and innovative cell therapies. Lessons from embryology offered important insights into the development of stem cell-derived CMs. However, the generation of a CM population, uniform in cardiac subtype, adult maturation and functional properties, is highly recommended. Moreover, hurdles regarding tumorigenesis, graft cell death, immune rejection and arrhythmogenesis need to be overcome in clinical practice.

Disrupted microtubule organization in tumor cells is an additional consequence of FASN inhibition. FASN inhibition combined with taxane treatment enhances inhibition of in vitro tumor cell growth compared to treatment with either agent alone. In lung, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic tumor xenograft studies, FASN inhibition and paclitaxel or docetaxel combine to inhibit xenograft tumor growth with significantly enhanced anti-tumor activity.

     "abstract": "While invasion and metastasis of tumour cells are the principle factor responsible for cancer related deaths, the mechanisms governing the process remain poorly defined. Moreover, phenotypic divergence of sub-populations of tumour cells is known to underpin alternative behaviors linked to tumour progression such as proliferation, survival and invasion. In the context of melanoma, heterogeneity between two transcription factors, BRN2 and MITF, has been associated with phenotypic switching between predominantly invasive and proliferative behaviors respectively. Epigenetic changes, in response to external cues, have been proposed to underpin this process, however the mechanism by which the phenotypic switch occurs is unclear. Here we report the identification of the NFIB transcription factor as a novel downstream effector of BRN2 function in melanoma cells linked to the migratory and invasive characteristics of these cells. Furthermore, the function of NFIB appears to drive an invasive phenotype through an epigenetic mechanism achieved via the upregulation of the polycomb group protein EZH2. A notable target of NFIB mediated up-regulation of EZH2 is decreased MITF expression, which further promotes a less proliferative, more invasive phenotype. Together our data reveal that NFIB has the ability to promote dynamic changes in the chromatin state of melanoma cells to facilitate migration, invasion and metastasis.",

Surgery and radiotherapy remain the only treatment options despite years of research, therefore an effective therapeutic is required.Unbiased omics studies have become pivotal in the identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins that may act as drug targets or biomarkers. Here we analysed the proteome and phospho-proteome of these genetically defined tumours using primary human tumour cells to identify upregulated/activated proteins and/or pathways. We identified over 2000 proteins in comparative experiments between Merlin-deficient schwannoma and meningioma compared to human Schwann and meningeal cells respectively. Using functional enrichment analysis we highlighted several dysregulated pathways and Gene Ontology terms. We identified several proteins and phospho-proteins that are more highly expressed in tumours compared to controls. Among proteins jointly dysregulated in both tumours we focused in particular on PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDLIM2) and validated its overexpression in several tumour samples, while not detecting it in normal cells. We showed that shRNA mediated knockdown of PDLIM2 in both primary meningioma and schwannoma leads to significant reductions in cellular proliferation.To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of the NF2-related meningioma and schwannoma proteome and phospho-proteome. Taken together, our data highlight several commonly deregulated factors, and indicate that PDLIM2 may represent a novel, common target for meningioma and schwannoma.",

Molecular mechanism of MeCP2 regulation was investigated using an integrated approach with combination of microarray analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). The results suggest that MeCP2 binds to the methylated CpG islands of FOXF1 and MYOD1 promoters and inhibits their expression at the transcription level.

     "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition to clinical and immunophenotypic characteristics, recurrent gene mutations have recently been identified in patients with DLBCL using next-generation sequencing technologies. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical relevance of B-cell function gene mutations in DLBCL. Clinical analysis was performed on 680 Chinese DLBCL patients (146 non-CR and 534 CR cases) treated with six cycles of 21-day R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), alone or followed by two additional doses of rituximab consolidation on patients' own intention. Somatic mutations of B-cell function genes were further screened on 275 (71 non-CR and 204 CR) cases with available tumor samples by targeted sequencing, including genes involved in B-cell receptors (BCRs) pathway (CARD11, LYN, CD79A, and CD79B), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway (MYD88), and tumor necrotic factor receptor (TNFR) pathway (TRAF2 and TNFAIP3). B-cell function gene mutations occurred in 44.0% (121/275) of DLBCL patients. The TLRs and TNFR related gene mutations were more frequently observed in non-CR patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.032, respectively). BCRs related gene mutations, as well as revised IPI (R-IPI) and double BCL-2/MYC expression, were independently related to short progression-free survival in DLBCL after CR. The adverse prognostic effect of BCRs related gene mutations could be overcome by two additional doses of rituximab consolidation. These results highlight the molecular heterogeneity of DLBCL and identify a significant role of B-cell function gene mutations on lymphoma progression and response to rituximab in DLBCL.",

Here, we assessed the prediction of preoperative metabolic syndrome and its single components for esophageal cancer mortality by analyzing a subset of data from the ongoing F uj i an prosp e ctive inve st igation of c a ncer (FIESTA) study. Between 2000 and 2010, patients who underwent three-field lymphadenectomy were eligible for inclusion. Blood/tissue specimens, demographic and clinicopathologic data were collected at baseline. Metabolic syndrome is defined by the criteria proposed by Chinese Diabetes Society. In this study, analysis was restricted to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) due to the limited number of other histological types. The median follow-up in 2396 ESCC patients (males/females: 1822/574) was 38.2\u00a0months (range, 0.5\u2013180\u00a0months). The multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of metabolic syndrome for ESCC mortality was statistically significant in males (HR, 95% confidence interval, P: 1.45, 1.14\u20131.83, 0.002), but not in females (1.46, 0.92\u20132.31, 0.107). For single metabolic components, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were significant for hyperglycemia (1.98, 1.68\u20132.33, <\u00a00.001) and dyslipidemia (1.41, 1.20\u20131.65, <\u00a00.001) in males and for hyperglycemia (1.76, 1.23\u20132.51, <\u00a00.001) in females, independent of clinicopathologic characteristics and obesity. In tree-structured survival analysis, the top splitting factor in both genders was tumor-node-metastasis stage, followed by regional lymph node metastasis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that preoperative metabolic syndrome was a significant independent predictor of ESCC mortality in males, and this effect was largely mediated by glyeolipid metabolism disorder.",

In order to elucidate age-specific profiles of immune responses against RSV protection, antibody responses were examined by using blood samples in both acute and convalescent phases obtained from child patients and adult patients. In addition to the serum neutralization activity, antibody responses to the RSV fusion protein (F protein) were dissected by analyzing levels of total IgG, IgG subclasses, the binding stability, and the levels of antibody for the neutralization epitopes. It was suggested that children's antibody responses against RSV are matured over months and years in at least 5 stages based on 1) levels of the neutralization titer and IgG3 for F protein in the convalescent phase, 2) geometric mean ratios of the neutralization titers and levels of IgG1 and IgG2 for F protein in the convalescent phase compared to those levels in the acute phase, 3) the affinity maturation of IgG for F protein and the cross reactivity of IgG for RSV glycoproteins of groups A and B, 4) levels of neutralization epitope-specific IgG, and 5) augmentation of overall antibody responses due to repetitive RSV infection.",

The present serologic diagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection relies mainly on IgM-capture ELISA which is confounded with the flaw of cross-reactivity among different flaviviruses. In this communication, we report a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MIA) that captures the diagnostic power of viral envelope protein (that elicits robust, yet cross-reactive antibodies to other flaviviruses) and the differential power of viral nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS5 (that induce more virus-type specific antibodies). Using 153 patient specimens with known ZIKV and/or dengue virus (DENV; a closely related flavivirus) infections, we showed that (i) ZIKV envelope-based MIA is equivalent or more sensitive than IgM-capture ELISA in diagnosing ZIKV infection, (ii) antibody responses to NS1 and NS5 proteins are more ZIKV-specific than antibody response to envelope protein, (iii) inclusion of NS1 and NS5 in the MIA improves the diagnostic accuracy when compared with the MIA that uses envelope protein alone. The multiplex MIA achieves a rapid diagnosis (turnaround time\u00a0<\u00a04\u00a0h) and requires small specimen volume (10\u00a0\u03bcl) in a single reaction.

Remarkably, CD8\u00a0+ T cell inhibitory capacity was preserved and there were no new escape mutations in targeted Gag epitopes.

To establish whether pharmacological targeting of PKC\u03b8 in DMD can be proposed as a therapeutic option, in this study we treated young mdx mice with the PKC\u03b8 inhibitor Compound 20 (C20).

Importantly, C20 treatment is efficient in recovering muscle performance in mdx mice, by preserving muscle integrity. Together, these results provide proof of principle that pharmacological inhibition of PKC\u03b8 in DMD can be considered an attractive strategy to modulate immune response and prevent the progression of the disease.Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle disease affecting 1:3500 male births. DMD is caused by a mutation in dystrophin gene, coding for a protein required for skeletal and cardiac muscle integrity. Lack of a functional dystrophin is primarily responsible for the muscle eccentric contraction-induced muscle damage, observed in dystrophic muscle. However, inflammation plays a considerable role in the progression of DMD. Glucocorticoids, which have anti-inflammatory properties, are being used to treat DMD with some success; however, long term treatment with these drugs induces muscle atrophy and wasting, outweighing their benefit. The identification of specific targets for anti-inflammatory therapies is one of the ongoing therapeutic options. Although blunting inflammation would not be a \u201ccure\u201d for the disease, the emerging clue is that multiple strategies, addressing different aspects of the pathology, which may eventually converge, may be successful. In this context, we previously showed that genetic ablation of Protein Kinase C \u03b8 (PKC\u03b8), an enzyme known to be involved in immune response, in mdx, the mouse model of DMD, improves muscle healing and regeneration, preventing massive inflammation.

TBI perturbed epigenomic programming, transcriptional activities (expression level and alternative splicing), and the organization of genes in networks centered around genes such as Anax2, Ogn, and Fmod. Transcriptomic signatures in the hippocampus are involved in neuronal signaling, metabolism, inflammation, and blood function, and they overlap with those in leukocytes from peripheral blood. The homology between genomic signatures from blood and brain elicited by TBI provides proof of concept information for development of biomarkers of TBI based on composite genomic patterns. By intersecting with human genome-wide association studies, many TBI signature genes and network regulators identified in our rodent model were causally associated with brain disorders with relevant link to TBI. The overall results show that concussive brain injury reprograms genes which could lead to predisposition to neurological and psychiatric disorders, and that genomic information from peripheral leukocytes has the potential to predict TBI pathogenesis in the brain.",

     "abstract": "Cerebral ischemic stroke is a main cause of chronic disability. However, there is currently no effective treatment to promote recovery from stroke-induced neurological symptoms. Recent studies suggest that after stroke, immature neurons, referred to as neuroblasts, generated in a neurogenic niche, the ventricular-subventricular zone, migrate toward the injured area, where they differentiate into mature neurons. Interventions that increase the number of neuroblasts distributed at and around the lesion facilitate neuronal repair in rodent models for ischemic stroke, suggesting that promoting neuroblast migration in the post-stroke brain could improve efficient neuronal regeneration. To move toward the lesion, neuroblasts form chain-like aggregates and migrate along blood vessels, which are thought to increase their migration efficiency. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these migration processes are largely unknown. Here we studied the role of \u03b21-class integrins, transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, in these migrating neuroblasts. We found that the neuroblast chain formation and blood vessel-guided migration critically depend on \u03b21 integrin signaling. \u03b21 integrin facilitated the adhesion of neuroblasts to laminin and the efficient translocation of their soma during migration. Moreover, artificial laminin-containing scaffolds promoted neuroblast chain formation and migration toward the injured area. These data suggest that laminin signaling via \u03b21 integrin supports vasculature-guided neuronal migration to efficiently supply neuroblasts to injured areas. This study also highlights the importance of vascular scaffolds for cell migration in development and regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) represents a promising agent to ameliorate obesity and other metabolic disorders. However, the abundance of BAT decreases with age and BAT paucity is a common feature of obese subjects. As brown adipocytes and myoblasts share a common Myf5 lineage origin, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the fate choices of brown adipocytes versus myoblasts may lead to novel approaches to expand BAT mass. Here we identify MyoD as a key negative regulator of brown adipocyte development. CRISPR/CAS9-mediated deletion of MyoD in C2C12 myoblasts facilitates their adipogenic transdifferentiation. MyoD knockout downregulates miR-133 and upregulates the miR-133 target Igf1r, leading to amplification of PI3K\u2013Akt signaling. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K or Akt abolishes the adipogenic gene expression of MyoD null myoblasts. Strikingly, loss of MyoD converts satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts to brown adipocytes through upregulation of Prdm16, a target of miR-133 and key determinant of brown adipocyte fate. Conversely, forced expression of MyoD in brown preadipocytes blocks brown adipogenesis and upregulates the expression of myogenic genes. Importantly, miR-133a knockout significantly blunts the inhibitory effect of MyoD on brown adipogenesis. Our results establish MyoD as a negative regulator of brown adipocyte development by upregulating miR-133 to suppress Akt signaling and Prdm16.",

We have previously found that dietary lipid adsorbent-montmorillonite (DLA-M) has an unexpected role in preventing obesity. The aim of this study was to further investigate whether DLA-M regulates intestinal absorption and gut microbiota to prevent obesity-related metabolic disorders. Here, we show that DLA-M absorbs free fatty acids (FFA) and endotoxins in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the combination of fluorescent tracer technique and polarized light microscopy showed that DLA-M crystals immobilized BODIPY\u00ae FL C16 and FITC-LPS, respectively, in the digestive tract in situ. HFD-fed mice treated with DLA-M showed mild changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, particularly increases in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing Blautia bacteria and decreases in endotoxin-producing Desulfovibrio bacteria, these changes were positively correlated with obesity and inflammation. Our results indicated that DLA-M immobilizes FFA and endotoxins in the digestive tract via the adsorption-excretion axis and DLA-M may potentially be used as a prebiotic to prevent intestinal dysbiosis and obesity-associated metabolic disorders in obese individuals.",

Whereas much previous work has purported Munc18a/SNARE complex (Syntaxin-1A/VAMP-2/SNAP25) to be primarily involved in predocked secretory granule (SG) fusion, less is known about newcomer SGs that undergo minimal docking time at the plasma membrane before fusion. Newcomer SG fusion has been postulated to involve a distinct SM/SNARE complex (Munc18b/Syntaxin-3/VAMP8/SNAP25), whose levels we find also reduced in islets of T2D humans and T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Munc18b overexpression by adenovirus infection (Ad-Munc18b), by increasing assembly of Munc18b/SNARE complexes, mediated increased fusion of not only newcomer SGs but also predocked SGs in T2D human and GK rat islets, resulting in rescue of the deficient biphasic GSIS.Infusion of Ad-Munc18b into GK rat pancreas led to sustained improvement in glucose homeostasis. However, Munc18b overexpression in normal islets increased only newcomer SG fusion. Therefore, Munc18b could potentially be deployed in human T2D to rescue the deficient GSIS.",

Of 1198 women who delivered, 1116 eligible mothers (147 with hyperandrogenism and 969 normal) were recruited. 1216 children (156 children born to mothers with hyperandrogenism and 1060 born to normal mother) were followed up their glycometabolism in mean age of 5\u00a0years. Imprinting genes of oocyte from mothers and lymphocytes from children were examined. A pregestational hyperandrogenism rat model was also established.Children born to women with hyperandrogenism showed increased serum fasting glucose and insulin levels, and were more prone to prediabetes (adjusted RR: 3.98 (95%CI 1.16\u201313.58)). Oocytes from women with hyperandrogenism showed increased insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression. Lymphocytes from their children also showed increased IGF2 expression and decreased IGF2 methylation. Treatment of human oocytes with dihydrotestosterone upregulated IGF2 and downregulated DNMT3a levels. In rat, pregestational hyperandrogenism induced diabetic phenotypes and impaired insulin secretion in offspring. In consistent with the findings in human, hyperandrogenism also increased Igf2 expression and decreased DNMT3a in rat oocytes. Importantly, the same altered methylation signatures of Igf2 were identified in the offspring pancreatic islets.Pregestational hyperandrogenism may predispose offspring to glucose metabolism disorder via epigenetic oocyte inheritance.Clinical trial registry no.: ChiCTR-OCC-14004537; www.chictr.org.",

Outcomes were large for gestational age (LGA) baby, cesarean section, and spontaneous preterm birth. We calculated the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUCs) to assess the capacity of OGTT glucose values to predict adverse outcomes, and compared the AUCs of different components of OGTT.1325 women had a LGA baby (10.5%). Glucose measurements were linearly associated with LGA, with strongest associations for fasting glucose (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.30\u20131.45). Weaker associations were observed for cesarean section and spontaneous preterm birth. Fasting glucose have a comparable discriminative power for prediction of LGA to the combination of fasting, 1\u00a0h, and 2\u00a0h glucose values during OGTT (AUCs, 0.611 vs. 0.614, P\u00a0=\u00a00.166).

Considering SLC4A11 mutations leads to corneal endothelial dystrophy and sensorineural deafness, our results indicate that SLC4A11-associated developmental and degenerative disorders result from altered glutamine catabolism.

ADAMTS13 is the main VWF-cleaving protease and its deficiency results in development of thrombotic microangiopathy. Besides ADAMTS13 other proteases may also possess VWF-cleaving activity, but their physiological importance in preventing thrombus formation is unknown. This study investigated if, and which, proteases could cleave VWF in the glomerulus. The content of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) was studied as a reflection of processes occurring in the subendothelial glomerular space. VWF was incubated with human GBMs and VWF cleavage was assessed by multimer structure analysis, immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. VWF was cleaved into the smallest multimers by the GBM, which contained ADAMTS13 as well as neutrophil proteases, elastase, proteinase 3 (PR3), cathepsin-G and matrix-metalloproteinase 9. The most potent components of the GBM capable of VWF cleavage were in the serine protease or metalloprotease category, but not ADAMTS13. Neutralization of neutrophil serine proteases inhibited GBM-mediated VWF-cleaving activity, demonstrating a marked contribution of elastase and/or PR3. VWF-platelet strings formed on the surface of primary glomerular endothelial cells, in a perfusion system, were cleaved by both elastase and the GBM, a process blocked by elastase inhibitor. Ultramorphological studies of the human kidney demonstrated neutrophils releasing elastase into the GBM. Neutrophil proteases may contribute to VWF cleavage within the subendothelium, adjacent to the GBM, and thus regulate thrombus size. This anti-thrombotic mechanism would protect the normal kidney during inflammation and could also explain why most patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency do not develop severe kidney failure.",

The helminth diseases schistosomiasis, opisthorchiasis, and clonorchiasis are highly carcinogenic while the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causing agent of Chagas disease, has a dual role in the development of cancer, including both carcinogenic and anticancer properties. Although malaria per se does not appear to be causative in carcinogenesis, it is strongly associated with the occurrence of endemic Burkitt lymphoma in areas holoendemic for malaria. The initiation of Plasmodium falciparum related endemic Burkitt lymphoma requires additional transforming events induced by the Epstein-Barr virus. Observations suggest that Strongyloides stercoralis may be a relevant co-factor in HTLV-1-related T cell lymphomas.

The mechanisms of these observations and the kinds of patients they apply to are unclear. Using an in vitro model of the pseudofollicles where CLL cells originate, LDLs were found to increase plasma membrane cholesterol, signaling molecules such as tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3, and activated CLL cell numbers. The signaling effects of LDLs were not seen in normal lymphocytes or glycolytic lymphoma cell-lines but were restored by transduction with the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b4, which mediates metabolic activity in CLL cells. Breakdown of LDLs in lysosomes was required for the amplification effect, which correlated with down-regulation of HMGCR expression and long lymphocyte doubling times (LDTs) of 53.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4\u00a0months. Cholesterol content of circulating CLL cells correlated directly with blood LDL levels in a subgroup of patients.

To determine the pivotal role that DUBs play in mediating tumorigenesis, we have performed a non-biased screen of 67 human DUBs based on a mammary cell transformation assay. This led to the identification of USP11 as a critical determinant of mammary tumor initiation and progression. Using an approach of protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we further identified XIAP to be a target for USP11. We demonstrated that, while depletion of XIAP attenuates cell transformation, elevated USP11 significantly promotes the tumor colony formation through stabilization of XIAP. Molecular modeling coupled with mutagenesis analyses further revealed that Leu207 on the BIR2 domain of XIAP facilitates its interaction with USP11. Stabilization of XIAP due to its deubiquitylation by USP11 leads to the inhibition of cell anoikis and apoptosis, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed that aberrant accumulation of USP11 correlates with elevated levels of XIAP in breast cancer tissues. We therefore propose that aberrant USP11, via stabilization of XIAP, promotes tumor initiation and progression.",

We have previously shown that KRasG12D-induced ADM is dependent on RAC1 and EGF receptor (EGFR) by a not fully clarified mechanism. Using three-dimensional mouse and human acinar tissue cultures and genetically engineered mouse models, we provide evidence that (i) KRasG12D leads to EGFR-dependent sustained fluid-phase endocytosis (FPE) during acinar metaplasia; (ii) variations in plasma membrane tension increase FPE and lead to ADM in vitro independently of EGFR; and (iii) that RAC1 regulates ADM formation partially through actin-dependent regulation of FPE. In addition, mice with a pancreas-specific deletion of the Neural-Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), a regulator of F-actin, have reduced FPE and impaired ADM emphasizing the in vivo relevance of our findings. This work defines a new role of FPE as a tumor initiating mechanism.",

We updated and extended previous systematic reviews by assessing the role of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and symptom severity in the development of sequelae following campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. We searched four databases, including PubMed, from 1 January 2011 to 29 April 2016. Observational studies reporting sequelae of reactive arthritis (ReA), Reiter's syndrome (RS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) following gastroenteritis were included. The primary outcome was incidence of sequelae of interest amongst cases of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. A narrative synthesis was conducted where heterogeneity was high. Of the 55 articles included, incidence of ReA (n\u00a0=\u00a037), RS (n\u00a0=\u00a05), IBS (n\u00a0=\u00a012) and GBS (n\u00a0=\u00a09) were reported following campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis. A pooled summary for each sequela was not estimated due to high level of heterogeneity across studies (I2\u00a0>\u00a090%). PPI usage and symptoms were sparsely reported. Three out of seven studies found a statistically significant association between antibiotics usage and development of ReA. Additional primary studies investigating risk modifying factors in sequelae of GI infections are required to enable targeted interventions.",

Here, we describe a computational pipeline that adopts an unbiased approach to identify a biomarker signature. Data from RNA sequencing from whole blood samples of TB patients were integrated with a curated genome-wide molecular interaction network, from which we obtain a comprehensive perspective of variations that occur in the host due to TB. We then implement a sensitive network mining method to shortlist gene candidates that are most central to the disease alterations. We then apply a series of filters that include applicability to multiple publicly available datasets as well as additional validation on independent patient samples, and identify a signature comprising 10 genes \u2014 FCGR1A, HK3, RAB13, RBBP8, IFI44L, TIMM10, BCL6, SMARCD3, CYP4F3 and SLPI, that can discriminate between TB and healthy controls as well as distinguish TB from latent tuberculosis and HIV in most cases.

In addition, an adjuvant effect was not observed when Advax-adjuvanted WV vaccine was used to immunize toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 knockout mice which are unable to respond to RNA contained in WV antigen. Similarly, no adjuvant effect was seen when Advax was combined with endotoxin-free ovalbumin, a neutral Th0-type antigen. An adjuvant effect was also not seen in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 knockout mice, and the adjuvant effect required the presences of dendritic cells (DCs) and phagocytic macrophages. Therefore, unlike other adjuvants, Advax potentiates the intrinsic or in-built adjuvant property of co-administered antigens. Hence, Advax is a unique class of adjuvant which can potentiate the intrinsic adjuvant feature of the vaccine antigens through a yet to be determined mechanism.",

However, the current treatments for mucus hypersecretion are often ineffective or temporary. The potential therapeutic targets of mucus hypersecretion in asthma remain unknown. Here, we show that Lyn is a central effector of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and mucous hypersecretion in asthma. In Lyn-transgenic mice (Lyn-TG) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice exposed to ovalbumin (OVA), Lyn overexpression attenuates mucus hypersecretion and ER stress. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) induced MUC5AC expression by enhancing ER stress in vitro. Lyn serves as a negative regulator of IL-13-induced ER stress and MUC5AC expression. We further find that an inhibitor of ER stress, which is likely involved in the PI3K p85\u03b1/Akt pathway and NF\u03baB activity, blocked MUC5AC expression in Lyn-knockdown cells. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt signaling is required for IL-13-induced ER stress and MUC5AC expression in airway epithelial cells. The ER stress regulation of MUC5AC expression depends on NF\u03baB in Lyn-knockdown airway epithelial cells. Our studies indicate not only a concept of mucus hypersecretion in asthma that involves Lyn kinase but also an important therapeutic candidate for asthma.",

During mouse development, Igf2 is expressed in all sites where hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) successively expand, then its expression drops at weaning and becomes undetectable when adult HSC have reached their niches in bones and start to self-renew. In the present study, we aim to discover the role of IGF2 during adulthood. We show that Igf2 is specifically expressed in adult HSC and we analyze HSC from adult mice deficient in Igf2 transcripts. We demonstrate that Igf2 deficiency avoids the age-related attrition of the HSC pool and that Igf2 is necessary for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Our study reveals that the expression level of Igf2 is critical to maintain the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, presumably by regulating the interaction between HSC and their niche. Our data have major clinical interest for transplantation: understanding the changes in adult stem cells and their environments will improve the efficacy of regenerative medicine and impact health- and life-span.",

With a community based cross-sectional study of 967 postmenopausal women, we found that the variant rs7041, but not rs4588, of DBP was significantly associated with the blood DBP level, which was positively correlated with the total 25(OH)D level but negatively associated with bioavailable 25(OH)D levels.

The bioavailable and total 25(OH)D were negatively correlated with bone formation biomarkers (OST, PINP and ALP) and PTH levels, while they were positively correlated with osteoprotegerin (OPG) level; however, the bone resorption biomarker (\u03b2-CTX) was not correlated with the 25(OH)D levels. An increment of PTH level, along with reduced bioavailable 25(OH)D levels, was evident when the bioavailable 25(OH)D level was <\u00a05\u00a0ng/mL, which may be the optimal cutpoint for sufficient vitamin D in Chinese elderly women. The blood calcium, magnesium, ALP, TSH, FGF23, and phosphorus levels were not correlated with the total or the bioavailable 25(OH)D levels. These results suggested that high bioavailable 25(OH)D levels were correlated with reduced bone turnover processes and were a biomarker superior to total 25(OH)D for vitamin D in assessing the risks of bone-related diseases.

VL exposure induced significantly higher upregulation of EGR1 in chick chorioretinal tissues than blue light under the same conditions. Next, we conducted clinical research retrospectively to compare the AL elongation among myopic children who wore eyeglasses (VL blocked) and two types of contact lenses (partially VL blocked and VL transmitting).

In this study, we demonstrated that FEN1 is overexpressed in breast cancers and is essential for rapid proliferation of cancer cells. We showed that manipulating FEN1 levels in cells alters the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we identified a small molecular compound, SC13 that specifically inhibits FEN1 activity, thereby interfering with DNA replication and repair in vitro and in cells. SC13 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and induces chromosome instability and cytotoxicity in cells.

     "abstract": "The immune tolerogenic effects of IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1) have been well documented and genetic studies in mice have clearly established the significance of IDO1 in tumor promotion. Dichotomously, the primary inducer of IDO1, the inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 (interferon-\u03b3), is a key mediator of immune-based tumor suppression. One means by which IFN\u03b3 can exert an anti-cancer effect is by decreasing tumor neovascularization. We speculated that IDO1 might contribute to cancer promotion by countering this anti-neovascular effect of IFN\u03b3, possibly through IDO1-potentiated elevation of the pro-tumorigenic inflammatory cytokine IL6 (interleukin-6). In this study, we investigated how genetic loss of IDO1 affects neovascularization in mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy and lung metastasis. Neovascularization in both models was significantly reduced in mice lacking IDO1, was similarly reduced with loss of IL6, and was restored in both cases by concomitant loss of IFN\u03b3. Likewise, the lack of IDO1 or IL6 resulted in reduced metastatic tumor burden and increased survival, which the concomitant loss of IFN\u03b3 abrogated. This insight into IDO1's involvement in pro-tumorigenic inflammatory neovascularization may have important ramifications for IDO1 inhibitor development, not only in cancer where clinical trials are currently ongoing, but in other disease indications associated with neovascularization as well.",

Application of biologically relevant mucosal models can advance understanding of the functional properties of antibodies that mediate HIV protection, thereby guiding antibody-based vaccine development.

For human vaginal explants, we developed a replication-competent, secreted NanoLuc reporter virus system and showed that CD4 binding site bnAbs b12 IgG1 and CH31 IgG1 and IgA2 isoforms potently blocked HIV-1JR-CSF and HIV-1Bal26 infection. However, IgG1 and IgA nnAbs, either alone or together, did not inhibit infection despite the presence of FcR-expressing effector cells in the tissue. In macaques, the CH31 IgG1 and IgA2 isoforms infused before high-dose SHIV challenge were completely to partially protective, respectively, while nnAbs (CH54 IgG1 and CH38 mIgA2) were non-protective. Importantly, in both mucosal models IgG1 isotype bnAbs were more protective than the IgA2 isotypes, attributable in part to greater neutralization activity of the IgG1 variants.

     "abstract": "Iron deficiency causes long-term adverse consequences for children and is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide. Observational studies suggest that iron deficiency anemia protects against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and several intervention trials have indicated that iron supplementation increases malaria risk through unknown mechanism(s). This poses a major challenge for health policy. We investigated how anemia inhibits blood stage malaria infection and how iron supplementation abrogates this protection.This observational cohort study occurred in a malaria-endemic region where sickle-cell trait is also common. We studied fresh RBCs from anemic children (135 children; age 6\u201324\u00a0months; hemoglobin <\u00a011\u00a0g/dl) participating in an iron supplementation trial (ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN07210906) in which they received iron (12\u00a0mg/day) as part of a micronutrient powder for 84\u00a0days. Children donated RBCs at baseline, Day 49, and Day 84 for use in flow cytometry-based in vitro growth and invasion assays with P. falciparum laboratory and field strains. In vitro parasite growth in subject RBCs was the primary endpoint.Anemia substantially reduced the invasion and growth of both laboratory and field strains of P. falciparum in vitro (~\u00a010% growth reduction per standard deviation shift in hemoglobin). The population level impact against erythrocytic stage malaria was 15.9% from anemia compared to 3.5% for sickle-cell trait. Parasite growth was 2.4 fold higher after 49\u00a0days of iron supplementation relative to baseline (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), paralleling increases in erythropoiesis.These results confirm and quantify a plausible mechanism by which anemia protects African children against falciparum malaria, an effect that is substantially greater than the protection offered by sickle-cell trait. Iron supplementation completely reversed the observed protection and hence should be accompanied by malaria prophylaxis.

However, reciprocal translocation carrier embryos were seldom discriminated from the normal ones mainly due to the technique restriction. Here we established a clinical applicable approach to identify precise breakpoint of reciprocal translocation and to further distinguish normal embryos in PGD. In the preclinical phase, rearrangement breakpoints and adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were characterized by next-generation sequencing following microdissecting junction region (MicroSeq) from 8 reciprocal translocation carriers. Junction-spanning PCR and sequencing further discovered precise breakpoints. The precise breakpoints were identified in 7/8 patients and we revealed that translocations in 6 patients caused 9 gene disruptions. In the clinical phase of embryo analysis, informative SNPs were chosen for linkage analyses combined with PCR analysis of the breakpoints to identify the carrier embryos. From 15 blastocysts diagnosed to be chromosomal balanced, 13 blastocysts were identified to be carriers and 2 to be normal. Late prenatal diagnoses for five carriers and one normal fetus confirmed the carrier diagnosis results.

Optogenetic inhibition of entorhinal CaMKII\u03b1-positive neurons blocked the antiepileptic effect of LFES. The channelrhodopsin-2-eYFP labeled entorhinal CaMKII\u03b1-positive neurons primarily targeted the hippocampus, and the activation of these fibers reduced hippocampal seizure severity. By combining extracellular recording and pharmacological methods, we found that activating entorhinal CaMKII\u03b1-positive neurons induced the GABA-mediated inhibition of hippocampal neurons. Optogenetic activation of focal hippocampal GABAergic neurons mimicked this neuronal modulatory effect and reduced hippocampal seizure severity, but the anti-epileptic effect is weaker than that of entorhinal LFES, which may be due to the limited spatial neuronal modulatory effect of focal photo-stimulation.

This study aims to assess the immediate outcomes of routine football heading using direct and sensitive measures of brain function.Nineteen amateur football players (5 females; age 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0y) headed machine-projected soccer balls at standardized speeds, modelling routine soccer practice.

Secondary outcome measures were cortical excitability, postural control, and cognitive function.Immediately following heading an increase in corticomotor inhibition was detected; further to these electrophysiological alterations, measurable reduction memory function were also found. These acute changes appear transient, with values normalizing 24\u00a0h post-heading.Sub-concussive head impacts routine in soccer heading are associated with immediate, measurable electrophysiological and cognitive impairments.

Here we tested the hypothesis that this effect is exerted by modulating the strength of neural synchronicity.Eighty-one Gulf War veterans (65 with GWI and 16 healthy controls) underwent a magnetoencephalography (MEG) scan to assess the strength of brain synchronicity by computing zero-lag crosscorrelations (and their Fisher z transforms) between prewhitened MEG time series. A high-resolution HLA genotyping determined the number of copies, k, of the 6 protective alleles above in each participant. We tested the hypothesis above by regressing NCM, Pain and Fatigue symptom severity against the interaction term, k\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0z (HLA-related effect), while including z (non-HLA-related effect), gender and age as covariates. The k\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0z and z terms assessed HLA- and non-HLA-related effects, respectively, of neural synchronicity on symptom severity. The distributions of these effects in sensor space were visualized using statistical heatmaps.We found significant, graded HLA- and non-HLA-related effects: (a) NCM\u00a0>\u00a0Pain\u00a0>\u00a0Fatigue for HLA-related effects, (b) NCM\u00a0>\u00a0Fatigue\u00a0>\u00a0Pain for non-HLA-related effects, and (c) HLA-related\u00a0>\u00a0non-HLA-related effects for all symptoms. These effects had widespread but distinct distributions in sensor space that allowed the orderly separation of the 6 terms (3 symptom domains\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 HLA factors) in a multidimensional plot, where one dimension separated the symptoms and the other the HLA relation.These findings demonstrate the presence of substantial, widespread, distinct and orderly HLA- and non-HLA-related neural influences on NCM, Pain and Fatigue symptom severity in GWI.U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and University of Minnesota.",

     "abstract": "Diffuse gliomas, grades II and III, hereafter called lower-grade gliomas (LGG), have variable, difficult to predict clinical courses, resulting in multiple studies to identify prognostic biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to assess expression or methylation of the homeobox family gene SHOX2 as independent markers for LGG survival.We downloaded publically available glioma datasets for gene expression and methylation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (LGG, n\u00a0=\u00a0516) was used as a training set, and three other expression datasets (n\u00a0=\u00a0308) and three other methylation datasets (n\u00a0=\u00a0320), were used for validation. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analyses.SHOX2 expression and gene body methylation varied among LGG patients and highly significantly predicted poor overall survival. While they were tightly correlated, SHOX2 expression appeared more potent as a prognostic marker and was used for most further studies. The SHOX2 prognostic roles were maintained after analyses by histology subtypes or tumor grade. We found that the combination of SHOX2 expression and IDH genotype status identified a subset of LGG patients with IDH wild-type (IDHwt) and low SHOX2 expression with considerably favorable survival. We further investigated the combination of SHOX2 with other known clinically relevant markers of LGG (TERT expression, 1p/19q chromosome co-deletion, MGMT methylation, ATRX mutation and NES expression). When combined with SHOX2 expression, we identified subsets of LGG patients with significantly favorable survival outcomes, especially in the subgroup with worse prognosis for each individual marker. Finally, multivariate analysis demonstrated that SHOX2 was a potent independent survival marker.We have identified that SHOX2 expression or methylation are potent independent prognostic indicators for predicting LGG patient survival, and have potential to identify an important subset of LGG patients with IDHwt status with significantly better overall survival. The combination of IDH or other relevant markers with SHOX2 identified LGG subsets with significantly different survival outcomes, and further understanding of these subsets may benefit therapeutic target identification and therapy selections for glioma patients.",

     "abstract": "The clinical potential of PARP-1 inhibitors has been recognized >\u00a010\u00a0years ago, prompting intensive research on their pharmacological application in several branches of medicine, particularly in oncology. However, natural or acquired resistance of tumors to known PARP-1 inhibitors poses a serious problem for their clinical implementation. Present study aims to reignite clinical interest to PARP-1 inhibitors by introducing a new method of identifying highly potent inhibitors and presenting the largest known collection of structurally diverse inhibitors. The majority of PARP-1 inhibitors known to date have been developed as NAD competitors. NAD is utilized by many enzymes other than PARP-1, resulting in a trade-off trap between their specificity and efficacy. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a new strategy to blindly screen a small molecule library for PARP-1 inhibitors by targeting a highly specific rout of its activation. Based on this screen, we present a collection of PARP-1 inhibitors and provide their structural classification. In addition to compounds that show structural similarity to NAD or known PARP-1 inhibitors, the screen identified structurally new non-NAD-like inhibitors that block PARP-1 activity in cancer cells with greater efficacy and potency than classical PARP-1 inhibitors currently used in clinic. These non-NAD-like PARP-1 inhibitors are effective against several types of human cancer xenografts, including kidney, prostate, and breast tumors in vivo. Our pre-clinical testing of these inhibitors using laboratory animals has established a strong foundation for advancing the new inhibitors to clinical trials.",

Our ongoing studies of the post-translational modifications that regulate Foxp3 demonstrated that the histone/protein acetyltransferase, Tip60, plays a dominant role in promoting acetylation, dimerization and function in Treg cells. We now show that the ubiquitin-specific protease, Usp7, controls Treg function largely by stabilizing the expression and promoting the multimerization of Tip60 and Foxp3. Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of Usp7 impairs Foxp3\u00a0+ Treg suppressive functions, while conventional T cell responses remain intact. As a result, pharmacologic inhibitors of Usp7 can limit tumor growth in immunocompetent mice, and promote the efficacy of antitumor vaccines and immune checkpoint therapy with anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody in murine models. Hence, pharmacologic therapy with Usp7 inhibitors may have an important role in future cancer immunotherapy.",

Here, we analyzed a large panel of lncRNA candidates with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) CRC dataset, and identified H19 as the most significant lncRNA associated with CRC patient survival. We further validated such association in two independent CRC cohorts. H19 silencing blocked G1-S transition, reduced cell proliferation, and inhibited cell migration. We profiled gene expression changes to gain mechanism insight of H19 function. Transcriptome data analysis revealed not only previously identified mechanisms such as Let-7 regulation by H19, but also RB1-E2F1 function and \u03b2-catenin activity as essential upstream regulators mediating H19 function. Our experimental data showed that H19 affects phosphorylation of RB1 protein by regulating gene expression of CDK4 and CCND1. We further demonstrated that reduced CDK8 expression underlies changes of \u03b2-catenin activity, and identified that H19 interacts with macroH2A, an essential regulator of CDK8 gene transcription. However, the relevance of H19-macroH2A interaction in CDK8 regulation remains to be experimentally determined. We further explored the clinical relevance of above mechanisms in clinical samples, and showed that combined analysis of H19 with its targets improved prognostic value of H19 in CRC.",

However, the associations between DNMTs variations and gastric cancer (GC) risk were still conflicting. We aimed to assess the effect of DNMTs polymorphisms on the susceptibility to GC.Firstly, we did a meta-analysis for 7 SNPs (rs16999593, rs2228611, rs8101866 in DNMT1, rs1550117, rs13420827 in DNMT3A, rs1569686, rs2424913 in DNMT3B). Four genetic models (homozygote, heterozygote, dominant and recessive model) were used. Moreover, a meta-sensitivity and subgroup analysis was performed to clarify heterogeneity source. Lastly, 17 SNPs that couldn't be meta-analyzed were presented in a systematic review.20 studies were included, 13 studies could be meta-analyzed and 7 ones could not. Firstly, a meta-analysis on 13 studies (3959 GC cases and 5992 controls) for 7 SNPs showed that GC risk increased in rs16999593 (heterozygote model: OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.14\u20131.61; dominant model: OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.15\u20131.60) and rs1550117 (homozygote model: OR 2.03, 95%CI 1.38\u20133.00; dominant model: OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.01\u20131.42; recessive model: OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.33\u20132.89) but decreased in rs1569686 (dominant model: OR 0.74, 95%CI 0.61\u20130.90). The remaining SNPs were not found associated with GC risk. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis indicated that for rs1550117 and rs1569686, the significant associations were particularly found in people from Chinese Jiangsu province (rs1550117, OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.25\u20132.51; rs1569686, OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.36\u20130.64) and that PCR-RFLP was a sensitive method to discover significant associations (rs1550117, OR 1.77, 95%CI 1.25\u20132.51; rs1569686, OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.37\u20130.65). Lastly, a systematic review on 7 studies for 17 SNPs suggested that rs36012910, rs7560488 and rs6087990 might have a potential effect on GC initiation.This meta-analysis demonstrated that rs16999593 and rs1550117 could contribute to GC risk and that rs1569686 might be a protective factor against gastric carcinogenesis. By using these SNPs as biomarkers, it is feasible to estimate the risk of acquiring GC and thus formulate timely preventive strategy.",

     "abstract": "In addition to oncogenic drivers, signaling nodes can critically modulate cancer-related cellular networks to strength tumor hallmarks. We identify G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) as a relevant player in breast cancer. GRK2 is up-regulated in breast cancer cell lines, in spontaneous tumors in mice, and in a proportion of invasive ductal carcinoma patients. Increased GRK2 functionality promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) leading to de-acetylation of the Prolyl Isomerase Pin1, a central modulator of tumor progression, thereby enhancing its stability and functional interaction with key mitotic regulators. Interestingly, a correlation between GRK2 expression and Pin1 levels and de-acetylation status is detected in breast cancer patients. Activation of the HDAC6-Pin1 axis underlies the positive effects of GRK2 on promoting growth factor signaling, cellular proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in both luminal and basal breast cancer cells. Enhanced GRK2 levels promote tumor growth in mice, whereas GRK2 down-modulation sensitizes cells to therapeutic drugs and abrogates tumor formation. Our data suggest that GRK2 acts as an important onco-modulator by strengthening the functionality of key players in breast tumorigenesis such as HDAC6 and Pin1.",

Here, we assessed cellular metabolic reprogramming of mammary carcinoma cells in response to increased collagen matrix density using an in vitro 3D model. Our initial observations demonstrated changes in functional metabolism in both normal mammary epithelial cells and mammary carcinoma cells in response to changes in matrix density. Further, mammary carcinoma cells grown in high density collagen matrices displayed decreased oxygen consumption and glucose metabolism via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle compared to cells cultured in low density matrices. Despite decreased glucose entry into the TCA cycle, levels of glucose uptake, cell viability, and ROS were not different between high and low density matrices. Interestingly, under high density conditions the contribution of glutamine as a fuel source to drive the TCA cycle was significantly enhanced. These alterations in functional metabolism mirrored significant changes in the expression of metabolic genes involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the serine synthesis pathway. This study highlights the broad importance of the collagen microenvironment to cellular expression profiles, and shows that changes in density of the collagen microenvironment can modulate metabolic shifts of cancer cells.",

Although the hazardous effect of a high fat diet (HFD) upon liver structure and function is well recognized, whether the co-presence of high protein intake contributes to, or protects against, HF-induced hepatic injury remains unclear. Increased intake of branched chain amino acids (BCAA, essential amino acids compromising 20% of total protein intake) reduces body weight. However, elevated circulating BCAA is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and injury. The mechanisms responsible for this quandary remain unknown; the role of BCAA in HF-induced liver injury is unclear. Utilizing HFD or HFD\u00a0+\u00a0BCAA models, we demonstrated BCAA supplementation attenuated HFD-induced weight gain, decreased fat mass, activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inhibited hepatic lipogenic enzymes, and reduced hepatic triglyceride content. However, BCAA caused significant hepatic damage in HFD mice, evidenced by exacerbated hepatic oxidative stress, increased hepatic apoptosis, and elevated circulation hepatic enzymes. Compared to solely HFD-fed animals, plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA) in the HFD\u00a0+\u00a0BCAA group are significantly further increased, due largely to AMPK\u03b12-mediated adipocyte lipolysis. Lipolysis inhibition normalized plasma FFA levels, and improved insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly, blocking lipolysis failed to abolish BCAA-induced liver injury. Mechanistically, hepatic mTOR activation by BCAA inhibited lipid-induced hepatic autophagy, increased hepatic apoptosis, blocked hepatic FFA/triglyceride conversion, and increased hepatocyte susceptibility to FFA-mediated lipotoxicity. These data demonstrated that BCAA reduces HFD-induced body weight, at the expense of abnormal lipolysis and hyperlipidemia, causing hepatic lipotoxicity. Furthermore, BCAA directly exacerbate hepatic lipotoxicity by reducing lipogenesis and inhibiting autophagy in the hepatocyte.",

A post-hoc factorial analysis was significant for B420 (\u2212\u00a04.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002 vs. Placebo). Changes in fat mass were most pronounced in the abdominal region, and were reflected by similar changes in waist circumference. B420 and LU\u00a0+\u00a0B420 also significantly reduced energy intake compared to Placebo. Changes in blood zonulin levels and hsCRP were associated with corresponding changes in trunk fat mass in the LU\u00a0+\u00a0B420 group and in the overall population. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events.This clinical trial demonstrates that a probiotic product with or without dietary fiber controls body fat mass.

     "abstract": "Neovascular eye diseases including retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy and age-related-macular-degeneration are major causes of blindness. Fenofibrate treatment in type 2 diabetes patients reduces progression of diabetic retinopathy independent of its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b1 agonist lipid lowering effect. The mechanism is unknown. Fenofibrate binds to and inhibits cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP)2C with higher affinity than to PPAR\u03b1. CYP2C metabolizes \u03c9-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). While \u03c9-3 LCPUFA products from other metabolizing pathways decrease retinal and choroidal neovascularization, CYP2C products of both \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs promote angiogenesis. We hypothesized that fenofibrate inhibits retinopathy by reducing CYP2C \u03c9-3 LCPUFA (and \u03c9-6 LCPUFA) pro-angiogenic metabolites. Fenofibrate reduced retinal and choroidal neovascularization in PPAR\u03b1-/-mice and augmented \u03c9-3 LCPUFA protection via CYP2C inhibition. Fenofibrate suppressed retinal and choroidal neovascularization in mice overexpressing human CYP2C8 in endothelial cells and reduced plasma levels of the pro-angiogenic \u03c9-3 LCPUFA CYP2C8 product, 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid. 19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid reversed fenofibrate-induced suppression of angiogenesis ex vivo and suppression of endothelial cell functions in vitro. In summary fenofibrate suppressed retinal and choroidal neovascularization via CYP2C inhibition as well as by acting as an agonist of PPAR\u03b1. Fenofibrate augmented the overall protective effects of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs on neovascular eye diseases.",

Here we report that PGRN binds directly to GCase and its deficiency results in aggregation of GCase and its receptor LIMP2. Mass spectrometry approaches identified HSP70 as a GCase/LIMP2 complex-associated protein upon stress, with PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. Additionally, 98 amino acids of C-terminal PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase and HSP70. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and animal models. These findings not only demonstrate that PGRN is a co-chaperone of HSP70 and plays an important role in GCase lysosomal localization, but may also provide new therapeutic interventions for lysosomal storage diseases, in particular GD.",

A recurrent mutation in CACNA1H (coding for Cav3.2) was identified in a familial form of early onset PA. Here we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with different types of PA to identify new susceptibility genes.Four different heterozygous germline CACNA1H variants were identified. A de novo Cav3.2 p.Met1549Ile variant was found in early onset PA and multiplex developmental disorder. Cav3.2 p.Ser196Leu and p.Pro2083Leu were found in two patients with FH, and p.Val1951Glu was identified in one patient with APA. Electrophysiological analysis of mutant Cav3.2 channels revealed significant changes in the Ca2\u00a0+ current properties for all mutants, suggesting a gain of function phenotype. Transfections of mutant Cav3.2 in H295R-S2 cells led to increased aldosterone production and/or expression of genes coding for steroidogenic enzymes after K+ stimulation. Identification of CACNA1H mutations associated with early onset PA, FH, and APA suggests that CACNA1H might be a susceptibility gene predisposing to PA with different phenotypic presentations, opening new perspectives for genetic diagnosis and management of patients with PA.",

In contrast, disruption of the intestinal microbiota by a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (AVNM) led to the attenuation of atherosclerosis by suppressing B2 cells, despite the persistence of serum lipid abnormalities. Furthermore, pharmacological depletion of B2 cells with an anti-B2-cell surface CD23 antibody also attenuated commensal microbe-induced atherosclerosis. Moreover, expression analysis of TLR-signaling-related genes in the activated B2 cell subsets, assessed using the Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array, confirmed activation of the B2-cell autoantibody-production axis, which was associated with an increased capacity of B2 cells to bind to intestinal microbiota. Together, our findings reveal the critical role of commensal microbe-specific activation of B2 cells in the development of atherogenesis through lipid metabolism-independent mechanisms.",

Bacterial products significantly up-regulated PK2, implying that infection induces PK2 over-expression. PK2 promoted KC and macrophage to produce interleukin-1 (IL-1), the central player of inflammation and psoriasis, which acts on adjacent fibroblast to induce inflammatory cascades and KC hyperproliferation. IL-1 feeds back on macrophages to induce PK2 production to perpetuate PK2-IL-1 positive feedback loop. PK2 also promoted angiogenesis, another psoriatic symptom. In mouse models, PK2 over-expression aggravated psoriasis while its knock-down inhibited pathological development. The results indicate that PK2 over-production perpetuates psoriatic symptoms by creating PK-2-IL-1 vicious loop. PK2 is a central player in psoriasis and a promising psoriasis-specific target.",

Moreover, 5/6Nx Clk/Clk mice, which carry homozygous mutations in the gene encoding circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), did not exhibit aggravation of apoptosis or induction of F4/80-positive cells. The renal expression of G0s2 in wild-type 5/6Nx mice was important for the transactivation of Ccl2 by p65. These pathologies were ameliorated by G0s2 knockdown. Furthermore, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of G0s2 expression was identified by high-throughput chemical screening, and the inhibitor suppressed renal inflammation in 5/6Nx mice.

Ingestion of Nef-containing plasma extracellular vesicles (pEV) from ART patients by primary immune cells, but also Nef expression, induced intracellular proTNF cleavage and secretion of vesicular TNF endosomes. Key event was the Nef-mediated routing of the TNF-converting enzyme ADAM17 into Rab4\u00a0+ early endosomes and the Rab27\u00a0+ secretory pathway. Analysis of lymph-node tissue by multi-epitope-ligand-cartography (MELC) confirmed a vesicular TNF secretion phenotype that co-localized with persistent Nef expression, and implicated Notch1 as an essential co-factor.

We here report the crystal structure and a biochemical characterization of the ClfA/tefibazumab (Fab) complex. The epitope for tefibazumab is located to the \u201ctop\u201d of the N3 subdomain of ClfA and partially overlaps with a previously unidentified second binding site for fibrinogen.

Although tefibazumab binds ClfA with high affinity we observe a modest IC50 value for the inhibition of fibrinogen binding to the MSCRAMM. This observation, paired with a common natural occurring variant of ClfA that is not effectively recognized by the mAb, may partly explain the modest effect tefibazumab showed in the initial clinic trail.

Gametocyte prevalence at day 7 was 37.0% (54/146; 95% CI 29.2\u201345.4), 19.0% (27/142; 95% CI 12.9\u201326.4), 17.2% (25/145; 95% CI 11.0\u201323.5) and 10.6% (15/141; 95% CI 6.1\u201316.9) in the DHAP alone, 0.20\u00a0mg/kg, 0.40\u00a0mg/kg, and 0.75\u00a0mg/kg PQ arms, respectively. The main adverse events reported include headache (130/471, 27.6%), cough (73/471, 15.5%), history of fever (61/471, 13.0%) and abdominal pain (57/471, 12.1%). There were five serious adverse events however, none was related to the interventions.A single course of PQ significantly reduces gametocyte carriage in malaria-infected asymptomatic, G6PD-normal individuals without increasing the risk of clinical anemia. The limited number of successful mosquito infections suggests that post-treatment transmission potential in this asymptomatic population is low.",

Patients randomly received autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (MNC) or placebo injections intradermally. Follow-up examinations were at 4, 8\u00a0weeks and 2\u00a0years. The primary endpoint was the volume achieved in relation to the designed size of the expander (expansion index, EI). Secondary endpoints were surface area, thickness and texture of expanded skin.

Tissue-engineered bone grafts created by in vitro manipulation of bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors have been considered potential treatments for bone defect reconstruction. However, a significant gap remains between experimental successes and clinical translation. An emerging strategy for bridging this gap is using the in vivo bioreactor principle and flap prefabrication techniques. This principle focuses on using the body as a bioreactor to cultivate the traditional triad (bioscaffolds, seed cells, and growth factors) and leveraging the body's self-regenerative capacity to regenerate new tissue. Additionally, flap prefabrication techniques allow the regenerated bone grafts to be transferred as prefabricated bone flaps for bone defect reconstruction. Such a strategy has been used successfully for reconstructing critical-sized bone defects in animal models and humans. Here, we highlight this concept and provide some perspective on how to translate current knowledge into clinical practice.",

Due to this discovery, we searched for some AR enhancers to increase the efficacy of Sorafenib chemotherapy, and identified the microRNA (miR)-367-3p, whose expression is positively correlated with AR expression in advanced HCC, as an HCC metastasis suppressor. Combining miR-367-3p with Sorafenib showed better efficacy to suppress HCC cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism dissection revealed that miR-367-3p could increase AR expression via directly targeting the 3\u2032UTR of MDM2 to decrease MDM2 protein expression. The resultant increase of AR expression might then promote the expression of FKBP5 and PHLPP, thus dephosphorylating and inactivating AKT and ERK, to suppress the HCC cell invasion. Interestingly, the suppression of pAKT by miR-367-3p could subsequently attenuate the phosphorylation of AR and MDM2, giving rise to additional enhancement of AR protein expression, effectively forming a positive feedback loop. Together, these results suggest that miR-367-3p may function as an AR enhancer to increase Sorafenib chemotherapy efficacy via altering the MDM2/AR/FKBP5/PHLPP/(pAKT and pERK) signals to better suppress HCC metastasis. Successful development of this newly combined chemotherapy in the future may help us to better suppress the HCC metastasis at late stages.",

We examined the association between the serum TGF-\u03b21 concentrations and death from HCC to determine whether the serum TGF-\u03b21 can be a predictor of incident HCC.We conducted a nested case-controlled study of participants in the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk.

ANXA2 knockdown in primary glioblastoma stem cell-like cultures suppressed known mesenchymal master regulators, and abrogated cell proliferation and invasion.

We reveal that platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) specifically drives dedifferentiation in PTC by disrupting the transcriptional activity of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1). PDGFR\u03b1 activation dephosphorylates TTF1 consequently shifting the localization of this transcription factor from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. TTF1 is required for follicular cell development and disrupting its function abrogates thyroglobulin production and sodium iodide transport. PDGFR\u03b1 also promotes a more invasive and migratory cell phenotype with a dramatic increase in xenograft tumor formation. In patient tumors we confirm that nuclear TTF1 expression is inversely proportional to PDGFR\u03b1 levels. Patients exhibiting PDGFR\u03b1 at time of diagnosis are three times more likely to exhibit nodal metastases and are 18 times more likely to recur within 5\u00a0years than those patients lacking PDGFR\u03b1 expression. Moreover, high levels of PDGFR\u03b1 and low levels of nuclear TTF1 predict resistance to radioactive iodine therapy. We demonstrate in SCID xenografts that focused PDGFR\u03b1 blockade restores iodide transport and decreases tumor burden by >\u00a050%. Focused PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitors, combined with radioactive iodine, represent an additional avenue for treating patients with aggressive variants of PTC.",

External validation was done on an external data set of 641 patients from Kyorin University Hospital.There were no significant differences in RFS and PFS rates between the groups according to EORTC risk classification. We constructed a novel risk model predicting recurrence that classified patients into three groups using four independent prognostic factors to predict tumour recurrence based on Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

We aimed to validate these subtypes in several clinical cohorts and identify signature immunohistochemical markers that would permit simple and cost-effective classification of the disease in primary care centers.We analyzed genomic expression profiles of bladder cancer in three cohorts of fresh frozen tumor samples: MD Anderson (n\u00a0=\u00a0132), Lund (n\u00a0=\u00a0308), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n\u00a0=\u00a0408) to validate the expression signatures of luminal and basal subtypes and relate them to clinical follow-up data. We also used an MD Anderson cohort of archival bladder tumor samples (n\u00a0=\u00a089) and a parallel tissue microarray to identify immunohistochemical markers that permitted the molecular classification of bladder cancer.Bladder cancers could be assigned to two candidate intrinsic molecular subtypes referred to here as luminal and basal in all of the datasets analyzed. Luminal tumors were characterized by the expression signature similar to the intermediate/superficial layers of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of PPAR\u03b3 target genes and the enrichment for FGFR3, ELF3, CDKN1A, and TSC1 mutations. In addition, luminal tumors were characterized by the overexpression of E-Cadherin, HER2/3, Rab-25, and Src. Basal tumors showed the expression signature similar to the basal layer of normal urothelium. They showed the upregulation of p63 target genes, the enrichment for TP53 and RB1 mutations, and overexpression of CD49, Cyclin B1, and EGFR. Survival analyses showed that the muscle-invasive basal bladder cancers were more aggressive when compared to luminal cancers. The immunohistochemical expressions of only two markers, luminal (GATA3) and basal (KRT5/6), were sufficient to identify the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer with over 90% accuracy.The molecular subtypes of bladder cancer have distinct clinical behaviors and sensitivities to chemotherapy, and a simple two-marker immunohistochemical classifier can be used for prognostic and therapeutic stratification.U.S. National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Health.",

In the current study, we investigated neural responses during click stimulation by BOLD signals.We acquired BOLD responses elicited by click trains of 20, 30, 40 and 80-Hz frequencies from 15 patients with acute episode schizophrenia (AESZ), 14 symptom-severity-matched patients with non-acute episode schizophrenia (NASZ), and 24 healthy controls (HC), assessed via a standard general linear-model-based analysis.

In addition, enhanced 80-Hz ASSR-BOLD signals were associated with more severe auditory hallucination experiences in AESZ participants. The present results indicate that neural over activation occurs during 80-Hz auditory stimulation of the left auditory cortex in individuals with acute state schizophrenia.

ZIKV initially targeted the intestinal tracts, spleen, and parotid glands, and retained in spleen and lymph nodes till 10\u00a0days post infection. ZIKV-specific immune responses were readily induced in all inoculated animals. The non-human primate model described here provides a valuable platform to study ZIKV pathogenesis and to evaluate vaccine and therapeutics.",

Infection with one serotype results in high titers of cross-reactive antibodies produced by plasmablasts, protecting temporarily against all serotypes, but impairing protective immunity in subsequent infections. To understand the development of these plasmablasts, we analyzed virus-specific B cell properties in patients during acute disease and at convalescence. Plasmablasts were unrelated to classical memory cells expanding in the blood during early recovery. We propose that only a small subset of memory B cells is activated as plasmablasts during repeat infection and that plasmablast responses are not representative of the memory B cell repertoire after dengue infection.",

We defined six HCV cascade of care stages: 1) estimated population prevalence; 2) HCV diagnosed; 3) HCV RNA tested; 4) genotyped; 5) initiated treatment; and 6) achieved sustained virologic response (SVR).We estimated that 73,203 people were HCV antibody positive in BC in 2012 (undiagnosed: 18,301, 25%; diagnosed: 54,902, 75%). Of these, 56%(40,656) had HCV RNA testing; 34%(26,300) were genotyped; 12%( 8532 ) had received interferon-based therapy and 7%(5197) had SVR. Males, older birth cohorts, and HBV coinfected were less likely to undergo HCV RNA testing. Among those with chronic HCV infection, 32% had received liver-related care. Retention in liver care was more likely in those with HIV, cirrhosis, and drug/alcohol use and less likely in males and HBV coinfected.Although there are gaps in HCV RNA testing and genotyping after HCV diagnosis, the major gap in the cascade of care was low treatment initiation.

In this study, we isolated antibodies from an HIV-1-infected individual that targeted the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) that may have selected single-residue changes in viral variants in the MPER that resulted in neutralization sensitivity to antibodies targeting distal epitopes on the HIV-1 Env. Similarly, a single change in the MPER in a second virus from another infected-individual also conferred enhanced neutralization sensitivity. These gp41 single-residue changes thus transformed tier-2 viruses into tier-1 viruses that were sensitive to vaccine-elicited tier-1 neutralizing antibodies. These data demonstrate that Env amino acid changes within the MPER bnAb epitope of naturally-selected escape viruses can increase neutralization sensitivity to multiple types of neutralizing antibodies, and underscore the critical importance of the MPER for maintaining the integrity of the tier-2 HIV-1 trimer.",

     "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved a sophisticated strategy to conceal conserved epitopes of its envelope glycoproteins (Env) recognized by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating antibodies. These antibodies, which are present in the sera of most HIV-1-infected individuals, preferentially recognize Env in its CD4-bound conformation. Accordingly, recent studies showed that small CD4-mimetics (CD4mc) able to \u201cpush\u201d Env into this conformation sensitize HIV-1-infected cells to ADCC mediated by HIV\u00a0+ sera. Here we test whether CD4mc also expose epitopes recognized by anti-cluster A monoclonal antibodies such as A32, thought to be responsible for the majority of ADCC activity present in HIV\u00a0+ sera and linked to decreased HIV-1 transmission in the RV144 trial. We made the surprising observation that CD4mc are unable to enhance recognition of HIV-1-infected cells by this family of antibodies in the absence of antibodies such as 17b, which binds a highly conserved CD4-induced epitope overlapping the co-receptor binding site (CoRBS). Our results indicate that CD4mc initially open the trimeric Env enough to allow the binding of CoRBS antibodies but not anti-cluster A antibodies. CoRBS antibody binding further opens the trimeric Env, allowing anti-cluster A antibody interaction and sensitization of infected cells to ADCC. Therefore, ADCC responses mediated by cluster A antibodies in HIV-positive sera involve a sequential opening of the Env trimer on the surface of HIV-1-infected cells. The understanding of the conformational changes required to expose these vulnerable Env epitopes might be important in the design of new strategies aimed at fighting HIV-1.",

To pharmacologically confirm the role of the stringent response in abscess formation, a cationic peptide that causes rapid degradation of the stringent response mediator, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), was employed. The therapeutic application of this peptide strongly inhibited lesion formation in mice infected with Gram-positive MRSA and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, we provide insights into the mechanisms governing abscess formation and a paradigm for treating multidrug resistant cutaneous abscesses.",

By application of the trained model to the German patients we observed comparable discriminatory properties despite lower population-specific rare SNV load. Furthermore, rare SNVs in genes of cell signaling and innate immunity related pathways were identified as classifiers discriminating between the sepsis courses.Sepsis patients with favorable disease course after sepsis, even in the case of unfavorable preconditions, seem to be affected more often by rare deleterious SNVs in cell signaling and innate immunity related pathways, suggesting a protective role of impairments in these processes against a poor disease course.",

Interestingly, we observed dynamic alterations in gut microbiota that were consistent with the changes in the metabolic phenotype induced by H. pylori and HFD.

     "abstract": "Xerostomia is a chief complaint of patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS). However, newer proposals for SS classification remove xerostomia and hyposalivation from the criteria list. Given these developments and the importance of patient-centered research outcomes, we sought to evaluate the utility of patient-reported xerostomia with implications for classification criteria, and clinical trials targeting SS treatment modalities.A nested case-control study was designed within The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research/National Institutes of Health (NIDCR/NIH) SS Cohort - one of the largest SS cohorts in the US. Clinical characteristics of those with and without xerostomia in SS and other salivary gland dysfunctions were compared. Several analytical methods were employed, including multivariable logistic regression modeling.The NIDCR/NIH Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome Clinic has an open cohort with ongoing enrollment since 1984. This open cohort comprised of 2046 participants by August 27, 2015. Baseline data of 701 SS, 355 Sicca, and 247 ISS participants within the source cohort were analyzed. Xerostomia was highest among SS participants (87.4%, 95% CI: 84.8%\u201389.8%) compared to Sicca (72.4%, 95% CI: 67.4%\u201377.0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and ISS groups (38.1%, 95% CI: 32.0%\u201344.4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Those with xerostomia were more likely to have SS than Sicca/ISS (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.98, 95% CI: 3.78\u20136.56). The ability of xerostomia to screen for SS among those with salivary gland dysfunction was higher than screening for Sicca/ISS. Screening diagnostics of xerostomia were of greater utility compared to hyposalivation. After adjusting for confounding in multivariable modeling, SS participants with xerostomia were more likely to be White (Black/African Americans (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.23\u20130.68, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and Asians (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.96, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.038) were less likely to have xerostomia compared to Whites), have dry eye symptoms for >\u00a03\u00a0months (OR: 5.80, 95% CI: 3.62\u20139.28, p-value <\u00a00.001), a lower Van Bijsterveld score (OR: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.34\u20130.90, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.017), a lower stimulated salivary flow rate (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.06\u20132.65, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.028), a focus score of >\u00a02 (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.20\u20133.09, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and salivary gland swelling (OR: 49.39, 95% CI: 2.02\u20131206.30, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.017). Age, gender, fatigue, pain, anxiety, and autoantibodies were not significantly associated with xerostomia.Findings from this study indicate that patient-reported xerostomia is highly prevalent among SS patients and is associated with several clinical phenotypes of this complex syndrome, thereby making it an important indicator of SS. The evidence also suggests that xerostomia is not limited to low salivary flow but might be reflective of compositional changes of saliva. Consequently, these findings suggest the need to consider xerostomia in the development of SS classification criteria and in patient-centered outcomes research in SS intervention trials.This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) Grant # DE000704-15.

SMAD3 is part of the SMAD2/3/4 transcription factor, essential for TGF-\u03b2-activated transcription.

Here, we examined aneurysm formation and progression in Smad3\u2212/\u2212 animals.Smad3\u2212/\u2212 animals developed aortic aneurysms rapidly, resulting in premature death. Aortic wall immunohistochemistry showed no increase in extracellular matrix and collagen accumulation, nor loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) but instead revealed medial elastin disruption and adventitial inflammation. Remarkably, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) were not activated in VSMCs, but rather specifically in inflammatory areas. Although Smad3\u2212/\u2212 aortas showed increased nuclear pSmad2 and pErk, indicating TGF-\u03b2 receptor activation, downstream TGF-\u03b2-activated target genes were not upregulated. Increased pSmad2 and pErk staining in pre-aneurysmal Smad3\u2212/\u2212 aortas implied that aortic damage and TGF-\u03b2 receptor-activated signaling precede aortic inflammation. Finally, impaired downstream TGF-\u03b2 activated transcription resulted in increased Smad3\u2212/\u2212 VSMC proliferation.Smad3 deficiency leads to imbalanced activation of downstream genes, no activation of MMPs in VSMCs, and immune responses resulting in rapid aortic wall dilatation and rupture. Our findings uncover new possibilities for treatment of SMAD3 patients; instead of targeting TGF-\u03b2 signaling, immune suppression may be more beneficial.",

Losses in confidence in vaccines and immunization programmes can lead to vaccine reluctance and refusal, risking disease outbreaks and challenging immunization goals in high- and low-income settings. National and international immunization stakeholders have called for better monitoring of vaccine confidence to identify emerging concerns before they evolve into vaccine confidence crises.We perform a large-scale, data-driven study on worldwide attitudes to immunizations. This survey \u2013 which we believe represents the largest survey on confidence in immunization to date \u2013 examines perceptions of vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness, and religious compatibility among 65,819 individuals across 67 countries. Hierarchical models are employed to probe relationships between individual- and country-level socio-economic factors and vaccine attitudes obtained through the four-question, Likert-scale survey.Overall sentiment towards vaccinations is positive across all 67 countries, however there is wide variability between countries and across world regions. Vaccine-safety related sentiment is particularly negative in the European region, which has seven of the ten least confident countries, with 41% of respondents in France and 36% of respondents in Bosnia & Herzegovina reporting that they disagree that vaccines are safe (compared to a global average of 13%). The oldest age group (65+) and Roman Catholics (amongst all faiths surveyed) are associated with positive views on vaccine sentiment, while the Western Pacific region reported the highest level of religious incompatibility with vaccines. Countries with high levels of schooling and good access to health services are associated with lower rates of positive sentiment, pointing to an emerging inverse relationship between vaccine sentiments and socio-economic status.Regular monitoring of vaccine attitudes \u2013 coupled with monitoring of local immunization rates \u2013 at the national and sub-national levels can identify populations with declining confidence and acceptance. These populations should be prioritized to further investigate the drivers of negative sentiment and to inform appropriate interventions to prevent adverse public health outcomes.",

A number of factors related to the collection and storage of samples may affect the biomolecular composition. We have studied the effect of long-time freezer storage, chronological age at sampling, season and month of the year and on the abundance levels of 108 proteins in 380 plasma samples collected from 106 Swedish women. Storage time affected 18 proteins and explained 4.8\u201334.9% of the observed variance. Chronological age at sample collection after adjustment for storage-time affected 70 proteins and explained 1.1\u201333.5% of the variance. Seasonal variation had an effect on 15 proteins and month (number of sun hours) affected 36 proteins and explained up to 4.5% of the variance after adjustment for storage-time and age. The results show that freezer storage time and collection date (month and season) exerted similar effect sizes as age on the protein abundance levels. This implies that information on the sample handling history, in particular storage time, should be regarded as equally prominent covariates as age or gender and need to be included in epidemiological studies involving protein levels.",

The vaccine contains recombinant fusion proteins consisting of allergen-derived peptides and the hepatitis B surface protein domain preS as immunological carrier.We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled AIT study to determine safety, clinical efficacy and immunological mechanism of three subcutaneous injections of three BM32 doses adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide versus aluminum hydroxide (placebo) applied monthly to grass pollen allergic patients (n\u00a0=\u00a070). Primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in total nasal symptom score (TNSS) through grass pollen chamber exposure before treatment and 4\u00a0weeks after the last injection. Secondary clinical endpoints were total ocular symptom score (TOSS) and allergen-specific skin response evaluated by titrated skin prick testing (SPT) at the same time points. Treatment-related side effects were evaluated as safety endpoints. Changes in allergen-specific antibody, cellular and cytokine responses were measured in patients before and after treatment.Sixty-eight patients completed the trial. TNSS significantly decreased with mean changes of \u2212\u00a01.41 (BM32/20\u00a0\u03bcg) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and \u2212\u00a01.34 (BM32/40\u00a0\u03bcg) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) whereas mean changes in the BM32/10\u00a0\u03bcg and placebo group were not significant. TOSS and SPT reactions showed a dose-dependent decrease. No systemic immediate type side effects were observed. Only few grade 1 systemic late phase reactions occurred in BM32 treated patients. The number of local injection site reactions was similar in actively and placebo-treated patients. BM32 induced highly significant allergen-specific IgG responses (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) but no allergen-specific IgE. Allergen-induced basophil activation was reduced in BM32 treated patients and addition of therapy-induced IgG significantly suppressed T cell activation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0063).The B cell epitope-based recombinant grass pollen allergy vaccine BM32 is well tolerated and few doses are sufficient to suppress immediate allergic reactions as well as allergen-specific T cell responses via a selective induction of allergen-specific IgG antibodies.

This mutual regulation between BMP4 and estrogen/ER\u03b1 signaling may also happen in adipose tissue of women, since the BMP4 level significantly increased after menopause, and was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI).

Here, we compared the CTC detection sensitivity and the prognostic value of FCMC with CellSearch in breast cancer patients. FCMC was validated in preclinical studies using spike-in samples and in blood samples from 20 healthy donors and 22 breast cancer patients in this study. Using spike-in samples, a statistically higher detection rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) of MDA-MB-231 cells and an equivalent detection rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.497) of MCF-7 cells were obtained with FCMC in comparison with CellSearch.

The CTC number detected using FCMC was significantly higher than that using CellSearch (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00037). CTC numbers obtained using either FCMC or CellSearch had prognostic value, as assessed by progression free survival.

     "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer exhibits diverse and rapidly evolving intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity. Patients with similar clinical presentations often display distinct tumor responses to standard of care (SOC) therapies. Genome landscape studies indicate that EGFR/HER2/RAS \u201cpathway\u201d activation is highly prevalent in malignant breast cancers. The identification of therapy-responsive and prognostic biomarkers is paramount important to stratify patients and guide therapies in clinical oncology and personalized medicine.In this study, we analyzed matched pairs of tumor specimens collected from 182 patients who received neoadjuvant systemic therapies (NST). Statistical analyses were conducted to determine whether EGFR/HER2/RAS pathway biomarkers and clinicopathological predictors, alone and in combination, are prognostic in breast cancer.SIAH and EGFR outperform ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 as two logical, sensitive and prognostic biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer. We found that increased SIAH and EGFR expression correlated with advanced pathological stage and aggressive molecular subtypes. Both SIAH expression post-NST and NST-induced changes in EGFR expression in invasive mammary tumors are associated with tumor regression and increased survival, whereas ER, PR, and HER2 were not. These results suggest that SIAH and EGFR are two prognostic biomarkers in breast cancer with lymph node metastases.The discovery of incorporating tumor heterogeneity-independent and growth-sensitive RAS pathway biomarkers, SIAH and EGFR, whose altered expression can be used to estimate therapeutic efficacy, detect emergence of resistant clones, forecast tumor regression, differentiate among partial responders, and predict patient survival in the neoadjuvant setting, has a clear clinical implication in personalizing breast cancer therapy.This work was supported by the Dorothy G.

The same high-risk genetic variants also predict nicotine dependence and delayed smoking cessation. It is unclear whether smoking cessation confers the same benefits in terms of lung cancer risk reduction for those who possess CHRNA5 risk variants versus those who do not.Meta-analyses examined the association between smoking cessation and lung cancer risk in 15 studies of individuals with European ancestry who possessed varying rs16969968 genotypes (N\u00a0=\u00a012,690 ever smokers, including 6988 cases of lung cancer and 5702 controls) in the International Lung Cancer Consortium.Smoking cessation (former vs. current smokers) was associated with a lower likelihood of lung cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.48, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.30\u20130.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0015).

The CHRNA5 rs16969968 risk genotype (AA) was associated with increased risk and earlier diagnosis for lung cancer, but the beneficial effects of smoking cessation were very similar in those with and without the risk genotype.We demonstrate that quitting smoking is highly beneficial in reducing lung cancer risks for smokers regardless of their CHRNA5 rs16969968 genetic risk status. Smokers with high-risk CHRNA5 genotypes, on average, can largely eliminate their elevated genetic risk for lung cancer by quitting smoking- cutting their risk of lung cancer in half and delaying its onset by 7\u00a0years for those who develop it. These results: 1) underscore the potential value of smoking cessation for all smokers, 2) suggest that CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotype affects lung cancer diagnosis through its effects on smoking, and 3) have potential value for framing preventive interventions for those who smoke.",

The expression of p16INK4a, a well-established senescence marker, was determined in T-cells before and 6\u00a0months after transplant. RNA sequencing was performed on paired samples from 8 patients pre- and post-cancer therapy. In patients undergoing allogeneic transplant, higher pre-transplant p16INK4a expression was associated with a greater number of prior cycles of chemotherapy received (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), prior autologous transplantation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and prior exposure to alkylating agents (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

Patients receiving autologous transplant experienced a larger increase in p16INK4a expression (3.1-fold increase, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) than allogeneic transplant recipients (1.9-fold increase, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004).

The rapid post-transfusion clearance of stored HbAS RBC is unrelated to macrophage-mediated uptake or intravascular hemolysis, but by enhanced sequestration in the spleen, kidney and liver. HbAS RBCs are intrinsically different from HbAA RBCs, with reduced membrane deformability as cells age in cold storage, leading to accelerated clearance of transfused HbAS RBCs by entrapment in organ microcirculation.The common genetic variant HbAS enhances RBC storage dysfunction and raises provocative questions about the use of HbAS RBCs at the limits of approved storage.",

It has been shown that epileptic seizures produce markedly increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain, and that NO induces Ca2\u00a0+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum via the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which occurs through S-nitrosylation of the intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ release channel. Here, we show that through genetic silencing of NO-induced activation of the RyR1 intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ release channel, neurons were rescued from seizure-dependent cell death. Furthermore, dantrolene, an inhibitor of RyR1, was protective against neurodegeneration caused by SE. These results demonstrate that NO-induced Ca2\u00a0+ release via RyR is involved in SE-induced neurodegeneration, and provide a rationale for the use of RyR1 inhibitors for the prevention of brain damage following SE.",

To gather data regarding the response of specific neuronal populations, we developed methodology for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to segregate and enrich specific cellular subtypes in the brain.

     "abstract": "Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification that facilitates protein-protein interaction. Two sulfated tyrosines (Tys173 and Tys177) were recently identified within the second variable (V2) loop of the major HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, and shown to contribute to stabilizing the intramolecular interaction between V2 and the third variable (V3) loop. Here, we report that tyrosine-sulfated peptides derived from V2 act as structural and functional mimics of the CCR5 N-terminus and potently block HIV-1 infection. Nuclear magnetic and surface plasmon resonance analyses indicate that a tyrosine-sulfated V2 peptide (pV2\u03b1-Tys) adopts a CCR5-like helical conformation and directly interacts with gp120 in a CD4-dependent fashion, competing with a CCR5 N-terminal peptide. Sulfated V2 mimics, but not their non-sulfated counterparts, inhibit HIV-1 entry and fusion by preventing coreceptor utilization, with the highly conserved C-terminal sulfotyrosine, Tys177, playing a dominant role. Unlike CCR5 N-terminal peptides, V2 mimics inhibit a broad range of HIV-1 strains irrespective of their coreceptor tropism, highlighting the overall structural conservation of the coreceptor-binding site in gp120. These results document the use of receptor mimicry by a retrovirus to occlude a key neutralization target site and provide leads for the design of therapeutic strategies against HIV-1.",

     "abstract": "Although licensed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are most efficacious in persons never infected with HPV, they also reduce infection and disease in previously infected subjects, indicating natural immunity is not entirely protective against HPV re-infection. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine the B cell memory elicited by HPV infection and evaluate whether vaccination merely boosts antibody (Ab) levels in previously infected subjects or also improves the quality of B cell memory. Toward this end, the memory B cells (Bmem) of five unvaccinated, HPV-seropositive subjects were isolated and characterized, and subject recall responses to a single HPV vaccine dose were analyzed. Vaccination boosted Ab levels 24- to 930-fold (median 77-fold) and Bmem numbers 3- to 27-fold (median 6-fold). In addition, Abs cloned from naturally elicited Bmem were generally non-neutralizing, whereas all those isolated following vaccination were neutralizing. Moreover, Ab and plasmablast responses indicative of memory recall responses were only observed in two subjects. These results suggest HPV vaccination augments both the magnitude and quality of natural immunity and demonstrate that sexually active persons could also benefit from HPV vaccination. This study may have important public policy implications, especially for the older \u2018catch-up\u2019 group within the vaccine's target population.",

All infections were confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA) probing with anti-flavivirus E antibody, and evaluation of cytopathic effects.ZIKV infected all six undifferentiated NB cell lines. In five out of six NB cell lines, between 90 and 70% cells were positive by IFA whereas for one cell line, CCL-127, ~\u00a080% of cells were positive for ZIKV as determined by IFA but showed persistent infection. Two differentiated cell lines, JFEN and T-268, were highly resistant to ZIKV with <\u00a01% of the cells being susceptible, as determined by IFA and confirmed by qRT-PCR. Two retinoic acid (RA)-induced NB partially differentiated cell lines showed no difference in permissiveness as compared to their undifferentiated mother cell lines.These findings strengthen the reported association between high incidences of microcephaly and ZIKV infection in newborns in Brazil. Our results suggest that the undifferentiated neurons are highly permissive to ZIKV infection, as one would expect during the early stages of neurogenesis in fetal brains; whereas differentiated neurons, representative of adult brain neurons, are relatively resistant to the virus, which explains the rare occurrence of neurological complications in adults infected with ZIKV. Our studies confirm the neurotropism of the ZIKV strain closely related to the current epidemic in Latin America.",

Other members of the Flavivirus genus, including West Nile virus (WNV), can cause encephalitis but were not demonstrated to cause microcephaly. It remains unclear whether Zika virus (ZIKV) and other flaviviruses may infect different cell populations in the developing neocortex and lead to distinct developmental defects. Here, we describe an assay to infect mouse E15 embryonic brain slices with ZIKV, WNV and dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV-4). We show that this tissue is able to support viral replication of ZIKV and WNV, but not DENV-4. Cell fate analysis reveals a remarkable tropism of ZIKV infection for neural stem cells. Closely related WNV displays a very different tropism of infection, with a bias towards neurons. We further show that ZIKV infection, but not WNV infection, impairs cell cycle progression of neural stem cells. Both viruses inhibited apoptosis at early stages of infection. This work establishes a powerful comparative approach to identify ZIKV-specific alterations in the developing neocortex and reveals specific preferential infection of neural stem cells by ZIKV.",

Early recognition of the pathogen and subsequent innate immune response play a vital role in disease susceptibility and outcome. Genetic variations in innate immune genes can alter the immune response and influence susceptibility and outcome of meningitis disease.Here we conducted a sequencing study of coding regions from 46 innate immune genes in 435 pneumococcal meningitis patients and 416 controls, to determine the role of genetic variation on pneumococcal meningitis susceptibility and disease outcome.Strongest signals for susceptibility were rs56078309 CXCL1 (p\u00a0=\u00a04.8e\u00a0\u2212\u00a004) and rs2008521 in CARD8 (p\u00a0=\u00a06.1e\u00a0\u2212\u00a004).

CRL4-CDT2 prevents re-initiation of DNA replication during the same cell cycle \u201crereplication\u201d through targeted degradation of CDT1, SET8 and p21 during S-phase of the cell cycle. We show that CDT2 is overexpressed in cutaneous melanoma and predicts poor overall and disease-free survival. CDT2 ablation inhibited a panel of melanoma cell lines through the induction of SET8- and p21-dependent DNA rereplication and senescence. Pevonedistat (MLN4924), a specific inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), inhibits the activity of cullin E3 ligases, thereby stabilizing a vast number of cullin substrates and resulting in cancer cell inhibition in vitro and tumor suppression in nude mice. We demonstrate that pevonedistat is effective at inhibiting the proliferation of melanoma cell lines in vitro through the induction of rereplication-dependent permanent growth arrest as well as through a transient, non-rereplication-dependent mechanism. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated heterozygous deletion of CDKN1A (encoding p21) or SET8 in melanoma cells demonstrated that the rereplication-mediated cytotoxicity of pevonedistat is mediated through preventing the degradation of p21 and SET8 and is essential for melanoma suppression in nude mice. By contrast, pevonedistat-induced transient growth suppression was independent of p21 or SET8, and insufficient to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Pevonedistat additionally synergized with the BRAF kinase inhibitor PLX4720 to inhibit BRAF melanoma, and suppressed PLX4720-resistant melanoma cells. These findings demonstrate that the CRL4-CDT2-SET8/p21 degradation axis is the primary target of inhibition by pevonedistat in melanoma and suggest that a broad patient population may benefit from pevonedistat therapy.The identification of new molecular targets and effective inhibitors is of utmost significance for the clinical management of melanoma. This study identifies CDT2, a substrate receptor for the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase, as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma. CDT2 is required for melanoma cell proliferation and inhibition of CRL4CDT2 by pevonedistat suppresses melanoma in vitro and in vivo through the induction of DNA rereplication and senescence through the stabilization of the CRL4CDT2 substrates p21 and SET8. Pevonedistat also synergizes with vemurafenib in vivo and suppresses vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells. These findings show a significant promise for targeting CRL4CDT2 therapeutically.",

However, it also revealed great heterogeneity, spanning from downregulation of blood vessel density and central necrosis to continued growth with new vasculature. Crucially, significantly upregulated pathways leading to resistance included glycolysis and pH adaptation, PI3K-Akt and immune checkpoint signaling, for which inhibitors exist, making a strong case to investigate such combinations.These findings support that anti-angiogenesis trials should incorporate initial enrichment of patients with high Ktrans, and a range of targeted therapeutic options to meet potential early resistance pathways. Multi-arm adaptive trials are ongoing using molecular markers for targeted agents, but our results suggest this needs to be further modified by much earlier adaptation when using drugs affecting the tumor microenvironment.",

We assessed the presence of TP53 mutations in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from the plasma of 51 SCLC cases and 123 non-cancer controls. We identified mutations using a pipeline specifically designed to accurately detect variants at very low fractions. We detected TP53 mutations in the cfDNA of 49% SCLC patients and 11.4% of non-cancer controls. When stratifying the 51 initial SCLC cases by stage, TP53 mutations were detected in the cfDNA of 35.7% early-stage and 54.1% late-stage SCLC patients. The results in the controls were further replicated in 10.8% of an independent series of 102 non-cancer controls. The detection of TP53 mutations in 11% of the 225 non-cancer controls suggests that somatic mutations in cfDNA among individuals without any cancer diagnosis is a common occurrence, and poses serious challenges for the development of ctDNA screening tests.",

Earlier detection has proved difficult because the molecular precursors involved in the natural history of the disease are unknown. To identify early driver mutations in ovarian cancer cells, we used dense whole genome sequencing of micrometastases and microscopic residual disease collected at three time points over three years from a single patient during treatment for high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). The functional and clinical significance of the identified mutations was examined using a combination of population-based whole genome sequencing, targeted deep sequencing, multi-center analysis of protein expression, loss of function experiments in an in-vivo reporter assay and mammalian models, and gain of function experiments in primary cultured fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells. We identified frequent mutations involving a 40\u00a0kb distal repressor region for the key stem cell differentiation gene SOX2. In the apparently normal FTE, the region was also mutated. This was associated with a profound increase in SOX2 expression (p\u00a0<\u00a02\u221216), which was not found in patients without cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0108). Importantly, we show that SOX2 overexpression in FTE is nearly ubiquitous in patients with HGSOCs (n\u00a0=\u00a0100), and common in BRCA1-BRCA2 mutation carriers (n\u00a0=\u00a071) who underwent prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy.

Ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4L targets LPA1 for its site specific ubiquitination and degradation in the lysosome. Nedd4L negatively regulates LPA-LPA1-mediated cytokine release. The stability of LPA1 is up-regulated by ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11), which deubiquitinates LPA1 and enhances LPA1-mediated pro-inflammatory effects. LPA1 is associated with USP11 in quiescent cells, while LPA treatment triggers LPA1 dis-association with USP11 and in turn binding to Nedd4L. Knockdown or inhibition of USP11 reduces LPA1 stability, levels of LPA1, and LPA1-CD14 interaction complex; thereby diminishing both LPA- and LPS-induced inflammatory responses and lung injury in preclinical murine models. Thus, our findings identify an ubiquitin E3 ligase and a deubiquitinating enzyme responsible for regulation of LPA1 stability and biological activities. This study provides potential targets for the development of anti-inflammatory molecules to lessen lung injury.",

They generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which protect against invading pathogens but are also associated with the development of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases and thrombosis. Here, we report that lactoferrin, one of the components of NETs, translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and markedly suppressed NETs release. Furthermore, exogenous lactoferrin shrunk the chromatin fibers found in released NETs, without affecting the generation of oxygen radicals, but this failed after chemical removal of the positive charge of lactoferrin, suggesting that charge-charge interactions between lactoferrin and NETs were required for this function. In a model of immune complex-induced NET formation in vivo, intravenous lactoferrin injection markedly reduced the extent of NET formation. These observations suggest that lactoferrin serves as an intrinsic inhibitor of NETs release into the circulation. Thus, lactoferrin may represent a therapeutic lead for controlling NETs release in autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases.",

We report herein that an EBV-specific microRNA (ebv-miR-BART13-3p) is significantly elevated in salivary glands (SGs) of pSS patients and we show that it targets stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1), a primary regulator of the store-operated Ca2\u00a0+ entry (SOCE) pathway that is essential for SG function, leading to loss of SOCE and Ca2\u00a0+-dependent activation of NFAT. Although EBV typically infects B cells and not salivary epithelial cells, ebv-miR-BART13-3p is present in both cell types in pSS SGs.

Here, methylation-specific primers and quantitative real-time PCR were used to study methylation patterns of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) gene, which is expressed primarily in myelin-producing oligodendrocytes (ODCs). MOG-DNA was demethylated in O4+ ODCs in mice and in DNA from human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) when compared with other cell types. In the cuprizone-fed mouse model of demyelination, ODC derived demethylated MOG cfDNA was increased in serum and was associated with tissue-wide demyelination, demonstrating the utility of demethylated MOG cfDNA as a biomarker of ODC death. Collected sera from patients with active (symptomatic) relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) demonstrated a higher signature of demethylated MOG cfDNA when compared with patients with inactive disease and healthy controls. Taken together, these results offer a minimally invasive approach to measuring ODC death in the blood of MS patients that may be used to monitor disease progression.",

However, little is known about how an apparently simple cervical spine injury can induce changes in cerebral processes. The present study was designed (1) to validate previous results showing alterations of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in cWAD, (2) to test if central hyperexcitability reflects changes in rCBF upon non-painful stimulation of the neck, and (3) to verify our hypothesis that the missing link in understanding the underlying pathophysiology could be the close interaction between the neck and midbrain structures. For this purpose, alterations of rCBF were explored in a case-control study using H215O positron emission tomography, where each group was exposed to four different conditions, including rest and different levels of non-painful electrical stimulation of the neck. rCBF was found to be elevated in patients with cWAD in the posterior cingulate and precuneus, and decreased in the superior temporal, parahippocampal, and inferior frontal gyri, the thalamus and the insular cortex when compared with rCBF in healthy controls. No differences in rCBF were observed between different levels of electrical stimulation. The alterations in regions directly involved with pain perception and interoceptive processing indicate that cWAD symptoms might be the consequence of a mismatch during the integration of information in brain regions involved in pain processing.",

     "abstract": "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a disease that leads to blindness. Gene therapy has been investigated with some success, and could lead to important advancements in treating LHON. This was a prospective, open-label trial involving 9 LHON patients at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, from August 2011 to December 2015. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of gene therapy for LHON. Nine LHON patients voluntarily received an intravitreal injection of rAAV2-ND4. Systemic examinations and visual function tests were performed during the 36-month follow-up period to determine the safety and efficacy of this gene therapy. Based on successful experiments in an animal model of LHON, 1 subject also received an rAAV2-ND4 injection in the second eye 12\u00a0months after gene therapy was administered in the first eye. Recovery of visual acuity was defined as the primary outcome of this study. Changes in the visual field, visual evoked potential (VEP), optical coherence tomography findings, liver and kidney function, and antibodies against AAV2 were defined as secondary endpoints. Eight patients (Patients 2\u20139) received unilateral gene therapy and visual function improvement was observed in both treated eyes (Patients 4, 6, 7, and 8) and untreated eyes (Patients 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8). Visual regression fluctuations, defined as changes in visual acuity greater than or equal to 0.3 logMAR, were observed in Patients 2 and 9. Age at disease onset, disease duration, and the amount of remaining optic nerve fibers did not have a significant effect on the visual function improvement. The visual field and pattern reversal VEP also improved. The patient (Patient 1) who received gene therapy in both eyes had improved visual acuity in the injected eye after the first treatment. Unfortunately, visual acuity in this eye decreased 3\u00a0months after he received gene therapy in the second eye. Animal experiments suggested that ND4 expression remains stable in the contralateral eye after intravitreal injections. No serious safety problem was observed in the 3-year follow-up of the 9 participants enrolled in this virus-based gene therapy. Meanwhile, our results support the use of intravitreal rAAV2-ND4 as an aggressive maneuver in our clinical trial. Further study in additional patients and in these 9 subjects is needed to better understand the effects of rAAV2-ND4 gene therapy on LHON and to increase the applications of this technique.",

The expression levels of c-Fos, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were upregulated in myopic eyes and downregulated upon treatment with atropine. The relationship between the inflammatory response and myopia was investigated by treating MFD hamsters with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CSA) or the inflammatory stimulators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PGN). Myopia progression was slowed by CSA application but was enhanced by LPS and PGN administration. The levels of c-Fos, NF-\u03baB, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 were upregulated in LPS- and PGN-treated eyes and downregulated by CSA treatment.

The aneurysms associated with BAV most commonly involve the ascending aorta and spare the descending aorta. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the ascending and descending aorta arise from neural crest (NC) and paraxial mesoderm (PM), respectively. We hypothesized defective differentiation of the neural crest stem cells (NCSCs)-derived SMCs but not paraxial mesoderm cells (PMCs)-derived SMCs contributes to the aortopathy associated with BAV. When induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from BAV/TAA patients were differentiated into NCSC-derived SMCs, these cells demonstrated significantly decreased expression of marker of SMC differentiation (MYH11) and impaired contraction compared to normal control. In contrast, the PMC-derived SMCs were similar to control cells in these aspects. The NCSC-SMCs from the BAV/TAA also showed decreased TGF-\u03b2 signaling based on phosphorylation of SMAD2, and increased mTOR signaling. Inhibition of mTOR pathway using rapamycin rescued the aberrant differentiation. Our data demonstrates that decreased differentiation and contraction of patient's NCSC-derived SMCs may contribute to that aortopathy associated with BAV.",

     "abstract": "Clevidipine, a dihydropyridine (DHP) analogue, lowers blood pressure (BP) by inhibiting l-type calcium channels (CaV1.2; gene CACNA1C) predominantly located in vascular smooth muscle (VSM). However, clinical observations suggest that clevidipine acts by a more complex mechanism. Clevidipine more potently reduces pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than systemic vascular resistance and its spectrum of effects on PVR are not shared by other DHPs. Clevidipine has potent spasmolytic effects in peripheral arteries at doses that are sub-clinical for BP lowering and, in hypertensive acute heart failure, clevidipine, but not other DHPs, provides dyspnea relief, partially independent of BP reduction. These observations suggest that a molecular variation in CaV1.2 may exist which confers unique pharmacology to different DHPs. We sequenced CACNA1C transcripts from human lungs and measured their affinity for clevidipine. Human lung tissue contains CACNA1C mRNA with many different splice variations. CaV1.2 channels with a specific combination of variable exons showed higher affinity for clevidipine, well below the concentration associated with BP reduction. Co-expression with pannexin 1 further increased the clevidipine affinity for this CaV1.2 splice variant. A high-affinity splice variant of CaV1.2 in combination with pannexin 1 could underlie the selective effects of clevidipine on pulmonary arterial pressure and on dyspnea.Clevidipine lowers blood pressure by inhibiting calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle. In patients with acute heart failure, clevidipine was shown to relieve breathing problems. This was only partially related to the blood pressure lowering actions of clevidipine and not conferred by another calcium channel inhibitor. We here found calcium channel variants in human lung that are more selectively inhibited by clevidipine, especially when associated with pannexin channels. This study gives a possible mechanism for clevidipine's relief of breathing problems and supports future clinical trials testing the role of clevidipine in the treatment of acute heart failure.",

Although there is biological plausibility for a procoagulant mechanism underlying some of these events, antithrombotic intervention trials demonstrate limited benefit, possibly through lack of stratification in heterogeneous patient groups. The ANXA5 M2 haplotype is a possible procoagulant biomarker and was tested pragmatically to determine whether this screening and LMWH treatment normalized the outcome for ANXA5 M2 positive couples.This was a pragmatic study that aimed to measure the effectiveness of a testing (for the M2 haplotype) and treatment (LMWH) pathway in routine clinical practice where there is variation between patients. Such a study in couples with fertility problems can inform choices between treatments; it is then the management protocol which is the subject of the investigation, not the individual treatments.Couples (N\u00a0=\u00a077) with one or both partners ANXA5 M2 positive demonstrated association of this haplotype with adverse IVF outcome. A pragmatic, multicenter, prospective cohort study of ANXA5 M2 haplotype screening, and LWMH treatment following embryo transfer (ET) in 103 IVF couples positive for ANXA5 M2 was performed. They were compared with a group of 1000 contemporaneous randomly selected unscreened and untreated couples undergoing assisted conception, from which 103 matched control couples were derived. The primary outcome measure was live birth incidence. Secondary outcomes were results following embryo transfer (ET) and live birth outcome by gender and M2 carriage, and allelic dose influence.The tested and treated cohort of ANXA5 M2 carriers achieved a similar live birth rate (37.9%) per ET cycle compared to both the more fertile comparison group (38.5%), and to the 103 matched controls (33.0%). Significantly more treated male carrier only couples had a live birth versus female M2 only (47.7% vs. 25.0% p\u00a0=\u00a00.045).Pragmatic ANXA5 M5 screening and treatment with LMWH in couples undergoing IVF is associated with similar outcome to couples with more favorable prognostic factors. The difference in live birth outcome for treated male only carrier couples may be consistent with an additional maternal thrombophilic factor that may adversely affect pregnancy, although other mechanisms are possible. This study suggests that LMWH treatment should be started prior to clinical pregnancy.",

Secondary endpoints were hospitalization duration, morphine consumption, pain evaluation, blood transfusion(s) (BT(s)), requiring intensive care and mortality.Among 250 VOCs included, 247 were analyzed. Forty-four (17.8%) ACSs occurred within 15 (median [IQR] 3 [2, 3]) days post-admission based on auscultation abnormalities; missing chest radiographs excluded three patients.

Originally implicated in allergy, IL-33 is also known to be involved in innate and adaptive immune responses by enhancing natural killer, Th1, and CD4 and CD8 T-cell functions. The nature of the antiviral immune response orchestrated by IL-33 depends on the site of infection, the duration of the disease and the cytokine milieu. In this review, we focus on the distinctive contribution of IL-33 as an anti-infective and proinflammatory cytokine in response to cell death and viral infections. The dynamic role of IL-33 in the acute and chronic phases of infection with HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, and with CMV is highlighted.

     "abstract": "Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays critical, but distinct, roles in bone remodeling, including bone formation (anabolic response) and resorption (catabolic response). Although its signaling and function have been extensively investigated, it just began to be understood how distinct functions are induced by PTH activating a common receptor, the PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1R), and how PTH1R signaling is terminated. Here, we provide evidence for vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35), a major component of retromer, in regulating PTH1R trafficking, turning off PTH signaling, and promoting its catabolic function. VPS35 is expressed in osteoblast (OB)-lineage cells. VPS35-deficiency in OBs impaired PTH(1\u201334)-promoted PTH1R translocation to the trans-Golgi network, enhanced PTH(1\u201334)-driven signaling, and reduced PTH(1\u201334)'s catabolic response in culture and in mice. Further mechanical studies revealed that VPS35 interacts with not only PTH1R, but also protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14C (PPP1R14C), an inhibitory subunit of PP1 phosphatase. PPP1R14C also interacts with PTH1R, which is necessary for the increased endosomal PTH1R signaling and decreased PTH(1\u201334)'s catabolic response in VPS35-deficient OB-lineage cells. Taken together, these results suggest that VPS35 deregulates PTH1R-signaling likely by its interaction with PTH1R and PPP1R14C. This event is critical for the control of PTH(1\u201334)-signaling dynamics, which may underlie PTH-induced catabolic response and adequate bone remodeling.",

Despite ABO matching, RBC transfusions can lead to production of alloantibodies against \u201cminor\u201d blood group antigens. Non-ABO alloimmunization is a leading cause of transfusion-associated mortality in the U.S. Despite its clinical importance, little is known about the immunological factors that promote alloimmunization. Prior studies indicate that inflammatory conditions place patients at higher risk for alloimmunization. Additionally, co-exposure to pro-inflammatory pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) promotes alloimmunization in animal models, suggesting that RBC alloimmunization depends on innate immune cell activation. However, the specific innate immune stimuli and sensors that induce a T cell-dependent alloantibody response to transfused RBCs have not been identified. The NLRP3 inflammasome senses chemically diverse PAMPs and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including extracellular ATP and iron-containing heme. We hypothesized that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by endogenous DAMPs from RBCs promotes the alloimmune response to a sterile RBC transfusion.

We multisampled 20 WT cases and assessed genome-wide allele-specific CNA and loss of heterozygosity, and inferred tumor evolution, using Illumina CytoSNP12v2.1 arrays, a custom analysis pipeline, and the MEDICC algorithm. We found remarkable diversity of ITGH and evolutionary trajectories in WT. 1q\u00a0+ is heterogeneous in the majority of tumors with this change, with variable evolutionary timing. We estimate that at least three samples per tumor are needed to detect >\u00a095% of cases with 1q\u00a0+. In contrast, somatic 11p15 LOH is uniformly an early event in WT development.

We then performed a cohort study on the effect of CAD antihistamine use on mortality of patients diagnosed with non-localized cancer in Denmark between 1995 and 2011. The use of the most commonly prescribed CAD antihistamine, loratadine, was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality among patients with non-localized NSCLC or any non-localized cancer when compared with use of non-CAD antihistamines and adjusted for potential confounders. Of the less frequently described CAD antihistamines, astemizole showed a similar significant association with reduced mortality as loratadine among patients with any non-localized cancer, and ebastine use showed a similar tendency. The association between CAD antihistamine use and reduced mortality was stronger among patients with records of concurrent chemotherapy than among those without such records. In line with this, sub-micromolar concentrations of loratadine, astemizole and ebastine sensitized NSCLC cells to chemotherapy and reverted multidrug resistance in NSCLC, breast and prostate cancer cells.

Here we show that EBV can infect primary mammary epithelial cells (MECs) that express the receptor CD21. EBV infection leads to the expansion of early MEC progenitor cells with a stem cell phenotype, activates MET signaling and enforces a differentiation block. When MECs were implanted as xenografts, EBV infection cooperated with activated Ras and accelerated the formation of breast cancer. Infection in EBV-related tumors was of a latency type II pattern, similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A human gene expression signature for MECs infected with EBV, termed EBVness, was associated with high grade, estrogen-receptor-negative status, p53 mutation and poor survival. In 11/33 EBVness-positive tumors, EBV-DNA was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization for the viral LMP1 and BXLF2 genes. In an analysis of the TCGA breast cancer data EBVness correlated with the presence of the APOBEC mutational signature. We conclude that a contribution of EBV to breast cancer etiology is plausible, through a mechanism in which EBV infection predisposes mammary epithelial cells to malignant transformation, but is no longer required once malignant transformation has occurred.",

Eighty-nine South African clinical isolates of varying first and second-line drug susceptibility patterns and two reference strains of M. tuberculosis underwent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination to two \u03b2-lactams: amoxicillin and meropenem, both alone and in combination with clavulanate, a \u03b2\u2013lactamase inhibitor. 41/91 (45%) of tested isolates were found to be hypersusceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate relative to reference strains, including 14/24 (58%) of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) and 22/38 (58%) of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates.

Here we show that a monoclonal antibody directed against the merozoite and human polyclonal IgG from merozoite vaccine recipients enhanced RBC invasion in a complement-dependent manner and that soluble CR1 inhibited this enhancement. Sialic acid-independent strains, that presumably are able to bind to CR1 via a native ligand, showed less complement-dependent enhancement of RBC invasion than sialic acid-dependent strains that do not utilize native CR1 ligands.

Finally, total anti-P. berghei IgG enhanced parasite growth and C3 deficiency decreased parasite growth in mice.

Thus, there is a need for a rapid test that can diagnose the presence of infection to triage patients, guide therapy, and decrease the incidence of sepsis.An Enzyme-Linked Lectin-Sorbent Assay (ELLecSA) that uses magnetic microbeads coated with an engineered version of the human opsonin, Mannose Binding Lectin, containing the Fc immunoglobulin domain linked to its carbohydrate recognition domain (FcMBL) was developed to quantify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in whole blood. This assay was tested in rats and pigs to explore whether it can detect infections and monitor disease progression, and in prospectively enrolled, emergency room patients with suspected sepsis. These results were also compared with data obtained from non-infected patients with or without traumatic injuries.The FcMBL ELLecSA was able to detect PAMPS present on, or released by, 85% of clinical isolates representing 47 of 55 different pathogen species, including the most common causes of sepsis. The PAMP assay rapidly (<\u00a01\u00a0h) detected the presence of active infection in animals, even when blood cultures were negative and bacteriocidal antibiotics were administered. In patients with suspected sepsis, the FcMBL ELLecSA detected infection in 55 of 67 patients with high sensitivity (>\u00a081%), specificity (>\u00a089%), and diagnostic accuracy of 0\u00b787. It also distinguished infection from trauma-related inflammation in the same patient cohorts with a higher specificity than the clinical sepsis biomarker, C-reactive Protein.The FcMBL ELLecSA-based PAMP assay offers a rapid, simple, sensitive and specific method for diagnosing infections, even when blood cultures are negative and antibiotic therapy has been initiated. It may help to triage patients with suspected systemic infections, and serve as a companion diagnostic to guide administration of emerging dialysis-like sepsis therapies.",

Therefore, drug discovery studies for these diseases have focused on the protein conversion process. We used a structure-based drug discovery algorithm (termed Nagasaki University Docking Engine: NUDE) that ran on an intensive supercomputer with a graphic-processing unit to identify several compounds with anti-prion effects. Among the candidates showing a high-binding score, the compounds exhibited direct interaction with recombinant PrP in vitro, and drastically reduced PrPSc and protein-aggresomes in the prion-infected cells. The fragment molecular orbital calculation showed that the van der Waals interaction played a key role in PrPC binding as the intermolecular interaction mode. Furthermore, PrPSc accumulation and microgliosis were significantly reduced in the brains of treated mice, suggesting that the drug candidates provided protection from prion disease, although further in vivo tests are needed to confirm these findings. This NUDE-based structure-based drug discovery for normal protein structures is likely useful for the development of drugs to treat other conformational disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",

Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down- or up-regulation of ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in A\u03b2 peptides levels whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30mut) did not affect A\u03b2 secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD) activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered A\u03b242 secretion in neuron primary cultures, soluble A\u03b242 and amyloid plaque load levels in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long term potentiation alterations.

However, current treatment options for spasticity produce muscle weakness which can impede movement, and do not directly address muscle stiffness. Here we propose that the accumulation of hyaluronan within muscles promotes the development of muscle stiffness, and report that treatment with the enzyme hyaluronidase increases upper limb movement and reduces muscle stiffness without producing weakness. 20 patients with unilateral upper limb spasticity received multiple intramuscular injections of human recombinant hyaluronidase with saline at a single visit. The safety and efficacy of the injections, passive and active movement, and muscle stiffness at eight upper limb joints were assessed at four time points: pre-injection (T0), within 2\u00a0weeks (T1), within 4\u20136\u00a0weeks (T2), and within 3\u20135\u00a0months post-injection (T3). There were no clinically significant adverse effects from the injections. Passive movement at all joints, and active movement at most joints increased at T1, and persisted at T2 and T3 for most joints. The modified Ashworth scores also declined significantly over time post-injection. Hyaluronidase injections offer a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for muscle stiffness in neurologically impaired individuals. These results warrant confirmation in placebo-controlled clinical trials.",

In this study, we explored whether renalase, an amine oxidase that has been previously shown to mediate reno-protection by local IPC, would also mediate the same effect elicited by remote IPC in animal model. Limb IPC was performed for 24\u00a0h followed by induction of CIN. Our results indicated that limb IPC prevented renal function decline, attenuated tubular damage and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in the kidney. All those beneficial effects were abolished by silencing of renalase with siRNA. This suggests that similar to local IPC, renalase is also critically involved in limb IPC-elicited reno-protection. Mechanistic studies showed that limb IPC increased TNF\u03b1 levels in the muscle and blood, and up-regulated renalase and phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 expression in the kidney. Pretreatment with TNF\u03b1 antagonist or NF-\u03baB inhibitor, largely blocked renalase expression. Besides, TNF\u03b1 preconditioning increased expression of renal renalase in vivo and in vitro, and attenuated H2O2 induced apoptosis in renal tubular cells. Collectively, our results suggest that limb IPC-induced reno-protection in CIN is dependent on increased renalase expression via activation of the TNF\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant gene silencing is highly associated with altered cell cycle regulation during carcinogenesis. In particular, silencing of the CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the p16INK4a protein, has a causal link with several different types of cancers. The p16INK4a protein plays an executional role in cell cycle and senescence through the regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 and cyclin D complexes. Several genetic and epigenetic aberrations of CDKN2A lead to enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis with recurrence of cancer and poor prognosis. In these cases, the restoration of genetic and epigenetic reactivation of CDKN2A is a practical approach for the prevention and therapy of cancer. This review highlights the genetic status of CDKN2A as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in various cancers.",

These antigen binding fragments, originating from Camelid heavy-chain antibodies, possess unusual hallmarks in terms of (small) size, stability, solubility and specificity, hence allowing cost-effective production and sometimes outperforming monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we evaluate the current status of nanobodies to study, diagnose, visualize or inhibit cancer-specific proteins and processes. Nanobodies are highly adaptable tools for cancer research as they enable specific modulation of targets, enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins alike. Molecular imaging studies benefit from the rapid, homogeneous tumor accumulation of nanobodies and their fast blood clearance, permitting previously unattainable fast tumor visualization. Moreover, they are endowed with considerable therapeutic potential as inhibitors of receptor-ligand pairs and deliverers of drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles towards tumors. More in vivo and clinical studies are however eagerly awaited to unleash their full potential.",

This system is referred to as the gut-brain axis. Here we show that both brush cells and type II taste cells are eliminated in the gastrointestinal tract of transcription factor Skn-1 knockout (KO) mice. Despite unaltered food intake, Skn-1 KO mice have reduced body weight with lower body fat due to increased energy expenditure. In this model, 24-h urinary excretion of catecholamines was significantly elevated, accompanied by increased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and fuel dissipation in skeletal muscle and impaired insulin secretion driven by glucose. These results suggest the existence of brain-mediated energy homeostatic pathways originating from brush cells and type II taste cells in the gastrointestinal tract and ending in peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. The discovery of food-derived factors that regulate these cells may open new avenues the treatment of obesity and diabetes.Taste signals and nutrient stimuli sensed by the gastrointestinal tract are transmitted to the brain to regulate feeding behavior and energy homeostasis along the gut-brain axis. We propose the concept that taste-receiving cells in the oral cavity and/or food-borne chemicals-receiving brush cells in the gut are involved in regulation of the body weight and adiposity via the brain.

Cellular functions in mouse and human tissues can be restored after fusion of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells with a variety of somatic cells. Here, after transplantation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the SNpc of two different mouse models of Parkinson's disease, we significantly ameliorated the dopaminergic neuron loss and function. We show fusion of transplanted HSPCs with neurons and with glial cells in the ventral midbrain of Parkinson's disease mice. Interestingly, the hybrids can undergo reprogramming in vivo and survived up to 4\u00a0weeks after transplantation, while acquiring features of mature astroglia. These newly generated astroglia produced Wnt1 and were essential for functional rescue of the dopaminergic neurons. Our data suggest that glial-derived hybrids produced upon fusion of transplanted HSPCs in the SNpc can rescue the Parkinson's disease phenotype via a niche-mediated effect, and can be exploited as an efficient cell-therapy approach.",

We hypothesized that neuronal gap junctions contribute to epileptogenesis through synchronous activity within the neuron networks in HH tissue. We studied surgically resected HH tissue with Western-blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, biocytin microinjection of recorded HH neurons, and microelectrode patch clamp recordings with and without pharmacological blockade of gap junctions. Normal human hypothalamus tissue was used as a control. Western blots showed increased expression of both connexin-36 (Cx36) and connexin-43 (Cx43) in HH tissue compared with normal human mammillary body tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Cx36 and Cx43 are expressed in HH tissue, but Cx36 was mainly expressed within neuron clusters while Cx43 was mainly expressed outside of neuron clusters. Gap-junction profiles were observed between small HH neurons with electron microscopy. Biocytin injection into single recorded small HH neurons showed labeling of adjacent neurons, which was not observed in the presence of a neuronal gap-junction blocker, mefloquine. Microelectrode field recordings from freshly resected HH slices demonstrated spontaneous ictal/interictal-like discharges in most slices. Bath-application of gap-junction blockers significantly reduced ictal/interictal-like discharges in a concentration-dependent manner, while not affecting the action-potential firing of small gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons observed with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the same patient's HH tissue. These results suggest that neuronal gap junctions between small GABAergic HH neurons participate in the genesis of epileptic-like discharges.

Here we apply a novel search strategy to identify androgen-regulated cellular pathways that may be clinically important in prostate cancer. Using RNASeq data, we searched for genes that showed reciprocal changes in expression in response to acute androgen stimulation in culture, and androgen deprivation in patients with prostate cancer. Amongst 700 genes displaying reciprocal expression patterns we observed a significant enrichment in the cellular process glycosylation. Of 31 reciprocally-regulated glycosylation enzymes, a set of 8 (GALNT7, ST6GalNAc1, GCNT1, UAP1, PGM3, CSGALNACT1, ST6GAL1 and EDEM3) were significantly up-regulated in clinical prostate carcinoma. Androgen exposure stimulated synthesis of glycan structures downstream of this core set of regulated enzymes including sialyl-Tn (sTn), sialyl LewisX (SLeX), O-GlcNAc and chondroitin sulphate, suggesting androgen regulation of the core set of enzymes controls key steps in glycan synthesis. Expression of each of these enzymes also contributed to prostate cancer cell viability.

Core binding factor is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of one of 3 RUNX proteins (RUNX1-3) and a CBF\u03b2 binding partner. CBF\u03b2 enhances DNA binding of RUNX subunits by relieving auto-inhibition. Both RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2 are frequently mutated in human leukemia. More recently, RUNX proteins have been shown to be key players in epithelial cancers, suggesting the targeting of this pathway could have broad utility. In order to test this, we developed small molecules which bind to CBF\u03b2 and inhibit its binding to RUNX. Treatment with these inhibitors reduces binding of RUNX1 to target genes, alters the expression of RUNX1 target genes, and impacts cell survival and differentiation. These inhibitors show efficacy against leukemia cells as well as basal-like (triple-negative) breast cancer cells. These inhibitors provide effective tools to probe the utility of targeting RUNX transcription factor function in other cancers.",

Since many resistance mechanisms have been described, most of them causing a hyperactivation of the MAPK- or PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, one potential strategy to overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma cells would be to target important common signaling nodes. Known factors that cause secondary resistance include the overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), alternative splicing of BRAF or the occurrence of novel mutations in MEK1 or NRAS.In this study we show that \u03b2-catenin is stabilized and translocated to the nucleus in approximately half of the melanomas that were analyzed and which developed secondary resistance towards BRAFi. We further demonstrate that \u03b2-catenin is involved in the mediation of resistance towards vemurafenib in vitro and in vivo. Unexpectedly, \u03b2-catenin acts mainly independent of the TCF/LEF dependent canonical Wnt-signaling pathway in resistance development, which partly explains previous contradictory results about the role of \u03b2-catenin in melanoma progression and therapy resistance. We further demonstrate that \u03b2-catenin interacts with Stat3 after chronic vemurafenib treatment and both together cooperate in the acquisition and maintenance of resistance towards BRAFi.",

Mechanistic studies revealed that the underused exons encode part of the protein necessary for interaction with Vimentin and Numa1, a protein which is required for proper positioning of the mitotic spindle.

Small DOK1 variants remain in cells of solid tumors and leukemias, albeit, their functions are elusive. To assess the so far unknown role of DOK1 in colorectal cancer (CRC), we generated DOK1 mutants which mimic the domain structure and subcellular distribution of DOK1 protein variants in leukemia patients. We found that cytoplasmic DOK1 activated peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma (PPAR\u03b3) resulting in inhibition of the c-FOS promoter and cell proliferation, whereas nuclear DOK1 was inactive. PPAR\u03b3-agonist increased expression of endogenous DOK1 and interaction with PPAR\u03b3. Forward translation of this cell-based signaling model predicted compartmentalization of DOK1 in patients. In a large series of CRC patients, loss of DOK1 protein was associated with poor prognosis at early tumor stages (*p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; n\u00a0=\u00a01492). In tumors with cytoplasmic expression of DOK1, survival was improved, whereas nuclear localization of DOK1 correlated with poor outcome, indicating that compartmentalization of DOK1 is critical for CRC progression. Thus, DOK1 was identified as a prognostic factor for non-metastatic CRC, and, via its drugability by PPAR\u03b3-agonist, may constitute a potential target for future cancer treatments.",

In agreement, absence of SLX4 leads to upregulated LINE-1 retrotransposition. Importantly, similar results were obtained with the FANCD2 upstream activator of SLX4. Furthermore, treatment of FA cells with the Tenofovir reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTi), that prevents endogenous retrotransposition, decreased both accumulation of cytoplasmic DNA and pro-inflammatory signaling. Collectively, our data suggest a contribution of endogenous RT activities to the generation of immunogenic cytoplasmic nucleic acids responsible for inflammation in FA. The additional observation that RTi decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by DNA replication stress-inducing drugs further demonstrates the contribution of endogenous RTs to sustaining chronic inflammation.

Systemic perturbation of the microbiome was noted in tumor and paired normal samples (vs non-cancer normals) for several bacterial families with a significant increase in Stenotrophomonas species distinguishing tumors vs paired normals. Comparison of parasite associated (OVa) vs non-associated (non-OVa) groups identified enrichment for specific enteric bacteria (Bifidobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae). One of the enriched families, Bifidobacteriaceae, was found to be dominant in the O. viverrini microbiome, providing a mechanistic link to the parasite. Functional analysis and comparison of CCA microbiomes revealed higher potential for producing bile acids and ammonia in OVa tissues, linking the altered microbiota to carcinogenesis.

We found that HIV infection is associated to dramatic changes in the active set of gut bacteria simultaneously altering the metabolic outcomes. Effects were accentuated among immunological ART responders, regardless diet, subject characteristics, clinical variables other than immune recovery, the duration and type of ART and sexual preferences. The effect was found at quantitative levels of several molecular agents and active bacteria which were herein identified and whose abundance correlated with HIV immune pathogenesis markers.

     "abstract": "Shock and kill strategies involving the use of small molecules to induce viral transcription in resting CD4\u00a0+ T cells (shock) followed by immune mediated clearance of the reactivated cells (kill), have been proposed as a method of eliminating latently infected CD4\u00a0+ T cells. The combination of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor romidepsin and protein kinase C (PKC) agonist bryostatin-1 is very effective at reversing latency in vitro. However, we found that primary HIV-1 specific CD8\u00a0+ T cells were not able to eliminate autologous resting CD4\u00a0+ T cells that had been reactivated with these drugs. We tested the hypothesis that the drugs affected primary CD8\u00a0+ T cell function and found that both agents had inhibitory effects on the suppressive capacity of HIV-specific CD8\u00a0+ T cells from patients who control viral replication without antiretroviral therapy (elite suppressors/controllers). The inhibitory effect was additive and multi-factorial in nature. These inhibitory effects were not seen with prostratin, another PKC agonist, either alone or in combination with JQ1, a bromodomain-containing protein 4 inhibitor. Our results suggest that because of their adverse effects on primary CD8\u00a0+ T cells, some LRAs may cause immune-suppression and therefore should be used with caution in shock and kill strategies.",

However, whether HIV-1 can overcome MxB restriction without compromise of viral fitness has been undefined. Here, we have discovered that naturally occurring capsid (CA) variants can render HIV-1 resistant to the activity of MxB without losing viral infectivity or the ability to escape from interferon induction. Moreover, these MxB resistant HIV-1 variants do not lose MxB recognition. Surprisingly, MxB resistant CA variants are most commonly found in the Clade C HIV-1 that is the most rapidly expanding Clade throughout the world. Accumulation of MxB resistant mutations is also observed during HIV-1 spreading in human populations. These findings support a potential role for MxB as a selective force during HIV-1 transmission and evolution.",

     "abstract": "Although both C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)- and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using HIV-1 strains cause AIDS, the emergence of CXCR4-utilizing variants is associated with an accelerated decline in CD4\u00a0+ T cells. It remains uncertain if CXCR4-using viruses hasten disease or if these variants only emerge after profound immunological damage. We show that exclusively CXCR4- as compared to cocirculating CCR5-utilizing variants are less sensitive to neutralization by both contemporaneous autologous plasma and plasma pools from individuals that harbor only CCR5-using HIV-1. The CXCR4-utilizing variants, however, do not have a global antigenic change because they remain equivalently susceptible to antibodies that do not target coreceptor binding domains. Studies with envelope V3 loop directed antibodies and chimeric envelopes suggest that the neutralization susceptibility differences are potentially influenced by the V3 loop. In vitro passage of a neutralization sensitive CCR5-using virus in the presence of autologous plasma and activated CD4\u00a0+ T cells led to the emergence of a CXCR4-utilizing virus in 1 of 3 cases. These results suggest that in some but not necessarily all HIV-1 infected individuals humoral immune pressure against the autologous virus selects for CXCR4-using variants, which potentially accelerates disease progression.

Therefore, different therapeutic strategies to eliminate the viral reservoirs are currently being explored. We here propose a novel strategy to reduce the replicating HIV reservoir during primary HIV infection by means of drug-induced retargeting of HIV integration. A novel class of integration inhibitors, referred to as LEDGINs, inhibit the interaction between HIV integrase and the LEDGF/p75 host cofactor, the main determinant of lentiviral integration site selection. We show for the first time that LEDGF/p75 depletion hampers HIV-1 reactivation in cell culture. Next we demonstrate that LEDGINs relocate and retarget HIV integration resulting in a HIV reservoir that is refractory to reactivation by different latency-reversing agents. Taken together, these results support the potential of integrase inhibitors that modulate integration site targeting to reduce the likeliness of viral rebound.",

As compared with age- and sex-matched uninfected individuals, we observed a persistence of activation in all the cell subpopulations analyzed, together with marks of inflammation and fibrinolysis. Two independent hierarchical clustering analyses allowed us to identify five clusters of markers that varied concurrently, and five patient groups, each with the same activation profile. The five groups of patients could be characterized by a marker of CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, NK cell, monocyte activation or of inflammation, respectively. One of these profiles was strongly associated with marks of metabolic syndrome, particularly with hyperinsulinemia (OR 12.17 [95% CI 1.79\u201382.86], p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).

Healthy adults had antibodies to M1 and NP capable of binding dimeric Fc\u03b3RIIIa and activating NK cells. Natural symptomatic and experimental influenza infections resulted in a rise in antibody dependent NK cell activation post-infection to the hemagglutinin of the infecting strain, but changes in NK cell activation to M1 and NP were variable. Although antibody dependent killing of target cells infected with vaccinia viruses expressing internal influenza proteins was not detected, opsonising antibodies to NP and M1 likely contribute to an antiviral microenvironment by stimulating innate immune cells to secrete cytokines early in infection. We conclude that effector cell activating antibodies to conserved internal influenza proteins are common in healthy and influenza-infected adults. Given the significance of such antibodies in animal models of heterologous influenza infection, the definition of their importance and mechanism of action in human immunity to influenza is essential.",

Here we report that co-deletion of Pten and p53 in murine prostate epithelium, often observed in human CRPC, leads to AR-independent CRPC and thus confers de novo resistance to second generation androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in multiple independent yet complementary preclinical mouse models. In contrast, mechanism-driven co-targeting hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated Warburg effect with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and ULK1-dependent autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) selectively kills cancer cells through intrinsic apoptosis to cause tumor regression in xenograft, leads to a near-complete tumor suppression and remarkably extends survival in Pten\u00a0\u2212/p53-deficiency-driven CRPC mouse model. Mechanistically, 2-DG causes AMPK phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits mTORC1-S6K1 translation signaling to preferentially block anti-apoptotic protein MCL-l synthesis to prime mitochondria-dependent apoptosis while simultaneously activates ULK1-driven autophagy for cell survival to counteract the apoptotic action of anti-Warburg effect. Accordingly, inhibition of autophagy with CQ sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis upon 2-DG challenge. Given that 2-DG is recommended for phase II clinical trials for prostate cancer and CQ has been clinically used as an anti-malaria drug for many decades, the preclinical results from our proof-of-principle studies in vivo are imminently translatable to clinical trials to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy by the combination modality for a subset of currently incurable CRPC harboring PTEN and TP53 mutations.",

Multiparametric (MP)-MRI incorporating S-DWI was useful for predicting biopsy results (AUC 0.72, Fisher's exact p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); however, using HR-DWI allowed MP-MRI to be more highly predictive of biopsy results (AUC 0.88, Fisher's exact p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). AUC for MP-MRI incorporating HR-DWI was significantly larger than MP-MRI incorporating S-DWI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). MP-MRI with HR-DWI had a sensitivity of 95.7% and identified tumor in 22 of 23 zones proven to have cancer on biopsy. In contrast, MP-MRI with S-DWI had a sensitivity of 60.9% and only identified 14 of 23 biopsy-positive zones (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).We developed a novel DWI and evaluated its improved resolution in a clinical setting. This technology has many potential applications and should be evaluated in future clinical trials as a patient management tool.",

     "abstract": "In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, finasteride selectively suppressed low-grade prostate cancer and significantly reduced the incidence of prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride compared with placebo. However, an apparent increase in high-grade disease was also observed among men randomized to finasteride. We aimed to determine why and hypothesized that there is a grade-dependent response to finasteride.From 2007 to 2012, we randomized dynamically by intranet-accessible software 183 men with localized prostate cancer to receive 5\u00a0mg finasteride or placebo daily in a double-blind study during the 4\u20136\u00a0weeks preceding prostatectomy. As the primary end point, the expression of a predefined molecular signature (ER\u03b2, UBE2C, SRD5A2, and VEGF) differentiating high- and low-grade tumors in Gleason grade (GG) 3 areas of finasteride-exposed tumors from those in GG3 areas of placebo-exposed tumors, adjusted for Gleason score (GS) at prostatectomy, was compared. We also determined androgen receptor (AR) levels, Ki-67, and cleaved caspase 3 to evaluate the effects of finasteride on the expression of its downstream target, cell proliferation, and apoptosis, respectively. The expression of these markers was also compared across grades between and within treatment groups. Logistic regression was used to assess the expression of markers.We found that the predetermined molecular signature did not distinguish GG3 from GG4 areas in the placebo group. However, AR expression was significantly lower in the GG4 areas of the finasteride group than in those of the placebo group. Within the finasteride group, AR expression was also lower in GG4 than in GG3 areas, but not significantly. Expression of cleaved caspase 3 was significantly increased in both GG3 and GG4 areas in the finasteride group compared to the placebo group, although it was lower in GG4 than in GG3 areas in both groups.We showed that finasteride's effect on apoptosis and AR expression is tumor grade dependent after short-term intervention. This may explain finasteride's selective suppression of low-grade tumors observed in the PCPT.",

Therefore, palmitate, the prevalent proinflammatory saturated fatty acid (SFA) in HFD and the anti-inflammatory, poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were analyzed for effects on circadian timekeeping and inflammatory responses in peripheral clocks. Prolonged palmitate, but not DHA, exposure increased the period of fibroblast Bmal1-dLuc rhythms. Acute palmitate treatment produced phase shifts of the Bmal1-dLuc rhythm that were larger in amplitude as compared to DHA. These phase-shifting effects were time-dependent and contemporaneous with rhythmic changes in palmitate-induced inflammatory responses. Fibroblast and differentiated adipocyte clocks exhibited cell-specific differences in the time-dependent nature of palmitate-induced shifts and inflammation. DHA and other inhibitors of inflammatory signaling (AICAR, cardamonin) repressed palmitate-induced proinflammatory responses and phase shifts of the fibroblast clock, suggesting that SFA-mediated inflammatory signaling may feed back to modulate circadian timekeeping in peripheral clocks.",

Here, we present a streamlined mass spectrometry-based platform for identifying and characterizing low-abundance regulatory peptides in humans. We demonstrate the clinical applicability of this platform by studying a hitherto neglected glucose- and appetite-regulating gut hormone, namely, oxyntomodulin. Our results show that the secretion of oxyntomodulin in patients with type 2 diabetes is significantly impaired, and that its level is increased by more than 10-fold after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, we report that oxyntomodulin is co-distributed and co-secreted with the insulin-stimulating and appetite-regulating gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is inactivated by the same protease (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) as GLP-1 and acts through its receptor. Thus, oxyntomodulin may participate with GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and appetite in humans. In conclusion, this mass spectrometry-based platform is a powerful resource for identifying and characterizing metabolically active low-abundance peptides.",

In vitro studies in mesangial cells revealed that exogenous addition of SM(d18:1/16:0) significantly elevated ATP via increased glucose consumption and lactate production with a consequent reduction of AMPK and PGC1\u03b1. Furthermore, inhibition of sphingomyelin synthases reversed these effects.

Here we show that LRP1 regulates hepatic energy homeostasis by integrating insulin signaling with lipid uptake and secretion. Somatic inactivation of LRP1 in the liver (hLRP1KO) predisposes to diet-induced insulin resistance with dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis. On a high-fat diet, hLRP1KO mice develop a severe Metabolic Syndrome secondary to hepatic insulin resistance, reduced expression of insulin receptors on the hepatocyte surface and decreased glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) translocation. While LRP1 is also required for efficient cell surface insulin receptor expression in the absence of exogenous lipids, this latent state of insulin resistance is unmasked by exposure to fatty acids. This further impairs insulin receptor trafficking and results in increased hepatic lipogenesis, impaired fatty acid oxidation and reduced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride secretion.",

Here, we identified a natural cyclopeptide termed destruxin A5 that effectively inhibits PDGF-BB-induced PDGFR-\u03b2 signaling. Interestingly and importantly, the inhibitory mechanism is distinct from the mechanism of tyrosine kinase inhibitors because destruxin A5 does not have the ability to bind to the ATP-binding pocket of PDGFR-\u03b2. Using Biacore T200 technology, thermal shift technology, microscale thermophoresis technology and computational analysis, we confirmed that destruxin A5 selectively targets the PDGF-B/PDGFR-\u03b2 interaction interface to block this signaling. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of destruxin A5 on PDGF-BB/PDGFR-\u03b2\u03b2 signaling was verified using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models, in which the extent of liver fibrosis was effectively alleviated by destruxin A5.

These signals converged with genetic causal risks of metabolic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders revealed in humans. Gene network modeling uncovered the extracellular matrix genes Bgn and Fmod as main orchestrators of the effects of fructose, as validated using two knockout mouse models.

Control and FSE rats were trained to forage or perform an active avoidance spatial task. FSE rats were sorted by those that were able to reach task criterion (FSE-L) and those that could not (FSE-NL). FSE-NL CA1 place cells did not exhibit phase preference in either context and exhibited poor cross-theta interaction between CA1 and CA3. FSE-L and control CA1 place cells exhibited phase preference at peak theta that shifted during active avoidance to the same static phase preference observed in CA3.

The underlying mechanisms of muscle pain are difficult to investigate as pain presents in patients with very diverse histories.

To gain insight into the pathophysiology of myalgia we investigated a homogeneous group of patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), a monogenic disorder presenting with myalgia in at least 50% of affected patients.After IRB approval we performed an observational cross-sectional cohort study and recruited 42 patients with genetically confirmed DM2 plus 20 healthy age and gender matched control subjects. All participants were subjected to an extensive sensory-testing protocol. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed from 12 muscle biopsy specimens obtained from DM2 patients.Clinical sensory testing as well as RNA sequencing clearly separated DM2 myalgic from non-myalgia patients and also from healthy controls. In particular pressure pain thresholds were significantly lowered for all muscles tested in myalgic DM2 patients but were not significantly different between non-myalgic patients and healthy controls. The expression of fourteen muscle expressed genes in myalgic patients was significantly up or down-regulated in myalgic compared to non-myalgic DM2 patients.Our data support the idea that molecular changes in the muscles of DM2 patients are associated with muscle pain. Further studies should address whether muscle-specific molecular pathways play a significant role in myalgia in order to facilitate the development of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to treat musculoskeletal pain.This study was funded by the German Research Society (DFG, GK1631), KAP programme of Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin and Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine.",

After transplantation recipients were IgE-sensitized at multiple time points with Phl p 5 and control allergen.Mice treated with mPhl p 5 bone marrow did not develop Phl p 5-specific IgE (or other isotypes) despite repeated administration of the allergen, while mounting and maintaining a strong humoral response towards the control allergen. Notably, Phl p 5-specific T cell responses and allergic airway inflammation were also completely prevented. Interestingly allergen-specific B cell tolerance was maintained independent of Treg functions indicating deletional tolerance as underlying mechanism.This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that allergen-specific immunological tolerance preventing occurrence of allergy can be established through a cell-based therapy employing allergen-expressing leukocytes.",

Candidates for myocardial revascularization were randomly allocated into two treatment groups. In the control arm (n\u00a0=\u00a05), the revascularizable area was treated with CABG and the non-revascularizable area was left untouched. Patients in the AGTP-treated arm (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were treated with CABG and the non-revascularizable area was covered by a biological adipose graft. The primary endpoint was the appearance of adverse effects derived from the procedure including hospital admissions and death, and 24-hour Holter monitoring arrhythmias at baseline, 1\u00a0week, and 3 and 12\u00a0months. Secondary endpoints of efficacy were assessed by cardiac MRI.No differences in safety were observed between groups in terms of clinical or arrhythmic events. On follow-up MRI testing, participants in the AGTP-treated arm showed a borderline smaller left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV; p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) and necrosis ratio (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) at 3\u00a0months but not at 12\u00a0months.

Here, we developed a comprehensive approach to measure transcriptional changes of the evolutionary conserved syntenic orthologs during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle across six Plasmodium species. We show significant transcriptional constraint at the mid-developmental stage of Plasmodium species while the earliest stages of parasite development display the greatest transcriptional variation associated with critical functional processes. Modeling of the evolutionary relationship based on changes in transcriptional profile reveal a phylogeny pattern of the Plasmodium species that strictly follows its mammalian hosts. In addition, the work shows that transcriptional conserved orthologs represent potential future targets for anti-malaria intervention as they would be expected to carry out key essential functions within the parasites.

Although a tropical mosquito-borne viral disease, a dengue outbreak occurred in Madeira, Portugal, in 2012; the first in Europe since 1920s. This outbreak emphasizes the potential for dengue re-emergence in Europe given changing climates. We present estimates of dengue epidemic potential using vectorial capacity (VC) based on historic and projected temperature (1901\u20132099). VC indicates the vectors' ability to spread disease among humans. We calculated temperature-dependent VC for Europe, highlighting 10 European cities and three non-European reference cities. Compared with the tropics, Europe shows pronounced seasonality and geographical heterogeneity. Although low, VC during summer is currently sufficient for dengue outbreaks in Southern Europe to commence\u2013if sufficient vector populations (either Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) were active and virus were introduced. Under various climate change scenarios, the seasonal peak and time window for dengue epidemic potential increases during the 21st century. Our study maps dengue epidemic potential in Europe and identifies seasonal time windows when major cities are most conducive for dengue transmission from 1901 to 2099. Our findings illustrate, that besides vector control, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions crucially reduces the future epidemic potential of dengue in Europe.",

These volunteers displayed high BCG-specific IFN-\u03b3 responses pre- and post-vaccination possibly predisposing them to autocrine/paracrine negative regulation of immune control of latent VZV. A systems biology transcriptomal approach identified positive correlations between post-vaccination T cell expression modules and WBA, and negative correlations between post-vaccination monocyte expression modules and WBA. The expression of one key macrophage marker (F4/80) was constitutively elevated in the two volunteers with zoster.The unexpected development of VZV in two of eight healthy adult vaccine recipients resulted in discontinuation of AERAS-422 vaccine development.

In HIV-infected individuals, persistent viral replication, together with inflammatory stimuli contributes to chronic immune activation and oxidative stress. These conditions remain even in subjects with sustained virologic suppression on antiretroviral therapy. Here we highlight recent studies demonstrating the importance of metabolic pathways, particularly those involving glucose metabolism, in differentiation and maintenance of the activation states of T cells and monocytes. We also discuss how changes in the metabolic status of these cells may contribute to ongoing immune activation and inflammation in HIV- infected persons and how this may contribute to disease progression, establishment and persistence of the HIV reservoir, and the development of co-morbidities. We provide evidence that other viruses such as Epstein\u2013Barr and Flu virus also disrupt the metabolic machinery of their host cells. Finally, we discuss how redox signaling mediated by oxidative stress may regulate metabolic responses in T cells and monocytes during HIV infection.",

Maturation and tumor recruitment of MDSCs are dependent on signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase CSF-1R on myeloid cells. Here, we show that MDSCs are the critical cell population in IDO-expressing B16 tumors in mediating accelerated tumor outgrowth and resistance to immunotherapy. Using a clinically relevant drug, we show that inhibition of CSF-1R signaling can functionally block tumor-infiltrating MDSCs and enhance anti-tumor T cell responses. Furthermore, inhibition of CSF-1R sensitizes IDO-expressing tumors to immunotherapy with T cell checkpoint blockade, and combination of CSF-1R blockade with IDO inhibitors potently elicits tumor regression. These findings provide evidence for a critical and functional role for MDSCs on the in vivo outcome of IDO-expressing tumors.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking both DNA replication and repair by inhibiting the bifunctional DNA2 could be a potent strategy to sensitize cancer cells to stresses from radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. We show that homozygous deletion of DNA2 sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation and camptothecin (CPT). Using a virtual high throughput screen, we identify 4-hydroxy-8-nitroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (C5) as an effective and selective inhibitor of DNA2. Mutagenesis and biochemical analysis define the C5 binding pocket at a DNA-binding motif that is shared by the nuclease and helicase activities, consistent with structural studies that suggest that DNA binding to the helicase domain is necessary for nuclease activity. C5 targets the known functions of DNA2 in vivo: C5 inhibits resection at stalled forks as well as reducing recombination. C5 is an even more potent inhibitor of restart of stalled DNA replication forks and over-resection of nascent DNA in cells defective in replication fork protection, including BRCA2 and BOD1L.

Recently, the combination of metronomic chemotherapy and drug repositioning has been proposed as an attractive alternative for cancer patients living in developing countries.In vitro experiments with transformed endothelial cells were used to identify synergistic interactions between anti-hypertensive drug propranolol and chemotherapeutics. This led to the design of a pilot treatment protocol combining oral propranolol and metronomic chemotherapy. Seven consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic/recurrent angiosarcoma were treated with this combination for up to 12\u00a0months, followed by propranolol-containing maintenance therapy.Gene expression analysis showed expression of ADRB1 and ADRB2 adrenergic receptor genes in transformed endothelial cells and in angiosarcoma tumors. Propranolol strongly synergized with the microtubule-targeting agent vinblastine in vitro, but only displayed additivity or slight antagonism with paclitaxel and doxorubicin. A combination treatment using bi-daily propranolol (40\u00a0mg) and weekly metronomic vinblastine (6\u00a0mg/m2) and methotrexate (35\u00a0mg/m2) was designed and used in 7 patients with advanced angiosarcoma. Treatment was well tolerated and resulted in 100% response rate, including 1 complete response and 3 very good partial responses, based on RECIST criteria. Median progression-free and overall survival was 11\u00a0months (range 5\u201324) and 16\u00a0months (range 10\u201330), respectively.Our results provide a strong rationale for the combination of \u03b2-blockers and vinblastine-based metronomic chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced angiosarcoma.

Surprisingly, these vesicles contained the viral accessory proteins Nef and Vpu, which are assumed to be not expressed under efficient ART, as well as pro-inflammatory effectors, including activated ADAM17. HIV pEV were characterized by the presence of activated \u03b1v\u03b23 and absence of CD81 and Tsg101. Correlating with immune activation, peripheral monocytes ingested large amounts of pEV, giving rise to an increased population of CD1c+ CD14+ cells that secreted inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, the pro-inflammatory content, particularly ADAM17 activity, correlated with low T cell counts. Preliminary evidence suggested that HIV pEV derived from peripheral mononuclear cells and from an unknown myeloid cell population. In summary we propose an important role of pro-inflammatory pEV in chronic HIV infection due to ongoing viral Nef activity.",

Surprisingly, pyrazinamide did not kill intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis up to fourfold the standard dose as monotherapy or as combination therapy, despite achieving high intracellular concentrations. Host-pathogen RNA-sequencing revealed lack of a pyrazinamide exposure transcript signature in intracellular bacteria or of phagolysosome acidification on pH imaging. Artificial intelligence algorithms confirmed that pyrazinamide was not predictive of good clinical outcomes in children\u00a0\u2264\u00a06\u00a0years who had extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, adding a drug that works inside macrophages could benefit children with disseminated tuberculosis. Our in vitro model can be used to identify such new regimens that could accelerate cure while minimizing toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Irisin, a myokine released during exercise, promotes browning of subcutaneous adipose tissue and regulates energy homeostasis. Although exercise constantly reduces blood cholesterol, whether irisin is involved in the regulation of cholesterol remains largely unknown. In the present study, subcutaneous infusion of irisin for 2\u00a0weeks induced a reduction in plasma and hepatic cholesterol in high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. These alterations were associated with an activation of 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2) transcription and nuclear translocation. In primary hepatocytes from either lean or DIO mice, irisin significantly decreased cholesterol content via sequential activation of AMPK and inhibition of SREBP2. Suppression of AMPK by compound C or AMPK\u03b11 siRNA blocked irisin-induced alterations in cholesterol contents and SREBP2. In conclusion, irisin could suppress hepatic cholesterol production via a mechanism dependent of AMPK and SREBP2 signaling. These findings suggest that irisin is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

We identified DIRAS3 and IGF-1 as long-term WL target genes up-regulated in ASCs in subcutaneous white adipose tissue of formerly obese donors (WLDs). We show that DIRAS3 negatively regulates Akt, mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling in ASCs undergoing adipogenesis and acts as a negative regulator of this pathway and an activator of autophagy. Studying the IGF-1\u2013DIRAS3 interaction in ASCs of WLDs, we demonstrate that IGF-1, although strongly up-regulated in these cells, hardly activates Akt, while ERK1/2 and S6K1 phosphorylation is activated by IGF-1. Overexpression of DIRAS3 in WLD ASCs completely inhibits Akt phosphorylation also in the presence of IGF-1. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and S6K1 is lesser reduced under these conditions. In conclusion, our key findings are that DIRAS3 down-regulates Akt\u2013mTOR signaling in ASCs of WLDs. Moreover, DIRAS3 inhibits adipogenesis and activates autophagy in these cells.",

Interestingly, we show a significant lowering of H2S levels in the brain, under chronic HH conditions. This phenomenon functionally impacted hypoxia-induced modulation of cerebral blood flow (hypoxic autoregulation) besides perturbing the strength of functional hyperemia responses. The augmentation of H2S levels, during HH conditions, remarkably preserved Glio-Vascular homeostasis and key neuro-physiological functions (cerebral blood flow, functional hyperemia and spatial memory) besides curtailing HH-induced neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus. Our data thus revealed causal role of H2S during HH-induced early Glio-Vascular dysfunction and consequent cognitive impairment.",

This study investigated the expression of MSRV in CIDP and evaluated relevant MSRV-Env pathogenic effects.50 CIDP patients, 19 other neurological controls (ONDs) and 65 healthy blood donors (HBDs) were recruited from two different countries. MSRV-env and -pol transcripts, IL6 and CXCL10 levels were quantified from blood samples. MSRV-Env immunohistology was performed in distal sensory nerves from CIDP and neurological controls biopsies. MSRV-Env pathogenic effects and mode of action were assayed in cultured primary human Schwann cells (HSCs).In both cohorts, MSRV-env and -pol transcripts, IL6 positivity prevalence and CXCL10 levels were significantly elevated in CIDP patients when compared to HBDs and ONDs (statistically significant in all comparisons). MSRV-Env protein was detected in Schwann cells in 5/7 CIDP biopsies. HSC exposed to or transfected with MSRV-env presented a strong increase of IL6 and CXCL10 transcripts and protein secretion. These pathogenic effects on HSC were inhibited by GNbAC1, a highly specific and neutralizing humanized monoclonal antibody targeting MSRV-Env.The present study showed that MSRV-Env may trigger the release of critical immune mediators proposed as instrumental factors involved in the pathophysiology of CIDP. Significant MSRV-Env expression was detected in a significant proportion of patients with CIDP, in which it may play a role according to its presently observed effects on Schwann cells along with previously known effects on immune cells.Experimental results also suggest that a biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy targeting this protein with a neutralizing antibody such as GNbAC1 may offer new perspectives for treating CIDP patients with positive detection of MSRV-Env expression.Geneuro-Innovation, France.",

This study examined if novel or rare missense coding variants in any of four different signaling genes in sporadic schizophrenia cases were associated with clinical phenotypes in an exceptionally well-characterized sample.Structured interviews, cognition, symptoms and life course features were assessed in 48 ethnically-diverse cases with psychosis who underwent targeted exome sequencing of PTPRG (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type G), SLC39A13 (Solute Carrier Family 39 (Zinc Transporter) Member 13), TGM5 (transglutaminase 5) and ARMS/KIDINS220 (Ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning protein or Kinase D-Interacting Substrate of 220\u00a0kDa). Cases harboring rare missense coding polymorphisms or novel mutations in one or more of these genes were compared to other cases not carrying any rare missense coding polymorphisms or novel mutations in these genes and healthy controls.Fifteen of 48 cases (31.25%) carried rare or novel missense coding variants in one or more of these genes. The subgroups significantly differed in important features, including specific working memory deficits for PTPRG (n\u00a0=\u00a05); severe negative symptoms, global cognitive deficits and poor educational attainment, suggesting a developmental disorder, for SLC39A13 (n\u00a0=\u00a04); slow processing speed, childhood attention deficit disorder and milder symptoms for TGM5 (n\u00a0=\u00a04); and global cognitive deficits with good educational attainment suggesting neurodegeneration for ARMS/KIDINS220 (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Case vignettes are included in the appendix.Genes prone to missense coding polymorphisms and/or mutations in sporadic cases may highlight influential genes for psychosis and illuminate heterogeneous pathways to schizophrenia. Ethnicity appears less important at the level of genetic variability. The sequence variations that potentially alter the function of specific genes or their signaling partners may contribute to particular subtypes of psychosis. This approach may be applicable to other complex disorders.",

During study period, 457 CVID patients were included: 99 (21.7%) with severe NK cell lymphopenia, 118 (25.8%) with mild NK cell lymphopenia and 240 (52.5%) with normal NK cell counts. Non-infectious complications (57% vs. 36% and 35%), and, particularly, granulomatous complications (25.3% vs. 13.6% and 8.8%), were more frequent in patients with severe NK cell lymphopenia than in other groups.

A 1\u00a0\u00b0C temperature reduction increased respiratory (2.90%, 1.84\u20133.97) and cardiovascular (1.66%, 1.19\u20132.14) mortality. The greatest risk was associated with cold-induced pneumonia (6.89%, 20\u201312.99) and respiratory morbidity (4.93% 1.54\u20138.44). A 1\u00a0\u00b0C temperature rise increased cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary, infectious disease and heat-related morbidity.Elevated risks for the elderly were prominent for temperature-induced cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, diabetes, genitourinary, infectious disease, heat-related, and respiratory outcomes. These risks will likely increase with climate change and global ageing.",

The expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in human tumors, causing the alteration of molecular mechanisms relevant for cancer progression. Importantly, miRNAs are detectable in the blood and their quantity fluctuations are the hallmark of pathogenic conditions, including cancer. Several groups reported the identification of circulating cell-free miRNAs (cf-miRNAs) in the human serum and plasma and demonstrated their diagnostic and prognostic utility. Other studies also shown that it may be feasible to apply such cf-miRNA signatures within screening programs in order to improve cancer early detection. Circulating cf-miRNAs therefore appear to be excellent candidates for blood-borne cancer biomarkers.",

Delivering antigen to DCs via surface receptors is thus an appealing strategy to evoke cellular immunity. Nonetheless, which DC surface receptor to target to yield the optimal CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses remains elusive. Herein, we report the superiority of CD40 over 9 different lectins and scavenger receptors at evoking antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. However, lectins (e.g., LOX-1 and Dectin-1) were more efficient than CD40 at eliciting CD4+ T cell responses. Common and distinct patterns of subcellular and intracellular localization of receptor-bound \u03b1CD40, \u03b1LOX-1 and \u03b1Dectin-1 further support their functional specialization at enhancing antigen presentation to either CD8+ or CD4+ T cells.

Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) evades CD8+ T-cells by producing ICP47, which limits immune recognition of infected cells by inhibiting the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Surprisingly, removing ICP47 was assumed to benefit OV immuno-therapy, but the impact of inhibiting TAP remains unknown because human HSV-1 ICP47 is not effective in rodents. Here, we engineer an HSV-1 OV to produce bovine herpesvirus UL49.5, which unlike ICP47, antagonizes rodent and human TAP. Significantly, UL49.5-expressing OVs showed superior efficacy treating bladder and breast cancer in murine models that was dependent upon CD8+ T-cells. Besides injected subcutaneous tumors, UL49.5-OV reduced untreated, contralateral tumor size and metastases. These findings establish TAP inhibitor-armed OVs that evade CD8+ T-cells as an immunotherapy strategy to elicit potent local and systemic anti-tumor responses.",

We examined whether blood \u0394age (the discrepancy between epigenetic and chronological ages) can predict cancer incidence or mortality, thus assessing its potential as a cancer biomarker. In a prospective cohort, \u0394age and its rate of change over time were calculated in 834 blood leukocyte samples collected from 442 participants free of cancer at blood draw. About 3\u20135\u00a0years before cancer onset or death, \u0394age was associated with cancer risks in a dose-responsive manner (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and a one-year increase in \u0394age was associated with cancer incidence (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.10) and mortality (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.07\u20131.28).

However, its roles in vivo are largely unknown. Here, we show that Pgam5-deficient mice are resistant to several metabolic insults. Under cold stress combined with fasting, Pgam5-deficient mice better maintained body temperature than wild-type mice and showed an extended survival rate. Serum triglycerides and lipid content in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a center of adaptive thermogenesis, were severely reduced in Pgam5-deficient mice. Moreover, although Pgam5 deficiency failed to maintain proper mitochondrial integrity in BAT, it reciprocally resulted in the dramatic induction of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) that activates various functions of BAT including thermogenesis. Thus, the enhancement of lipid metabolism and FGF21 may contribute to the cold resistance of Pgam5-deficient mice under fasting condition. Finally, we also found that Pgam5-deficient mice are resistant to high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Our study uncovered that PGAM5 is involved in the whole-body metabolism in response to stresses that impose metabolic challenges on mitochondria.",

Our findings demonstrate that activating the pyruvate-PEP futile cycle in skeletal muscle is the primary cause of elevated lipolysis in adipose tissues of miR-378 transgenic mice, and it helps orchestrate the crosstalk between muscle and fat to control energy homeostasis in mice.

Since glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) activity, ApoE genotypes and olfactory function are involved in both T2DM and AD pathogenesis, we investigate whether alterations of these factors can identify cognitive impairment in T2DM patients.The cognitive ability was evaluated using Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed by Petersen's criteria. GSK-3\u03b2 activity in platelet, ApoE genotypes in leucocytes and the olfactory function were detected by Western/dot blotting, the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR and the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the biomarkers for MCI diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression. The diagnostic capability of the biomarkers was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses.We recruited 694 T2DM patients from Jan. 2012 to May. 2015 in 5 hospitals (Wuhan), and 646 of them met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. 345 patients in 2 hospitals were assigned to the training set, and 301 patients in another 3 hospitals assigned to the validation set. Patients in each set were randomly divided into two groups: T2DM without MCI (termed T2DM-nMCI) or with MCI (termed T2DM-MCI). There were no significant differences for sex, T2DM years, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, complications, insulin treatment, HbA1c, ApoE \u03b52, ApoE \u03b53, tGSK3\u03b2 and pS9GSK3\u03b2 between the two groups. Compared with the T2DM-nMCI group, T2DM-MCI group showed lower MMSE score with older age, ApoE \u03b54 allele, higher olfactory score and higher rGSK-3\u03b2 (ratio of total GSK-3\u03b2 to Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2) in the training set and the validation set. The OR values of age, ApoE \u03b54 gene, olfactory score and rGSK-3\u03b2 were 1.09, 2.09, 1.51, 10.08 in the training set, and 1.06, 2.67, 1.47, 7.19 in the validation set, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of age, ApoE \u03b54 gene, olfactory score and rGSK-3\u03b2 were 0.76, 0.72, 0.66, 0.79 in the training set, and 0.70, 0.68, 0.73, 0.79 in the validation set, respectively. These four combined biomarkers had the area under the curve (AUC) of 82% and 86%, diagnostic accuracy of 83% and 81% in the training set and the validation set, respectively.Aging, activation of peripheral circulating GSK-3\u03b2, expression of ApoE \u03b54 and increase of olfactory score are diagnostic for the mild cognitive impairment in T2DM patients, and combination of these biomarkers can improve the diagnostic accuracy.",

Here we demonstrate that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17), a main sheddase for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, is essential for defensive epithelial properties against UC by promoting epithelial cell growth and goblet cell differentiation in mouse and human. Mice with systemic deletion of Adam17 developed severe dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis when compared to mice with myeloid cell Adam17 deletion or control littermates. ADAM17 was predominantly expressed by regenerating epithelia in control mice, and its loss or inhibition attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, epithelial proliferation, mucus production and barrier functions. Conversely, ectopic EGFR stimulation promoted epithelial regeneration thereby partially rescuing the severe colitis caused by ADAM17 deficiency. In UC patients, epithelial ADAM17 expression positively correlated with both cell proliferation and goblet cell number. These findings suggest that maintaining ADAM17\u2013EGFR epithelial signaling is necessary for the recovery from UC and would be beneficial to therapeutic strategies targeting ADAM17-mediated TNF-\u03b1 shedding.",

We analyzed results by antipsychotic type, antipsychotic dose equivalent, anticholinergic load, duration of treatment, gender, ethnicity, and age.For patients not prescribed clozapine, median colonic transit time was 23\u00a0h. For patients prescribed clozapine, median transit time was 104.5\u00a0h, over four times longer than those on other antipsychotics or normative values (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Eighty percent of clozapine-treated patients had colonic hypomotility, compared with none of those prescribed other antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone aripiprazole, zuclopenthixol or haloperidol). In the clozapine group, right colon, left colon and rectosigmoid transit times were all markedly abnormal suggesting pan-colonic pathology.

Moreover, MSM had a significantly richer and more diverse fecal microbiota than non-MSM individuals. After stratifying for sexual orientation, there was no solid evidence of an HIV-specific dysbiosis. However, HIV-1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness, the lowest bacterial richness being observed in subjects with a virological-immune discordant response to antiretroviral therapy.

Two subjects (1 subject who received 30\u00a0mg/kg VIS410 and 1 subject who received placebo) experienced serious AEs (Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs) that were not related to study drug. VIS410 exposure was approximately dose-proportional with a mean half-life of 12.9\u00a0days. Mean VIS410 Cmax levels in the upper respiratory tract were 20.0 and 25.3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml at the 30\u00a0mg/kg and 50\u00a0mg/kg doses, respectively, with corresponding serum Cmax levels of 980.5 and 1316\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Using these pharmacokinetic data, a microsimulation model showed that median attack rate reductions ranged from 8.6% (interquartile range (IQR): 4.7%\u201311.0%) for 2% coverage to 22.6% (IQR: 12.7\u201330.0%) for 6% coverage. The overall benefits to the elderly, a vulnerable subgroup, are largest when VIS410 is distributed exclusively to elderly individuals, resulting in reductions in hospitalization rates between 11.4% (IQR: 8.2%\u201313.3%) for 2% coverage and 30.9% (IQR: 24.8%\u201335.1%) for 6% coverage among those more than 65\u00a0years of age.VIS410 was generally safe and well tolerated and had good relative exposure in both serum and upper respiratory tract, supporting its use as either a single-dose therapeutic or prophylactic for influenza A. Including VIS410 prophylaxis among the public health interventions for seasonal influenza has the potential to lower attack rates and substantially reduce hospitalizations in individuals over the age of 65.Visterra, Inc.",

     "abstract": "Otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases worldwide, but because of lack of doctors and health personnel in developing countries it is often misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. This may lead to serious, and life-threatening complications. There is, thus a need for an automated computer based image-analyzing system that could assist in making accurate otitis media diagnoses anywhere.A method for automated diagnosis of otitis media is proposed. The method uses image-processing techniques to classify otitis media. The system is trained using high quality pre-assessed images of tympanic membranes, captured by digital video-otoscopes, and classifies undiagnosed images into five otitis media categories based on predefined signs. Several verification tests analyzed the classification capability of the method.An accuracy of 80.6% was achieved for images taken with commercial video-otoscopes, while an accuracy of 78.7% was achieved for images captured on-site with a low cost custom-made video-otoscope.The high accuracy of the proposed otitis media classification system compares well with the classification accuracy of general practitioners and pediatricians (~\u00a064% to 80%) using traditional otoscopes, and therefore holds promise for the future in making automated diagnosis of otitis media in medically underserved populations.",

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of protective natural autoantibodies among patients with RHD in Uganda, and to determine whether the levels of these autoantibodies are affected by HIV status.Participants were grouped according to RHD and HIV status. The three control groups (RHD\u00a0\u2212\u00a0HIV\u00a0\u2212, RHD\u00a0\u2212\u00a0HIV\u00a0+, RHD\u00a0+\u00a0HIV\u00a0\u2212) were age-matched to the RHD\u00a0+\u00a0HIV\u00a0+ participants. All participants underwent HIV testing and echocardiography to evaluate for RHD. Natural autoantibody levels reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured.We enrolled 220 participants; 21 with both RHD and HIV. Ages ranged from 10 to 60\u00a0years, with female predominance (144/220, 65%). After adjusting for age and gender, HIV infection and RHD were each associated with low IgM anti-PC (HIV: p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 and RHD: p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). A distinct HIV\u00a0\u2217\u00a0RHD interaction was identified (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) with increased IgG anti-MDA levels in HIV infected subjects without RHD, whereas IgG anti-MDA levels were decreased in HIV infected subjects with RHD.We found that HIV and RHD are associated with alterations in natural autoantibody responses previously linked to an increased risk for atherosclerosis and autoimmune inflammatory disease.",

Decreased BMPR2 expression was seen in lung tissue from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.The selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BMPR2 were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ligase detection reaction. The effects of SNPs on gene expression were analyzed with luciferase assays. The mRNA and protein expression levels of BMPR2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COPD patients were determined by quantitative PCR and western blotting, respectively.Two SNPs, rs6435156C\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs1048829G\u00a0>\u00a0T in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of BMPR2 were selected and genotyped in COPD case and healthy control subjects from southern Chinese population.

Older age, cigarette smoking, family history of cancer and COPD were all factors that interacted with rs6435156C\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs1048829G\u00a0>\u00a0T causing increased COPD risk. Cigarette smokers with rs6435156 (CT\u00a0+\u00a0TT) or rs1048829 (GT\u00a0+\u00a0TT) were more susceptible to COPD than that with the rs6435156CC or rs1048829GG genotypes. In A549 human alveolar epithelial cells, luciferase reporter assays revealed that introduction of 3\u2032UTR of BMPR2 plasmids carrying rs6435156T allele but not rs1048829T led to lower luciferase activity than the wild-type C or G alleles. Comparing to rs6435156CC, treatment with hsa-miR-20a mimics deceased whereas hsa-miR-20a inhibitor restored the luciferase reporter activity in cells transfected with constructs carrying rs6435156TT. BMPR2 mRNA and protein expressions were significantly lower in PBMCs from COPD smokers than that in non-smokers. COPD patients carrying rs6435156T allele had less BMPR2 expression in PBMCs.This study demonstrated that both rs6435156C\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs1048829G\u00a0>\u00a0T variants in BMPR2 contributed to increased susceptibility to COPD. The T variants of rs6435156 increased COPD risk likely by binding with hsa-miR-20a, thus leading to downregulated BMPR2 expression in lung epithelial and immune cells.",

Leukocyte recruitment is a key step, mediated partly by chemotactic complement activation factors C3a and C5a. However, mechanisms mediating C3a/C5a generation during thrombosis have not been studied. In a murine venous thrombosis model, levels of thrombin\u2013antithrombin complexes poorly correlated with C3a and C5a, excluding a central role for thrombin in C3a/C5a production. However, clot weight strongly correlated with C5a, suggesting processes triggered during thrombosis promote C5a generation. Since thrombosis elicits fibrinolysis, we hypothesized that plasmin activates C5 during thrombosis. In vitro, the catalytic efficiency of plasmin-mediated C5a generation greatly exceeded that of thrombin or factor Xa, but was similar to the recognized complement C5 convertases. Plasmin-activated C5 yielded a functional membrane attack complex (MAC). In an arterial thrombosis model, plasminogen activator administration increased C5a levels. Overall, these findings suggest plasmin bridges thrombosis and the immune response by liberating C5a and inducing MAC assembly. These new insights may lead to the development of strategies to limit thrombus formation and/or enhance resolution.",

We have used a systems-based approach to examine the effects of acquired loss of Pkd1 in adult mouse kidney as it transitions from normal to cystic state.We performed transcriptional profiling of a large set of male and female kidneys, along with metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of a subset of male kidneys. We also assessed the effects of a modest diet change on cyst progression in young cystic mice. Fatty acid oxidation and glycolytic rates were measured in five control and mutant pairs of epithelial cells.We find that females have a significantly less severe kidney phenotype and correlate this protection with differences in lipid metabolism. We show that sex is a major determinant of the transcriptional profile of mouse kidneys and that some of this difference is due to genes involved in lipid metabolism. Pkd1 mutant mice have transcriptional profiles consistent with changes in lipid metabolism and distinct metabolite and complex lipid profiles in kidneys. We also show that cells lacking Pkd1 have an intrinsic fatty acid oxidation defect and that manipulation of lipid content of mouse chow modifies cystic disease.Our results suggest PKD could be a disease of altered cellular metabolism.",

The efficacy of current interventions, principal treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors, is not satisfactory and this condition presents an unmet medical need. Preclinical studies using adipose-derived stem cells to treat ED have shown promising results. Herein, we report the results of a human phase 1 trial with autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) freshly isolated after a liposuction.Seventeen men suffering from post RP ED, with no recovery using conventional therapy, were enrolled in a prospective phase 1 open-label and single-arm study. All subjects had RP performed 5\u201318\u00a0months before enrolment, and were followed for 6\u00a0months after intracavernosal transplantation. ADRCs were analyzed for the presence of stem cell surface markers, viability and ability to differentiate. Primary endpoint was the safety and tolerance of the cell therapy while the secondary outcome was improvement of erectile function. Any adverse events were reported and erectile function was assessed by IIEF-5 scores. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02240823.Intracavernous injection of ADRCs was well-tolerated and only minor events related to the liposuction and cell injections were reported at the one-month evaluation, but none at later time points. Overall during the study period, 8 of 17 men recovered their erectile function and were able to accomplish sexual intercourse. Post-hoc stratification according to urinary continence status was performed. Accordingly, for continent men (median IIEFinclusion\u00a0=\u00a07 (95% CI 5\u201312), 8 out of 11 men recovered erectile function (IIEF6months\u00a0=\u00a017 (6\u201323)), corresponding to a mean difference of 0.57 (0.38\u20130.85; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0069), versus inclusion.

This disruption is due to immune, structural and microbial alterations. In this review, we highlighted the key findings of gut mucosa studies of SIV-infected macaques and HIV-infected humans that have revealed virus-induced changes of intestinal CD4, CD8 T cells, innate lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and of the local cytokine/chemokine network in addition to epithelial injuries.

We show that these compounds switch T cell metabolism to fatty acid oxidation as favoured metabolic programme for TSCM cell generation. Of note, pharmacologically induced TSCM cells possess superior functional features as a long-term repopulation capacity after adoptive transfer.

We further show that manipulation of Twist1 levels by genetic approaches or by exposure to widely used culture supplements including fibroblast growth factor 2 (Ffg2) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) alters MSC efficacy in cell-based and in vivo assays in a predictable manner. Thus, by mechanistically linking stem/progenitor and effector functions our studies provide a unifying framework in the form of an MSC hierarchy that models the functional complexity of populations. Using this framework, we developed a CLinical Indications Prediction (CLIP) scale that predicts how donor-to-donor heterogeneity and culture conditions impact the therapeutic efficacy of MSC populations for different disease indications.",

     "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity worldwide. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the pattern of angiogenic endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and apoptotic endothelial cell-derived microparticles (EMPs) would be able to differentiate HF with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction.One hundred sixty four chronic HF subjects met inclusion criteria. Patients with global left ventricular ejection fraction \u2265\u00a050% were categorized as the HFpEF group (n\u00a0=\u00a079) and those with \u2264\u00a045% as the HFrEF group (n\u00a0=\u00a085). Therefore, to compare the circulating levels of biological markers 35 control subjects without HF were included in the study. All control individuals were age- and sex-matched chronic HF patients. The serum level of biomarkers was measured at baseline. The flow cytometric technique was used for predictably distinguishing circulating cell subsets depending on expression of CD45, CD34, CD14, Tie-2, and CD309 antigens and determining endothelial cell-derived microparticles. CD31+/annexin V+ was defined as apoptotic endothelial cell-derived MPs, MPs labeled for CD105+ or CD62E+ were determined as MPs produced due to activation of endothelial cells.In multivariate logistic regression model T2DM (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.26; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), obesity (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.22; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), previous MI (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.17; P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), galectin-3 (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.67; P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), CD31+/annexin V+ EMPs (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.11; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), NT-proBNP (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.11; P\u00a0=\u00a00.046), CD14+\u00a0CD309+ cells (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.058; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and CD14+\u00a0\u0421D309+ Tie-2+ cells (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.044; P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) were found as independent predictors of HFpEF. Using multivariate Cox-regression analysis adjusted etiology (previous myocardial infarction), cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus) we found that NT-proBNP (OR 1.08; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20131.12; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and CD31+/annexin V+ EMPs to CD14+\u00a0CD309+ cell ratio (OR 1.06; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20131.11; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) were independent predictors for HFpEF.We found that CD31+/annexin V+ EMPs to CD14+\u00a0CD309+ cell ratio added to NT-proBNP, clinical data, and cardiovascular risk factors has exhibited the best discriminate value and higher reliability to predict HFpEF compared with NT-proBNP and clinical data/cardiovascular risk factors alone.",

The failure to initiate the correct therapy in a timely fashion results in poor clinical outcomes, longer hospital stays, and higher medical costs. Current approaches to antibiotic susceptibility testing of cultured pathogens have key limitations ranging from long run times to dependence on prior knowledge of genetic mechanisms of resistance. We have developed a rapid antimicrobial susceptibility assay for Staphylococcus aureus based on bacterial cytological profiling (BCP), which uses quantitative fluorescence microscopy to measure antibiotic induced changes in cellular architecture. BCP discriminated between methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) clinical isolates of S. aureus (n\u00a0=\u00a071) within 1\u20132\u00a0h with 100% accuracy. Similarly, BCP correctly distinguished daptomycin susceptible (DS) from daptomycin non-susceptible (DNS) S. aureus strains (n\u00a0=\u00a020) within 30\u00a0min. Among MRSA isolates, BCP further identified two classes of strains that differ in their susceptibility to specific combinations of beta-lactam antibiotics. BCP provides a rapid and flexible alternative to gene-based susceptibility testing methods for S. aureus, and should be readily adaptable to different antibiotics and bacterial species as new mechanisms of resistance or multidrug-resistant pathogens evolve and appear in mainstream clinical practice.",

Rabbits were infected with virulent Mtb by aerosol exposure and treated for eight weeks with INH with or without CC-11050, starting at four weeks post infection. The effect of CC-11050 treatment on disease severity, pathology, bacillary load, T cell proliferation and global lung transcriptome profiles were analyzed.Significant improvement in bacillary clearance and reduced lung pathology and fibrosis were noted in the rabbits treated for eight weeks with INH\u00a0+\u00a0CC-11050, compared to those treated with INH or CC-11050 only. In addition, expression of host genes associated with tissue remodeling, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) regulation, macrophage activation and lung inflammation networks was dampened in CC-11050-treated, compared to the untreated rabbits.Adjunctive CC-11050 therapy significantly improves the response of rabbits with experimental pulmonary TB to INH treatment. We propose that CC-11050 may be a promising candidate for host directed therapy of patients with pulmonary TB, reducing the duration and improving clinical outcome of antibiotic treatment.",

Phage therapy (PT), the use of bacterial viruses infecting the pathogen in a species-specific way, is a potential alternative.T4-like coliphages or a commercial Russian coliphage product or placebo was orally given over 4\u00a0days to Bangladeshi children hospitalized with acute bacterial diarrhea. Safety of oral phage was assessed clinically and by functional tests; coliphage and Escherichia coli titers and enteropathogens were determined in stool and quantitative diarrhea parameters (stool output, stool frequency) were measured. Stool microbiota was studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing; the genomes of four fecal Streptococcus isolates were sequenced.No adverse events attributable to oral phage application were observed (primary safety outcome). Fecal coliphage was increased in treated over control children, but the titers did not show substantial intestinal phage replication (secondary microbiology outcome). 60% of the children suffered from a microbiologically proven E. coli diarrhea; the most frequent diagnosis was ETEC infections. Bacterial co-pathogens were also detected. Half of the patients contained phage-susceptible E. coli colonies in the stool. E. coli represented less than 5% of fecal bacteria. Stool ETEC titers showed only a short-lived peak and were otherwise close to the replication threshold determined for T4 phage in vitro. An interim analysis after the enrollment of 120 patients showed no amelioration in quantitative diarrhea parameter by PT over standard care (tertiary clinical outcome). Stool microbiota was characterized by an overgrowth with Streptococcus belonging to the Streptococcus gallolyticus and Streptococcus salivarius species groups, their abundance correlated with quantitative diarrhea outcome, but genome sequencing did not identify virulence genes.Oral coliphages showed a safe gut transit in children, but failed to achieve intestinal amplification and to improve diarrhea outcome, possibly due to insufficient phage coverage and too low E. coli pathogen titers requiring higher oral phage doses.

In one case without a tissue diagnosis, ctDNA enabled a diagnosis of GTN originating in a non-molar conception and in another a diagnosis of non-gestational tumor, based on the high degree of allelic instability and loss of heterozygosity in the ctDNA. In summary ctDNA can be detected in the plasma of women with GTN and can facilitate the diagnosis of both gestational and non-gestational trophoblastic tumors in cases without histopathological diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are complicated by wide variability in the intensity and duration of prior stressors in patient participants, secondary effects of chronic psychiatric illness, and a variable history of treatment with psychiatric medications. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, patient samples have often been small, and they were not often compared to similarly stressed patients without PTSD in order to control for general stress effects. Findings from these studies have been inconsistent. The present study investigated whole-brain microstructural alterations of white matter in a large drug-naive population who survived a specific, severe traumatic event (a major 8.0-magnitude earthquake). Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we explored group differences between 88 PTSD patients and 91 matched traumatized non-PTSD controls in fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as its component elements axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD), and examined these findings in relation to findings from deterministic DTI tractography. Relations between white matter alterations and psychiatric symptom severity were examined. PTSD patients, relative to similarly stressed controls, showed an FA increase as well as AD and RD changes in the white matter beneath left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and forceps major. The observation of increased FA in the PTSD group suggests that the pathophysiology of PTSD after a specific acute traumatic event is distinct from what has been reported in patients with several years duration of illness. Alterations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be an important aspect of illness pathophysiology, possibly via the region's established role in fear extinction circuitry. Use-dependent myelination or other secondary compensatory changes in response to heightened demands for threat appraisal and emotion regulation may be involved.",

Of 68,921 patients attending the emergency room in 10/2010\u201306/2013, 11,575 were hospitalized, with 521 eligible patients (mean age: 7.6\u00a0years) entering the quality management program. Using the VACC-Tool at the point-of-care, 180/521 cases were classified successfully and 194/521 ruled out with certainty. Of the 180 confirmed cases, 116 had been missed by ICD-10 coding, 38 misclassified. By retrospective application of the same case criteria, 33 cases were missed. Encephalitis and ADEM cases were most likely missed or misclassified. The VACC-Tool enables physicians to ask the right questions at the right time, thereby classifying cases consistently and accurately, facilitating translational research. Future applications will alert physicians when additional diagnostic procedures are required.",

JAK inhibitors ameliorate symptoms and address splenomegaly, but because of the heterogeneous contributors to the disease process, JAK inhibitor monotherapy incompletely addresses the burden of disease. The ever-growing understanding of MPN pathogenesis has provided the rationale for testing novel and targeted therapeutic agents, as monotherapies or in combination, in preclinical and clinical settings. A number of intriguing options have emerged, and it is hoped that further progress will lead to significant changes in the natural history of MPNs.",

     "abstract": "Obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with decreased cognitive function. While weight loss and T2D remission result in improvements in metabolism and vascular function, it is less clear if these benefits extend to cognitive performance. Here, we highlight the malleable nature of MetS-associated cognitive dysfunction using a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced MetS. While learning and memory was generally unaffected in mice with type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple cognitive impairments were associated with MetS, including deficits in novel object recognition, cued fear memory, and spatial learning and memory. However, a brief reduction in dietary fat content in chronic HFD-fed mice led to a complete rescue of cognitive function. Cerebral blood volume (CBV), a measure of vascular perfusion, was decreased during MetS, was associated with long term memory, and recovered following the intervention. Finally, repeated infusion of plasma collected from age-matched, low fat diet-fed mice improved memory in HFD mice, and was associated with a distinct metabolic profile. Thus, the cognitive dysfunction accompanying MetS appears to be amenable to treatment, related to cerebrovascular function, and mitigated by systemic factors.",

To limit the deleterious effects of excess ROS, certain gene promoters contain antioxidant response elements (ARE), e.g. the genes NQO-1 and HO-1. ROS induces conformational changes in KEAP1 and releases NRF2, which activates AREs. We show in vitro and in vivo that OXPHOS induces, both in primary leukemic cells and cell lines, de novo expression of NQO-1 and HO-1 and also the MAPK ERK5 and decreases KEAP1 mRNA. ERK5 activates the transcription factor MEF2, which binds to the promoter of the miR-23a\u201327a\u201324-2 cluster. Newly generated miR-23a destabilizes KEAP1 mRNA by binding to its 3\u2032UTR. Lower KEAP1 levels increase the basal expression of the NRF2-dependent genes NQO-1 and HO-1. Hence, leukemic cells performing OXPHOS, independently of de novo ROS production, generate an antioxidant response to protect themselves from ROS.",

Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients. Our study suggests that alectinib, PF-06463922, or P-gp inhibitor with ceritinib could overcome the ceritinib or crizotinib resistance mediated by P-gp overexpression.",

The identification of adjuvants that augment immunogenicity, specifically in a manner that is durable and antigen-specific, is therefore critical for advanced development. In this study, we use the filovirus virus-like particle (VLP) as a model protein-based vaccine in order to evaluate the impact of four candidate vaccine adjuvants on enhancing long term protection from Ebola virus challenge. Adjuvants tested include poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), MPLA, CpG 2395, and alhydrogel. We compared and contrasted antibody responses, neutralizing antibody responses, effector T cell responses, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell frequencies with each adjuvant's impact on durable protection. We demonstrate that in this system, the most effective adjuvant elicits a Th1-skewed antibody response and strong CD4 T cell responses, including an increase in Tfh frequency. Using immune-deficient animals and adoptive transfer of serum and cells from vaccinated animals into na\u00efve animals, we further demonstrate that serum and CD4 T cells play a critical role in conferring protection within effective vaccination regimens. These studies inform on the requirements of long term immune protection, which can potentially be used to guide screening of clinical-grade adjuvants for vaccine clinical development.",

In addition, each participant rated symptom severity in 6 domains according to established GWI criteria, and an overall symptom severity was calculated.We found 6 Class II alleles that classified participants 84.1% correctly (13/16 control and 56/66 GWI). The number of copies of the 6 alleles was significantly higher in the control group, suggesting a protective role. This was supported by a significant negative dependence of overall symptom severity on the number of allele copies, such that symptom severity was lower in participants with larger numbers of allele copies.These results indicate a reduced HLA protection (i.e. genetic susceptibility) in veterans with GWI.University of Minnesota and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",

The antibody specificity was verified by IHC staining of multiple tissue sections from other infectious disease cases. RV infection of each cell type is consistent with abnormalities which have been identified in patients with CRS, in the heart, large blood vessels, and brain.

Latency reversal was strongly induced by BAFi's Caffeic Acid Phenethyl Ester and Pyrimethamine, two molecules previously characterized for clinical application. BAFi's reversed HIV-1 latency in cell line based latency models, in two ex vivo infected primary cell models of latency, as well as in HIV-1 infected patient's CD4\u00a0+ T cells, without inducing T cell proliferation or activation.

Despite its importance for HIV-1 pathogenesis, the precise mechanisms underlying CD4\u00a0+ T-cell depletion remain incompletely understood. Here we make the surprising observation that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediates the death of uninfected bystander CD4\u00a0+ T cells in cultures of HIV-1-infected cells. While HIV-1-infected cells are protected from ADCC by the action of the viral Vpu and Nef proteins, uninfected bystander CD4\u00a0+\u00a0T cells bind gp120 shed from productively infected cells and are efficiently recognized by ADCC-mediating antibodies. Thus, gp120 shedding represents a viral mechanism to divert ADCC responses towards uninfected bystander CD4\u00a0+ T cells. Importantly, CD4-mimetic molecules redirect ADCC responses from uninfected bystander cells to HIV-1-infected cells; therefore, CD4-mimetic compounds might have therapeutic utility in new strategies aimed at specifically eliminating HIV-1-infected cells.",

However, an important limitation is the requirement for lumbar puncture. For this reason, a sensitive and reliable blood biomarker of CNS injury would represent a welcome advance in both clinical and research settings.To explore whether plasma concentrations of NFL might be used to detect CNS injury in HIV infection, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay was developed. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured NFL in paired CSF and plasma samples from 121 HIV-infected subjects divided into groups according to stage of their systemic disease, presence of overt HIV-associated dementia (HAD), and after antiretroviral treatment (ART)-induced viral suppression. HIV-negative controls were also examined.Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations were very highly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.89, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). While NFL was more than 50-fold lower plasma than CSF it was within the quantifiable range of the new plasma assay in all subjects, including the HIV negatives and the HIV positives with normal CSF NFL concentrations. The pattern of NFL changes were almost identical in plasma and CSF, both exhibiting similar age-related increases in concentrations along with highest values in HAD and substantial elevations in ART-na\u00efve neuroasymptomatic subjects with low blood CD4+ T cells.These results show that plasma NFL may prove a valuable tool to evaluate ongoing CNS injury in HIV infection that may be applied in the clinic and in research settings to assess the presence if active CNS injury. Because CSF NFL is also elevated in a variety of other CNS disorders, sensitive measures of plasma NFL may similarly prove useful in other settings.",

     "abstract": "Hypothermia is potently neuroprotective, but the molecular basis of this effect remains obscure. Changes in neuronal tau protein are of interest, since tau becomes hyperphosphorylated in injury-resistant, hypothermic brains. Noting inter-species differences in tau isoforms, we have used functional cortical neurons differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (hCNs) to interrogate tau modulation during hypothermic preconditioning at clinically-relevant temperatures. Key tau developmental transitions (phosphorylation status and splicing shift) are recapitulated during hCN differentiation and subsequently reversed by mild (32\u00a0\u00b0C) to moderate (28\u00a0\u00b0C) cooling \u2014 conditions which reduce oxidative and excitotoxic stress-mediated injury in hCNs. Blocking a major tau kinase decreases hCN tau phosphorylation and abrogates hypothermic neuroprotection, whilst inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A mimics cooling-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and protects normothermic hCNs from oxidative stress. These findings indicate a possible role for phospho-tau in hypothermic preconditioning, and suggest that cooling drives human tau towards an earlier ontogenic phenotype whilst increasing neuronal resilience to common neurotoxic insults. This work provides a critical step forward in understanding how we might exploit the neuroprotective benefits of cooling without cooling patients.",

In the validation phase, the values of models were further tested for AD diagnosis using samples of 861 control subjects, 81 AD patients, 70 vascular dementia patients, and 13 frontotemporal dementia patients.TDP and the \u03b3 exhibited significant and consistent values for AD diagnosis in both exploration and validation phases. TDP had 0.843 and 0.837 of the areas under ROC curve (AUCs), 77.4% and 81.5% of sensitivities, and 78.1% and 77.2% of specificities respectively in the exploration and validation phases.

     "abstract": "Despite long-standing calls to disseminate evidence-based treatments for generalized anxiety (GAD), modest progress has been made in the study of how such treatments should be implemented. The primary objective of this study was to test three competing strategies on how to implement a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for out-patients with GAD (i.e., comparison of one compensation vs. two capitalization models).For our three-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (implementation of CBT for GAD [IMPLEMENT]), we recruited adults with GAD using advertisements in high-circulation newspapers to participate in a 14-session cognitive behavioral treatment (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry, MAW-packet). We randomly assigned eligible patients using a full randomization procedure (1:1:1) to three different conditions of implementation: adherence priming (compensation model), which had a systematized focus on patients' individual GAD symptoms and how to compensate for these symptoms within the MAW-packet, and resource priming and supportive resource priming (capitalization model), which had systematized focuses on patients' strengths and abilities and how these strengths can be capitalized within the same packet. In the intention-to-treat population an outcome composite of primary and secondary symptoms-related self-report questionnaires was analyzed based on a hierarchical linear growth model from intake to 6-month follow-up assessment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02039193) and is closed to new participants.From June 2012 to Nov. 2014, from 411 participants that were screened, 57 eligible participants were recruited and randomly assigned to three conditions. Forty-nine patients (86%) provided outcome data at post-assessment (14% dropout rate). All three conditions showed a highly significant reduction of symptoms over time. However, compared with the adherence priming condition, both resource priming conditions indicated faster symptom reduction. The observer ratings of a sub-sample of recorded videos (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) showed that the therapists in the resource priming conditions conducted more strength-oriented interventions in comparison with the adherence priming condition. No patients died or attempted suicide.To our knowledge, this is the first trial that focuses on capitalization and compensation models during the implementation of one prescriptive treatment packet for GAD. We have shown that GAD related symptoms were significantly faster reduced by the resource priming conditions, although the limitations of our study included a well-educated population. If replicated, our results suggest that therapists who implement a mental health treatment for GAD might profit from a systematized focus on capitalization models.Swiss Science National Foundation (SNSF-Nr.

This study sought to clarify the relationship of dysbiosis with allergies in adults.Publicly available American Gut Project questionnaire and fecal 16S rRNA sequence data were analyzed. Fecal microbiota richness (number of observed species) and composition (UniFrac) were used to compare adults with versus without allergy to foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, other) and non-foods (drug, bee sting, dander, asthma, seasonal, eczema). Logistic and Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for lowest vs highest richness tertile.

This paper presents a systematic assessment of research investments awarded to UK institutions and global health metrics assessing disease burden.We systematically sourced research funding data awarded from public and philanthropic organisations between 1997 and 2013. We screened awards for relevance to infection and categorised data by type of science, disease area and specific pathogen. Investments were compared with mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLD) across three time points.Between 1997\u20132013, there were 7398 awards with a total investment of \u00a33.7 billion. An increase in research funding across 2011\u20132013 was observed for most disease areas, with notable exceptions being sexually transmitted infections and sepsis research where funding decreased. Most funding remains for pre-clinical research (\u00a32.2 billion, 59.4%). Relative to global mortality, DALYs and YLDs, acute hepatitis C, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis received comparatively high levels of funding. Pneumonia, shigellosis, pertussis, cholera and syphilis were poorly funded across all health metrics. Tuberculosis (TB) consistently attracts relatively less funding than HIV and malaria.Most infections have received increases in research investment, alongside decreases in global burden of disease in 2013. The UK demonstrates research strengths in some neglected tropical diseases such as African trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis, but syphilis, cholera, shigellosis and pneumonia remain poorly funded relative to their global burden. Acute hepatitis C appears well funded but the figures do not adequately take into account projected future chronic burdens for this condition. These findings can help to inform global policymakers on resource allocation for research investment.",

Although genetic deletion of mAKAP\u03b1 early in prenatal RGC development did not affect RGC survival into adulthood, nor promoted the death of RGCs in the uninjured adult retina, loss of mAKAP\u03b1 in the adult increased RGC death after optic nerve crush.

     "abstract": "White matter degeneration is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Age remains the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's and the prevalence of age-related late onset Alzheimer's is greatest in females. We investigated mechanisms underlying white matter degeneration in an animal model consistent with the sex at greatest Alzheimer's risk. Results of these analyses demonstrated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and cytosolic-phospholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain aging. Electron microscopic and lipidomic analyses confirmed myelin degeneration. An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in brain ketone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies. This mechanistic pathway and its chronologically phased activation, links mitochondrial dysfunction early in aging with later age development of white matter degeneration. The catabolism of myelin lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response to address brain fuel and energy demand. Elucidation of the initiating factors and the mechanistic pathway leading to white matter catabolism in the aging female brain provides potential therapeutic targets to prevent and treat demyelinating diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.

Patients were reviewed by a cardiologist to rule out cardiac contraindications. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to flecainide or placebo using stratified permuted blocks by a central pharmacy. The primary outcome measure was the slope of decline of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALS FRS-r) during the treatment period.Between March 11, 2008 and July 1, 2010, 67 patients were screened, 54 of whom were randomly assigned to receive flecainide (26 patients) or placebo (28 patients). Four patients in the flecainide group and three patients in the placebo group withdrew from the study. One patient in the flecainide group died during the study, attributed to disease progression. Flecainide was generally well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in either group. There was no significant difference in the rate of decline in the primary outcome measure ALS-FRS-r between placebo and flecainide treated patients (Flecainide 0.65 [95% CI 0.49 to 0.98]; Placebo 0.81 [0.49 to 2.12] P\u00a0=\u00a00.50). However, the rate of decline of the neurophysiological index was significantly reduced in the flecainide group (Flecainide 0.06 [0.01 to 0.11]; Placebo 0.14 [0.09 to 0.19], P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Flecainide-treated patients maintained stabilized peripheral axonal excitability over the study compared to placebo.This pilot study indicated that flecainide was safe and potentially biologically effective in ALS. There was evidence that flecainide stabilized peripheral axonal membrane function in ALS.

Here we report that the response of colorectal cancer (CRC) to p38 inhibitors (p38i) is highly variable: while p38i induces regression of one subgroup of CRCs, it stimulates growth of another subgroup. We further show that PP2AC is differentially expressed in the two different CRC subgroups, which determines the programing of p38-TSC-mTORC1 signaling through differential TSC2 phosphorylation at S664, 1254 and 1798, and the antitumor activity by p38i. Remarkably, modulation of PP2AC level is sufficient to reprogram p38-to-mTORC1 signaling and antitumor response. PP2AC expression accurately predicts therapeutic response to p38i in several CRC models, including a large cohort of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Moreover, we demonstrate that combination of p38 and mTOR kinase inhibitors effectively overcomes resistance to either inhibitor in single agent therapy. These results demonstrate that alternative routing of signal transduction underlies differential response to p38 and mTOR targeted therapies. The biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies described herein provide a compelling reason for testing in metastatic CRC patients who suffer very poor prognosis due to lack of efficacious drug therapies.",

One hundred and eight pts (23.7%) received whole breast and node irradiation. A boost dose of 10\u201316\u00a0Gy was delivered in 449 pts (98.5%). Adjuvant hormonotherapy was administered to 349 pts (76.5%). With a median follow-up of 38.6\u00a0months, grade \u2265\u00a02 bf\u00a0+ was observed in 64 pts (14%). A decreased incidence of grade \u2265\u00a02 bf\u00a0+ was observed for increasing values of RILA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). No grade 3 bf\u00a0+ was observed for patients with RILA \u2265\u00a012%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.62. For cut-off values of RILA \u2265\u00a020% and <\u00a012%, sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 34%, 56% and 67%, respectively. Negative predictive value for grade \u2265\u00a02 bf\u00a0+ was equal to 91% for RILA \u2265\u00a020% and positive predictive value was equal to 22% for RILA <\u00a012% where the overall prevalence of grade \u2265\u00a02 bf\u00a0+ was estimated at 14%. A significant decrease in the risk of grade \u2265\u00a02 bf\u00a0+ was found if patients had no adjuvant hormonotherapy (sHR\u00a0=\u00a00.31, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and presented a RILA \u2265\u00a012% (sHR\u00a0=\u00a00.45, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).RILA significantly predicts the risk of breast fibrosis.

The c-myc up-regulates the telomerase reverse transcriptase which adds the telomeres repeating sequences to the chromosomal ends to compensate for the progressive loss of telomeric sequence. We performed multivariate linear regression to analyze the association of PCBs, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran with leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in the adult population (n\u00a0=\u00a02413) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999\u20132002. LTL was natural log-transformed and the results were re-transformed and presented as percent differences. Individuals in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of the sum of PCBs were associated with 8.33% (95% CI: 4.08\u201313.88) and 11.63% (95% CI: 6.18\u201317.35) longer LTLs, respectively, compared with the lowest quartile, with evidence of a dose\u2013response relationship (p-trend\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The association of the sum PCBs with longer LTL was found in both sexes.Additionally, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were associated with longer LTL. The age independent association between longer LTL and environmental exposures to PCBs, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin may support a role as tumor promoter of these compounds. Further studies to evaluate the effect of these compounds on LTL are needed to more fully understand the implications of our finding.",

     "abstract": "BRCA2 mutation carriers are at increased risk for multiple cancers including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC). Our goal was to compare the effectiveness of different PAC screening strategies in BRCA2 mutation carriers, from the standpoint of life expectancy.A previously published Markov model of PAC was updated and extended to incorporate key aspects of BRCA2 mutation carrier status, including competing risks of breast- and ovarian-cancer specific mortality. BRCA2 mutation carriers were modeled and analyzed as the primary cohort for the analysis. Additional higher risk BRCA2 cohorts that were stratified according to the number of first-degree relatives (FDRs) with PAC were also analyzed. For each cohort, one-time screening and annual screening were evaluated, with screening starting at age 50 in both strategies. The primary outcome was net gain in life expectancy (LE) compared to no screening. Sensitivity analysis was performed on key model parameters, including surgical mortality and MRI test performance.One-time screening at age 50 resulted in a LE gain of 3.9\u00a0days for the primary BRCA2 cohort, and a gain of 5.8\u00a0days for those with BRCA2 and one FDR. Annual screening resulted in LE loss of 12.9\u00a0days for the primary cohort and 1.3\u00a0days for BRCA2 carriers with 1 FDR, but resulted in 20.6\u00a0days gained for carriers with 2 FDRs and 260\u00a0days gained for those with 3 FDRs. For patients with \u2265\u00a03 FDRs, annual screening starting at an earlier age (i.e. 35\u201340) was optimal.Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, aggressive screening regimens may be ineffective unless additional indicators of elevated risk (e.g., 2 or more FDRs) are present.

Here, we investigated VEDT in patients with pancreatic ductal neoplasia in a window-of-opportunity preoperative clinical trial to assess its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and apoptotic activity.Patients received oral VEDT at escalating doses (from 200 to 3200\u00a0mg) daily for 13\u00a0days before surgery and one dose on the day of surgery. Dose escalation followed a three-plus-three trial design. Our primary endpoints were safety, VEDT pharmacokinetics, and monitoring of VEDT-induced neoplastic cell apoptosis (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00985777).In 25 treated patients, no dose-limiting toxicity was encountered; thus no maximum-tolerated dose was reached. One patient had a drug-related adverse event (diarrhea) at a 3200-mg daily dose level. The effective half-life of VEDT was ~\u00a04\u00a0h. VEDT concentrations in plasma and exposure profiles were quite variable but reached levels that are bioactive in preclinical models. Biological activity, defined as significant induction of apoptosis in neoplastic cells as measured by increased cleaved caspase-3 levels, was seen in the majority of patients at the 400-mg to 1600-mg daily dose levels.VEDT from 200 to 1600\u00a0mg daily taken orally for 2\u00a0weeks before pancreatic surgery was well tolerated, reached bioactive levels in blood, and significantly induced apoptosis in the neoplastic cells of patients with pancreatic ductal neoplasia.

While high alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for pancreatitis, its relationship with specific types of pancreatitis and a potential threshold have not been systematically examined.We conducted a systematic literature search for studies on the association between alcohol consumption and pancreatitis based on PRISMA guidelines. Non-linear and linear random-effect dose\u2013response meta-analyses using restricted cubic spline meta-regressions and categorical meta-analyses in relation to abstainers were conducted.Seven studies with 157,026 participants and 3618 cases of pancreatitis were included into analyses.

     "abstract": "As part of the growing lifestyle diversity in modern society, there is wide variation in the time of day individuals choose to exercise. Recent surveys in the US and Japan have reported that on weekdays, more people exercise in the evening, with fewer individuals exercising in the morning or afternoon. Exercise performed in the post-prandial state has little effect on accumulated fat oxidation over 24\u00a0h (24-h fat oxidation) when energy intake is matched to energy expenditure (energy-balanced condition). The present study explored the possibility that exercise increases 24-h fat oxidation only when performed in a post-absorptive state, i.e. before breakfast.Indirect calorimetry using a metabolic chamber was performed in 10 young, non-obese men over 24\u00a0h. Subjects remained sedentary (control) or performed 60-min exercise before breakfast (morning), after lunch (afternoon), or after dinner (evening) at 50% of VO2max. All trials were designed to be energy balanced over 24\u00a0h. Time course of energy and substrate balance relative to the start of calorimetry were estimated from the differences between input (meal consumption) and output (oxidation).Fat oxidation over 24\u00a0h was increased only when exercise was performed before breakfast (control, 456\u00a0\u00b1\u00a061; morning, 717\u00a0\u00b1\u00a064; afternoon, 446\u00a0\u00b1\u00a057; and evening, 432\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044\u00a0kcal/day). Fat oxidation over 24\u00a0h was negatively correlated with the magnitude of the transient deficit in energy and carbohydrate.Under energy-balanced conditions, 24-h fat oxidation was increased by exercise only when performed before breakfast. Transient carbohydrate deficits, i.e., glycogen depletion, observed after morning exercise may have contributed to increased 24-h fat oxidation.",

     "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that causes a deficit of pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells. The complexities of overcoming autoimmunity in T1D have contributed to the challenges the research community faces when devising successful treatments with conventional immune therapies. Overcoming autoimmune T cell memory represents one of the key hurdles.In this open-label, phase 1/phase 2 study, Caucasian T1D patients (N\u00a0=\u00a015) received two treatments with the Stem Cell Educator (SCE) therapy, an approach that uses human multipotent cord blood-derived multipotent stem cells (CB-SCs). SCE therapy involves a closed-loop system that briefly treats the patient's lymphocytes with CB-SCs in vitro and returns the \u201ceducated\u201d lymphocytes (but not the CB-SCs) into the patient's blood circulation. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01350219.Clinical data demonstrated that SCE therapy was well tolerated in all subjects. The percentage of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells was significantly increased at 26\u00a0weeks and maintained through the final follow-up at 56\u00a0weeks. The percentage of CD4+ central memory T cells (TCM) was markedly and constantly increased at 18\u00a0weeks. Both CD4+ effector memory T cells (TEM) and CD8+ TEM cells were considerably decreased at 18\u00a0weeks and 26\u00a0weeks respectively. Additional clinical data demonstrated the modulation of C\u2013C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expressions on na\u00efve T, TCM, and TEM cells. Following two treatments with SCE therapy, islet \u03b2-cell function was improved and maintained in individuals with residual \u03b2-cell function, but not in those without residual \u03b2-cell function.Current clinical data demonstrated the safety and efficacy of SCE therapy in immune modulation.

Systemic administration of lansoprazole to a rat femoral fracture model increased osteoblastogenesis. Dissection of signaling pathways revealed that lansoprazole activates a noncanonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) activated kinase-1 (TAK1)\u2013p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We found by in cellulo ubiquitination studies that lansoprazole enhances polyubiquitination of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and by in vitro ubiquitination studies that the enhanced polyubiquitination of TRAF6 is attributed to the blocking of a deubiquitination enzyme, cylindromatosis (CYLD). Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of CYLD demonstrated that lansoprazole tightly fits in a pocket of CYLD where the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin lies. Lansoprazole is a potential therapeutic agent for enhancing osteoblastic differentiation.",

     "abstract": "As HIV-1 envelope immune responses are critical to vaccine related protection, most candidate HIV vaccines entering efficacy trials are based upon a clade specific design. This need for clade specific vaccine prototypes markedly reduces the implementation of potentially effective HIV vaccines. We utilized a mathematical model to determine the effectiveness of immediate roll-out of a non-clade matched vaccine with reduced efficacy compared to constructing clade specific vaccines, which would take considerable time to manufacture and test in safety and efficacy trials. We simulated the HIV epidemic in San Francisco (SF) and South Africa (SA) and projected effectiveness of three vaccination strategies: i) immediate intervention with a 20\u201340% vaccine efficacy (VE) non-matched vaccine, ii) delayed intervention by developing a 50% VE clade-specific vaccine, and iii) immediate intervention with a non-matched vaccine replaced by a clade-specific vaccine when developed. Immediate vaccination with a non-clade matched vaccine, even with reduced efficacy, would prevent thousands of new infections in SF and millions in SA over 30\u00a0years. Vaccination with 50% VE delayed for five years needs six and 12\u00a0years in SA to break-even with immediate 20 and 30% VE vaccination, respectively, while not able to surpass the impact of immediate 40% VE vaccination over 30\u00a0years. Replacing a 30% VE with a 50% VE vaccine after 5\u00a0years reduces the HIV acquisition by 5% compared to delayed vaccination. The immediate use of an HIV vaccine with reduced VE in high risk communities appears desirable over a short time line but higher VE should be the pursued to achieve strong long-term impact. Our analysis illustrates the importance of developing surrogate markers (correlates of protection) to allow bridging types of immunogenicity studies to support more rapid assessment of clade specific vaccines.",

Using hepatitis B vaccination as a model, we determined how the total immunoglobulin sequence repertoire changes following antigen exposure in humans, and compared this to sequences from vaccine-specific sorted cells. Clonal sequence expansions were seen 7\u00a0days after vaccination, which correlated with vaccine-specific plasma cell numbers. These expansions caused an increase in mutation, and a decrease in diversity and complementarity-determining region 3 sequence length in the repertoire. We also saw an increase in sequence convergence between participants 14 and 21\u00a0days after vaccination, coinciding with an increase of vaccine-specific memory cells. These features allowed development of a model for in silico enrichment of vaccine-specific sequences from the total repertoire. Identifying antigen-specific sequences from total repertoire data could aid our understanding B cell driven immunity, and be used for disease diagnostics and vaccine evaluation.",

We studied HEV seroprevalences in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection to understand the consequences of HEV superinfection in a Vietnamese population. This cross-sectional study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 and included 1318 Vietnamese patients with HBV-related liver diseases and 340 healthy controls. The case group included patients with acute (n\u00a0=\u00a026) and chronic hepatitis B (n\u00a0=\u00a0744), liver cirrhosis (n\u00a0=\u00a0160), hepatocellular carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0166) and patients with both liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0222). Anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies were assessed in patients and controls by ELISA. HEV-RNA was identified by PCR assays and sequencing. Seroprevalences of anti-HEV IgG among hepatitis B patients and controls were 45% and 31%, respectively (adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a00.034). Anti-HEV IgM seroprevalences were 11.6% and 4.7% in patients and controls, respectively (adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Seroprevalences were higher among the elder individuals. When stratifying for patient groups, those with liver cirrhosis had the highest anti-HEV IgG (52%) and anti-HEV IgM (19%) seroprevalences. Hepatitis B patients with current HEV infection had abnormal liver function tests compared to patients with past or without HEV infection. One HEV isolate was retrieved from a patient with both liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and identified as HEV genotype 3. This study indicates high prevalences of HEV infection in Vietnamese HBV patients and among healthy individuals and shows that HEV superinfection may influence the outcome and progression of HBV-related liver disease.",

Chronic condition burden and unadjusted mortality were compared across neighborhood income quintiles. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the effect of number of chronic conditions on two-year survival across income quintiles.Prevalence of five or more chronic conditions was significantly higher among older adults in the poorest neighborhoods (18.2%) than the wealthiest (14.3%) (Standardized difference\u00a0>\u00a00\u00b71). There was also a socioeconomic gradient in unadjusted mortality over two years: 10.1% of people in the poorest neighborhoods died compared with 7.6% of people in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In adjusted analyses, having more chronic conditions was associated with a statistically significant increase in hazard of death over two years, however the magnitude of this effect was comparable across income quintiles. Individuals in the poorest neighborhoods with four chronic conditions had 2.07 times higher hazard of death (95% CI: 1.97\u20132.19) than those with one chronic condition, but this was comparable to the hazard associated with four chronic conditions in the wealthiest neighborhoods (HR: 2.29, 95% CI: 2.16\u20132.43).Among older adults with universal access to health care, the deleterious effect of increasing chronic condition burden on two-year hazard of death was consistent across neighborhood income quintiles once baseline differences in condition burden were accounted for. This may be partly attributable to equal access to, and utilization of, health care. Alternate explanations for these findings, including study limitations, are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Anthrax is a rare disease in humans but elicits great public fear because of its past use as an agent of bioterrorism. Injectional anthrax has been occurring sporadically for more than ten years in heroin consumers across multiple European countries and this outbreak has been difficult to trace back to a source.We took a molecular epidemiological approach in understanding this disease outbreak, including whole genome sequencing of Bacillus anthracis isolates from the anthrax victims. We also screened two large strain repositories for closely related strains to provide context to the outbreak.Analyzing 60 Bacillus anthracis isolates associated with injectional anthrax cases and closely related reference strains, we identified 1071 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The synapomorphic SNPs (350) were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships, infer likely epidemiological sources and explore the dynamics of evolving pathogen populations. Injectional anthrax genomes separated into two tight clusters: one group was exclusively associated with the 2009\u201310 outbreak and located primarily in Scotland, whereas the second comprised more recent (2012\u201313) cases but also a single Norwegian case from 2000.Genome-based differentiation of injectional anthrax isolates argues for at least two separate disease events spanning >\u00a012\u00a0years. The genomic similarity of the two clusters makes it likely that they are caused by separate contamination events originating from the same geographic region and perhaps the same site of drug manufacturing or processing. Pathogen diversity within single patients challenges assumptions concerning population dynamics of infecting B. anthracis and host defensive barriers for injectional anthrax.This work was supported by the United States Department of Homeland Security grant no. HSHQDC-10-C-00,139 and via a binational cooperative agreement between the United States Government and the Government of Germany. This work was supported by funds from the German Ministry of Defense (Sonderforschungsprojekt 25Z1-S-431,214). Support for sequencing was also obtained from Illumina, Inc. These sources had no role in the data generation or interpretation, and had not role in the manuscript preparation.We searched PubMed for any article published before Jun. 17, 2015, with the terms \u201cBacillus anthracis\u201d and \u201cheroin\u201d, or \u201cinjectional anthrax\u201d. Other than our previously published work (Price et al., 2012), we found no other relevant studies on elucidating the global phylogenetic relationships of B. anthracis strains associated with injectional anthrax caused by recreational heroin consumption of spore-contaminated drug. There were, however, publically available genome sequences of two strains involved (Price et al., 2012, Grunow et al., 2013) and the draft genome sequence of Bacillus anthracis UR-1, isolated from a German heroin user (Ruckert et al., 2012) with only limited information on the genotyping of closely related strains (Price et al., 2012, Grunow et al., 2013).Injectional anthrax has been plaguing heroin drug users across Europe for more than 10\u00a0years. In order to better understand this outbreak, we assessed genomic relationships of all available injectional anthrax strains from four countries spanning a >\u00a012\u00a0year period. Very few differences were identified using genome-based analysis, but these differentiated the isolates into two distinct clusters. This strongly supports a hypothesis of at least two separate anthrax spore contamination events perhaps during the drug production processes. Identification of two events would not have been possible from standard epidemiological analysis. These comprehensive data will be invaluable for classifying future injectional anthrax isolates and for future geographic attribution.",

Clinical and laboratory data of 70 patients with confirmed tuberculous pericarditis, including time-to-positive (TTP) cultures from pericardial fluid, were extracted and analyzed for mortality outcomes using CART. TTP was translated to log10 colony forming units (CFUs) per mL, and compared to that obtained from sputum in some of our patients.Seventy patients with proven tuberculous pericarditis were enrolled. The median patient age was 35 (range: 20\u201371) years. The median, follow up was for 11.97 (range: 0\u00b703\u201374.73) months.

The overall mortality rate was 1.43 per 100 person-months. CART identified follow-up duration of 5\u00b723\u00a0months on directly observed therapy, a CD4\u00a0+ count of \u2264\u00a0199.5/mL, and TTP\u00a0\u2264\u00a014\u00a0days (bacillary load\u00a0\u2265\u00a05.53 log10 CFU/mL) as predictive of mortality. TTP interacted with follow-up duration in a non-linear fashion.Patients with culture confirmed tuberculous pericarditis have a high bacillary burden, and this bacterial burden drives mortality.

Antibiotics have to penetrate to site of infection at sufficient non-protein bound concentrations, and then enter bacteria to inhibit intracellular biochemical processes. The antibiotic concentrations achieved in pericardial fluid in TB pericarditis have never been measured before. We recruited two cohorts of patients with TB pericarditis, and left a pigtail catheter in-situ for serial drug concentration measurements over 24\u00a0h. Altogether, 704 drug concentrations were comodeled for pharmacokinetic analyses. The drug concentrations achieved in pericardial fluid were compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. The total rifampicin concentration pericardial-to-serum ratios in 16 paired samples were 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33. The protein concentrations of the pericardial fluid in TB pericarditis were observed to be as high as in plasma. The non-protein bound rifampicin concentrations in pericardial fluid were 4-fold lower than rifampicin MICs in the pilot study, and the peak concentration was 0.125 versus 0.208\u00a0mg/L in the second (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The rifampicin clearance from pericardial fluid was 9.45\u00a0L/h versus 7.82\u00a0L/h in plasma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Ethambutol peak concentrations had a pericardial-to-plasma ratio of 0.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22; free ethambutol peak concentrations were 2.30-lower than MICs (p\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b7001).

There was no significant difference between isoniazid pericardial fluid and plasma concentrations, and isoniazid peak concentrations were above MIC. This is the first study to measure anti-TB drug concentrations, pH and protein in the pericardial TB fluid. Pericardial concentrations of the key sterilizing drugs for TB were below MIC, which could contribute to poor outcomes. A new regimen that overcomes these limitations might need to be crafted.",

There has been a recent surge of interest in the bromo and extra-terminal (BET) epigenetic \u201creaders\u201d including BRD4 since the serendipitous discovery of JQ1(+), an inhibitor specific to the seemingly undruggable BET bromodomains. The role of the BET family in the development of intimal hyperplasia is not known.We investigated the effect of BET inhibition on intimal hyperplasia using a rat balloon angioplasty model.While BRD4 was dramatically up-regulated in the rat and human hyperplastic neointima, blocking BET bromodomains with JQ1(+) diminished neointima in rats. Knocking down BRD4 with siRNA, or treatment with JQ1(+) but not the inactive enantiomer JQ1(\u2212), abrogated platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB)-stimulated proliferation and migration of primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells.

The aim of this study was to assess practice patterns regarding routine management of patients with stable CAD.A survey comprising six questions on two clinical scenarios regarding stable CAD management was sent to 345 cardiologists from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region (France). We first assessed practice patterns globally and then searched for associations with physician characteristics (age, gender, sub-specialty, and type of practice).The response rate was 92%. Regarding management of asymptomatic CAD, 86% of the cardiologists performed routine exercise testing, before which, 69% withdrew \u03b2-blockers. After a positive exercise test, 26% immediately performed coronary angiography and 67%, further imaging tests. In the absence of left ventricular dysfunction or history of myocardial infarction, routine \u03b2-blocker prescription for stable CAD was selected by 43%. When anticoagulation was needed for atrial fibrillation, 41% initiated direct oral anticoagulants rather than vitamin-K antagonists and 50% combined aspirin with anticoagulants. For recurrent stable angina in patients with known CAD, 24% performed coronary angiography directly, 49% requested a stress test, and 27% opted for medical therapy without further diagnostic testing. Age, gender of the cardiologist, academic environment, and practice of interventional cardiology were associated with certain management patterns.When not guided by high-level recommendations, practice patterns for routine clinical situations in stable CAD vary considerably. Future clinical trials should address these clinical interrogations.",

In SCD, elevated red cell cation permeability is critical as increased solute loss causes dehydration and encourages sickling. Recently, we showed that the KCl cotransporter (KCC) activity in red cells from HbSC patients correlated significantly with disease severity, but that in HbSS patients did not. Two transporters involved in red cell dehydration, the conductive channels Psickle and the Gardos channel, behaved similarly in red cells from the two genotypes, but were significantly less active in HbSC patients. By contrast, KCC activity was quantitatively greater in HbSC red cells. Results suggest that KCC is likely to have greater involvement in red cell dehydration in HbSC patients, which could explain its association with disease severity in this genotype. This work supports the hypothesis that SCD in HbSC patients is a distinct disease entity to that in HbSS patients. Results suggest the possibility of designing specific treatments of particular benefit to HbSC patients and a rationale for the development of prognostic markers, to inform early treatment of children likely to develop more severe complications of the disease.",

Our objective was to identify during COPD, factors of susceptibility to bacterial infections among cytokine network and their role in COPD exacerbations. S. pneumoniae was used to sub-lethally challenge mice chronically exposed to air or cigarette smoke (CS) and to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-smokers, smokers and COPD patients. The immune response and the cytokine production were evaluated. Delayed clearance of the bacteria and stronger lung inflammation observed in infected CS-exposed mice were associated with an altered production of IL-17 and IL-22 by innate immune cells. This defect was related to a reduced production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-23 by antigen presenting cells. Importantly, supplementation with recombinant IL-22 restored bacterial clearance in CS-exposed mice and limited lung alteration. In contrast with non-smokers, blood NK and NKT cells from COPD patients failed to increase IL-17 and IL-22 levels in response to S. pneumoniae, in association with a defect in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-23 secretion. This study identified IL-17 and IL-22 as susceptibility factors in COPD exacerbation. Therefore targeting such cytokines could represent a potent strategy to control COPD exacerbation.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, PM had never been accurately characterized inside human lung cells and the most responsible components of the particulate mix are still unknown. On another hand carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from natural and anthropogenic sources might be an important component of PM in both indoor and outdoor air.We used high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to characterize PM present in broncho-alveolar lavage-fluids (n\u00a0=\u00a064) and inside lung cells (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients) of asthmatic children. We show that inhaled PM mostly consist of CNTs. These CNTs are present in all examined samples and they are similar to those we found in dusts and vehicle exhausts collected in Paris, as well as to those previously characterized in ambient air in the USA, in spider webs in India, and in ice core. These results strongly suggest that humans are routinely exposed to CNTs.",

Inactivation of Tfr1 incapacitated normal energy production in muscle, leading to growth arrest and a muted attempt to switch to fatty acid \u03b2 oxidation, using up fat stores. Starvation signals stimulated gluconeogenesis in the liver, but amino acid substrates became limiting and hypoglycemia ensued. Surprisingly, the liver was also iron deficient, and production of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin was depressed.

Notably, mimecan-MBP also induced anorexia in Ay/a and db/db mice. Furthermore, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was up-regulated in the hypothalamus by mimecan-MBP, as well as in N9 microglia cells by recombinant mouse mimecan.

Fecal transplant from risperidone-treated mice caused a 16% reduction in total resting metabolic rate in na\u00efve recipients, attributable to suppression of non-aerobic metabolism. Risperidone inhibited growth of cultured fecal bacteria grown anaerobically more than those grown aerobically. Finally, transplant of the fecal phage fraction from risperidone-treated mice was sufficient to cause excess weight gain in na\u00efve recipients, again through reduced energy expenditure.

RBCs from ascorbate deficient mice were osmotically sensitive, appeared as spherocytes, and had decreased \u03b2-spectrin. These aberrancies reversed with ascorbate repletion in vivo. Under physiologic conditions, only ascorbate's oxidation product dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), a substrate for facilitated glucose transporters, was transported into mouse and human RBCs, with immediate intracellular reduction to ascorbate. In vitro, glucose inhibited entry of physiologic concentrations of dehydroascorbic acid into mouse and human RBCs. In vivo, plasma glucose concentrations in normal and diabetic mice and humans were inversely related to respective RBC ascorbate concentrations, as was osmotic fragility. Human RBC \u03b2-spectrin declined as diabetes worsened.

To explore this issue, the effects of PRI-724, a selective inhibitor of the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/\u03b2-catenin interaction, on liver fibrosis were examined using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- or bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced mouse liver fibrosis models. Following repetitive CCl4 administrations, the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin was observed only in the non-parenchymal cells in the liver. PRI-724 treatment reduced the fibrosis induced by CCl4 or BDL. C-82, an active form of PRI-724, inhibited the activation of isolated primary mouse quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and promoted cell death in culture-activated HSCs. During the fibrosis resolution period, an increase in F4/80+ CD11b+ and Ly6Clow CD11b+ macrophages was induced by CCl4 and was sustained for two weeks thereafter, even after having stopped CCl4 treatment. PRI-724 accelerated the resolution of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, and this was accompanied by increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, and MMP-8 expression in intrahepatic leukocytes.

We aimed to assess if EE impairs the success of oral polio and rotavirus vaccines in infants in Bangladesh.We conducted a prospective observational study of 700 infants from an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh from May 2011 to November 2014. Infants were enrolled in the first week of life and followed to age one year through biweekly home visits with EPI vaccines administered and growth monitored. EE was operationally defied as enteric inflammation measured by any one of the fecal biomarkers reg1B, alpha-1-antitrypsin, MPO, calprotectin, or neopterin. Oral polio vaccine success was evaluated by immunogenicity, and rotavirus vaccine response was evaluated by immunogenicity and protection from disease. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01375647.EE was present in greater than 80% of infants by 12\u00a0weeks of age. Oral poliovirus and rotavirus vaccines failed in 20.2% and 68.5% of the infants respectively, and 28.6% were malnourished (HAZ\u00a0<\u00a0\u2212\u00a02) at one year of age. In contrast, 0%, 9.0%, 7.9% and 3.8% of infants lacked protective levels of antibody from tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, diphtheria and measles vaccines respectively. EE was negatively associated with oral polio and rotavirus response but not parenteral vaccine immunogenicity. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and measures of maternal health were additionally predictive of both oral vaccine failure and malnutrition. The selected biomarkers from multivariable analysis accounted for 46.3% variation in delta HAZ. 24% of Rotarix\u00ae IgA positive individuals can be attributed to the selected biomarkers.EE as well as systemic inflammation and poor maternal health were associated with oral but not parenteral vaccine underperformance and risk for future growth faltering.

Besides VEGFA and VEGFB, hypoxia induced VEGFC expression robustly. Based on this finding, we tested the role of VEGFC in pathological retinal angiogenesis. VEGFC induced proliferation, migration, sprouting and tube formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs) and these responses require CREB-mediated DLL4 expression and NOTCH1 activation. Furthermore, down regulation of VEGFC levels substantially reduced tip cell formation and retinal neovascularization in vivo.

In regard to upstream mechanism, we found that down regulation of p38\u03b2 levels inhibited hypoxia-induced CREB-DLL4-NOTCH1 activation, tip cell formation, sprouting and retinal neovascularization.

Historically, the S2R has been defined as (1) a binding site with high affinity to 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and haloperidol but not to the selective sigma-1 receptor ligand (+)-pentazocine, and (2) a protein of 18\u201321\u00a0kDa, as shown by specific photolabeling with [3H]-Azido-DTG and [125I]-iodoazido-fenpropimorph ([125I]-IAF). Recently, the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), a 25\u00a0kDa protein, was reported to be the S2R (Nature Communications, 2011, 2:380). To confirm this identification, we created PGRMC1 knockout NSC34 cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We found that in NSC34 cells devoid of or overexpressing PGRMC1, the maximum [3H]-DTG binding to the S2R (Bmax) as well as the DTG-protectable [125I]-IAF photolabeling of the S2R were similar to those of wild-type control cells.

Expression levels of candidate genes were determined from archival tumors using the OpenArray\u00ae platform for TaqMan\u00ae RT-qPCR. The dataset was randomly divided at 2:1 ratio into training (n\u00a0=\u00a0221) and testing (n\u00a0=\u00a0103) sets to develop a multigene prognostic signature.Gene expressions were measured in 324 patients. In the training set, multiple models testing 424 candidate genes identified a prognostic signature containing 8 genes plus MSKCC clinical risk factors. In the testing set, the time dependent (td) AUC for a prognostic model containing the 8 genes with and without MSKCC risk factors were 0.72 and 0.69, respectively. The tdAUC for the clinical risk factors alone was 0.61. Additional primary mRCCs from patients with mRCC (n\u00a0=\u00a012) were sampled in multiple sites and standard deviations of gene expressions within a tumor were used as a measure of heterogeneity. All 8 genes in the final prognostic model met our criteria for minimal heterogeneity.A molecular prognostic signature based on 8 genes was developed and is ready for external validation in this patient population and other related settings such as nonmetastatic RCC.",

Of the multiple variables inherent in any such process, none is more important to outcome than the appropriateness of the sample source. To address this question, we investigated CTCs in paired peripheral venous and arterial blood specimens obtained from stage IV uveal melanoma patients.Blood specimens were obtained from both common femoral arteries and antecubital veins in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases for CTC measurements.CTCs were detectable with greater frequency (100%) and in larger numbers (median 5, range 1 to 168) in all arterial blood specimens than in venous samples (52.9%; median 1, range 0 to 8). Patients with hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher number of arterial CTCs, compared to patients with liver-only metastasis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). There was no significant association between the number of arterial CTCs and the tumor burden within the liver in patients who had liver-only metastases.Our data indicate that arterial blood specimens might be a better source of circulating uveal melanoma cells. Although less conveniently processed, perhaps arterial blood should be evaluated as sample source for measurement of CTCs.",

However, outcomes data after a diagnosis of HBOC syndrome especially in diverse populations, are minimal. Here we asked if genetic screening of high-risk underserved women identified in the mammogram population reduces cancer incidence.We evaluated 61,924 underserved women at screening mammography for family histories suggestive of HBOC syndrome over the course of 21\u00a0months. Data were collected retrospectively from patients at two safety net hospitals through chart review. A computer model was used to calculate the long-term effect of this screening on cancer incidence by assessing both the mutation detection rate and the completion of prophylactic surgeries in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.We identified 20 of the 85 (23.5%) expected BRCA1/2 mutation carriers in the underserved population. The frequencies of prophylactic mastectomies and oophorectomies in the mutation carriers were 25% and 40%, respectively. Using these data, our model predicted only an 8.8% reduction in both breast and ovarian cancer in the underserved patients. This contrasts with a 57% reduction in breast cancer and 51% reduction in ovarian cancer in an insured reference population. Our data indicate that underserved patients with HBOC syndrome are difficult to identify and when identified are limited in their ability to adhere to NCCN guidelines for cancer prevention.Screening for women at risk for HBOC syndrome in mammogram populations will only prevent cancers if we can increase compliance with management guidelines. This study provides prototypic baseline data for step-wise analysis of the efficacy of the use of family history analysis in the mammography setting for detection and management of HBOC syndrome.",

Sixty percent of the double mutant mice developed invasive M\u00fcllerian and mammary carcinomas. Mice carrying heterozygous mutations in Brca1 and p53 also developed invasive tumors, albeit at a lesser (30%) rate, in which the wild type alleles were no longer present due to loss of heterozygosity.

These studies were complemented by analyses of RANKL and OPG in the serum and mammary tissues of female cynomolgus macaques (n\u00a0=\u00a088) and serum RANKL and OPG in postmenopausal women (n\u00a0=\u00a0150).BRCA-mutation carriers had lower mean values of free serum OPG in particular in BRCA1-mutation carriers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018) compared with controls. Among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, lower OPG levels were associated with germline mutation locations known to confer an increased breast cancer risk (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

In normal bronchial epithelial cells, DNMT3B/\u0394DNMT3B and DNMT3B/\u2206DNMT3B-del displayed equal levels of expression. In contrast, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC), 111 (93%) of the 119 tumors predominantly expressed DNMT3B/\u0394DNMT3B-del, including 47 (39%) tumors with no detectable DNMT3B/\u2206DNMT3B. Using a transgenic mouse model, we further demonstrated the biological impact of \u2206DNMT3B4-del, the \u2206DNMT3B-del isoform most abundantly expressed in NSCLC, in global DNA methylation patterns and lung tumorigenesis. Expression of \u2206DNMT3B4-del in the mouse lungs resulted in an increased global DNA hypomethylation, focal DNA hypermethylation, epithelial hyperplastia and tumor formation when challenged with a tobacco carcinogen. Our results demonstrate \u2206DNMT3B4-del as a critical factor in developing aberrant DNA methylation patterns during lung tumorigenesis and suggest that \u2206DNMT3B4-del may be a target for lung cancer prevention.",

A high percentage of these cells expressed natural killer cell p46-related protein (NKp46), natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) and killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) and a low percentage expressed NKG2A and CD94.

Finally, we found that these activated NK cells are distinguished by their CD45RA+RO+ phenotype, as opposed to non-activated cells in patients or in healthy donors displaying a CD45RA+RO\u2212 phenotype similar to na\u00efve T cells.

Using a new model, which incorporates individual variability related to structural change and behavior, we sought to identify functional correlates of compensation in premanifest-HD gene-carriers.We investigated the modulatory effects of regional brain atrophy, indexed by structural measures of disease load, on the relationship between performance and brain activity (or connectivity) using task-based and resting-state functional MRI.Consistent with compensation, as atrophy increased performance-related activity increased in the right parietal cortex during a working memory task. Similarly, increased functional coupling between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a left hemisphere network in the resting-state predicted better cognitive performance as atrophy increased. Such patterns were not detectable for the left hemisphere or for motor tasks.Our findings provide evidence for active compensatory processes in premanifest-HD for cognitive demands and suggest a higher vulnerability of the left hemisphere to the effects of regional atrophy.",

Recent animal models proposed increased GABA-mediated inhibition as one underlying mechanism directly affecting the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning. In most adult NF1 patients, apparent cognitive and attentional deficits, tumors affecting the nervous system and other confounding factors for neuroscientific studies are difficult to control for. Here we used a highly specific group of adult NF1 patients without cognitive or nervous system impairments. Such selected NF1 patients allowed us to address the following open questions: Is the learning process of acquiring a challenging motor skill impaired in NF1 patients? And is such an impairment in relation to differences in intracortical inhibition?We used an established non-invasive, double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (dp-TMS) paradigm to assess practice-related modulation of intracortical inhibition, possibly mediated by gamma-minobutyric acid (GABA)ergic-neurotransmission. This was done during an extended learning paradigm in a group of NF1 patients without any neuropsychological deficits, functioning normally in daily life and compared them to healthy age-matched controls.NF1 patients experienced substantial decline in motor skill acquisition (F\u00a0=\u00a09.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) over five-consecutives training days mediated through a selective reduction in the early acquisition (online) and the consolidation (offline) phase.

It is also unclear what proportion of more recent W ST-11 disease clusters are caused by direct descendants of the Hajj clone. Whole genome sequences of 270 meningococcal strains isolated from patients with invasive meningococcal disease globally from 1970 to 2013 were compared using whole genome phylogenetic and major antigen-encoding gene sequence analyses. We found that all W ST-11 strains were descendants of an ancestral strain that had undergone unique capsular switching events. The Hajj clone and its descendants were distinct from other W ST-11 strains in that they shared a common antigen gene profile and had undergone recombination involving virulence genes encoding factor H binding protein, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrite reductase. These data demonstrate that recent acquisition of a distinct antigen-encoding gene profile and variations in meningococcal virulence genes was associated with the emergence of the Hajj clone. Importantly, W ST-11 strains unrelated to the Hajj outbreak contribute a significant proportion of W ST-11 cases globally. This study helps illuminate genomic factors associated with meningococcal strain emergence and evolution.",

Along international borders, like the San Diego\u2013Tijuana region, understanding the dynamics of HIV transmission across reported risks, racial/ethnic groups, and geography can help direct effective prevention efforts on both sides of the border.We gathered sociodemographic, geographic, clinical, and viral sequence data from HIV infected individuals participating in ten studies in the San Diego\u2013Tijuana border region. Phylogenetic and network analysis was performed to infer putative relationships between HIV sequences. Correlates of identified clusters were evaluated and spatiotemporal relationships were explored using Bayesian phylogeographic analysis.After quality filtering, 843 HIV sequences with associated demographic data and 263 background sequences from the region were analyzed, and 138 clusters were inferred (2\u201323 individuals). Overall, the rate of clustering did not differ by ethnicity, residence, or sex, but bisexuals were less likely to cluster than heterosexuals or men who have sex with men (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043), and individuals identifying as white (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) were more likely to cluster than other races. Clustering individuals were also 3.5\u00a0years younger than non-clustering individuals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Although the sampled San Diego and Tijuana epidemics were phylogenetically compartmentalized, five clusters contained individuals residing on both sides of the border.This study sampled ~\u00a07% of HIV infected individuals in the border region, and although the sampled networks on each side of the border were largely separate, there was evidence of persistent bidirectional cross-border transmissions that linked risk groups, thus highlighting the importance of the border region as a \u201cmelting pot\u201d of risk groups.NIH, VA, and Pendleton Foundation.",

     "abstract": "HIV-specific antibodies (Abs) can reduce viral burden by blocking new rounds of infection or by destroying infected cells via activation of effector cells through Fc\u2013FcR interaction. This latter process, referred to as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), has been associated with viral control and improved clinical outcome following both HIV and SIV infections. Here we describe an HIV viral-like particle (VLP)-based sorting strategy that led to identification of HIV-specific memory B cells encoding Abs that mediate ADCC from a subtype A-infected Kenyan woman at 914\u00a0days post-infection. Using this strategy, 12 HIV-envelope-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated and three mediated potent ADCC activity when compared to well-characterized ADCC mAbs. The ADCC-mediating Abs also mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition (ADCVI), which provides a net measure of Fc receptor-triggered effects against replicating virus. Two of the three ADCC-mediating Abs targeted a CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope also bound by the mAb C11; the third antibody targeted the N-terminus of V3. Both CD4i Abs identified here demonstrated strong cross-clade breadth with activity against 10 of 11 envelopes tested, including those from clades A, B, C, A/D and C/D, whereas the V3-specific antibody showed more limited breadth. Variants of these CD4i, C11-like mAbs engineered to interrupt binding to Fc\u03b3Rs inhibited a measurable percentage of the donor's ADCC activity starting as early as 189\u00a0days post-infection. C11-like antibodies also accounted for between 18\u201378% of ADCC activity in 9 chronically infected individuals from the same cohort study. Further, the two CD4i Abs originated from unique B cells, suggesting that antibodies targeting this epitope can be commonly produced. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that CD4i, C11-like antibodies develop within the first 6\u00a0months of infection and they can arise from unique B-cell lineages in the same individual. Further, these mAbs mediate potent plasma IgG-specific ADCC breadth and potency and contribute to ADCC activity in other HIV-infected individuals.",

     "abstract": "Both iron deficiency (ID) and malaria are common among African children. Studies show that the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin is induced by malaria, but few studies have investigated this relationship longitudinally. We measured hepcidin concentrations, markers of iron status, and antibodies to malaria antigens during two cross-sectional surveys within a cohort of 324 Kenyan children \u2264\u00a08\u00a0years old who were under intensive surveillance for malaria and other febrile illnesses. Hepcidin concentrations were the highest in the youngest, and female infants, declined rapidly in infancy and more gradually thereafter. Asymptomatic malaria and malaria antibody titres were positively associated with hepcidin concentrations. Recent episodes of febrile malaria were associated with high hepcidin concentrations that fell over time. Hepcidin concentrations were not associated with the subsequent risk of either malaria or other febrile illnesses. Given that iron absorption is impaired by hepcidin, our data suggest that asymptomatic and febrile malaria contribute to the high burden of ID seen in African children. Further, the effectiveness of iron supplementation may be sub-optimal in the presence of asymptomatic malaria. Thus, strategies to prevent and eliminate malaria may have the added benefit of addressing an important cause of ID for African children.",

The prevalence of HPV-DNA semen infection and serology was studied in a follow-up of 24\u00a0months.Compared to seronegative patients, VSP seroconverted at recruitment showed absence of multiple infections and reduced prevalence of HPV semen infection at 12 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.039), 18 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and 24\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a00.034) of follow-up.

It has been hypothesised that immune boosting of latently infected persons by contact with varicella reduces the probability of HZ. If true, universal varicella vaccination may increase HZ incidence due to reduced VZV circulation. To inform decision-making, we conduct cost-effectiveness analyses of varicella vaccination, including effects on HZ.Effects of varicella vaccination are simulated with a dynamic transmission model, parameterised with Dutch VZV seroprevalence and HZ incidence data, and linked to an economic model. We consider vaccination scenarios that differ by whether or not they include immune boosting, and reactivation of vaccine virus.Varicella incidence decreases after introduction of vaccination, while HZ incidence may increase or decrease depending on whether or not immune boosting is present. Without immune boosting, vaccination is expected to be cost-effective or even cost-saving. With immune boosting, vaccination at 95% coverage is not expected to be cost-effective, and may even cause net health losses.Cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination depends strongly on the impact on HZ and the economic time horizon. Our findings reveal ethical dilemmas as varicella vaccination may result in unequal distribution of health effects between generations.",

The tomographies show excellent depiction of the distribution of structural \u2013 and thus indirectly functional \u2013 changes in lung parenchyma, on single-modality slices in dark field as well as on multimodal fusion images.

The simple anthropometric measure of body mass index does not always reflect the biological effects of excessive body fat on health, thus additional molecular characterizations of obese phenotypes are needed to assess the risk of developing subsequent metabolic conditions at an individual level.To better understand the associations of free fatty acids (FFAs) with metabolic phenotypes of obesity, we applied a targeted metabolomics approach to measure 40 serum FFAs from 452 individuals who participated in four independent studies, using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Xevo G2 quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometer.FFA levels were significantly elevated in overweight/obese subjects with diabetes compared to their healthy counterparts. We identified a group of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) that are closely correlated with metabolic status in two groups of obese individuals who underwent weight loss intervention and can predict the recurrence of diabetes at two years after metabolic surgery. Two UFAs, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and palmitoleic acid, were also able to predict the future development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a group of obese subjects.These findings underscore the potential role of UFAs in the MS pathogenesis and also as important markers in predicting the risk of developing diabetes in obese individuals or diabetes remission after a metabolic surgery.",

The Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) burn size in elderly has remained the same over the past three decades, and so has morbidity and mortality, despite the increased demand for elderly burn care. The objective of this study is to gain insights on why elderly burn patients have had such a poor outcome when compared to adult burn patients. The significance of this project is that to this date, burn care providers recognize the extreme poor outcome of elderly, but the reason remains unclear. In this prospective translational trial, we have determined clinical, metabolic, inflammatory, immune, and skin healing aspects. We found that elderly have a profound increased mortality, more premorbid conditions, and stay at the hospital for longer, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Interestingly, we could not find a higher incidence of infection or sepsis in elderly, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05, but a significant increased incidence of multi organ failure, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. These clinical outcomes were associated with a delayed hypermetabolic response, increased hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic responses, inversed inflammatory response, immune-compromisation and substantial delay in wound healing predominantly due to alteration in characteristics of progenitor cells, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. In summary, elderly have substantially different responses to burns when compared to adults associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study indicates that these responses are complex and not linear, requiring a multi-modal approach to improve the outcome of severely burned elderly.",

In Cox proportional hazard models, inflammation predicted all-cause mortality with hazard ratios (95% CI) 1.89 (1.21 to 2.95) and 1.36 (1.05 to 1.78) in the very old and (semi-)supercentenarians, respectively. In linear forward stepwise models, inflammation predicted capability (10.8% variance explained) and cognition (8.6% variance explained) in (semi-)supercentenarians better than chronologic age or gender.

Mbnl1\u0394E3/\u0394E3/Mbnl3\u0394E2 mice, depleted of Mbnl1 and Mbnl3, demonstrate a profound enhancement of myotonia and an increase in the number of muscle fibers with very low Clc-1 currents, where gClmax values approach ~\u00a01\u00a0mS/cm2, with the absence of a further enhancement in Clc-1 splice errors, alterations in polyA site selection or Clc-1 localization. Significantly, Mbnl1\u0394E3/\u0394E3/Mbnl3\u0394E2 muscles demonstrate an aberrant accumulation of Clc-1 RNA on monosomes and on the first polysomes. Mbnl1 and Mbnl3 bind Clc-1 RNA and both proteins bind Hsp70 and eEF1A, with these associations being reduced in the presence of RNA. Thus binding of Mbnl1 and Mbnl3 to Clc-1 mRNA engaged with ribosomes can facilitate an increase in the local concentration of Hsp70 and eEF1A to assist Clc-1 translation. Dual depletion of Mbnl1 and Mbnl3 therefore initiates both Clc-1 splice errors and translation defects to synergistically enhance myotonia. As the HSALR model for myotonic dystrophy (DM1) shows similar Clc-1 defects, this study demonstrates that both splice errors and translation defects are required for DM1 pathology to manifest.Research in context: Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominant disorder resulting from the expression of expanded CUG repeat RNA, which aberrantly sequesters and inactivates the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of proteins. In mice, inactivation of Mbnl1 is known to alter Clc-1 splicing to result in myotonia. We demonstrate that concurrent depletion of Mbnl1 and Mbnl3 results in a synergistic enhancement of myotonia, with an increase in muscle fibers showing low chloride currents. The observed synergism results from the aberrant accumulation of Clc-1 mRNA on monosomes and the first polysomes. This translation error reflects the ability of Mbnl1 and Mbnl3 to act as adaptors that recruit Hsp70 and eEF1A to the Clc-1 mRNA engaged with ribosomes, to facilitate translation. Thus our study demonstrates that Clc-1 RNA translation defects work coordinately with Clc-1 splice errors to synergistically enhance myotonia in mice lacking Mbnl1 and Mbnl3.",

     "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) mouse models exhibit cognitive deficits, and are used for studying the neuronal basis of DS pathology. To understand the differences in the physiology of DS model neurons, we used dissociated neuronal cultures from the hippocampi of Ts65Dn and Tc1 DS mice. Imaging of [Ca2+]i and whole cell patch clamp recordings were used to analyze network activity and single neuron properties, respectively. We found a decrease of ~\u00a030% in both fast (A-type) and slow (delayed rectifier) outward potassium currents. Depolarization of Ts65Dn and Tc1 cells produced fewer spikes than diploid cells. Their network bursts were smaller and slower than diploids, displaying a 40% reduction in \u0394f\u00a0/\u00a0f0 of the calcium signals, and a 30% reduction in propagation velocity. Additionally, Ts65Dn and Tc1 neurons exhibited changes in the action potential shape compared to diploid neurons, with an increase in the amplitude of the action potential, a lower threshold for spiking, and a sharp decrease of about 65% in the after-hyperpolarization amplitude.Numerical simulations reproduced the DS measured phenotype by variations in the conductance of the delayed rectifier and A-type, but necessitated also changes in inward rectifying and M-type potassium channels and in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. We therefore conducted whole cell patch clamp measurements of M-type potassium currents, which showed a ~\u00a090% decrease in Ts65Dn neurons, while HCN measurements displayed an increase of ~\u00a065% in Ts65Dn cells. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicates overexpression of 40% of KCNJ15, an inward rectifying potassium channel, contributing to the increased inhibition. We thus find that changes in several types of potassium channels dominate the observed DS model phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) represents the most severe degree of the spectrum of epilepsy severity and is the commonest cause of epilepsy-related premature mortality. The precise pathophysiology and the genetic architecture of SUDEP remain elusive. Aiming to elucidate the genetic basis of SUDEP, we analysed rare, protein-changing variants from whole-exome sequences of 18 people who died of SUDEP, 87 living people with epilepsy and 1479 non-epilepsy disease controls. Association analysis revealed a significantly increased genome-wide polygenic burden per individual in the SUDEP cohort when compared to epilepsy (P\u00a0=\u00a05.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03) and non-epilepsy disease controls (P\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03). The polygenic burden was driven both by the number of variants per individual, and over-representation of variants likely to be deleterious in the SUDEP cohort. As determined by this study, more than a thousand genes contribute to the observed polygenic burden within the framework of this study. Subsequent gene-based association analysis revealed five possible candidate genes significantly associated with SUDEP or epilepsy, but no one single gene emerges as common to the SUDEP cases. Our findings provide further evidence for a genetic susceptibility to SUDEP, and suggest an extensive polygenic contribution to SUDEP causation. Thus, an overall increased burden of deleterious variants in a highly polygenic background might be important in rendering a given individual more susceptible to SUDEP. Our findings suggest that exome sequencing in people with epilepsy might eventually contribute to generating SUDEP risk estimates, promoting stratified medicine in epilepsy, with the eventual aim of reducing an individual patient's risk of SUDEP.",

This study examined whether treatment with low-dose pravastatin prevents stroke recurrence in ischemic stroke patients.This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint, parallel-group study of patients who experienced non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. All patients had a total cholesterol level between 4.65 and 6.21\u00a0mmol/L at enrollment, without the use of statins. The pravastatin group patients received 10\u00a0mg of pravastatin/day; the control group patients received no statins. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA), with the onset of each stroke subtype set to be one of the secondary endpoints.Although 3000 patients were targeted, 1578 patients (491 female, age 66.2\u00a0years) were recruited and randomly assigned to pravastatin group or control group. During the follow-up of 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0years, although total stroke and TIA similarly occurred in both groups (2.56 vs. 2.65%/year), onset of atherothrombotic infarction was less frequent in pravastatin group (0.21 vs. 0.64%/year, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0047, adjusted hazard ratio 0.33 [95%CI 0.15 to 0.74]). No significant intergroup difference was found for the onset of other stroke subtypes, and for the occurrence of adverse events.Although whether low-dose pravastatin prevents recurrence of total stroke or TIA still needs to be examined in Asian, this study has generated a hypothesis that it may reduce occurrence of stroke due to larger artery atherosclerosis.This study was initially supported by a grant from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.

Pretreatment with 100\u00a0mg/kg of meclizine, 17\u00a0h prior to ischemia protected mice from IRI.

Meclizine upregulated glycolysis in glucose-containing media and reduced cellular ATP levels in galactose-containing media.

For example primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma with very poor prognosis that typically affects HIV infected individuals in advanced stages of immunodeficiency. Here we report on the dual anti-HIV and anti-PEL effect of targeting a single process common in both diseases. Inhibition of the exportin-1 (XPO1) mediated nuclear transport by clinical stage orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors (SINE) prevented the nuclear export of the late intron-containing HIV RNA species and consequently potently suppressed viral replication. In contrast, in CRISPR-Cas9 genome edited cells expressing mutant C528S XPO1, viral replication was unaffected upon treatment, clearly demonstrating the anti-XPO1 mechanism of action. At the same time, SINE caused the nuclear accumulation of p53 tumor suppressor protein as well as inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity in PEL cells resulting in cell cycle arrest and effective apoptosis induction. In vivo, oral administration arrested PEL tumor growth in engrafted mice. Our findings provide strong rationale for inhibiting XPO1 as an innovative strategy for the combined anti-retroviral and anti-neoplastic treatment of HIV and PEL and offer perspectives for the treatment of other AIDS-associated cancers and potentially other virus-related malignancies.",

Five cases were considered by independent experts to be confirmed CRPS. Quantitative analyses did not suggest an association between CRPS and HPV-16/18-adjuvanted vaccine.

Systematic database reviews using search terms varying in specificity and sensitivity did not identify new cases.

However, virtually all glioblastoma patients experience disease progression within 7 to 10\u00a0months. Although many salvage treatments, including bevacizumab, rechallenge with temozolomide, and other alkylating agents, have been evaluated, none of these clearly improves survival. Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) is highly expressed in glioblastoma cell mitochondria, and mitochondrial function is intimately tied to treatment-resistant glioblastoma progression. These glioblastoma properties provide a strong rationale for pursuing a MAOB-selective pro-drug treatment approach that, upon drug activation, targets glioblastoma mitochondria, especially mitochondrial DNA. MP-MUS is the lead compound in a family of pro-drugs designed to treat GBM that is converted into the mature, mitochondria-targeting drug, P+-MUS, by MAOB.

As yet, there are no validated descriptions of prostate cancer subgroups derived from integrated genomics linked with clinical outcome.In a study of 482 tumour, benign and germline samples from 259 men with primary prostate cancer, we used integrative analysis of copy number alterations (CNA) and array transcriptomics to identify genomic loci that affect expression levels of mRNA in an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) approach, to stratify patients into subgroups that we then associated with future clinical behaviour, and compared with either CNA or transcriptomics alone.We identified five separate patient subgroups with distinct genomic alterations and expression profiles based on 100 discriminating genes in our separate discovery and validation sets of 125 and 103 men. These subgroups were able to consistently predict biochemical relapse (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.016 respectively) and were further validated in a third cohort with long-term follow-up (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). We show the relative contributions of gene expression and copy number data on phenotype, and demonstrate the improved power gained from integrative analyses. We confirm alterations in six genes previously associated with prostate cancer (MAP3K7, MELK, RCBTB2, ELAC2, TPD52, ZBTB4), and also identify 94 genes not previously linked to prostate cancer progression that would not have been detected using either transcript or copy number data alone. We confirm a number of previously published molecular changes associated with high risk disease, including MYC amplification, and NKX3-1, RB1 and PTEN deletions, as well as over-expression of PCA3 and AMACR, and loss of MSMB in tumour tissue. A subset of the 100 genes outperforms established clinical predictors of poor prognosis (PSA, Gleason score), as well as previously published gene signatures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). We further show how our molecular profiles can be used for the early detection of aggressive cases in a clinical setting, and inform treatment decisions.For the first time in prostate cancer this study demonstrates the importance of integrated genomic analyses incorporating both benign and tumour tissue data in identifying molecular alterations leading to the generation of robust gene sets that are predictive of clinical outcome in independent patient cohorts.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), vaginal, and colorectal tissues were transfected with siRNA targeting nucleotide kinases, incubated with TFV, and TFV-monophosphate (TFV-MP) and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) were measured using mass spectrometry\u2013liquid chromatography. Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) performed the first TFV phosphorylation step in PBMC, vaginal, and colorectal tissues.

In addition, next-generation sequencing of the Microbicide Trials Network MTN-001 clinical samples detected 71 previously unreported genetic variants in the genes encoding these kinases.

     "abstract": "Infectious diseases are the leading cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. One dramatic issue is the emergence of microbial resistance to antibiotics which is a major public health concern. Surprisingly however, such in vivo adaptive ability has not been reported yet for many intracellular human bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila.We examined 82 unrelated patients with Legionnaire's disease from which 139 respiratory specimens were sampled during hospitalization and antibiotic therapy. We both developed a real time PCR assay and used deep-sequencing approaches to detect antibiotic resistance mutations in L. pneumophila and follow their selection and fate in these samples.We identified the in vivo selection of fluoroquinolone resistance mutations in L. pneumophila in two infected patients treated with these antibiotics. By investigating the mutational dynamics in patients, we showed that antibiotic resistance occurred during hospitalization most likely after fluoroquinolone treatment.In vivo selection of antibiotic resistances in L. pneumophila may be associated with treatment failures and poor prognosis. This hidden resistance must be carefully considered in the therapeutic management of legionellosis patients and in the control of the gradual loss of effectiveness of antibiotics.",

     "abstract": "The quartan malaria parasite Plasmodium malariae is the widest spread and best adapted human malaria parasite. The simian Plasmodium brasilianum causes quartan fever in New World monkeys and resembles P. malariae morphologically. Since the genetics of the two parasites are nearly identical, differing only in a range of mutations expected within a species, it has long been speculated that the two are the same. However, no naturally acquired infection with parasites termed as P. brasilianum has been found in humans until now.We investigated malaria cases from remote Yanomami indigenous communities of the Venezuelan Amazon and analyzed the genes coding for the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the small subunit of ribosomes (18S) by species-specific PCR and capillary based-DNA sequencing.Based on 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified 12 patients harboring malaria parasites which were 100% identical with P. brasilianum isolated from the monkey, Alouatta seniculus. Translated amino acid sequences of the CS protein gene showed identical immunodominant repeat units between quartan malaria parasites isolated from both humans and monkeys.This study reports, for the first time, naturally acquired infections in humans with parasites termed as P. brasilianum. We conclude that quartan malaria parasites are easily exchanged between humans and monkeys in Latin America. We hypothesize a lack of host specificity in mammalian hosts and consider quartan malaria to be a true anthropozoonosis. Since the name P. brasilianum suggests a malaria species distinct from P. malariae, we propose that P. brasilianum should have a nomenclatorial revision in case further research confirms our findings. The expansive reservoir of mammalian hosts discriminates quartan malaria from other Plasmodium spp. and requires particular research efforts.",

     "abstract": "The burden of pneumonia continues to be substantial, particularly among the poorest in global society. We describe here the trends for UK pneumonia R&D investment and published outputs, and correlate with 2013 global mortality.Data related to awards to UK institutions for pneumonia research from 1997 to 2013 were systematically sourced and categorised by disease area and type of science. Investment was compared to mortality figures in 2010 and 2013 for pneumonia, tuberculosis and influenza. Investment was also compared to publication data.Of all infectious disease research between 2011 and 2013 (\u00a3917.0 million), \u00a328.8 million (3.1%) was for pneumonia. This was an absolute and proportionate increase from previous time periods. Translational pneumonia research (33.3%) received increased funding compared with 1997\u20132010 where funding was almost entirely preclinical (87.5%, here 30.9%), but high-burden areas such as paediatrics, elderly care and antimicrobial resistance received little investment. Annual investment remains volatile; publication temporal trends show a consistent increase. When comparing investment to global burden with a novel \u2018investment by mortality observed\u2019 metric, tuberculosis (\u00a348.36) and influenza (\u00a3484.21) receive relatively more funding than pneumonia (\u00a343.08), despite investment for pneumonia greatly increasing in 2013 compared to 2010 (\u00a37.39). Limitations include a lack of private sector data and the need for careful interpretation of the comparisons with burden, plus categorisation is subjective.There has been a welcome increase for pneumonia funding awarded to UK institutions in 2011\u20132013 compared with 1997\u20132010, along with increases for more translational research. Published outputs relating to pneumonia rose steadily from 1997 to 2013. Investment relative to mortality for pneumonia has increased, but it remains low compared to other respiratory infections and clear inequities remain. Analyses that measure investments in pneumonia can provide an insight into funding trends and research gaps.Pneumonia continues to be a high-burden illness around the globe. This paper shows that although research funding is increasing in the UK (between 1997 and 2013), it remains poorly funded compared to other important respiratory infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. Publications about pneumonia have been steadily increasing over time, indicating continuing academic and clinical interest in the topic. Though global mortality of pneumonia is declining, it should still be an area of high priority for funders, policymakers and researchers.",

We developed methods to reduce costs substantially by using existing data in primary care systems, to ask whether Helicobacter pylori eradication would reduce the incidence of hospitalisation for ulcer bleeding in aspirin users.The Helicobacter Eradication Aspirin Trial (HEAT) is a National Institute of Health Research-funded, double-blind placebo controlled randomised trial of the effects of H. pylori eradication on subsequent ulcer bleeding in infected individuals taking aspirin daily, conducted in practices across the whole of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A bespoke web-based trial management system developed for the trial (and housed within the secure NHS Data Network) communicates directly with the HEAT Toolkit software downloaded at participating practices, which issues queries searching entry criteria (\u2265\u00a060\u00a0years, on chronic aspirin \u2264\u00a0325\u00a0mg daily, not on anti-ulcer therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for GP review of eligibility. Trial participation is invited using a highly secure automated online mail management system. Interested patients are seen once for consent and breath testing. Those with a positive test are randomised to eradication treatment (lansoprazole, clarithromycin, metronidazole) or placebo, with drug sent by post. Events are tracked by upload of accumulating information in the GP database, patient contact, review of National Hospital Episode Statistics and Office of National Statistics data.HEAT is the largest Clinical Research Network-supported drug trial, with 115,660 invitation letters sent from 850 practices, 22,922 volunteers, and 3038 H. pylori positive patients randomised to active or placebo treatment after 2.5\u00a0years of recruitment. 178 practices have performed their first follow-up data search to identify 21 potential endpoints to date.HEAT is important medically, because aspirin is so widely used, and methodologically, as a successful trial would show that large-scale studies of important clinical outcomes can be conducted at a fraction of the cost of those conducted by industry, which in turn will help to ensure that trials of primarily medical rather than commercial interest can be conducted successfully in the UK.",

CMV vaccine is currently unavailable and treatment options in pregnancy are limited. Susceptible pregnant women caring for children are at high risk for primary infection. CMV educational and hygienic measures have the potential to prevent primary maternal infection.A mixed interventional and observational controlled study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of hygiene information among pregnant women at risk for primary CMV infection for personal/occupational reasons. In the intervention arm, CMV-seronegative women, identified at the time of maternal serum screening for fetal aneuploidy at 11\u201312\u00a0weeks of gestation, were given hygiene information and prospectively tested for CMV until delivery. The comparison arm consisted of women enrolled at delivery who were neither tested for nor informed about CMV during pregnancy, and who had a serum sample stored at the screening for fetal aneuploidy. By design, groups were homogeneous for age, parity, education, and exposure to at least one risk factor. The primary outcome was CMV seroconversion. Acceptance of hygiene recommendations was a secondary objective and was measured by a self-report.Four out of 331 (1.2%) women seroconverted in the intervention group compared to 24/315 (7.6%) in the comparison group (delta\u00a0=\u00a06.4%; 95% CI 3.2\u20139.6; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were 3 newborns with congenital infection in the intervention group and 8 in the comparison group (1 with cerebral ultrasound abnormalities at birth). Ninety-three percent of women felt hygiene recommendations were worth suggesting to all pregnant women at risk for infection.This controlled study provides evidence that an intervention based on the identification and hygiene counseling of CMV-seronegative pregnant women significantly prevents maternal infection. While waiting for CMV vaccine to become available, the intervention described may represent a responsible and acceptable primary prevention strategy to reduce congenital CMV.",

Blood remnants and clots, remaining in the pericardial space in spite of chest tube drainage, induce high fibrinolytic activity that may contribute to bleeding complications. Continuous postoperative pericardial flushing (CPPF) with an irrigation solution may reduce blood loss by preventing the accumulation of clots. In this pilot study, the safety and feasibility of CPPF were evaluated and the effect on blood loss and other related complications was investigated.Between November 2011 and April 2012 twenty-one adult patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) received CPPF from sternal closure up to 12\u00a0h postoperative. With an inflow Redivac drain that was inserted through one of the chest tube incision holes, an irrigation solution (NaCl 0.9% at 38\u00a0\u00b0C) was delivered to the pericardial cavity using a volume controlled flushing system.

However, the interpretation of findings often rests with a single individual, and errors can carry significant impact. Cell identification and classification skills are well supported by existing resources, but the contribution and importance of other skills are less well understood.The UK external quality assurance group in haematology (UK NEQAS(H)) runs a Continued Professional Development scheme where large digital-images of abnormal blood smears are presented using a web-based virtual microscope. Each case is answered by more than 800 individuals. Morphological feature selection and prioritisation, as well as diagnosis and proposed action, are recorded. We analysed the responses of participants, aiming to identify successful strategies as well as sources of error.The approach to assessment by participants depended on the affected cell type, case complexity or skills of the morphologist. For cases with few morphological abnormalities, we found that accurate cell identification and classification were the principle requirements for success. For more complex films however, feature recognition and prioritisation had primary importance. Additionally however, we found that participants employed a range of heuristic techniques to support their assessment, leading to associated bias and error.A wide range of skills together allow successful morphological assessment and the complexity of this process is not always understood or recognised. Heuristic techniques are widely employed to support or reinforce primary observations and to simplify complex findings. These approaches are effective and are integral to assessment; however they may also be a source of bias or error. Improving outcomes and supporting diagnosis require the development of decision-support mechanisms that identify and support the benefits of heuristic strategies while identifying or avoiding associated biases.The CPD scheme is funded by participant subscription.",

A Random Forest model containing ten variables demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC 0.79). Decision Curve Analysis indicated that the use of this model would improve clinical outcomes and reduce unnecessary surgical procedures. Civilian trauma patients demonstrated similar inflammatory responses and an equivalent wound failure rate, indicating that the model may be generalizable to civilian settings.Using advanced analytics, we successfully codified clinical and biomarker data from combat patients into a potentially generalizable decision support tool.

Five patients were followed longitudinally as in-patients in the post-transplant period.Seven volatiles were elevated in the breath of patients versus controls. Of these, five showed statistically significant decrease post-transplant: limonene, methanol, 2-pentanone, 2-butanone and carbon disulfide. On an individual basis limonene has the best diagnostic capability (the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) is 0.91), but this is improved by combining methanol, 2-pentanone and limonene (AUROC curve 0.95). Following transplant, limonene shows wash-out characteristics.Limonene, methanol and 2-pentanone are breath markers for a cirrhotic liver.

Young people (aged 8\u201316\u00a0years) with IBD were randomized to receive telephone consultation or face-to-face consultation for 24\u00a0months. The primary outcome measure was the paediatric IBD-specific IMPACT quality of life (QOL) score at 12\u00a0months. Secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction with consultations, disease course, anthropometric measures, proportion of consultations attended, duration of consultations, and costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02319798.Eighty six patients were randomised to receive either telephone consultation (n\u00a0=\u00a044) or face-to-face consultation (n\u00a0=\u00a042). Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. At 12\u00a0months, there was no evidence of difference in QOL scores (estimated treatment effect in favour of the telephone consultation group was 5.7 points, 95% CI \u2212\u00a02.9 to 14.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Mean consultation times were 9.8\u00a0min (IQR 8 to 12.3) for telephone consultation, and 14.3\u00a0min (11.6 to 17.0) for face-to-face consultation with an estimated reduction (95% CI) of 4.3 (2.8 to 5.7) min in consultation times (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

FASN expression increases with tumor progression and associates with chemoresistance, tumor metastasis, and diminished patient survival in numerous tumor types. TVB-3166, an orally-available, reversible, potent, and selective FASN inhibitor induces apoptosis, inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth under lipid-rich conditions, and inhibits in-vivo xenograft tumor growth. Dose-dependent effects are observed between 20\u2013200\u00a0nM TVB-3166, which agrees with the IC50 in biochemical FASN and cellular palmitate synthesis assays. Mechanistic studies show that FASN inhibition disrupts lipid raft architecture, inhibits biological pathways such as lipid biosynthesis, PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR and \u03b2-catenin signal transduction, and inhibits expression of oncogenic effectors such as c-Myc; effects that are tumor-cell specific. Our results demonstrate that FASN inhibition has anti-tumor activities in biologically diverse preclinical tumor models and provide mechanistic and pharmacologic evidence that FASN inhibition presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating a variety of cancers, including those expressing mutant K-Ras, ErbB2, c-Met, and PTEN. The reported findings inform ongoing studies to link mechanisms of action with defined tumor types and advance the discovery of biomarkers supporting development of FASN inhibitors as cancer therapeutics.Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a vital enzyme in tumor cell biology; the over-expression of FASN is associated with diminished patient prognosis and resistance to many cancer therapies. Our data demonstrate that selective and potent FASN inhibition with TVB-3166 leads to selective death of tumor cells, without significant effect on normal cells, and inhibits in vivo xenograft tumor growth at well-tolerated doses. Candidate biomarkers for selecting tumors highly sensitive to FASN inhibition are identified. These preclinical data provide mechanistic and pharmacologic evidence that FASN inhibition presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating a variety of cancers.",

     "abstract": "Although screening programmes of smokers have detected resectable early lung cancers more frequently than expected, their efficacy in reducing mortality remains debatable. To elucidate the biological features of computed tomography (CT) screening detected lung cancer, we examined the mRNA signatures on tumours according to the year of detection, stage and survival.Gene expression profiles were analysed on 28 patients (INT\u2013IEO training cohort) and 24 patients of Multicentre Italian Lung Detection (MILD validation cohort). The gene signatures generated from the training set were validated on the MILD set and a public deposited DNA microarray data set (GSE11969). Expression of selected genes and proteins was validated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Enriched core pathway and pathway networks were explored by GeneSpring GX10.A 239-gene signature was identified according to the year of tumour detection in the training INT\u2013IEO set and correlated with the patients' outcomes. These signatures divided the MILD patients into two distinct survival groups independently of tumour stage, size, histopathological type and screening year. The signatures can also predict survival in the clinically detected cancers (GSE11969). Pathway analyses revealed tumours detected in later years enrichment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway, with up-regulation of PDPK1, ITGB1 and down-regulation of FOXO1A. Analysis of normal lung tissue from INT\u2013IEO cohort produced signatures distinguishing patients with early from late detected tumours.The distinct pattern of \u201cindolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d tumour exists in CT-screening detected lung cancer according to the gene expression profiles. The early development of an aggressive phenotype may account for the lack of mortality reduction by screening observed in some cohorts.",

Radiotherapy alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently there is no predictive marker with clinical utility to guide treatment decisions in NSCLC patients undergoing radiotherapy. Identification of such markers would allow treatment options to be considered for more effective therapy. To enable the identification of appropriate protein biomarkers, plasma samples were collected from patients with non-small cell lung cancer before and during radiotherapy for longitudinal comparison following a protocol that carries sufficient power for effective discovery proteomics. Plasma samples from patients pre- and during radiotherapy who had survived >\u00a018\u00a0mo were compared to the same time points from patients who survived <\u00a014\u00a0mo using an 8 channel isobaric tagging tandem mass spectrometry discovery proteomics platform. Over 650 proteins were detected and relatively quantified. Proteins which showed a change during radiotherapy were selected for validation using an orthogonal antibody-based approach. Two of these proteins were verified in a separate patient cohort: values of CRP and LRG1 combined gave a highly significant indication of extended survival post one week of radiotherapy treatment.",

     "abstract": "PA28\u03b3 was suggested to play a role in malignant progression. This paper aimed to investigate the association between PA28\u03b3 and the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in cohort studies.The PA28\u03b3 expression level was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a total of 368 OSCC patients from three independent cohorts. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to determine multivariate hazard ratios for Overall Survival (OS). Model discrimination was measured using C Statistic. Additionally, OS was analyzed in Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set. Functional analyses were conducted both in-vitro and in-vivo.The median follow-up times of patients in the three studies were 60, 52, and 51\u00a0months. High expression of PA28\u03b3 was identified in tumors from 179 of 368 patients (48.6%). Compared with low expression, high expression of PA28\u03b3 was strongly associated with worse OS, with relative risks of 5.14 (95% CI, 2.51\u201310.5; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 2.82 (95% CI, 1.73\u20134.61; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 3.85 (95% CI, 1.59\u20139.37; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). PA28\u03b3 expression was also associated with disease-free survival in all three cohorts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.005). These findings are consistent with TCGA HNSCC data (P\u00a0<\u00a00.006). The prediction of all-cause mortality was significantly improved when PA28\u03b3 was added to the traditional clinical factors (Model 3, C statistic value: 0.78 VS 0.73, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016). In functional analyses, we found that PA28\u03b3 silencing dramatically inhibited the growth, proliferation and mobility of OSCC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth and angiogenesis in tumor-bearing mice.PA28\u03b3 overexpression is associated with adverse prognosis in patients with OSCC. The aberrant expression of PA28\u03b3 may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of OSCC.OSCC is one of the most common HNSCC, which have a high lethally rate. However, few prognostic markers have been applied in the clinical practice. We found that PA28\u03b3 in OSCC tumor tissues were significantly high expression than those in normal tissues. As the results of the three cohorts from two independent research centers and from an additional validation cohort from a US population in the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate PA28\u03b3 is a good predictor of the risk of death in OSCC. Meanwhile, we demonstrate PA28\u03b3 have a potential role in OSCC tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "Vaccine reverse engineering is emerging as an important approach to vaccine antigen identification, recently focusing mainly on structural characterization of interactions between neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antigens. Using mAbs that bind unknown antigen structures, we sought to probe the intrinsic features of antibody antigen-binding sites with a high complexity peptide library, aiming to identify conformationally optimized mimotope antigens that capture mAb-specific epitopes. Using a high throughput sequencing-enhanced messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) display approach, we identified high affinity binding peptides for a hepatitis C virus neutralizing mAb. Immunization with the selected peptides induced neutralizing activity similar to that of the original mAb. Antibodies elicited by the most commonly selected peptides were predominantly against specific epitopes. Thus, using mRNA display to interrogate mAbs permits high resolution identification of functional peptide antigens that direct targeted immune responses, supporting its use in vaccine reverse engineering for pathogens against which potent neutralizing mAbs are available.We used a large number of randomly produced small proteins (\u201cpeptides\u201d) to identify peptides containing specific protein sequences that bind efficiently to an antibody that can prevent hepatitis C virus infection in cell culture. After the identified peptides were injected into mice, the mice produced their own antibodies with characteristics similar to the original antibody. This approach can provide previously unavailable information about antibody binding and could also be useful in developing new vaccines.",

     "abstract": "The global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic and the spread of multi- and extensively-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) have been fueled by low adherence to following lengthy treatment protocols, and the rapid spread of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Persistence of the infection in immunocompetent individuals follows from the ability of M.tb to subvert host immune responses in favor of survival within macrophages. Alternative host-directed strategies are therefore being currently sought to improve treatment efficacy and duration. In this study, we evaluated tofacitinib, a new oral Janus kinase (JAK) blocker with anti-inflammatory properties, in shortening tuberculosis treatment. BALB/c mice, which are immunocompetent, showed acceleration of M.tb clearance achieving apparent sterilization after 16\u00a0weeks of adjunctive tofacitinib therapy at average exposures higher than recommended in humans, while mice receiving standard treatment alone did not achieve clearance until 24\u00a0weeks. True sterilization with tofacitinib was not achieved until five months. C3HeB/FeJ mice, which show reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines during M.tb infection, did not show improved clearance with adjunctive tofacitinib therapy, indicating that the nature of granulomatous lesions and host immunity may influence responsiveness to tofacitinib. Our findings suggest that the JAK pathway could be explored further for host-directed therapy in immunocompetent individuals.",

     "abstract": "Quantifying latently infected cells is critical to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the size of the long-lived viral reservoir, but the low frequency of these cells makes this very challenging.We developed TILDA (Tat/rev Induced Limiting Dilution Assay) to measure the frequency of cells with inducible multiply-spliced HIV RNA, as these transcripts are usually absent in latently infected cells but induced upon viral reactivation. TILDA requires less than a million cells, does not require RNA extraction and can be completed in two days.In suppressed individuals on ART, we found the median frequency of latently infected CD4\u00a0+ T cells as estimated by TILDA to be 24\u00a0cells/million, which was 48 times more than the frequency measured by the quantitative viral outgrowth assay, and 6\u201327 times less than the frequencies of cells harbouring viral DNA measured by PCR-based assays. TILDA measurements strongly correlated with most HIV DNA assays. The size of the latent reservoir measured by TILDA was lower in subjects who initiated ART during the early compared to late stage of infection (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). In untreated HIV disease, the frequency of CD4\u00a0+ cells carrying latent but inducible HIV largely exceeded the frequency of actively producing cells, demonstrating that the majority of infected cells are transcriptionally silent even in the absence of ART.Our results suggest that TILDA is a reproducible and sensitive approach to measure the frequency of productively and latently infected cells in clinical settings. We demonstrate that the latent reservoir represents a substantial fraction of all infected cells prior to ART initiation.In this manuscript, we describe the development of a novel assay that measures the magnitude of the latent HIV reservoir, the main barrier to HIV eradication. This novel assay, termed TILDA for Tat/rev Induced Limiting Dilution Assay, requires only 10\u00a0ml of blood, does not necessitate extraction of viral nucleic acids, is highly reproducible, covers a wide dynamic range of reservoir sizes and can be completed in two days. As such, TILDA may represent an alternative to existing assays used to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir.",

However, IGRAs do not discriminate active and latent infections (LTBI) and no gold standard for LTBI diagnosis is available. Thus, since improved tests to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection are required, we assessed the efficacy of several M. tuberculosis latency antigens. BCG-vaccinated healthy donors (HD) and tuberculosis (TB) patients were recruited. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, TST and clinical data were used to differentiate LTBI. IFN-\u03b3 production against CFP-10, ESAT-6, Rv2624c, Rv2626c and Rv2628 antigens was tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. LTBI subjects secreted significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 levels against Rv2626c than HD. Additionally, Rv2626c peptide pools to which only LTBI responded were identified, and their cumulative IFN-\u03b3 response improved LTBI discrimination. Interestingly, whole blood stimulation with Rv2626c allowed the discrimination between active and latent infections, since TB patients did not secrete IFN-\u03b3 against Rv2626c, in contrast to CFP-10\u00a0+\u00a0ESAT-6 stimulation that induced IFN-\u03b3 response from both LTBI and TB patients. ROC analysis confirmed that Rv2626c discriminated LTBI from HD and TB patients. Therefore, since only LTBI recognizes specific epitopes from Rv2626c, this antigen could improve LTBI diagnosis, even in BCG-vaccinated people.",

We constructed a score of self-reported recommendation frequency for 6 specific vaccines to target populations.16% to 43% of GPs sometimes or never recommended at least one specific vaccine to their target patients. Multivariable logistic regressions of the dichotomized score showed that GPs recommended vaccines frequently when they felt comfortable explaining their benefits and risks to patients (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.87; 1.35\u20132.59), or trusted official sources of information highly (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.40; 1.01\u20131.93).

The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) DBS on several pre-clinical markers of the antidepressant-like response and at investigating putative non-neuronal mechanism underlying DBS action. We found that DBS induced an antidepressant-like response that was prevented by IL-PFC neuronal lesion and by adenosine A1 receptor antagonists including caffeine. Moreover, high frequency DBS induced a rapid increase of hippocampal mitosis and reversed the effects of stress on hippocampal synaptic metaplasticity. In addition, DBS increased spontaneous IL-PFC low-frequency oscillations and both raphe 5-HT firing activity and synaptogenesis. Unambiguously, a local glial lesion counteracted all these neurobiological effects of DBS. Further in vivo electrophysiological results revealed that this astrocytic modulation of DBS involved adenosine A1 receptors and K+ buffering system. Finally, a glial lesion within the site of stimulation failed to counteract the beneficial effects of low frequency (30\u00a0Hz) DBS. It is proposed that an unaltered neuronal\u2013glial system constitutes a major prerequisite to optimize antidepressant DBS efficacy. It is also suggested that decreasing frequency could heighten antidepressant response of partial responders.",

     "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders are common mental disorders without a pathological biomarker. Classic genetic studies found that an extra X chromosome frequently causes psychiatric symptoms in patients with either Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Triple X syndrome (XXX). Over-dosage of some X-linked escapee genes was suggested to cause psychiatric disorders. However, relevance of these rare genetic diseases to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders in the general population of psychiatric patients is unknown.XIST and several X-linked genes were studied in 36 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy females and 60 lymphoblastoid cell lines from female patients with either bipolar disorder or recurrent major depression. XIST and KDM5C expression was also quantified in 48 RNA samples from postmortem human brains of healthy female controls and female psychiatric patients.We found that the XIST gene, a master in control of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), is significantly over-expressed (p\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07, corrected after multiple comparisons) in the lymphoblastoid cells of female patients with either bipolar disorder or major depression. The X-linked escapee gene KDM5C also displays significant up-regulation (p\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07, corrected after multiple comparisons) in the patients' cells.

Studies on human postmortem brains supported over-expression of the XIST gene in female psychiatric patients.We propose that over-expression of XIST may cause or result from subtle alteration of XCI, which up-regulates the expression of some X-linked escapee genes including KDM5C. Over-expression of X-linked genes could be a common mechanism for the development of psychiatric disorders between patients with those rare genetic diseases and the general population of female psychiatric patients with XIST over-expression. Our studies suggest that XIST and KDM5C expression could be used as a biological marker for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients.Due to lack of biological markers, diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders are subjective. There is utmost urgency to identify biomarkers for clinics, research, and drug development. We found that XIST and KDM5C gene expression may be used as a biological marker for diagnosis of major affective disorders in a significantly large subset of female patients from the general population. Our studies show that over-expression of XIST and some X-linked escapee genes may be a common mechanism for development of psychiatric disorders between the patients with rare genetic diseases (XXY or XXX) and the general population of female psychiatric patients.",

ADAMTS13 deficiency causes the loss of regulation of von Willebrand factor multimeric size and platelet-tethering function, which results in the formation of disseminated microvascular platelet microthrombi. Precisely how anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, or antibody subsets, cause ADAMTS13 deficiency (ADAMTS13 activity generally <\u00a010%) has not been formally investigated.We analysed 92 acquired TTP episodes at presentation, through treatment and remission/relapse using epitope mapping and functional analyses to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of anti-ADAMTS13 IgG.89/92 of TTP episodes had IgG recognising the ADAMTS13 N-terminal domains. The central spacer domain was the only N-terminal antigenic target detected. 38/92 TTP episodes had autoantibodies recognising the N-terminal domains alone; 54/92 TTP episodes also had antibodies against the ADAMTS13 C-terminal domains (TSP2\u20138 and/or CUB domains). Changes in autoantibody specificity were detected in 9/16 patients at relapse, suggesting a continued development of the disease. Functional analyses on IgG from 43 patients revealed inhibitory IgG were limited to anti-spacer domain antibodies. However, 15/43 patients had autoantibodies with no detectable inhibitory action and as many as 32/43 patients had autoantibodies with inhibitory function that was insufficient to account for the severe deficiency state, suggesting that in many patients there is an alternative pathogenic mechanism. We therefore analysed plasma ADAMTS13 antigen levels in 91 acquired TTP presentation samples. We demonstrated markedly reduced ADAMTS13 antigen levels in all presentation samples, median 6% normal (range 0\u201347%), with 84/91 patients having <\u00a025% ADAMTS13 antigen. ADAMTS13 antigen in the lowest quartile at first presentation was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 5.7).Anti-spacer domain autoantibodies are the major inhibitory antibodies in acquired TTP. However, depletion of ADAMTS13 antigen (rather than enzyme inhibition) is a dominant pathogenic mechanism. ADAMTS13 antigen levels at presentation have prognostic significance. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of acquired TTP.",

     "abstract": "Gut microbiota has been implicated as a pivotal contributing factor in diet-related obesity; however, its role in development of disease phenotypes in human genetic obesity such as Prader\u2013Willi syndrome (PWS) remains elusive. In this hospitalized intervention trial with PWS (n\u00a0=\u00a017) and simple obesity (n\u00a0=\u00a021) children, a diet rich in non-digestible carbohydrates induced significant weight loss and concomitant structural changes of the gut microbiota together with reduction of serum antigen load and alleviation of inflammation. Co-abundance network analysis of 161 prevalent bacterial draft genomes assembled directly from metagenomic datasets showed relative increase of functional genome groups for acetate production from carbohydrates fermentation. NMR-based metabolomic profiling of urine showed diet-induced overall changes of host metabotypes and identified significantly reduced trimethylamine N-oxide and indoxyl sulfate, host-bacteria co-metabolites known to induce metabolic deteriorations. Specific bacterial genomes that were correlated with urine levels of these detrimental co-metabolites were found to encode enzyme genes for production of their precursors by fermentation of choline or tryptophan in the gut. When transplanted into germ-free mice, the pre-intervention gut microbiota induced higher inflammation and larger adipocytes compared with the post-intervention microbiota from the same volunteer. Our multi-omics-based systems analysis indicates a significant etiological contribution of dysbiotic gut microbiota to both genetic and simple obesity in children, implicating a potentially effective target for alleviation.Poorly managed diet and genetic mutations are the two primary driving forces behind the devastating epidemic of obesity-related diseases. Lack of understanding of the molecular chain of causation between the driving forces and the disease endpoints retards progress in prevention and treatment of the diseases. We found that children genetically obese with Prader\u2013Willi syndrome shared a similar dysbiosis in their gut microbiota with those having diet-related obesity. A diet rich in non-digestible but fermentable carbohydrates significantly promoted beneficial groups of bacteria and reduced toxin-producers, which contributes to the alleviation of metabolic deteriorations in obesity regardless of the primary driving forces.",

An overview of systematic reviews can focus implementation on the most effective ways to increase child survival.In this overview we included published Cochrane and other systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies on antenatal, childbirth, postnatal and child health interventions aiming to prevent perinatal/neonatal and child mortality using the WHO list of essential interventions. We assessed the methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR criteria and assessed the quality of the outcomes using the GRADE approach. Based on the findings from GRADE criteria, interventions were summarized as effective, promising or ineffective.The overview identified 148 Cochrane and other systematic reviews on 61 reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health interventions. Of these, only 57 reviews reported mortality outcomes. Using the GRADE approach, antenatal corticosteroids for preventing neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants; early initiation of breastfeeding; hygienic cord care; kangaroo care for preterm infants; provision and promotion of use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) for children; and vitamin A supplementation for infants from six months of age, were identified as clearly effective interventions for reducing neonatal, infant or child mortality. Antenatal care, tetanus immunization in pregnancy, prophylactic antimalarials during pregnancy, induction of labour for prolonged pregnancy, case management of neonatal sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia, prophylactic and therapeutic use of surfactant, continuous positive airway pressure for neonatal resuscitation, case management of childhood malaria and pneumonia, vitamin A as part of treatment for measles associated pneumonia for children above 6\u00a0months, and home visits across the continuum of care, were identified as promising interventions for reducing neonatal, infant, child or perinatal mortality.Comprehensive adoption of the above six effective and 11 promising interventions can improve neonatal and child survival around the world. Choice of intervention and degree of implementation currently depends on resources available and policies in individual countries and geographical settings.This review was part of doctoral thesis which was funded by University of Adelaide, Australia.",

MM cells are exquisitely sensitive to Bortezomib \u2013 exhibiting a low-nanomolar IC50 \u2013 suggesting that minimal inhibition of degradation suffices to kill MM cells. Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration, contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity. Comparing MM cells to other, Bortezomib-resistant, cancer cells shows that the degree of proteasome inhibition is the greatest in MM cells and only there leads to proteasome stress, providing an explanation for why Bortezomib is effective against MM but not other cancers.",

     "abstract": "Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer associated with RB1 loss or MYCN amplification (RB1+/+MYCNA). There are controversies concerning the existence of molecular subtypes within RB1\u2212/\u2212 retinoblastoma. To test whether these molecular subtypes exist, we performed molecular profiling.Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling was performed on 76 primary human retinoblastomas. Expression profiling was complemented by genome-wide DNA profiling and clinical, histopathological, and ex vivo drug sensitivity data.RNA and DNA profiling identified major variability between retinoblastomas. While gene expression differences between RB1+/+MYCNA and RB1\u2212/\u2212 tumors seemed more dichotomous, differences within the RB1\u2212/\u2212 tumors were gradual. Tumors with high expression of a photoreceptor gene signature were highly differentiated, smaller in volume and diagnosed at younger age compared with tumors with low photoreceptor signature expression. Tumors with lower photoreceptor expression showed increased expression of genes involved in M-phase and mRNA and ribosome synthesis and increased frequencies of somatic copy number alterations.Molecular, clinical and histopathological differences between RB1\u2212/\u2212 tumors are best explained by tumor progression, reflected by a gradual loss of differentiation and photoreceptor expression signature. Since copy number alterations were more frequent in tumors with less photoreceptorness, genomic alterations might be drivers of tumor progression.Retinoblastoma is an ocular childhood cancer commonly caused by mutations in the RB1 gene. In order to determine optimal treatment, tumor subtyping is considered critically important. However, except for very rare retinoblastomas without an RB1 mutation, there are controversies as to whether subtypes of retinoblastoma do exist. Our study shows that retinoblastomas are highly diverse but rather than reflecting distinct tumor types with a different etiology, our data suggests that this diversity is a result of tumor progression driven by cumulative genetic alterations. Therefore, retinoblastomas should not be categorized in distinct subtypes, but be described according to their stage of progression.",

Here we report a potent bactericidal action of AZM against MDR carbapenem-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii.

Patients with loss or decrease of function single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the above genes were assigned a risk score based upon the number of SNPs present weighted relative to whether CYP2B6 (main metabolism pathway) and/or CYP2A6 and CYP3A4 (accessory pathways) were involved. Cox regression models were used to study the association between high genetic risk and time from initiation to EFV discontinuation. Failure was defined as discontinuation of an antiretroviral regimen other than for virologic failure or protocol determined discontinuation.Patients with highest pharmacogenetic risk, as defined by cumulative SNPs in CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, have an increased risk of discontinuation of EFV containing therapy compared to patients with lower genetic risk scores (adjusted HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2, 3.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). High genetic risk score was not associated with an increased risk of discontinuing atazanavir or nevirapine. High genetic risk was present more often in blacks compared to non-blacks (Adjusted OR 4.5, 95% CI: 1.9,10.5), and treatment discontinuation was also increased in blacks overall (Adjusted HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0, 1.9). However, high genetic risk was more associated with treatment discontinuation than race alone for both blacks (Adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8, 4.8) and non-blacks (Adjusted OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.5, 18.0).Premature discontinuation of ART delays the time to effective long term viral suppression, and is associated with significant morbidity. Pharmacogenetic testing may predict those with a high risk of EFV discontinuation, and therefore should be considered in patients in whom initiation of EFV based ART is being considered.Funded by NIH.",

CH58 neutralizes HIV-1 CRF_01 AE strain 92TH023 and mediates ADCC against CD4\u00a0+ T cell targets infected with CRF_01 AE tier 2 virus. CH58 and other antibodies that bind to a gp120 V2 epitope have a second light chain complementarity determining region (LCDR2) bearing a glutamic acid, aspartic acid (ED) motif involved in forming salt bridges with polar, basic side amino acid side chains in V2. In an effort to learn how V2 responses develop, we determined the crystal structures of the CH58-UA antibody unliganded and bound to V2 peptide. The structures showed an LCDR2 structurally pre-conformed from germline to interact with V2 residue Lys169. LCDR3 was subject to conformational selection through the affinity maturation process. Kinetic analyses demonstrate that only a few contacts were responsible for a 2000-fold increase in KD through maturation, and this effect was predominantly due to an improvement in off-rate. This study shows that preconformation and preconfiguration can work in concert to produce antibodies with desired immunogenic properties.",

In mice and cynomolgus monkeys, FGFR1/\u03b2Klotho activation increased serum high-molecular-weight adiponectin, which appears to contribute over time by enhancing the amplitude of the metabolic benefits. At the same time, insulin sensitization by FGFR1/\u03b2Klotho activation occurs even before the onset of weight loss in a manner that is independent of adiponectin. Together, selective activation of FGFR1/\u03b2Klotho complex with a long acting therapeutic antibody represents an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other obesity-linked disorders through enhanced energy expenditure, insulin sensitization and induction of high-molecular-weight adiponectin.",

Neural recordings in a mouse model of SLE, in which circulating DNRAbs penetrate the hippocampus, revealed that CA1 place cells exhibited a significant expansion in place field size. Structural analysis showed that hippocampal pyramidal cells had substantial reductions in their dendritic processes and spines. Strikingly, these abnormalities became evident at a time when DNRAbs were no longer detectable in the hippocampus. These results suggest that antibody-mediated neurocognitive impairments may be highly specific, and that spatial cognition may be particularly vulnerable to DNRAb-mediated structural and functional injury to hippocampal cells that evolves after the triggering insult is no longer present.",

A cross-sectional study comparing DN with diabetes patients without kidney disease (DC) and healthy controls (HCs); and renal mesangial cells (HMCs) grown in normal and high glucose, was carried out. Patients with diabetes (DC) had increased circulating mitochondrial DNA (MtDNA), and HMCs increased their MtDNA within 24\u00a0h of hyperglycaemia. The increased MtDNA content in DCs and HMCs was not functional as transcription was unaltered/down-regulated, and MtDNA damage was present. MtDNA was increased in DC compared to HC, conversely, patients with DN had lower MtDNA than DC. Hyperglycaemic HMCs had fragmented mitochondria and TLR9 pathway activation, and in diabetic patients, mitophagy was reduced. Despite MtDNA content and integrity changing within 4\u00a0days, hyperglycaemic HMCs had a normal bio-energetic profile until 8\u00a0days, after which mitochondrial metabolism was progressively impaired. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DN patients had reduced reserve capacity and maximal respiration, loss of metabolic flexibility and reduced Bioenergetic Health Index (BHI) compared to DC. Our data show that MtDNA changes precede bioenergetic dysfunction and that patients with DN have impaired mitochondrial metabolism compared to DC, leading us to propose that systemic mitochondrial dysfunction initiated by glucose induced MtDNA damage may be involved in the development of DN. Longitudinal studies are needed to define a potential cause\u2013effect relationship between changes in MtDNA and bioenergetics in DN.",

The mechanisms underlying fate specification in conjunction with neural tube closure are poorly understood. Here, by comparing expression profiles between SE and NE lineages, we observed that uncommitted progenitor cells, expressing stem cell markers, are present in the neural plate border/neural fold prior to neural tube closure. Our results also demonstrated that canonical Wnt and its antagonists, DKK1/KREMEN1, progressively specify these progenitors into SE or NE fates in accord with the progress of neural tube closure. Additionally, SE specification of the neural plate border via canonical Wnt signaling is directed by the grainyhead-like 3 (Grhl3) transcription factor. Thus, we propose that the fate specification of uncommitted progenitors in the neural plate border by canonical Wnt signaling and its downstream effector Grhl3 is crucial for neural tube closure. This study implicates that failure in critical genetic factors controlling fate specification of progenitor cells in the neural plate border/neural fold coordinated with neural tube closure may be potential causes of human neural tube defects.",

Rodent studies indicate that hypothermia can elicit preconditioning, wherein a subtoxic cellular stress confers resistance to an otherwise lethal injury.

Mild-to-moderate hypothermia (28\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C) induces cold-shock protein expression and mild endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hCNs, with full activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Chemical block of a principal UPR pathway mitigates the protective effect of cooling against oxidative stress, whilst pre-cooling neurons abrogates the toxic injury produced by the ER stressor tunicamycin. Cold-stress thus preconditions neurons by upregulating adaptive chaperone-driven pathways of the UPR in a manner that precipitates ER-hormesis. Our findings establish a novel arm of neurocryobiology that could reveal multiple therapeutic targets for acute and chronic neuronal injury.",

To address this issue, we analyzed the expression of key developmental genes in fetal placenta in a birth cohort of women using unregulated water supplies in a US region with elevated groundwater arsenic. We identified several genes whose expression associated with maternal arsenic exposure in a fetal sex-specific manner. In particular, expression of the HEDGEHOG pathway component, GLI3, in female placentae was both negatively associated with arsenic exposure and positively associated with infant birth weight. This suggests that modulation of GLI3 in the fetal placenta, and perhaps in other fetal tissues, contributes to arsenic's detrimental effects on fetal growth. We showed previously that arsenic-exposed NIH3T3 cells have reduced GLI3 repressor protein. Together, these studies identify GLI3 as a key signaling node that is affected by arsenic, mediating a subset of its effects on developmental signaling and fetal health.",

We found that EBV miRNA BHRF1-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the plasma of patients with CLL compared with healthy individuals (p\u00a0<\u00a00\u00a0\u00b7\u00a00001). Notably, BHRF1-1 as well as BART4 expression were detected in the plasma of either seronegative or seropositive (anti-EBNA-1 IgG and EBV DNA tested) patients; similarly, miRNA-ISH stained positive in bone marrow specimens while LMP1 and EBER immunohistochemistry failed to detect viral proteins and RNA. We also found that BHRF1-1 plasma expression levels were positively associated with elevated beta-2-microglobulin levels and advanced Rai stages and observed a correlation between higher BHRF1-1 expression levels and shorter survival in two independent patients' cohorts. Furthermore, in the majority of CLL cases where BHRF1-1 was exogenously induced in primary malignant B cells the levels of TP53 were reduced. Our findings suggest that EBV may have a role in the process of disease progression in CLL and that miRNA RT-PCR and miRNAs ISH could represent additional methods to detect EBV miRNAs in patients with CLL.",

In Xuanwei City of Yunnan Province, the lung cancer incidence is among the highest in China attributed to severe air pollution generated by combustion of smoky coal, providing a unique opportunity to dissect lung carcinogenesis of air pollution. Here we analyzed the somatic mutations of 164 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) from Xuanwei and control regions (CR) where smoky coal was not used. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mean of 289 somatic exonic mutations per tumor and the frequent C:G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A:T nucleotide substitutions in Xuanwei NSCLCs. Exome sequencing of 2010 genes showed that Xuanwei and CR NSCLCs had a mean of 68 and 22 mutated genes per tumor, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). We found 167 genes (including TP53, RYR2, KRAS, CACNA1E) which had significantly higher mutation frequencies in Xuanwei than CR patients, and mutations in most genes in Xuanwei NSCLCs differed from those in CR cases. The mutation rates of 70 genes (e.g., RYR2, MYH3, GPR144, CACNA1E) were associated with patients' lifetime benzo(a)pyrene exposure. This study uncovers the mutation spectrum of air pollution-related lung cancers, and provides evidence for pollution exposure\u2013genomic mutation relationship at a large scale.",

Therefore, Taspase1 represents a conditional oncoprotein in the context of t(4;11) leukemia. In this report, we used site-directed mutagenesis to unravel the molecular events by which Taspase1 becomes sequentially activated. Monomeric pro-enzymes form dimers which are autocatalytically processed into the enzymatically active form of Taspase1 (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1). The active enzyme cleaves only very few target proteins, e.g., MLL, MLL4 and TFIIA at their corresponding consensus cleavage sites (CSTasp1) as well as AF4\u2013MLL in the case of leukemogenic translocation. This knowledge was translated into the design of a dominant-negative mutant of Taspase1 (dnTASP1). As expected, simultaneous expression of the leukemogenic AF4\u2013MLL and dnTASP1 causes the disappearance of the leukemogenic oncoprotein, because the uncleaved AF4\u2013MLL protein (328\u00a0kDa) is subject to proteasomal degradation, while the cleaved AF4\u2013MLL forms a stable oncogenic multi-protein complex with a very long half-life. Moreover, coexpression of dnTASP1 with a BFP-CSTasp1-GFP FRET biosensor effectively inhibits cleavage. The impact of our findings on future drug development and potential treatment options for t(4;11) leukemia will be discussed.",

We recently found that human prolidase (PEPD), a dipeptidase, is a high affinity ERBB2 ligand and cross-links two ERBB2 monomers. Here, we show that recombinant human PEPD (rhPEPD) strongly inhibits ERBB2-overexpressing tumors in mice, whereas it does not impact tumors without ERBB2 overexpression. rhPEPD causes ERBB2 depletion, disrupts oncogenic signaling orchestrated by ERBB2 homodimers and heterodimers, and induces apoptosis. The impact of enzymatically-inactive mutant rhPEPDG278D on ERBB2 is indistinguishable from that of rhPEPD, but rhPEPDG278D is superior to rhPEPD for tumor inhibition. The enzymatic function of rhPEPD stimulates HIF-1\u03b1 and other pro-survival factors in tumors, which likely attenuates its antitumor activity. rhPEPDG278D is also attractive in that it may not interfere with the physiologic function of endogenous PEPD in normal cells. Collectively, we have identified a human protein as an inhibitory ERBB2 ligand that inhibits ERBB2-overexpressing tumors in vivo. Several anti-ERBB2 agents are on the market but are hampered by drug resistance and high drug cost. rhPEPDG278D may synergize with these agents and may also be highly cost-effective, since it targets ERBB2 with a different mechanism and can be produced in bacteria.",

We focused on the PI3K\u2013AKT axis.

The somatic status of the mutations was confirmed when peritumoral DNA was available. The JGCTs without duplications carried point mutations affecting highly conserved residues. Several of these substitutions were somatic lesions. The mutated proteins carrying the duplications had a non-wild-type subcellular distribution, with a marked enrichment at the plasma membrane. This led to a striking degree of AKT1 activation demonstrated by a strong phosphorylation level and by reporter assays.Our study incriminates somatic mutations of AKT1 as a major event in the pathogenesis of JGCTs.

The interplay between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and EGFR was studied in primary intestinal epithelial cells isolated from ApcMin mice, immortalized normal human colon epithelial cells (HCECs) as well as murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).Immunohistochemistry staining results established that EGFR overexpression is an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis, which can be greatly attenuated by regular use of aspirin. Importantly, EGFR and COX-2 were co-overexpressed and co-localized with each other in FAP patients. Further mechanistic studies revealed that COX-2 overexpression triggers the activation of the c-Jun-dependent transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1), which binds to the Egfr promoter. Binding facilitates the cellular accumulation of EGFR and lowers the threshold required for pre-neoplastic cells to undergo transformation.Aspirin might exert its chemopreventive activity against CRC, at least partially, by normalizing EGFR expression in gastrointestinal precancerous lesions.",

Here we documented that IgG4 retrieved from the serum of our propositus reacted against carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) at the podocyte surface. In patient's biopsy, glomerular CAII staining increased and co-localized with subepithelial IgG4 deposits along the capillary walls. Patient's IgG4 caused a drop in cell pH followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS production and cytoskeletal reorganization in cultured podocytes. These events promoted mitochondrial superoxide-dismutase-2 (SOD2) externalization on the plasma membrane, becoming recognizable by complement-binding IgG3 anti-SOD2. Among patients with IgG4-related disease only sera of those with IgG4 anti-CAII antibodies caused low intracellular pH and mitochondrial alterations underlying SOD2 externalization. Circulating IgG4 anti-CAII can cause podocyte injury through processes of intracellular acidification, mitochondrial oxidative stress and neoantigen induction in patients with IgG4 related disease. The onset of MN in a subset of patients could be due to IgG4 antibodies recognizing CAII with consequent exposure of mitochondrial neoantigen in the context of multifactorial pathogenesis of disease.",

     "abstract": "The anti-inflammatory agents glucocorticoids (GC) are the only available treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, long-term GC treatment causes muscle atrophy and wasting. Thus, targeting specific mediator of inflammatory response may be more specific, more efficacious, and with fewer side effects. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 is overproduced in patients with DMD and in the muscle of mdx, the animal model for human DMD. We tested the ability of inhibition of IL6 activity, using an interleukin-6 receptor (Il6r) neutralizing antibody, to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype. Blockade of endogenous Il6r conferred on dystrophic muscle resistance to degeneration and alleviated both morphological and functional consequences of the primary genetic defect. Pharmacological inhibition of IL6 activity leaded to changes in the dystrophic muscle environment, favoring anti-inflammatory responses and improvement in muscle repair. This resulted in a functional homeostatic maintenance of dystrophic muscle.These data provide an alternative pharmacological strategy for treatment of DMD and circumvent the major problems associated with conventional therapy.",

We show that mild inhibition of mitochondrial complex I with small molecule CP2 reduces levels of amyloid beta and phospho-Tau and averts cognitive decline in three animal models of familial AD. Low-mass molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical studies confirmed that CP2 competes with flavin mononucleotide for binding to the redox center of complex I leading to elevated AMP/ATP ratio and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in neurons and mouse brain without inducing oxidative damage or inflammation. Furthermore, modulation of complex I activity augmented mitochondrial bioenergetics increasing coupling efficiency of respiratory chain and neuronal resistance to stress. Concomitant reduction of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 activity and restoration of axonal trafficking resulted in elevated levels of neurotrophic factors and synaptic proteins in adult AD mice. Our results suggest that metabolic reprogramming induced by modulation of mitochondrial complex I activity represents promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",

Although direct sequencing (DS) with manual microdissection (MMD) is widely used, a diagnostic kit providing rapid detections of RAS mutations would be clinically beneficial. We evaluated the MEBGENTM RASKET KIT (RASKET KIT), a multiplex assay using PCR-reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide and xMAP\u00ae technology to concurrently detect exon 2, 3, and 4 RAS mutations in a short turnaround time (4.5\u00a0h/96-specimens).Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained from 308 consenting patients with histologically-confirmed CRC at six hospitals in Japan. For the RASKET KIT, we used only 50\u2013100\u00a0ng DNA from each FFPE specimen not processed by MMD. The primary endpoint was the concordance rate between RAS mutations identified with the RASKET KIT and two reference assays (DS with MMD and TheraScreen\u00ae K-RAS Mutation Kit). As the secondary endpoints, we evaluated the concordance rate between DS and the RASKET KIT for RAS mutations in the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population and the genotyping performance of the RASKET KIT compared with DS.Among 307 analyzable specimens, the reference assays detected 140 (45.6%, 140/307) RAS mutations: 111 KRAS exon 2 and 29 other (minor) RAS mutations. The RASKET KIT detected 143 (46.6%, 143/307) mutations: 114 KRAS exon 2 and 29 minor RAS mutations. The between-method concordance rate was 96.7% (297/307) (95% CI: 94.1\u201398.4%). Minor RAS mutations were detected in 15.7% (30/191) of the wild-type KRAS exon 2 population (n\u00a0=\u00a0191); the concordance rate was 98.4% (188/191) (95% CI: 95.5\u201399.7%). The concordance rate of RAS genotyping was 100% (139/139) (95% CI: 97\u2013100%).The RASKET KIT provides rapid and precise detections of RAS mutations and consequently, quicker and more effective anti-EGFR therapy for CRC (Study ID: UMIN000011784).Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd.

This phenomenon complements the hypothesis that innate immunity may adopt rudimentary memory, as demonstrated in vitro with endotoxin priming and tolerance in cultured monocytes. However, previous in vivo studies only examined the protective effect of endotoxin tolerance in the context of sepsis. In sharp contrast, we report herein that pre-conditioning with super-low or low dose endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cause strikingly opposite survival outcomes. Mice pre-conditioned with super-low dose LPS experienced severe tissue damage, inflammation, increased bacterial load in circulation, and elevated mortality when they were subjected to cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP). This is in contrast to the well-reported protective phenomenon with CLP mice pre-conditioned with low dose LPS. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that super-low and low dose LPS differentially modulate the formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in neutrophils. Instead of increased ERK activation and NET formation in neutrophils pre-conditioned with low dose LPS, we observed significantly reduced ERK activation and compromised NET generation in neutrophils pre-conditioned with super-low dose LPS. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism potentially responsible for the dynamic programming of innate immunity in vivo as it relates to sepsis risks.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, chronic immune activation and systemic inflammation have emerged as hallmarks of HIV disease progression and mortality. Several studies indicate that soluble inflammatory biomarkers (sCD14, IL-6, IL-8, CRP and hyaluronic acid), as well as surface markers of T-cell activation (CD38, HLA-DR) independently predict progression to AIDS and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. While co-infections have been shown to contribute to immune activation, the impact of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is widely endemic in the areas most affected by the global AIDS epidemic, has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that both active and latent states of Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infection contribute to elevated immune activation as measured by these markers. In HIV-infected individuals with active, but not latent TB, we found elevated levels of soluble markers associated with monocyte activation. Interestingly, T-cell activation was elevated individuals with both latent and active TB. These results suggest that in the highly TB- and HIV-endemic settings of southern Africa, latent TB-associated T-cell activation may contribute to HIV disease progression and exacerbate the HIV epidemic. In addition, our findings indicate that aggressive campaigns to treat LTBI in HIV-infected individuals in high-burden countries will not only impact TB rates, but may also slow HIV progression.Latent tuberculosis, which affects an estimated 1/3 of the world's population, has long been thought to be a relatively benign, quiescent state of M. tuberculosis infection. While HIV co-infection is known to exacerbate M. tuberculosis infection and increase the risk of developing active TB, little is known about the potential effect of latent TB infection on HIV disease. This study shows that HIV-infected individuals with both active and latent TB have elevated levels of inflammation and immune activation, biomarkers of HIV disease progression and elevated risk of mortality. These results suggest that, in the context of HIV, latent TB infection may be associated with increased risk of progression to AIDS and mortality.",

This complex cDNA library was biopanned to obtain 1152 potential sarcoidosis antigens and a microarray was constructed to immunoscreen two different sets of sera from healthy controls and sarcoidosis. Meta-analysis identified 259 discriminating sarcoidosis antigens, and multivariate analysis identified 32 antigens with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 83% to classify sarcoidosis from healthy controls. Additionally, interrogating the same microarray platform with sera from subjects with TB, we identified 50 clones that distinguish between TB, sarcoidosis and healthy controls. The top 10 sarcoidosis and TB specific clones were sequenced and homologies were searched in the public database revealing unique epitopes and mimotopes in each group. Here, we show for the first time that immunoscreenings of a library derived from sarcoidosis tissue differentiates between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis antigens.

Bambuterol is a prodrug of \u03b22-agonist commonly used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with the advantage of once daily dosing and favorable side effect profile. The potential lipid-lowering effects of bambuterol were unclear, possibly due to the racemic bambuterol (rac-bambuterol) that was used in previous studies.The lipid-lowering effects of R-bambuterol were examined in a randomized phase I trial in 48 healthy Chinese volunteers aged 18\u201345\u00a0years. Participants were randomly assigned to five groups to receive a single dose (2.5\u00a0mg, 5\u00a0mg or 10\u00a0mg) or multiple doses (5\u00a0mg) of oral medications of R-bambuterol, or a single dose of rac-bambuterol (10\u00a0mg). Plasma lipid levels were measured at baseline, time to peak concentration (Tmax) and 24\u00a0h after the treatment.Administration of a single-dose of R-bambuterol resulted in dose-dependent reductions in the levels of plasma LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) at Tmax. Levels of LDL-C exhibited the most reductions, which were statistically significant in all three single-dose R-bambuterol groups (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05). R-bambuterol was more potent in LDL-C lowering compared to rac-bambuterol at Tmax (P\u00a0=\u00a00.08). At 24\u00a0h after dosing, the significant lipid lowering effects of R-bambuterol sustained for LDL-C (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), ApoB (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and ApoA1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), but not for HDL-C.

In the multiple-dose group, LDL-C levels again were significantly reduced (all P values\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the ratios of ApoA1/ApoB were marginally increased.R-bambuterol can lower the plasma levels of LDL-C, and marginally raise the ratio of ApoA1/ApoB (indicator of HDL-C/LDL-C) with both a single dose and multiple doses. R-bambuterol was more potent in LDL-C lowering than rac-bambuterol.",

Although there has been a dramatic increase in the success rate of HSCT over the last two decades, HSCT can result in serious, sometimes untreatable disease due to toxic conditioning regimens and Graft-versus-Host-Disease. Studies utilizing germline knockout mice have discovered several candidate genes that could be targeted pharmacologically to create a more favorable environment for transplant success. SHIP1 deficiency permits improved engraftment of hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HS-PCs) and produces an immunosuppressive microenvironment ideal for incoming allogeneic grafts. The recent development of small molecule SHIP1 inhibitors has opened a different therapeutic approach by creating transient SHIP1-deficiency. Here we show that SHIP1 inhibition (SHIPi) mobilizes functional HS-PC, accelerates hematologic recovery, and enhances donor HS-PC engraftment in both allogeneic and autologous transplant settings. We also observed the expansion of key cell populations known to suppress host-reactive cells formed during engraftment. Therefore, SHIPi represents a non-toxic, new therapeutic that has significant potential to improve the success and safety of therapies that utilize autologous and allogeneic HSCT.",

Therefore, a systemic approach targeting primary whole blood cells is required to better understand the cellular immune defence against metHb and PAMPs, when under a haemolytic infection.We investigated how human white blood cells, including neutrophils, respond to metHb and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS), signalling mediators (ERK and p38), NF-\u03baB, cytokines, elastase secretion and cell activation markers.metHb activates NF-\u03baB in TLR2-expressing HEK293 cells but not in normal or TLR9-expressing HEK293 cells. Treatment of isolated neutrophils with metHb increased production of ROS and expressions of IL-8, TNF\u03b1, and CD11b, which were further enhanced by metHb\u00a0+\u00a0LTA complex. While LTA stimulated the survival of neutrophils, it caused apoptotic cell death when complexed with metHb.

Most European and American isolates belonged to one of two closely related sub-lineages, which had diversified before the identification of the pandemic in the 1970s. A third, genetically more diverse sub-lineage, was associated with Asian isolates.

CRF19 was more frequently predicted to use the CXCR4 co-receptor, had higher fitness scores in the protease region, and patients had higher viral load at diagnosis.CRF19 is a recombinant of subtype D (C-part of Gag, PR, RT and nef), subtype A (N-part of Gag, Integrase, Env) and subtype G (Vif, Vpr, Vpu and C-part of Env). Since subtypes D and A have been associated with respectively faster and slower disease progression, our findings might indicate a fit PR driving high viral load, which in combination with co-infections may boost RANTES levels and thus CXCR4 use, potentially explaining the fast progression.

     "abstract": "During early clinical development, prospective identification of a predictive biomarker and validation of an assay method may not always be feasible. Dichotomizing a continuous biomarker measure to classify responders also leads to challenges. We present a case study of a prospective\u2013retrospective approach for a continuous biomarker identified after patient enrollment but defined prospectively before the unblinding of data. An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and the challenges encountered in its practical application are also provided.HERALD (NCT02134015) was a double-blind, phase 2 study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to erlotinib with placebo or with high or low doses of patritumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3). While the primary objective was to assess safety and progression-free survival (PFS), a secondary objective was to determine a single predictive biomarker hypothesis to identify subjects most likely to benefit from the addition of patritumab. Although not identified as the primary biomarker in the study protocol, on the basis of preclinical results from 2 independent laboratories, expression levels of the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG) were prospectively declared the predictive biomarker before data unblinding but after subject enrollment. An assay to measure HRG mRNA was developed and validated. Other biomarkers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, were also evaluated in an exploratory fashion. The cutoff value for high vs. low HRG mRNA levels was set at the median delta threshold cycle. A maximum likelihood analysis was performed to evaluate the provisional cutoff. The relationship of HRG values to PFS hazard ratios (HRs) was assessed as a measure of internal validation. Additional NSCLC samples were analyzed to characterize HRG mRNA distribution.The subgroup of patients with high HRG mRNA levels (\u201cHRG-high\u201d) demonstrated clinical benefit from patritumab treatment with HRs of 0.37 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0283) and 0.29 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0027) in the high- and low-dose patritumab arms, respectively. However, only 102 of the 215 randomized patients (47.4%) had sufficient tumor samples for HRG mRNA measurement. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the provisional cutoff was within the optimal range. In the placebo arm, the HRG-high subgroup demonstrated worse prognosis compared with HRG-low. A continuous relationship was observed between increased HRG mRNA levels and lower HR. Additional NSCLC samples (N\u00a0=\u00a0300) demonstrated a similar unimodal distribution to that observed in this study, suggesting that the defined cutoff may be applicable to future NSCLC studies.The prospective\u2013retrospective approach was successful in clinically validating a probable predictive biomarker. Post hoc in vitro studies and statistical analyses permitted further testing of the underlying assumptions. However, limitations of this analysis include the incomplete collection of adequate tumor tissue and a lack of stratification. In a phase 3 study, findings are being confirmed, and the HRG cutoff value is being further refined.NCT02134015.",

In this research, we applied 3-dimensional neurovascular histology with cell tracing to reveal the participation of Schwann cells and pericytes in mouse islet transplantation. Longitudinal studies of the grafts under the kidney capsule identify that the donor Schwann cells and pericytes re-associate with the engrafted islets at the peri-graft and perivascular domains, respectively, indicating their adaptability in transplantation.

However, the pathogenic mechanisms that cause this deficit have not yet been defined. Here we show that the human DYRK1A kinase on chromosome 21 tightly regulates the nuclear levels of Cyclin D1 in embryonic cortical stem (radial glia) cells, and that a modest increase in DYRK1A protein in transgenic embryos lengthens the G1 phase in these progenitors. These alterations promote asymmetric proliferative divisions at the expense of neurogenic divisions, producing a deficit in cortical projection neurons that persists in postnatal stages. Moreover, radial glial progenitors in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome have less Cyclin D1, and Dyrk1a is the triplicated gene that causes both early cortical neurogenic defects and decreased nuclear Cyclin D1 levels in this model. These data provide insights into the mechanisms that couple cell cycle regulation and neuron production in cortical neural stem cells, emphasizing that the deleterious effect of DYRK1A triplication in the formation of the cerebral cortex begins at the onset of neurogenesis, which is relevant to the search for early therapeutic interventions in Down syndrome.",

The DAT is a membrane protein that controls DA homeostasis through the high-affinity re-uptake of synaptically released DA.We adopt newly developed animal models and state-of-the-art biophysical techniques to determine the contribution of the identified gene variants to impairments in DA neurotransmission observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Here, we characterize two independent autism-associated variants in the genes that encode STX1 and the DAT. We demonstrate that each variant dramatically alters DAT function. We identify molecular mechanisms that converge to inhibit reverse transport of DA and DA-associated behaviors. These mechanisms involve decreased phosphorylation of STX1 at Ser14 mediated by casein kinase 2 as well as a reduction in STX1/DAT interaction. These findings point to STX1/DAT interactions and STX1 phosphorylation as key regulators of DA homeostasis.We determine the molecular identity and the impact of these variants with the intent of defining DA dysfunction and associated behaviors as possible complications of ASD.",

This corrector rescues F508del-CFTR from its abnormal intracellular localization to the cell surface, a traffic defect shared by all Class II CFTR mutants. Our goal here is to test the efficacy of lumacaftor in other Class II mutants in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients.The effect of lumacaftor was investigated in primary HBE cells from non-CF and CF patients with F508del/F508del, A561E/A561E, N1303K/G542X, F508del/G542X and F508del/Y1092X genotypes by measurements of Forskolin plus Genistein-inducible equivalent short-circuit current (Ieq-SC-Fsk\u00a0+\u00a0Gen) in perfused open-circuit Ussing chambers. Efficacy of corrector C18 was also assessed on A561E/A561E and F508del/F508del cells.Our data indicate that A561E (when present in both alleles) responds positively to lumacaftor treatment at equivalent efficacy of F508del in primary HBE cells. Similarly, lumacaftor has a positive impact on Y1092X, but not on N1303K. Our data also show that cells with only one copy of F508del-CFTR respond less to VX-809. Moreover, there is great variability in lumacaftor responses among F508del-homozygous cells from different donors. Compound C18 failed to rescue A561E-CFTR but not in F508del-CFTR, thus plausibly it has a different mechanism of action distinct from lumacaftor.CF patients with A561E (and likely also those with Y1029X) can potentially benefit from lumacaftor.

When a circulating TXA2 level of 1000\u00a0pg/mL was selected as a practical cutoff point, 95% of CRC patients were successfully identified. Further study suggested that the TXA2 pathway is constitutively activated during colorectal tumorigenesis and required for anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells.This study established the importance of the TXA2 pathway in CRC pathophysiology, and laid the groundwork for introducing a TXA2-targeting strategy to CRC prevention, early detection and management.",

Aberrant promoter CpG island methylation and subsequent transcriptional silencing of specific genes have emerged as contributors to progression of chronic kidney disease. Here, we report that transcriptional silencing of the Ras-GTP suppressor RASAL1 contributes causally to progression of kidney fibrosis and we identified that circulating methylated RASAL1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood correspond with levels of intrarenal levels of RASAL1 promoter methylation and degree of fibrosis in kidney biopsies, enabling non-invasive longitudinal analysis of intrarenal CpG island methylation.Retrospective analysis of patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis revealed that circulating methylated RASAL1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood decrease with Dihydralazine treatment in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and provided evidence that low-dose Dihydralazine delays decline of excretory kidney function, whereas Dihydralazine at standard doses had no protective effect. We demonstrate that the protective effect of Dihydralazine is due to induction of endogenous Tet3/Tdg-mediated DNA-de-methylation activity reversing aberrant promoter CpG island methylation, while HIF1\u03b1 induction at standard doses counterbalances its protective activity. We conclude that RASAL1 promoter methylation is a therapeutic target and a biomarker of renal fibrosis.

Durable control in LTNP/EC is likely mediated by highly functional virus-specific CD8+ T-cells. Protective Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I alleles, like B*27 and B*57, are present in most, but not all LTNP/EC, providing an opportunity to investigate features shared by their HIV-specific immune responses. To better understand the contribution of epitope targeting and conservation to immune control, we compared the CD8+ T-cell specificity and function of B*27/57neg LTNP/EC (n\u00a0=\u00a023), B*27/57pos LTNP/EC (n\u00a0=\u00a023) and B*27/57neg progressors (n\u00a0=\u00a013). Fine mapping revealed 11 previously unreported immunodominant responses. Although B*27/57neg LTNP/EC did not target more highly conserved epitopes, their CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity was significantly higher than progressors. Similar to B*27/57pos LTNP/EC, this superior cytotoxicity was mediated by preferential expansion of immunodominant responses and lysis through the predicted HLA. These findings suggest that increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity is a common mechanism of control in most LTNP/EC regardless of HLA type. They also suggest that potent cytotoxicity can be mediated through various epitopes and HLA molecules and could, in theory, be induced in most people.",

We performed WGS on members of two cohorts of cancer genetics patients: those with BRCA1/2 mutations (n\u00a0=\u00a0176) and those without (n\u00a0=\u00a082). Initial analysis of potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs, defined as nonsynonymous variants with allele frequency\u00a0<\u00a01% in ESP6500) in 163 clinically-relevant genes suggested that WGS will provide useful clinical results. This is despite the fact that a majority of PPVs were novel missense variants likely to be classified as variants of unknown significance (VUS). Furthermore, previously reported pathogenic missense variants did not always associate with their predicted diseases in our patients. This suggests that the clinical use of WGS will require large-scale efforts to consolidate WGS and patient data to improve accuracy of interpretation of rare variants. While loss-of-function (LoF) variants represented only a small fraction of PPVs, WGS identified additional cancer risk LoF PPVs in patients with known BRCA1/2 mutations and led to cancer risk diagnoses in 21% of non-BRCA cancer genetics patients after expanding our analysis to 3209 ClinVar genes. These data illustrate how WGS can be used to improve our ability to discover patients' cancer genetic risks.",

In addition to directly remodeling actin filaments in vitro, we have shown that INF2 regulates intracellular actin dynamics and actin dependent cellular behavior by opposing Rhoa/Dia signaling. As a step towards a better understanding of the human kidney disease, we wanted to explore the relevance of these findings to the in vivo situation. We used dose dependent knockdown of INF2 to first define an in vivo model and establish an overt glomerular phenotype in zebrafish. This simple assay was validated by rescue with wild type INF2 confirming the specificity of the findings. The edema, podocyte dysfunction, and an altered glomerular filtration barrier observed in the zebrafish pronephros correlate with mistrafficking of glomerular slit diaphragm proteins, defective slit-diaphragm signaling, and disinhibited diaphanous formin (mDia) activity. In contrast to wild-type human INF2, INF2 mutants associated with kidney disease fail to rescue the zINF2 morphant phenotype. Of particular interest, this INF2 knockdown phenotype is also rescued by loss of either RhoA or Dia2. This simple assay allows the demonstration that INF2 functions, at least in part, to modulate Dia-mediated Rho signaling, and that disease causing mutations specifically impair this regulatory function. These data support a model in which disease-associated diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) mutants in INF2 interfere with its binding to and inhibition of Dia, leading to uncontrolled Rho/Dia signaling and perturbed actin dynamics. Methods to fine tune Rho signaling in the glomerulus may lead to new approaches to therapy in humans.",

Inhibition of autophagic membrane formation compromises infectious particle production and leads to the accumulation of viral DNA in the cytosol. Vice versa, pharmacological stimulation of autophagic membrane formation enhances infectious virus production. Atg8/LC3, an essential macroautophagy protein and substrate anchor on autophagic membranes, was found in virus preparations, suggesting that EBV recruits Atg8/LC3 coupled membranes to its envelope in the cytosol.

We aimed to determine the contribution of large isoform of Mammalian DnaJ (MRJ-L), a HIV-1 Vpr-interacting cellular protein, to this natural variation. Expression of MRJ-L in monocyte-derived macrophages was significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a031) than their uninfected counterparts (n\u00a0=\u00a027) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Fifty male homosexual subjects (20 of them are HIV-1 positive) were further recruited to examine the association between MRJ-L levels and occurrence of HIV infection. Bayesian multiple logistic regression revealed that playing a receptive role and increased levels of MRJ-L in macrophages were two risk factors for HIV-1 infection. A 1% rise in MRJ-L expression was associated with a 1.13 fold (95% CrI 1.06\u20131.29) increase in odds of contracting HIV-1 infection. Ex vivo experiments revealed that MRJ-L facilitated Vpr-dependent nuclear localization of virus. Infection of macrophage-tropic strain is a critical step in HIV-1 transmission. MRJ-L is a critical factor in this process; hence, subjects with higher macrophage MRJ-L levels are more vulnerable to HIV-1 infection.",

Measles virus (MV) RNA was obtained directly from the clinical specimens, amplified by PCR, and then the N and H genes were sequenced.MV RNA was detectable in throat swabs from all 122 patients tested. Positive-strand viral RNA, which indicates the intermediate replicative form of MV, was also detected in PBMCs from all 31 cases from whom these cells were collected. One hundred and eighteen strains with the N gene were obtained by RT-PCR and sequenced. Using phylogenetic analysis with measles reference sequences, all of the Vietnamese strains were found to be genotype D8. However, all strains formed a distinct cluster within the genotype D8 group (D8-VNM) suggesting their own lineage. This distinct cluster was supported by a branch with a 99% bootstrap value and 3.3% nucleotide divergence in the N-450 region of the N gene from the D8 reference strain. Notably, all of the D8-VNM variant strains represented unique amino acid sequences consisting of R442, S451 and G452 in the N-450 region of the N gene.Measles viruses responsible for outbreaks in Southern Vietnam belonged to a genotype D8 variant group which had unique amino acid sequences in the N gene.

We provide unprecedented experimental evidence for a previously unrecognized causal link between CD22\u0394E12 and aggressive biology of BPL cells by demonstrating that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD22\u0394E12 in primary BPL cells is associated with a marked inhibition of their clonogenicity. These findings provide the preclinical proof-of-concept that siRNA-mediated depletion of CD22\u0394E12 may help develop effective treatments for high-risk and relapsed BPL patients who are in urgent need for therapeutic innovations. We also describe a unique polypeptide-based nanoparticle formulation of CD22\u0394E12-siRNA as an RNAi therapeutic candidate targeting CD22\u0394E12 that is capable of delivering its siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm of leukemia cells causing effective CD22\u0394E12 depletion and marked inhibition of leukemic cell growth.

We further show that SYK regulates the G2 checkpoint by physically associating with and inhibiting the dual-specificity phosphatase CDC25C via phosphorylation of its S216 residue. SYK depletion by RNA interference or treatment with the chemical SYK inhibitor prevented nocodazole-treated human cell lines from activating the G2 checkpoint via CDC25C S216-phosphorylation and resulted in polyploidy. Our study provides genetic and biochemical evidence that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has a unique role in the activation of the G2 checkpoint in both non-lymphohematopoietic and B-lineage lymphoid cells.

We studied cytoadhesion of parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) to the endothelial receptors CD36 and ICAM1, rosetting of pRBCs with uninfected RBCs, and pRBC surface expression of the parasite-derived adhesion molecule P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1).We confirmed previous reports that HbAS pRBCs show reduced cytoadhesion, rosetting and PfEMP1 expression levels compared to normal pRBC controls. Furthermore, we found that co-inheritance of HbAS with \u03b1+thalassemia consistently reversed these effects, such that pRBCs of mixed genotype showed levels of cytoadhesion, rosetting and PfEMP1 expression that were indistinguishable from those seen in normal pRBCs. However, pRBCs with \u03b1+thalassemia alone showed parasite strain-specific effects on adhesion, and no consistent reduction in PfEMP1 expression.Our data support the hypothesis that the negative epistasis between HbAS and \u03b1+thalassemia observed in epidemiological studies might be explained by host genotype-specific changes in the pRBC-adhesion properties that contribute to parasite sequestration and disease pathogenesis in vivo.

We conducted studies on human breast cancer cell lines and compared arsenic exposure in Antofagasta with concentrations inducing apoptosis in laboratory studies.Before 1958, breast cancer mortality rates were similar, but in 1958\u20131970 the rates in Region II were half those in Region V (rate ratio RR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95% CI 0.40\u20130.66; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Women under the age of 60 experienced a 70% reduction in breast cancer mortality during 1965\u20131970 (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.30, 0.17\u20130.54; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Breast cancer cell culture studies showed apoptosis at arsenic concentrations close to those estimated to have occurred in people in Region II.We found biologically plausible major reductions in breast cancer mortality during high exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water which could not be attributed to bias or confounding. We recommend clinical trial assessment of inorganic arsenic in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Sepsis involves aberrant immune responses to infection, but the exact nature of this immune dysfunction remains poorly defined. Bacterial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are potent inducers of inflammation, which has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis, but repeated exposure can also induce a suppressive effect known as endotoxin tolerance or cellular reprogramming. It has been proposed that endotoxin tolerance might be associated with the immunosuppressive state that was primarily observed during late-stage sepsis. However, this relationship remains poorly characterised. Here we clarify the underlying mechanisms and timing of immune dysfunction in sepsis.We defined a gene expression signature characteristic of endotoxin tolerance. Gene-set test approaches were used to correlate this signature with early sepsis, both newly and retrospectively analysing microarrays from 593 patients in 11 cohorts. Then we recruited a unique cohort of possible sepsis patients at first clinical presentation in an independent blinded controlled observational study to determine whether this signature was associated with the development of confirmed sepsis and organ dysfunction.All sepsis patients presented an expression profile strongly associated with the endotoxin tolerance signature (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; AUC 96.1%). Importantly, this signature further differentiated between suspected sepsis patients who did, or did not, go on to develop confirmed sepsis, and predicted the development of organ dysfunction.Our data support an updated model of sepsis pathogenesis in which endotoxin tolerance-mediated immune dysfunction (cellular reprogramming) is present throughout the clinical course of disease and related to disease severity. Thus endotoxin tolerance might offer new insights guiding the development of new therapies and diagnostics for early sepsis.",

     "abstract": "Vascular diseases are increasing health problems affecting >\u00a025\u00a0million individuals in westernized societies. Such patients could benefit from transplantation of tissue-engineered vascular grafts using autologous cells. One challenge that has limited this development is the need for cell isolation, and risks associated with ex vivo expanded stem cells. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to generate transplantable vascular grafts using decellularized allogeneic vascular scaffolds, repopulated with peripheral whole blood (PWB) in vitro in a bioreactor. Circulating, VEGFR-2\u00a0+/CD45\u00a0+ and a smaller fraction of VEGFR-2\u00a0+/CD14\u00a0+ cells contributed to repopulation of the graft. SEM micrographs showed flat cells on the luminal surface of the grafts consistent with endothelial cells. For clinical validation, two autologous PWB tissue-engineered vein conduits were prepared and successfully used for by-pass procedures in two pediatric patients. These results provide a proof of principle for the generation of transplantable vascular grafts using a simple autologous blood sample, making it clinically feasible globally.",

     "abstract": "The induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 72 by mild electrical stimulation with heat shock (MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS), which improves visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in mice, may be beneficial in treating metabolic syndrome (MS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Using open-label crossover trials, 40 subjects with MS or T2DM were randomly assigned using computer-generated random numbers to 12\u00a0weeks of therapeutic MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS followed by 12\u00a0weeks of no treatment, or vice versa. During the intervention period, physical and biochemical markers were measured.Compared to no treatment, MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS treatment was associated with a significant decrease in visceral adiposity (\u2212\u00a07.54\u00a0cm2 (\u2212\u00a08.61%), 95% CI \u2212\u00a08.55 to \u2212\u00a06.53 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) in MS, \u2212\u00a019.73\u00a0cm2 (\u2212\u00a010.89%), 95% CI \u2212\u00a020.97 to \u2212\u00a018.49 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) in T2DM). Fasting plasma glucose levels were decreased by 3.74\u00a0mg/dL (\u2212\u00a05.28%: 95% CI \u2212\u00a04.37 to \u2212\u00a03.09\u00a0mg/dL, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) in MS and by 14.97\u00a0mg/dL (10.40%: 95% CI \u2212\u00a015.79 to 14.15\u00a0mg/dL, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in T2DM, and insulin levels were also reduced by 10.39% and 25.93%, respectively. HbA1c levels showed a trend toward reduction (\u2212\u00a00.06%) in MS, and was significantly declined by \u2212\u00a00.43% (95% CI \u2212\u00a00.55 to \u2212\u00a00.31%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) in T2DM. HbA1c level of less than 7.0% was achieved in 52.5% of the MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS-treated T2DM patients in contrast to 15% of the non-treated period. Several insulin resistance indices, inflammatory cytokines or adipokines, including C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, were all improved in both groups. In isolated monocytes, HSP72 expression was increased and cytokine expression was reduced following MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS treatment. Glucose excursions on meal tolerance test were lower after using MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS in T2DM.This combination therapy has beneficial impacts on body composition, metabolic abnormalities, and inflammation in subjects with MS or T2DM. Activation of the heat shock response by MES\u00a0+\u00a0HS may provide a novel approach for the treatment of lifestyle-related diseases.Funding for this research was provided by MEXT KAKENHI (Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan).",
