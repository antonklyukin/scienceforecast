     "abstract": "Chest wall invasion (CWI) is observed in 5% of localized non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in these patients is unknown. We investigate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with T3N0 NSCLC due to CWI.Patients with T3N0 NSCLC due to CWI were identified using a prospective registry. CWI was defined as radiographic evidence of soft tissue invasion or bony destruction. We excluded patients with recurrent or metastatic disease. All patients were treated with definitive SBRT. Prescribed dose was 50\u202fGy in 5 fractions for most patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival outcomes.We identified 12 patients treated between 2006 and 2017. Median age was 70 (range, 58\u201385). Median tumor diameter was 3.0\u202fcm (range, 0.9\u20137.2). Median survival was 12.0\u202fmonths (range, 2.4\u201363). At a median follow-up of 8.9\u202fmonths (range, 2.1\u201363), 1-year primary tumor control was 89%, involved lobar control was 89%, local\u2013regional control was 82%, distant control was 91%, and survival was 63%. Of the 4 patients with pre-treatment chest wall pain, 3 reported improvement after SBRT. Two patients reported new grade 1\u20132 chest wall pain. No grade 3+ toxicity was reported, with 1 patient experiencing grade 1 skin toxicity and 3 patients experiencing grade 1\u20132 radiation pneumonitis.SBRT for CWI NSCLC is safe, with high early tumor control and low treatment-related toxicity. Most patients with pre-treatment chest wall pain experienced relief after SBRT, with no grade 3+ toxicity observed.",

     "abstract": "The aim of our study was an external validation of the extracranial prognostic score predicting survival of patients with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation on data from a single institution.A retrospective analysis of 524 patients with brain metastases treated with cranial radiotherapy in a single tertiary center was performed. Three predictive scores were calculated and assessed for their ability to discriminate prognostic groups: (i) The Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) score (available for 524 patients); (ii) the Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) score (464 patients); (iii) the extracranial score (EC-S) developed by Nieder et al. which is based on serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the number of extracranial organs involved (157 patients). Discrimination of each score was assessed by G\u00f6nen & Heller\u2019s concordance probability estimate (CPE). The calibration was checked by comparing median survival estimates of each risk group with the corresponding values of the datasets from which the scores were derived. Finally, a multivariable Cox regression model was built by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator on a large number of variables including all three scores.With a CPE\u202f=\u202f0.626\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.022, the EC-S had the best discriminatory power. The EC-S also appeared to be better calibrated and had the best ability to separate patients with a very poor prognosis: patients with combination of low albumin, elevated LDH and more than 1 extracranial organ with metastatic involvement had a median survival time of only 0.6\u202fmonths (CI95% 0.1\u20131.1) and a hazard ratio for death of 6.36 (2.67\u201315.14) compared to patients with no extracranial metastases and normal levels of albumin and LDH. In the multivariable Cox model serum albumin, LDH, treatment modality, DS-GPA and EC-S were retained as prognostic factors. An ad hoc combination of both DS-GPA and EC-S into a new score was possible for 134 patients and indicated a slightly better discrimination (CPE\u202f=\u202f0.636\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.023) than either DS-GPA or EC-S alone.This study provides an independent validation of the prognostic EC-S which was the best prognostic model for defining the patients who obviously did not benefit from radiation therapy of brain metastases in terms of overall survival. The combination of the EC-S with the established DS-GPA score resulted in a slight increase in discriminatory ability. The new EC-GPA score needs further validation in larger patient cohorts.",

     "abstract": "To determine the potential for dose escalation to a biological equivalent dose BED10 \u2245 100\u202fGy in hypofractionated radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).Ten unselected LAPC patients were retrospectively included in the study. Two fractionation regimens were compared (5 and 15 fractions). The aim was to cover 95% of the Planning Target Volume (PTV) with a BED10\u202f=\u202f54\u202fGy (base dose\u202f=\u202f33\u202fGy in 5 fractions, 42.5\u202fGy in 15 fractions) whilst respecting organs-at-risk (OAR) constraints. Once the highest PTV coverage was achieved dose escalation to a BED10 \u2245 100\u202fGy (escalated dose\u202f=\u202f50\u202fGy in 5 fractions, 67.5\u202fGy in 15 fractions) was attempted, limiting the PTV maximum dose to 130% of the escalated dose.In 5 fractions, 95% PTV coverage by both base and escalated doses could be achieved for one patient with PTV more than 1\u202fcm away from OAR. 95% and 90% PTV coverage by the base dose was achieved in one and two patients respectively. In all other patients, coverage even by the base dose had to be compromised to comply with OAR constraints. In 15 fractions, 95% PTV coverage by the base dose was feasible for all patients except one. Dose escalation allowed improvement in target coverage by the base dose in both fractionation regimen whilst covering a sub-volume of the PTV with a BED10 \u2245 100\u202fGy. Both fractionation schemes were equivalent in terms of dose escalation potential.LAPC patients with OAR close to the PTV are generally not eligible for hypofractionation with dose escalation. However, this planning study shows that it is possible to cover PTV sub-volumes with a BED10 \u2245 100\u202fGy in addition to delivering a BED10\u202f=\u202f54\u202fGy to 90\u201395% of the PTV as commonly prescribed to this population. Combined with an adaptive approach, this may maximize PTV coverage by a high BED on days with favourable anatomy.",

Adaptive radiotherapy is often necessary but 1) tools are needed to define the optimal time for replanning, and 2) the subsequent workflow is time-consuming.We designed a prospective study to evaluate 1) the validity of automatically deformed contours on the daily MVCT, in order to safely use the \u201cdose-of the day\u201d tool to check daily if replanning is necessary; 2) the automatically deformed contours on the replanning CT and the time gained in the replanning workflow.Forty-eight patients with T3-T4 and/or involved node >2\u202fcm head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, planned for curative radiotherapy without surgery, will be enrolled. They will undergo treatment with helical IMRT including daily repositioning MVCTs. The contours proposed will be compared weekly on intermediate planning CTs (iCTs) on weeks 3, 4, 5 and 6. On these iCTs both manual recontouring and automated deformable registration of the initial contours will be compared with the contours automatically defined on the MVCT. The primary objective is to evaluate the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the volumes of each parotid gland. The secondary objectives will evaluate, for target volumes and all OARs: the DSC, the mean distance to agreement, and the average surface-to-surface distance. Time between the automatic and the manual recontouring workflows will be compared.",

These markers have previously been reported in a study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) (Linge et al., 2016).In this retrospective monocentric study, 92 patients with locally advanced HNSCC were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and Cox models presented in the study of the DKTK-ROG were validated using the area under the curve (AUC) and the concordance index (ci), respectively. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional tumour control (LRC) after primary RCTx.Although both cohorts significantly differed in the proportion of the tumour subsites, the parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage could be validated regarding LRC and overall survival (OS) using multivariable Cox regression (LRC ci: 0.59, OS ci: 0.63). These models were slightly improved by combination with the putative CSC marker CD44 (LRC ci: 0.61, OS ci: 0.69). The logistic regression model for 2-year LRC based on tumour volume, p16 status and CD44 protein was validated with an AUC of 0.64. The patient stratification based on hypoxia-associated gene signatures status was similar to the original study but without significant differences in LRC and OS.In this validation study, the inclusion of the putative CSC marker CD44 slightly improved the prognostic performance of the baseline parameters tumour volume, p16 status and N stage. No improvement was observed when including expressions of the hypoxia-associated gene signatures. Prospective validation on a larger cohort is warranted to assess the clinical relevance of these markers.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this current study was to assess whether the tumour grade and molecular subtypes have influenced local control in the whole breast hypofractionated radiotherapy (HRT) over standard radiotherapy (SRT) in early breast node negative cancer patients by a retrospective control group study.Data of 215 patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy at our institution from 2008 to 2011 were prospectively collected and then compared with 215\u202fpts treated with SRT in a control group study. The local relapse free survival (LRFS) in both arms was compared on the basis of variables defined by tumour grade (Nottingham Grading System), and Molecular subtypes. Kaplan-Meier method was applied to estimate the LRFS in both groups. Chi-squared and univariate Cox proportional hazards model were conducted for all variables in both groups to assess the impact on local control. Statistical significance was assumed at P\u202f<\u202f.05. Statistical significant variables at univariate analysis were then included in multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. The median follow up duration was 9.5\u202fyears (7\u201313\u202fyrs); the Kaplan Meyer 8\u202fyear LRFS did not reach any statistical significant difference between the two groups (P\u202f=\u202f. 836). At univariate Cox analysis tumour grade 3 was significantly related to local relapse only in the SRT group (P\u202f=\u202f.041) while, among molecular subtypes, no differences were found for all groups; for Her2\u202f+\u202fnoL no difference was found (P\u202f=\u202f.233). Multivariate analysis confirmed Her2 non-luminal subtype as an independent variable for local relapse regardless the fractionation arm (P\u202f=\u202f.045). Breast cancer subtypes show a different radiosensitivity, which is independent by fractionation.",

     "abstract": "The tumor, node, metastases (TNM) anatomic staging system plays a pivotal role in cancer care, research, and cancer control activities. Since the first edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging classification published in 1977, soft tissue sarcomas have been staged in an anatomic site agnostic fashion whereby the primary tumor size (T) was categorized as T1 if <=5\u202fcm and T2 if >5\u202fcm; this remained unchanged through the 7th edition of the TNM. However, soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck (STSHN) usually present smaller than sarcomas of other sites, but carry a disproportionate risk of local recurrence. Up to 70% of tumors are less than 5\u202fcm at presentation, and therefore classified together as T1. Given the rarity of STSHN, there is a paucity of data to guide progress in their classification. Moreover, the majority of publications only report tumor size as less than or greater than 5\u202fcm, presumably based on conventions of the TNM system that remained unchanged for 40\u202fyears, thereby affecting progress of STSHN classification. This formed the impetus for change in the 8th edition in 2 key ways: 1) several soft tissue sarcoma site based changes occurred including STSHN now having its own system, and 2) primary tumor size cut-offs of 2\u202fcm and 4\u202fcm used in STSHN now reflect sizes that head and neck specialists commonly encounter in their practice. This update was pragmatic in modifying the TNM from a system with a T category not serving STSHN and which was originally based on sarcoma data from non-head and neck anatomic sites. The background to this change is outlined which provides a framework in which data can be reported to generate evidence for future staging modifications.",

T cell origin lymphomas are most common, with Mycosis Fungoides (MF) accounting for about 50\u201370% of cases. Sezary Syndrome (SS), which represents the leukemic varian of MF, accounts for 3% of Cutaneous T Cell Lymphomas (CTCL). Total Skin Electron Beam Therapy (TSEB) is included at the mainstream of treatment choices for CTCL. The scope of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of two treatment schedules of TSEB.We report our experience with TSEB in the management of MF and SS, as of 14 patients treated in our institution from 2011 to 2015. 8 patients received the 12\u202fGy (low dose) scheme while 6 patients were managed with 36\u202fGy (standard or full dose scheme) according to six dual field Stanford technique. The endpoints were overall response rate, duration of response and toxicity of treatment.After a median follow up of 2.5\u202fyears we noted excellent treatment outcome, with both schemes being well tolerated and resulting in comparable response rates. The overall response rate for both treatment regimens was over 87.5%. Treatment was well tolerated with mild toxicity.The role of TSEB in the management of MF and SS is well established. The low dose TSEB schedule of 12\u202fGy is an effective treatment option, since therapeutic results are more than acceptable, compliance is excellent and toxicity is minimal. Moreover, the evidence that it can be repeated safely makes it more attractive than the standard 36\u202fGy scheme, when a patient is referred to radiation treatment according to treatment guidelines.",

Radiation is often deferred or delayed for these patients due to late effects; proton therapy may mitigate some of these concerns. This study reviews the role of radiation in ETMR and describes initial results with proton therapy.Records of patients with embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), medulloepithelioma (MEP), and ependymoblastoma (EPL) treated with proton therapy at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. A literature review of cases of CNS ETANTR, MEP, and EPL published since 1990 was also conducted.Seven patients were treated with proton therapy. Their median age at diagnosis was 33\u202fmonths (range 10\u201357\u202fmonths) and their median age at radiation start was 42\u202fmonths (range 17\u201358\u202fmonths). Their median overall survival (OS) was 16\u202fmonths (range 8\u201364\u202fmonths), with three patients surviving 36\u202fmonths or longer. Five patients had disease progression prior to starting radiation; all 5 of these patients failed in the tumor bed. A search of the literature identified 204 cases of ETMR with a median OS of 10\u202fmonths (range 0.03\u2013161\u202fmonths). Median OS of 18 long-term survivors (\u226536\u202fmonths) in the literature was 77\u202fmonths (range 37\u2013184\u202fmonths). Of these 18 long-term survivors, 17 (94%) received radiotherapy as part of their initial treatment; 14 of them were treated with craniospinal irradiation.Outcomes of patients with ETMR treated with proton therapy are encouraging compared to historical results. Further study of this rare tumor is warranted to better define the role of radiotherapy.",

Most bladder cancer trials have excluded SqCC, and the current treatment paradigm for localized SqCC is extrapolated from results in urothelial carcinoma (UC). In particular, there is limited data on the efficacy of definitive chemo-radiotherapy (CRT). In this study, we compare overall survival outcomes between SqCC and UC patients treated with definitive CRT.We queried the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for muscle-invasive (cT2-T4 N0 M0) bladder cancer patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2013 who underwent concurrent CRT. Propensity matching was performed to match patients with SqCC to those with UC. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival method, and the log-rank test and Cox regression were used for analyses.3332 patients met inclusion criteria of which 79 (2.3%) had SqCC. 73.4% of SqCC patients had clinical T2 disease compared to 82.5% of UC patients. Unadjusted median OS for SqCC patients was 15.6\u202fmonths (95% CI, 11.7\u201319.6) versus 29.1\u202fmonths (95% CI, 27.5\u201330.7) for those with UC (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with worse OS included: SqCC histology [HR: 1.53 (95% CI, 1.19\u20131.97); P\u202f=\u202f0.001], increasing age [HR: 1.02 (95% CI, 1.02\u20131.03); P\u202f<\u202f0.0001], increasing clinical T-stage [HR: 1.21 (95% CI, 1.13\u20131.29); P\u202f<\u202f0.0001], and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index [HR: 1.26 (95% CI, 1.18\u20131.33); P\u202f<\u202f0.0001]. Seventy-seven SqCC patients were included in the propensity-matched analysis (154 total patients) with a median OS for SqCC patients of 15.1\u202fmonths (95% CI, 11.1\u201318.9) vs. 30.4\u202fmonths (95% CI, 19.4\u201341.4) for patients with UC (P\u202f=\u202f0.013).This is the largest study to-date assessing survival outcomes for SqCC of the bladder treated with CRT. In this study, SqCC had worse overall survival compared to UC patients. Histology had a greater impact on survival than increasing T-stage, suggesting that histology should be an important factor when determining a patient\u2019s treatment strategy and that treatment intensification in this subgroup may be warranted.",

As the critical brain areas are mainly in the target volume vicinity, it is unclear if protons indeed substantially spare neurofunctional organs at risk (NOAR). Therefore, a dosimetric comparison study of WV-RT/TB was conducted to assess whether proton or photon radiotherapy achieves better NOAR sparing.Eleven children with GCT received 24\u202fGy(RBE) WV-RT and a boost up to 40\u202fGy(RBE) in 25 fractions of 1.6\u202fGy(RBE) with pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT). Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated for these patients. NOAR were delineated and treatment plans were compared for target volume coverage (TVC), homogeneity index (HI), inhomogeneity coefficient (IC) and (N)OAR sparing.TVC was comparable for all three modalities. Compared to IMRT and VMAT, PBS-PT showed statistically significant optimized IC, as well as dose reduction, among others, in mean and integral dose to the: normal brain (\u221235.2%, \u221232.7%; \u221235.2%, \u221233.0%, respectively), cerebellum (\u221253.7%, \u221233.1%; \u221253.6%, \u221232.7%) and right temporal lobe (\u221214.5%, \u221231.9%; \u221214.7%, \u221229.9%).

Compared to VMAT, the dose to the hippocampi, amygdalae and temporal lobes was significantly decreased in the IMRT plans.Dosimetric comparison of WV-RT/TB in IGCT suggests PBS-PT's advantage over photons in conformality and NOAR sparing, whereas IMRT\u2019s superiority over VMAT, thus potentially minimizing long-term sequelae.",

Despite promising preclinical and clinical phase I and II results, the most important of which are described in this review, the implementation of hypoxia-activated prodrugs in the clinic has, so far, not been successful. The lack of stratification of patients based on tumor hypoxia status, which can vary widely, is sufficient to account for the failure of phase III trials. To fully exploit the potential of hypoxia-activated prodrugs, hypoxia stratification of patients is needed. Here, we propose a biomarker-stratified enriched Phase III study design in which only biomarker-positive (i.e. hypoxia-positive) patients are randomized between standard treatment and the combination of standard treatment with a hypoxia-activated prodrug. This implies the necessity of a Phase II study in which the biomarker or a combination of biomarkers will be evaluated. The total number of patients needed for both clinical studies will be far lower than in currently used randomize-all designs. In addition, we elaborate on the improvements in HAP design that are feasible to increase the treatment success rates.",

We analyzed the differences in the mean dose received by regions of the esophagus relative to the landmark of the azygous vein and the stomach to correlate the development of an anastomotic complication using nonparametric rank-sum tests.Anastomotic leakage and stricture rates were 12% and 22%, respectively. Patients with anastomotic complications received a statistically significant higher mean dose to the esophagus at the level of the azygous vein (0.0\u202fcm) and lower (up to \u22122.7\u202fcm) (28.4\u201342.2\u202fGy vs. 10.3\u201327.6\u202fGy, p\u202f<\u202f0.04).

The prone approach appeared to be more favorable with respect to the chest wall, and ipsilateral lung dose compared to the supine position. No dosimetric differences were observed for the ipsilateral breast. No treatment position was clearly more beneficial for the skin or heart, since dosimetry varied among parameters. Overall, the MRI-linac and clinical plans were comparable, with minor absolute dosimetric differences.MRI-linac based single dose APBI to the intact tumor is a promising and a dosimetrically feasible strategy in patients with low-risk breast cancer.

FGF1 is a candidate radioprotector for radiation-induced intestinal damage, but may promote the malignancy of pancreatic cancer. An FGF1/CPP-C chimeric protein was created to enhance the intracellular signaling mode of FGF1 instead of FGFR signaling. The present study investigated the effects of FGF1/CPP-C on the intestinal adverse reactions of C-ion radiotherapy as well as its influence on the malignancy of pancreatic cancer.FGF1/CPP-C was administered intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice without heparin 12\u202fh before total body irradiation (TBI) with low-LET C-ion (17\u202fkeV/\u03bcm) at 6\u20138\u202fGy. Several radioprotective effects were examined in the jejunum. The invasion and migration of the human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 were assessed using Boyden chambers after cultures with FGF1/CPP-C.The FGF1/CPP-C treatment promoted crypt survival after C-ion irradiation at 7\u20138\u202fGy significantly more than the FGF1 treatment. FGF1/CPP-C also inhibited C-ion radiotherapy-induced apoptosis and reduced \u03b3H2AX foci in crypt cells more than FGF1. However, FGF1/CPP-C inhibited the downstream signaling pathways of FGFRs and suppressed the activation of cell-cycle regulatory molecules in the intestine until 4\u202fh after TBI. Furthermore, IEC6 cells were arrested in G2M after cultures with FGF1/CPP-C or FGF1, suggesting that DNA repair after irradiation is promoted by FGF1/CPP-C-induced G2M arrest. In contrast, FGF1/CPP-C appeared to be internalized into MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells more efficiently than FGF1. Therefore, FGF1/CPP-C reduced the in vitro proliferation, invasion, and migration of MIAPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells significantly more than FGF1 through the cellular internalization of FGF1.These results suggest that the intracellular signaling mode of FGF1/CPP-C attenuates the intestinal adverse effects of C-ion radiotherapy without enhancing the malignancy of pancreatic carcinoma.",

Significant decreases (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) in median rectal and anal NTCPs (respectively, Gr 2 late rectal bleeding and subjective sphincter control) were predicted when using an IRS.Local-dose effects are predicted to be significantly reduced by an IRS. The spatial NTCP model predicts a significant decrease in Gr 2 late rectal bleeding and subjective sphincter control. Dose constraints can be improved for current clinical treatment planning.",

     "abstract": "Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with raster scanning technology is a promising treatment for lung cancer and thoracic malignancies. Determining normal tissue tolerance of organs at risk is of utmost importance for the success of CIRT. Here we report the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of CIRT as a function of dose and fractionation for development of pulmonary fibrosis using well established fibrosis index (FI) model.Dose series of fractionated clinical quality CIRT versus conventional photon irradiation to the whole thorax were compared in C57BL6 mice. Quantitative assessment of pulmonary fibrosis was performed by applying the FI to computed tomography (CT) data acquired 24-weeks post irradiation. RBE was calculated as the ratio of photon to CIRT dose required for the same level of FI. Further RBE predictions were performed using the derived equation from high-linear energy transfer biologically effective dose (high-LET BED) model.The averaged lung fibrosis RBE of 5-fraction CIRT schedule was determined as 2.75\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.55. The RBE estimate at the half maximum effective dose (RBEED50) was estimated at 2.82 for clinically relevant fractional sizes of 1\u20136\u202fGy. At the same dose range, an RBE value of 2.81\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.40 was predicted by the high-LET BED model. The converted biologically effective dose (BED) of CIRT for induction of half maximum FI (BEDED50) was identified to be 58.12\u202fGy3.95. In accordance, an estimated RBE of 2.88 was obtained at the BEDED50 level. The LQ model radiosensitivity parameters for 5-fraction was obtained as \u03b1H\u202f=\u202f0.3030\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0037\u202fGy\u22121 and \u03b2H\u202f=\u202f0.0056\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0007\u202fGy\u22122.This is the first report of RBE estimation for CIRT with the endpoint of pulmonary fibrosis in-vivo. We proposed in present study a novel way to mathematically modeling RBE by integrating RBEmax and \u03b1/\u03b2L based on conventional high-LET BED conception. This model well predicted RBE in the clinically relevant dose range but is sensitive to the uncertainties of \u03b1/\u03b2 estimates from the reference photon irradiation (\u03b1/\u03b2L). These findings will assist to eliminate current uncertainties in prediction of CIRT induced normal tissue complications and builds a solid foundation for development of more accurate in-vivo data driven RBE estimates.",

     "abstract": "To compare and evaluate the utility of varying hemostatic radiotherapy prescriptions for emergent palliation of bleeding tumors.This retrospective study analyzed 112 consecutive patients treated with radiotherapy for emergent palliation of bleeding tumors at an academic institution. Study endpoints included: primary bleeding control; re-bleeding rate after initial control; treatment interruption rate; overall survival; and death within 30\u202fdays of treatment.The most commonly prescribed fractionations were: 20\u202fGy in 5 fractions, 30\u202fGy in 10 fractions, and 8\u202fGy in a single fraction. The overall primary bleeding control rate was 89%. By location, primary bleeding control rates were 89% (31/35), 80% (16/20), 88% (14/16), 93% (13/14), 100% (9/9), and 100% (6/6) for gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, thoracic, extremity, and gynecologic sites, respectively. The overall re-bleeding rate following initial bleeding control was 25%. Female patients had a significantly reduced risk of bleeding recurrence (HR 0.18 [0.04\u20130.79], p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Longer fractionation regimens (>5 fractions) were not associated with a reduced incidence of re-bleeding (p\u202f=\u202f0.65), but were associated with more treatment interruptions (p\u202f=\u202f0.02). The 1-year overall survival rate in this population was 24%, with mortality greater in patients with poor performance status (HR 2.99 [1.36\u20136.58], p\u202f=\u202f0.007).Regardless of prescription, palliative radiotherapy is highly effective for primary bleeding control, with both long and short regimens demonstrating equal hemostatic effect and durability in the emergent setting. Longer radiotherapy regimens (>5 fractions), however, are accompanied by increased treatment interruptions and hospital days. Therefore, shorter hemostatic regimens (<5 fractions) are preferable in this palliative setting, with respect to minimizing treatment burden for patients while achieving symptomatic relief.",

Of these, 265 (38%) received BT combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). An International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS quality of life (IPSS-QOL) score, and overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) were recorded before BT (baseline, BL), and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60\u202fmonths after BT. The sum of frequency (2), urgency (4) and nocturia (7) of the IPSS questionnaire was defined as the storage symptoms score, whereas the sum of emptying (1), intermittency (3), weak stream (5), and hesitancy (6) was defined as the voiding symptom score.Total IPSS significantly increased at 3\u202fmonths following BT compared with BL (mean score: 17.1 vs. 7.99, P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and returned to BL by 36\u202fmonths. The storage symptom score did not return to BL 36\u202fmonths after BT. Total OABSS significantly increased 3\u202fmonths after BT compared with BL (mean score: 6.52 vs. 3.45, P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and returned to BL 48\u202fmonths after BT.

The risk factors for LUTS within 1\u202fyear after BT were BL IPSS (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and PV (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Patients who received combined EBRT experienced transient storage symptoms 24 and 36\u202fmonths after BT, whereas those who received BT alone did not. However, the storage symptom score of the patients who received combined EBRT was improving 48\u202fmonths after BT and eventually showed no significant difference compared with those treated with BT alone.Three months after BT, LUTS, including storage symptoms, deteriorated the most but improved with time. The urinary symptom in patients who received combined EBRT can potentially flare again in 24 and 36\u202fmonths after BT. Knowledge of changes in LUTS associated with BT may influence treatment recommendations and enable patients to make better-informed decisions.",

Diabetic patients with prostate cancer could be at a high risk of radiation-induced acute proctitis following radical radiotherapy. Our aims were to analyse the incidence, severity, and duration of radiation proctitis in diabetic patients treated by radical radiotherapy and combined androgen deprivation for prostate cancer.On the bases of inclusion and exclusion criteria 716 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively recruited. Patients were stratified into diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients. The incidence, severity, and duration of proctitis were the main outcomes. A polynomial ordered logistic regression was fitted to determine the influence of diabetes status, age, blood pressures medication, co-morbidities, Gleason score, PSA after treatment, and tumour stage on the grades of proctitis. Time to resolution per year was modelled as a negative binomial generalised linear model.The overall mean age of patients was 67.44 (SD 6.77) years with a follow-up time of 3.36 (SD 2.05) years. Data exploratory analysis suggested that the only highly significant explanatory variable was the presence or absence of diabetes.

The pain score for each question consisted of a four-level scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3). Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between both esophageal and throat pain and clinical as well as dosimetric variables.In multivariate analysis, age was significantly associated with both types of pain, leading to odds ratio (OR)\u202f=\u202f0.95 (p\u202f=\u202f0.008) and OR\u202f=\u202f0.95 (p\u202f=\u202f0.007) for esophageal and throat pain, respectively.

     "abstract": "The goal is to compare, in vitro, the efficiency of minibeam radiotherapy (MBRT) and standard RT in inducing clonogenic cell death in glioma cell lines. With this aim, we report on the first in vitro study performed in an X-ray Small Animal Radiation Research Platform (SARRP) modified for minibeam irradiations. F98 rat and U87 human glioma cells were irradiated with either an array of minibeams (MB) or with conventional homogeneous beams (broad beam, BB). A specially designed multislit collimator was used to generate the minibeams with a width of a center-to-center distance of 1465 (\u00b110)\u202f\u03bcm, and a PVDR value of 12.4 (\u00b12.3) measured at 1\u202fcm depth in a water phantom. Cells were either replated for clonogenic assay directly (immediate plating, IP) or 24\u202fh after irradiation (delayed plating, DP) to assess the effect of potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR) on cell survival. Our hypothesis is that with MBRT, a similar level of clonogenic cell death can be reached compared to standard RT, when using equal mean radiation doses. To prove this, we performed dose escalations to determine the minimum integrated dose needed to reach a similar level of clonogenic cell death for both treatments. We show that this minimum dose can vary per cell line: in F98 cells a dose of 19\u202fGy was needed to obtain similar levels of clonogenic survival, whereas in U87 cells there was still a slightly increased survival with MB compared to BB 19\u202fGy treatment.The results suggest also an impairment of DNA damage repair in F98 cells as there is no difference in clonogenic cell survival between immediately and delayed plated cells for each dose and irradiation mode. For U87 cells, a small IP-DP effect was observed in the case of BB irradiation up to a dose of 17\u202fGy. However, at 19\u202fGy BB, as well as for the complete dose range of MB irradiation, U87 cells did not show a difference in clonogenic survival between IP and DP. We therefore speculate that MBRT might influence PLDR. The current results show that X-ray MBRT is a promising method for treatment of gliomas: future preclinical and clinical studies should aim at reaching a minimum radiation (valley) dose for effective eradication of gliomas with increased sparing of normal tissues compared to standard RT.",

     "abstract": "Current standard radiotherapy for oropharynx cancer (OPC) is associated with high rates of severe toxicities, shown to adversely impact patients\u2019 quality of life. Given excellent outcomes of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated OPC and long-term survival of these typically young patients, treatment de-intensification aimed at improving survivorship while maintaining excellent disease control is now a central concern. The recent implementation of magnetic resonance image \u2013 guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) systems allows for individual tumor response assessment during treatment and offers possibility of personalized dose-reduction. In this 2-stage Bayesian phase II study, we propose to examine weekly radiotherapy dose-adaptation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluated tumor response. Individual patient\u2019s plan will be designed to optimize dose reduction to organs at risk and minimize locoregional failure probability based on serial MRI during RT. Our primary aim is to assess the non-inferiority of MRgRT dose adaptation for patients with low risk HPV-associated OPC compared to historical control, as measured by Bayesian posterior probability of locoregional control (LRC).Patients with T1-2\u202fN0-2b (as per AJCC 7th Edition) HPV-positive OPC, with lymph node <3\u202fcm and <10 pack-year smoking history planned for curative radiotherapy alone to a dose of 70\u202fGy in 33 fractions will be eligible. All patients will undergo pre-treatment MRI and at least weekly intra-treatment MRI. Patients undergoing MRgRT will have weekly adaptation of high dose planning target volume based on gross tumor volume response. The stage 1 of this study will enroll 15 patients to MRgRT dose adaptation. If LRC at 6\u202fmonths with MRgRT dose adaptation is found sufficiently safe as per the Bayesian model, stage 2 of the protocol will expand enrollment to an additional 60 patients, randomized to either MRgRT or standard IMRT.Multiple methods for safe treatment de-escalation in patients with HPV-positive OPC are currently being studied. By leveraging the ability of advanced MRI techniques to visualize tumor and soft tissues through the course of treatment, this protocol proposes a workflow for safe personalized radiation dose-reduction in good responders with radiosensitive tumors, while ensuring tumoricidal dose to more radioresistant tumors. MRgRT dose adaptation could translate in reduced long term radiation toxicities and improved survivorship while maintaining excellent LRC outcomes in favorable OPC.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03224000; Registration date: 07/21/2017.",

To enhance patient recruitment strategies, we asked how patients wish to be informed about possible trials: More than half (52.0%) of the questioned patients preferred an individual medical consultation with their physician.We further analyzed the trial participation depending on age, gender, unit, and tumor entity. We could show a significant influence of age (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) but not for gender (p\u202f=\u202f0.724). The trial participation was also significantly associated with the treating unit (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and tumor entity (p\u202f=\u202f0.001).Patients are willing to participate in clinical trials. Better information strategies need to be implemented. Physicians need to be aware of running trials within their department and must counseling counsel patients effectively to improve recruitment. Trial concepts should keep in mind patients\u2019 needs including an adequate number of appointments, positive risk-benefit profiles, and information material.",

In this randomized study (The RIC-study) we used patient reported outcomes to evaluate sexual function 18\u202fmonths after combined endocrine therapy and radical radiotherapy (RT) given with either wide or tight planning target volume (PTV) margins. We also analyzed the impact of radiation dose to penile bulb on sexual function.The RIC-study included 257 men with intermediate and high-risk PC. All patients received 6\u202fmonths of total androgen blockage started 3\u202fmonths prior to randomization. In high-risk patients, an oral anti-androgen (Bicalutamide) was administered for an additional 2.5\u202fyears. Patients were randomized to receive 78\u202fGy in 39 fractions guided either by weekly offline orthogonal portal imaging or by daily online cone beam computed tomography image-guided RT. Sexual function was evaluated at 18\u202fmonths after start of RT using the Questionnaire Ume\u00e5 Fransson Widmark 1994. Ability to have an erection was assessed on an 11-point scale numerical rating scale (0\u202f=\u202fno and 10\u202f=\u202fvery much) as the primary outcome. In addition, the association between penile bulb (PB) radiation dose and erectile function was analyzed.Of 250 evaluable patients, 228 (mean age 71.8\u202fyears) returned the questionnaires. The patients reported a high degree of sexual related problems with mean scores to the primary outcome question (221 respondents) of 7.44 and 7.39 in the 2D weekly IGRT-arm and 3D daily IGRT-arm (p\u202f=\u202f0.93) respectively. For four additional questions (scale 0\u201310) regarding sexual function resulted in mean scores >6.5 with no difference between study arms. The mean dose to PB was substantially larger in the 2D weekly IGRT-arm vs the 3D daily IGRT-arm (mean 59.8\u202fGy vs mean 35.1\u202fGy).We found no effect of mean PB-dose on the primary outcome adjusted for study-site, risk-group and age. When adjusting for serum-testosterone level at 18\u202fmonths in addition, the effect of mean PB-dose remained insignificant.IGRT protocol or PB dose had no effect on ED 18\u202fmonths after RT in this study population. The low potency rates can partly be explained by the prolonged use of anti-androgen in high risk patients. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm the results from the RIC-study.",

Tumors were microscopically delineated on both sections by an experienced head-and-neck pathologist. Tumor delineations were compared using the conformity index (CI) and the distance between both contours.The CI between HE-based and CK-AE1/3-based tumor delineations was 0.87.

Multiple valid approaches exist, without a clear and absolute consensus for every clinical scenario, and therefore specialist opinions may vary. Multidisciplinary consultations focusing on shared decision-making aim to provide an apposite tool for the initial treatment decision. We have evaluated the first two years of activity of the Gustave Roussy Prostate Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic (PCMC), dedicated to the initial decision-making for non-metastatic prostate cancer.PCMC consists of two consecutive specialist consultations with a urological surgeon and a radiation oncologist, followed by a dedicated Tumor Board discussion. A study questionnaire was addressed to all PCMC patients via postal mail. Medical notes and questionnaire responses of 195 eligible patients were analyzed.The questionnaire response rate was 69% (134 patients). Complete satisfaction rate was high (114 of 118 responders, 97%). Patients were offered new treatment options in 55% of cases, and felt better informed in 98% (122 of 125 responders). The double consultation was considered useful (124 of 129 responders, 96%). Reported feeling of active participation was significantly elevated (117 of 131 responders, 89%), while 46% of patients (57 of 125) modified their decision on the management of their prostate cancer following their PCMC consultation.The experience of a multidisciplinary consultation in the initial management of non-metastatic prostate cancer renders high patient satisfaction, improves their appreciation of feeling better informed, promotes active participation and shared decision-making and strongly influences their final decision.",

It is unknown whether the presence of a neuropathic component also favorably influences pain interference. In a secondary analysis of our previous prospective observational study, we investigated if the presence of a neuropathic component of the index pain caused by the irradiated tumors predicts greater reduction in pain interference.For patients scheduled for RT for painful tumors, Brief Pain Inventory data were collected at initiation of RT and 1, 2, and 3\u202fmonths thereafter. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the effects of the presence of a neuropathic component on the changes in pain interference scores (i.e., follow-up minus baseline). We used 10 covariates as potential confounders.Of the 302 analyzable patients, 93 (31%) were diagnosed as having a neuropathic component of the index pain. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that all the point estimates of regression coefficients at 1-, 2-, and 3-month follow-up were negative values; some were statistically significant. At 2-month follow-up, patients with a neuropathic component experienced greater reductions in their pain interference scores for walking ability (p\u202f=\u202f0.048), normal work (p\u202f=\u202f0.021), sleep (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), and enjoyment of life (p\u202f=\u202f0.010) than those without it.The presence of a neuropathic pain component predicted a greater reduction in pain interference after RT.

Primary endpoint was urinary incontinence rate. Secondary endpoints were acute and late grade \u22652 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity rates, biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS).244 patients were included. Median follow-up after SRT was 50\u202fmonths (range: 4\u2013187\u202fmonths). Before start of SRT 69.7% of patients were continent for urine. After SRT de novo urinary incontinence complaints (grade\u202f\u2265\u202f1) occurred in the respective acute and late phase in 6.1% and 17.6% of patients. Respective acute grade \u22652 GU and GI toxicity was 19.2% and 17.6%. Late grade \u22652 toxicity for GU was 29.9% and for GI was 21.3%, respectively. The respective 5-year bPFS, OS, DSS and DMFS rates were 47.6%, 91.8%, 98.8% and 80.5%.Experience at our institution with SRT demonstrates that this results in good long-term biochemical control. However, toxicity and urinary incontinence rates were high.",

     "abstract": "Delineation of treatment volumes is a major source of uncertainties in radiotherapy (RT). This is also true for rectal cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant RT, with a potential impact on treatment quality. We investigated the role of the digital platform Anatom-e (Anatom-e Information Sytems Ltd., Houston, Texas) in increasing the compliance to follow a specific treatment protocol in a multicentric setting.Two clinical cases of locally advanced rectal cancer were chosen. Participants were instructed to follow the 2009 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus atlas and asked to manually segment clinical target volumes (CTVs), for both patient 1 and 2, on day 1 with and without the use of Anatom-e. After one week (day 2), the same radiation oncologist contoured again, with and without Anatom-e, the same CT series. Intraobserver (Intra-OV) and interobserver (Inter-OV) variability were evaluated with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Hausdorff distance (HD) and mean distance to agreement (MDA).For clinical case 1, no significant difference was found for Intra-OV and Inter-OV. For clinical case 2, no significant difference was found for Intra-OV but a statistically significant difference was found for Inter-OV in DSC when using or not the platform. Mean DCS was 0.65 (SD: \u00b10.64; range: 0.58\u20130.79) for day 1 vs reference volume without Anatom-e and 0.72 (SD: \u00b10.39; range: 0.67\u20130.77) (p\u202f=\u202f0.03) with it. Mean MDA was lower with Anatom-e (3.61; SD: \u00b11.33; range: 2.85\u20134.78) than without (4.14; SD: \u00b12.97; range: 2.18\u20135.21), with no statistical significance (p\u202f=\u202f0.21) The use of Anatom-e decreased the SD from 2.97 to 1.33. Mean HD was lower with Anatom-e (26.06; SD: \u00b12.05; range: 24.08\u201332.62), with no statistical significance (p\u202f=\u202f0.14) compared to that without (31.39; SD: \u00b11.31; range: 26.14\u201348.72).The use of Anatom-e decreased the Inter-OV in the CTV delineation process for locally advanced rectal cancer with complex disease presentation planned for neoadjuvant RT. This system may be potentially helpful in increasing the compliance to follow shared guidelines and protocols.",

Trans-CHHiP aims to identify biomarkers of fraction sensitivity.We outline the process of tissue collection, including central review by a study-specific specialist uropathologist and comparison of the centrally-assigned Gleason grade group with that assigned by the recruiting-centre pathologist.2047 patients provided tissue from 107 pathology departments between August 2012 and April 2014. A highly motivated Clinical Trials Unit chasing samples and a central Trans-CHHiP group that regularly reviewed progress were important for successful sample collection. Agreement in Gleason grade group assigned by the recruiting centre pathologist and the central study-specific uropathologist occurred in 886 out of 1854 (47.8%) cases. Key lessons learned were the need for prospective consent for tissue collection when recruiting patients to the main trial, and the importance of Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) integration into the initial trial site agreement.This methodology enabled collection of 2047 patient samples from a large randomised radiotherapy trial. Central pathological review is important to minimise subjectivity in Gleason grade grouping and the impact of grade shift.",

Synthetic peptide has various advantages in its clinical application.Colon26 adenocarcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously in the right and left flanks of mice. eMIP, CCL3 or any of synthesized peptides was administered intravenously, either after irradiating the right flank. The effect was evaluated by tumor-growth inhibition.Q/C peptide, a synthetic peptide of amino acids 22\u201351 of eMIP has no chemotaxis-inducing ability but yet enhanced tumor growth inhibition at the non-irradiated sites, recapitulating the effect of eMIP with local irradiation. Co-administration of this peptide and HSP70 also inhibited tumor growth.Q/C peptide maps to the eMIP \u03b2-sheet: 3 adjacent anti-parallel strands connected by the \u03b2-hairpins, is the active portion of eMIP necessary for an immunomodulatory antitumor effect. This experimental reduction furthers our understanding of the underlying mechanism of the abscopal effect. The data will open the way for therapeutic application of like peptides.",

One reason for geographical miss is a change of tumor related atelectasis in the course of radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with UICC Stage IIIb NSCLC who presented with a large tumor related atelectasis. During definitive radiochemotherapy, the atelectasis resolved, which resulted in a massive tumor shift out of the planning target volume within 2\u202fdays. Without close monitoring by cone beam CTs and prompt replanning, this would have led to a geographical miss and relevant underdosage of the tumor. Furthermore, changes in anatomy and pulmonary function during treatment had implications for organs at risk and opened windows for dose escalation.We suggest at least biweekly CBCTs in patients with poststenotic atelectasis to ensure the rapid detection of geographical changes of the target and subsequent intervention if necessary.",

     "abstract": "In the last years, limited studies have described that radiotherapy could produce important distant responses in unirradiated sites, the so-called \u201cabscopal effect\u201d. Recent evidence suggests that radiotherapy induces antigen release from tumor, in this way activating the immune system. However, radiotherapy alone is rarely enough to induce the systemic response requested for control of the metastases. With the advent of immunotherapy, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have demonstrated impressive efficacy in various metastatic cancers. Currently, preclinical and clinical studies have reported a significant increase of abscopal responses in patients treated with the combination of radiotherapy and ICI. The purpose of this review was summarizing the clinical studies combining radiotherapy and ipilimumab (ipi), particularly focusing on abscopal responses.Databases of Medline (via Pubmed) from 2009 to June 2, 2017 were reviewed to obtain English language studies reporting clinical abscopal effect in the combination of radiotherapy with exclusive ipi in metastatic melanoma cancers. Included studies reported the abscopal effect as a primary endpoint, and as secondary endpoint included overall survival and toxicity.A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 451 patients, and in 5/16 studies the patients were treated on research protocols and followed-up prospectively. The median reported abscopal effect and OS were 26.5% and 19 months, respectively. The median toxicity \u2265 Grade 3 was 18.3% ranged from 10% to 20%.Early clinical outcomes reports suggest that the combination of ipilimumab and RT may improve survival in metastatic melanoma patients. The abscopal responses become a clinically relevant effect of such combination and should be studied in controlled randomized trials.",

The 3-year and 5-year LRFS were 71% and 64% in the RT group vs. 66% and 50% in the surgery group, respectively (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24\u20131.45; p\u202f=\u202f0.24). Up to 34% had acute grade 3 toxicity and 11% had grade 4 osteoradionecrosis of the jaw.Longer follow-up still does not show a significant difference in OS and LRFS between both treatments. Because most patients submitted to surgery required adjuvant RT and since its side-effects were not negligible, further studies are warranted to better suit the first treatment for each patient and to prevent the need for adjuvant treatment and the risk of toxicity.",

However, mode of cell killing induced by protons is less understood in comparison with X-rays. The purpose of this study is to see if there is any difference in the mode of cell-killing, induced by protons and X-rays in an ex vivo human peripheral blood lymphocyte (HPBL) model.HPBL were irradiated with 60\u202fMeV proton beam or 250-kVp X-rays in the dose range of 0.3\u20134.0\u202fGy. Frequency of apoptotic and necrotic cells was determined by the Fluorescein (FITC)-Annexin V labelling procedure, 1 and 4\u202fh after irradiation. Chip-based DNA Ladder Assay was used to confirm radiation-induced apoptosis and necrosis. Chip-based DNA Ladder Assay was used to confirm radiation-induced apoptosis.Ex vivo irradiation of HPBL with proton beams of 60\u202fMeV or 250\u202fkVp X-rays resulted in apoptotic as well as necrotic modes of cell-killing, which were evident at both 1 and 4\u202fh after irradiation in the whole dose and time range. Generally, our results indicated that protons cause relatively higher yields of cell death that appears to be necrosis compared to X-rays. The analysis also demonstrates that radiation type and dose play a critical role in mode of cell-killing.Obtained results suggest that X-rays and protons induce cell-killing by different modes. Such differences in cell-killing modes may have implications on the potential of a given therapeutic modality to cause immune modulation via programmed cell death (X-rays) or necrotic cell death (proton therapy). These studies point towards exploring for gene expression biomarkers related necrosis or apoptosis to predict immune response after proton therapy.",

The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI\u2019s) in the context of recurrent/metastatic (R/M) setting anticipates the possible integration of immunotherapy into the therapeutic armamentarium of locally advanced disease. Durvalumab (DUR) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1, anti-PD-L1 antibody with promising data in R/M HNSCC. The aim of our study is to test the antitumor activity of a combined regimen incorporating an immune checkpoint inhibitor into a conventional bio-radiation strategy for the cure of unfavorable locally advanced HNSCC.In this open label, multi-center, single-arm, phase I/II study, enrolled patients will receive Radiotherapy (RT) (69.9\u202fGy/2.12\u202fGy in 33 fractions) with concurrent Cetuximab (CTX) (400\u202fmg/m2 1\u202fweek before RT start followed by 250\u202fmg/m2 weekly) and DUR (fixed dose of 1500\u202fmg every 4\u202fweeks starting from RT-CTX week 1) followed by adjuvant DUR (to a maximum of 6\u202fmonths after completion of RT-CTX). Primary endpoint of the study is 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). A safety run-in is planned after the enrollment of first 12, 24 and 36 patients. Patients affected by high-risk (\u2265N2a or\u202f\u2265T3, any N) larynx, hypopharynx and HPV negative oropharynx or HPV-positive oropharynx (\u2265T2, \u2265N2b, \u226510\u202fpack/years) will be eligible.Conventional intensification strategies failed to provide any benefit for the cure of locally advanced HNSCC. For the still prevalent HPV-negative population and the high risk-HPV positive disease, there is an unmet need for alternative treatment paradigms. Potentially, the inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint may synergize with both CTX and RT through immunologic interplay, ultimately aiming to reverse the HNSCC-induced immune suppression. The DUCRO study will seek to demonstrate if such a strategy may be safe and active.NCT number: NCT03051906Eudract number: 2016-004668-20",

Since then, IGABT has been spreading, particularly in Europe, North America and Asia, and the guidelines have proved their broad acceptance and applicability in clinical practice. However, a unified approach to volume contouring and reporting does not imply a unified administration of treatment, and currently both external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and IGABT are delivered using a large variety of techniques and prescription/fractionation schedules.With IGABT, local control is excellent in limited and well-responding tumours. The major challenges are currently loco-regional control in advanced tumours, treatment-related morbidity, and distant metastatic disease. Emerging evidence from the RetroEMBRACE and EMBRACE I studies has demonstrated that clinical outcome is related to dose prescription and technique. The next logical step is to demonstrate excellent clinical outcome with the most advanced EBRT and brachytherapy techniques based on an evidence-based prospective dose and volume prescription protocol.The EMBRACE II study is an interventional and observational multicentre study which aims to benchmark a high level of local, nodal and systemic control while limiting morbidity, using state of the art treatment including an advanced target volume selection and contouring protocol for EBRT and brachytherapy, a multi-parametric brachytherapy dose prescription protocol (clinical validation of dose constraints), and use of advanced EBRT (IMRT and IGRT) and brachytherapy (IC/IS) techniques (clinical validation).

Apart from subjective measures, such as quality of life assessment and neurocognitive function tests, objective methods to quantify tissue damage are needed to assess this impact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established method for brain tumor diagnoses as well as assessing treatment response. In this study, we retrospectively assessed volumetric changes of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in glioma patients following photon irradiation using a heterogeneous MRI-dataset obtained in routine clinical practice at different sites with imaging parameters and magnetic field strengths. We found a significant reduction in WM volume at one year ( p = 0.01 ) and two years ( p = 0.008 ) post radio(chemo)therapy whereas corresponding GM volumes did not change significantly ( p = 0.05 and p = 0.11 , respectively). More importantly, we also found large variations in the segmented tissue volumes caused by the heterogeneous MR data, thus potentially masking more subtle tissue changes over time. On the basis of these observations, we present suggestions regarding data acquisitions in future prospective MR studies to assess such volumetric changes.",

With the introduction of new treatment techniques, such as integrated magnetic resonance imaging and linear accelerators (MR-linac) or particle therapy, the prediction of clinical efficacy of these more costly treatment modalities becomes more relevant. One of the side-effects of brain irradiation, being cognitive decline, is one of the toxicities most difficult to measure and predict. In order to validly compare different treatment modalities, 1) a uniform nomenclature of the organs at risk (OARs), 2) uniform atlas-based delineation [e.g., Eekers et al.], 3) long-term follow-up data with standardized cognitive tests, 4) a large patient population, and 5) (thus derived) validated normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models are mandatory.Apart from the Gondi model, in which the role of the dose to 40% of both hippocampi (HC) proves to be significantly related to cognition in 18 patients, no similar models are available. So there is a strong need for more NTCP models, on HC, brain tissue and possible other relevant brain structures.In this review we summarize the available evidence on the role of the posterior cerebellum as a possible new organ at risk for cognition, which is deemed relevant for irradiation of brain and head and neck tumors.",

We then studied the effects of this mutation on cell growth, the response to radiation, and clonogenic survival, as well as using a cell viability assay to examine DNA damage and repair. Finally, we performed immunofluorescence for \u03b3-H2AX to examine double-strand DNA breaks and evaluated the expression of 84 key genes involved in DNA repair with a real-time PCR array.Mutant IGF-1R cells exhibited significantly blunted cell growth and viability, compared to wild-type cells, as well as reduced clonogenic survival after \u03b3-irradiation. However, mutant IGF-1R cells did not show any significant delays in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Furthermore, expression of mutant IGF-1R significantly down-regulated the mRNA levels of BRCA2, a major protein involved in homologous recombination DNA repair.These results indicate that blocking the IGF-1R-mediated signaling cascade, through the expression of a kinase-deficient IGF-1R mutant, reduces cell growth and sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation.

We aim to quantify the geometric distortion in patient images by comparing their in-treatment position MRIs with the corresponding planning CTs, using CT as the non-distorted gold standard.Twenty-one head and neck cancer patients were imaged with MRI as part of a prospective Institutional Review Board approved study. MR images were acquired with a T2 SE sequence (0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0mm voxel size) in the same immobilization position as in the CTs. MRI to CT rigid registration was then done and geometric distortion comparison was assessed by measuring the corresponding anatomical landmarks on both the MRI and the CT images. Several landmark measurements were obtained including; skin to skin (STS), bone to bone, and soft tissue to soft tissue at specific levels in horizontal and vertical planes of both scans. Inter-observer variability was assessed and interclass correlation (ICC) was calculated.A total of 430 landmark measurements were obtained. The median distortion for all landmarks in all scans was 1.06\u00a0mm (IQR 0.6\u20131.98). For each patient 48% of the measurements were done in the right-left direction and 52% were done in the anteroposterior direction. The measured geometric distortion was not statistically different in the right-left direction compared to the anteroposterior direction (1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 vs. 1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0mm, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.4). The magnitude of distortion was higher in the STS peripheral landmarks compared to the more central landmarks (2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 vs. 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0mm, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The mean distortion measured by observer one was not significantly different compared to observer 2, 3, and 4 (1.05, 1.23, 1.06 and 1.05\u00a0mm, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.4) with ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.84.MRI geometric distortions were quantified in radiotherapy planning applications with a clinically insignificant error of less than 2\u00a0mm compared to the gold standard CT.",

     "abstract": "An increased risk of breast cancer following radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) has now been robustly established. In order to estimate the dose\u2013response relationship more accurately, and to aid clinical decision making, a retrospective estimation of the radiation dose delivered to the site of the subsequent breast cancer is required.For 174 Dutch and 170 UK female patients with breast cancer following HL treatment, the 3-dimensional position of the breast cancer in the affected breast was determined and transferred onto a CT-based anthropomorphic phantom. Using a radiotherapy treatment planning system the dose distribution on the CT-based phantom was calculated for the 46 different radiation treatment field set-ups used in the study population. The estimated dose at the centre of the breast cancer, and a margin to reflect dose uncertainty were determined on the basis of the location of the tumour and the isodose lines from the treatment planning. We assessed inter-observer variation and for 47 patients we compared the results with a previously applied dosimetry method.The estimated median point dose at the centre of the breast cancer location was 29.75\u00a0Gy (IQR 5.8\u201337.2), or about 75% of the prescribed radiotherapy dose. The median dose uncertainty range was 5.97\u00a0Gy. We observed an excellent inter-observer variation (ICC 0.89 (95% CI: 0.74\u20130.95)). The absolute agreement intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-method variation was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.37\u20130.75), indicating (nearly) good agreement. There were no systematic differences in the dose estimates between observers or methods.Estimates of the dose at the point of a subsequent breast cancer show good correlation between methods, but the retrospective nature of the estimates means that there is always some uncertainty to be accounted for.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical results in patients with brain metastases treated with LINAC-based SRS using a thermoplastic mask (non-invasive fixation system) and Image-Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT).In this single-institution study 48 patients with 77 brain metastases were treated between February 2012 and January 2014. The prescribed dose was 20 Gy or 18 Gy as a single fraction. SRS was performed with a True Beam STX Novalis Radiosurgery LINAC (Varian Medical Systems). The verification of positioning was done using the BrainLAB ExacTrac \u00ae X-ray 6D system and cone-beam CT.In 69 of 77 treated brain metastases (90%) the follow-up was documented on MR imaging performed every 3\u202fmonths. Mean follow-up time was 10.86\u202fmonths. Estimated 1-year local control was 83%, using the Kaplan-Meier method. In 7/69 brain metastases (10%) local failure (LF) was diagnosed. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.73\u202fmonths, largely due to distant brain relapse. A GTV of \u22642.0\u202fcm3 was significantly associated with a better PFS than a GTV >2.0\u202fcm3. Extracranial stable disease and GTV \u22642.5\u202fcm\u00b3 were significant predictors of OS.We observed 2 cases of radiation necrosis diagnosed by histology after surgical resection. No other cases of severe side effects (CTACE\u202f\u2265\u202f3) were observed.LINAC-based frameless SRS with the BrainLAB Mask using the BrainLAB ExacTrac \u00ae X-ray 6D system for patient positioning is well tolerated, safe and leads to favorable crude local control of 90%.

Atlas of Complication Incidence (ACI) were generated to relate the DVH of the PRS with specific rectal symptoms; rectal bleeding and control-related symptoms (LENT/SOM).

     "abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition disorder characterized by germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene. In response to DNA damage, p53 stimulates protective cellular processes including cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis to prevent aberrant cell proliferation. Current cancer therapies involve agents that damage DNA, which also affect non-cancerous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here, we report on a child with LFS who developed genomic instability during craniospinal irradiation for metastatic choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC).This previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with parieto-temporal brain tumor, diagnosed as CPC grade-3. Screening for cancer-predisposing syndrome revealed heterozygous p53 germline mutation, leading to LFS diagnosis. After tumour resection and systemic chemotherapy, entire craniospinal axis was irradiated due to leptomeningeal seeding, resulting in disease stabilization for nearly 12\u202fmonths. Blood lymphocytes of LFS patient (p53-deficient) and age-matched tumor-children (p53-proficient) were collected before, during and after craniospinal irradiation and compared with asymptomatic carriers for identical p53 mutation, not exposed to DNA-damaging treatment. In p53-deficient lymphocytes of LFS patient radiation-induced DNA damage failed to induce cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Although DNA repair capacity was not impaired, p53-deficient blood lymphocytes of LFS patient showed significant accumulation of 53BP1-foci during and even several months after irradiation, reflecting persistent DNA damage. Electron microscopy revealed DNA abnormalities ranging from simple unrepaired lesions to chromosomal abnormalities. Metaphase spreads of p53-deficient lymphocytes explored by mFISH revealed high amounts of complex chromosomal aberrations after craniospinal irradiation.Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in maintaining genomic stability by promoting cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that a patient with LFS receiving craniospinal irradiation including large volumes of bone marrow developed progressive genomic instability of the hematopoietic system. During DNA-damaging radiotherapy, genome-stabilizing mechanisms in proliferating stem/progenitor cells are perturbed by p53 deficiency, increasing the risk of cancer initiation and progression.",

Although FGF1 is a potential radioprotector, the influence of FGF1 on the malignancy of angiosarcoma remains unknown.Highly stable FGF1 mutants, which exhibit stronger mitogenic activity than wild-type FGF1, were examined as strong radioprotectors and signaling agonists to clarify the effects of FGF1 on the murine angiosarcoma cell line ISOS-1.FGF1 mutants reduced colony formation by and the in vitro invasion and migration of ISOS-1 cells, in addition to an increase in radiosensitivity to X-rays. In contrast, an FGFR inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effects of FGF1 mutants on colony formation, invasion, and migration. siRNA targeting the Fgfr1 gene showed that strong FGFR1 signaling reduced colony formation by ISOS-1 cells. However, the FGF1 mutant reduced the activation of VEGFRs and EGFRs in ISOS-1 cells more strongly than wild-type FGF1. Moreover, the inhibition of VEGFRs and EGFRs synergistically reduced colony formation by and invasion and migration of ISOS-1 cells.These results suggest that strong FGF1 signaling exerts not only radioprotective effects, but also inhibitory effects on proliferative and metastatic capacities of angiosarcoma through the dual inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR pathways.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between hypoxia or IFP and circulating neutrophil levels, and their combined effect on survival following RT.A total of 287 FIGO stage IB to IIIB cervical cancer patients treated with RT or RT and cisplatin (RTCT) were included. Tumor hypoxia and IFP were measured at baseline prior to treatment. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was measured at baseline and weekly during treatment. Median follow up was 7.1\u00a0years.High nadir ANC at the point of maximal myelosuppression was a stronger predictor of inferior survival than high baseline ANC after adjusting for clinical prognostic factors and treatment (RT vs. RTCT). The predictive effect of nadir ANC was most evident in patients with well-oxygenated tumors or tumors with high IFP at diagnosis.This study provides new information about the combined influence of the tumor microenvironment and myeloid cells on the survival of cervical cancer patients treated with RT/RTCT to motivate the development of new treatments based on molecular targeting of immune\u2013based radioresistance pathways.",

Cells were seeded in parallel for colony formation assay (CFA) and stained for \u03b3H2AX foci or processed for western blot analysis.Hypoxia during irradiation led to increased cellular survival and reduced amount of residual \u03b3H2AX foci in all the cell lines with similar oxygen enhancement ratios (OER SKX: 2.31, FaDu: 2.44, UT-SCC5: 2.32), while post-irradiation hypoxia did not alter CFA nor residual \u03b3H2AX foci. Interestingly, prolonged exposure to hypoxia prior to irradiation resulted in differential outcome, assessed as Hypoxia modifying factor (HMF) namely radiosensitization (SKX HMF: 0.76), radioresistance (FaDu HMF: 1.54) and no effect (UT SCC-5 HMF: 1.1). Notably, radiosensitization was observed in the ATM-deficient SKX cell line while UT SCC-5 and to a lesser extent also FaDu cells showed radiation- and hypoxia-induced upregulation of ATM phosphorylation. Across all the cell lines Rad51 was downregulated whereas phosphor-DNA-PKcs was enhanced under hypoxia for FaDu and UTSCC-5 and was delayed in the SKX cell line.We herein report a key role of ATM in the cellular fitness of cells exposed to prolonged moderate hypoxia prior to irradiation. While DNA damage response post-irradiation seem to be mainly driven by non-homologous end joining repair pathway in these conditions, our data suggest an important role for ATM kinase in hypoxia-driven modification of radiation response.",

Therefore, new biomarkers are needed to further define subgroups for individualised therapeutic approaches. Preclinical and first clinical observations showed that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1 (CXCL12) play an important role in tumour cell proliferation, survival, cancer progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. However, the data on the prognostic value of SDF-1/CXCR4 expression for HNSCC are conflicting. The aim of our hypothesis-generating study was to retrospectively explore the prognostic potential of SDF-1/CXCR4 in a well-defined cohort of HNSCC patients collected within the multicenter biomarker study of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG).Patients with stage III and IVA HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx were treated with resection and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with \u226560\u00a0Gy and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). Tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) from a total of 221 patients were generated from surgical specimens, 201 evaluated for the SDF-1 and CXCR4 expression by immunofluorescence and correlated with clinico-pathological and outcome data.In univariate and multivariate analyses intracellular SDF-1 expression was associated with lower loco-regional control (LRC) in the entire patient group as well as in the HPV16 DNA negative subgroup. CXCR4 expression showed a trend for lower LRC in the univariate analysis which was not confirmed in the multivariate analysis. Neither for SDF-1 nor CXCR4 expression associations with distant metastasis free or overall survival were found.Our exploratory data support the hypothesis that overexpression of intracellular SDF-1 is an independent negative prognostic biomarker for LRC after postoperative RT-CT in high-risk HNSCC. Prospective validation is warranted and further exploration of SDF-1/CXCR4 as a potential therapeutic target to overcome treatment resistance in HNSCC appears promising.",

Medical comorbidities and Charlson scores were determined by individual chart review. Patients were stratified into 3 groups based on the CCI score (0\u20131, 2\u20133, 4\u20139) and again based on the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity score (aCCI). Cumulative survival for each stratum was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Non-significant and confounding variables were identified and discounted from survival modeling. 3 sex stratified Cox regression models were tested: (1) aCCI with age and comorbidity combined; (2) age and CCI; (3) age alone, comorbidity removed.The median survival was 4.4\u00a0years and the median follow up 4.7\u00a0years. The median CCI and aCCI scores were 2 and 5 respectively. Patients with aCCI 7\u201312 had an increased hazard of death on univariate analysis HR 2.45 (1.15\u20135.22 95%CI, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and -excluding age as a competing variable- on multivariate analysis HR 2.25 (1.04\u20134.84 95%CI, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

For personalized radiation oncology, datasets representing the variation in the entire cancer patient population need to be acquired and used to learn prediction models. Ethical and legal boundaries to ensure data privacy hamper collaboration between research institutes. We hypothesize that data sharing is possible without identifiable patient data leaving the radiation clinics and that building machine learning applications on distributed datasets is feasible.We developed and implemented an IT infrastructure in five radiation clinics across three countries (Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands). We present here a proof-of-principle for future \u2018big data\u2019 infrastructures and distributed learning studies. Lung cancer patient data was collected in all five locations and stored in local databases. Exemplary support vector machine (SVM) models were learned using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) from the distributed databases to predict post-radiotherapy dyspnea grade \u2a7e 2 . The discriminative performance was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) in a five-fold cross-validation (learning on four sites and validating on the fifth). The performance of the distributed learning algorithm was compared to centralized learning where datasets of all institutes are jointly analyzed.The euroCAT infrastructure has been successfully implemented in five radiation clinics across three countries. SVM models can be learned on data distributed over all five clinics. Furthermore, the infrastructure provides a general framework to execute learning algorithms on distributed data. The ongoing expansion of the euroCAT network will facilitate machine learning in radiation oncology. The resulting access to larger datasets with sufficient variation will pave the way for generalizable prediction models and personalized medicine.",

In the intermediate range of dose the survival relation for the population, as a whole, is not linear quadratic. Consequently, the value of the alpha beta ratio and the associated biologically effective dose calculation are different for the low and high dose range for most malignant tumors.Normal tissue cell populations responsible for organ function also have heterogeneous radio sensitivity, though to less degree than most malignant tumors. Consequently, the alpha beta ratio and associated biologically effective dose calculation related to the development of some acute early and chronic late developing radiation injuries are not the same in the low and high dose range.Variance of the distribution of \u03b1 of a heterogeneous cell population lowers the effective value of the quadratic survival constant \u03b2 of the population, as a whole, and increases the \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio in the low dose range. Heterogeneous appearance of tumor cells (pleomorphism) and necrosis on biopsy or imaging studies reflect heterogeneity of the radio sensitivity of the cells. Greater heterogeneity implies a tendency to higher \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio.

Biologically effective dose (BED) was calculated for each patient, and greater than the median dose delivered (75 Gray (Gy)) was evaluated as a potential prognostic factor. Survival was compared and independent prognostic variables were evaluated by a Cox proportional hazards regression model.Twenty-six patients (76.5%) exhibited a radiographic response to RT, and 10 patients (29.4%) ultimately developed local failure. Local control, liver control, distant control and OS at one year were 57.1%, 36.4%, 55.2% and 57.4%, respectively. Patients who received a BED >75\u00a0Gy had a significantly better local control at 1\u00a0year (93.3% vs 45.6%; Log Rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.0184). Patients who received a BED >75\u00a0Gy also had significantly better median survival (24.7mo vs 6.1mo) and 1-year overall survival (76.5% vs 30.0%) when compared with BED \u226475\u00a0Gy (Log-Rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).Our data suggest that RT should be considered for well-selected patients with HCC and PVTT for the purpose of improving local control and potentially prolonging the time to worsening venous obstruction and liver failure. When feasible, dose-escalation should be considered with a target BED of >75\u00a0Gy if normal organ dose constraints can be safely met.",

All cases of bilateral BC were excluded. All patients who experienced loco regional recurrence have been studied. Mapping patterns of regional recurrences was also performed and compared with the ESTRO and RTOG Guidelines of volume definition and delineation guidelines.Among the 796 women included, 10.1% were triple-negative (TN) and 18.8% were HER2-positive and 24.6% of them had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT).

In 14 cases the locoregional recurrences were diagnosed at the same time as the metastatic disease whereas 4 patients presented distant metastases secondarily. Local (Chest wall) recurrences occurred in 13 cases (56%) with the coverage by the isodose of 47.5\u00a0Gy (isodose 95%). Fifteen regional recurrences (lymph nodes) were observed in 13 patients. Only 3 regional recurrences occurred within irradiated volumes and 12 regional recurrences occurred outside irradiated areas.In presented series, the local recurrences were related mostly to the tumor biological aggressivity and radio resistance. Small number was caused by geographical miss. Further follow-up and careful registration of the recurrences is needed to improve their understanding.",

Recently, additional hematologic parameters have emerged as potential indicators of worse outcome in this patient group. In a cohort of cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and brachytherapy, we report on the prognostic significance of hematologic parameters including anemia, leukocytosis, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and thrombocytosis, the effect of combining anemia with other hematologic parameters, and the effect of changes in hemoglobin levels during treatment.Two-hundred fifty-seven cervical cancer patients were retrospectively identified from a single cancer institution\u2019s database. Hematologic parameters were categorized as: anemia (hemoglobin \u2264115\u00a0g/L), leukocytosis (white blood cell count >10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L), thrombocytosis (platelets >400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L), and NLR (ratio >5). The association between clinical factors and hematologic parameters on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed at 5\u00a0years.At 5\u00a0years, both pre-treatment anemia (PFS: 60% vs 34%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; OS: 68% vs 41%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and on-treatment anemia (PFS: 62% vs 40%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; OS: 70% vs 48%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) were significantly associated with worse survival.

A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (\u0394SUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated.From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT\u00a0+\u00a0erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT\u00a0+\u00a0erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No differences in \u0394SUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C\u2013C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT\u00a0+\u00a0erlotinib.Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone.

Advances in medical imaging facilitate more precise localization of the gross tumor volume, alongside a more detailed understanding of the geometric uncertainties associated with treatment delivery that has enabled robust safety margins to be customized to the specific treatment scenario at hand. By contrast, the clinical target volume, meant to encompass gross tumor, as well as, adjacent sub-clinical disease, has evolved very little. It is more often defined by clinician experience and institutional convention than on a patient-specific basis. This disparity arises from the inherent invisibility of sub-clinical disease in current medical imaging. Its incidence and expanse can only be ascertained via indirect means.

All women received adjuvant CT for BC. Self-reported nausea and vomiting was recorded in a structured diary over ten days following treatment. Blood samples were collected before the treatment and used for the detection of 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 43 genes.

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy has a high curative potential in localized prostate cancer, however, there are still patients with locally advanced tumours who face a considerable risk of recurrence. Radiosensitization using molecular targeted drugs could help to optimize treatment for this high-risk group. The PI3K/Akt pathway is overexpressed in many prostate cancers and is correlated to radioresistance. Nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor (HPI), was found to block this pathway and to radiosensitize cancer cells of different origin. This is the first study examining the effect of nelfinavir in combination with irradiation on prostate cancer cell survival in vitro as well as on growth time and local tumour control in vivo.The in vitro effect of nelfinavir on radioresponse of PC-3 was tested by colony formation assay with 10\u00a0\u03bcM nelfinavir. In vivo, the effect of nelfinavir alone and in combination with irradiation was tested in nude mice carrying PC-3 xenografts. For evaluating tumour growth time, mice were treated with 80\u00a0mg nelfinavir/kg body weight, daily at 5\u00a0days per week over 6\u00a0weeks. Simultaneous irradiation with 30 fractions and total doses between 30 and 120\u00a0Gy was applied to calculate local tumour control for day 180 after treatment.Nelfinavir inhibited Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and showed a minor but significant effect on clonogenic cell survival in vitro with slightly higher cell survival rates after combined treatment. The treatment of PC-3 xenografts with nelfinavir alone led to no significant increase of tumour growth time and no improvement of local tumour control.Despite promising growth delay effects of nelfinavir in other tumour models and first clinical applications of this drug as anti-cancer agent, PC-3 prostate cancer cells express no or only minor sensitivity to nelfinavir treatment alone and no radiosensitizing effect in vitro or in vivo.",

The toxicity of the current combination of intensified dose per fraction radiotherapy and platinum based chemotherapy limits further uniform intensification. If a predictive biomarker for outcomes from CRT can be identified during treatment then individualised and adaptive treatment strategies may be employed.The MeRInO study is a prospective observational imaging study of patients with intermediate and high risk, locally advanced OPSCC receiving radical RT or concurrent CRT Patients undergo diffusion weighted MRI prior to treatment (MRI_1) and during the third week of RT (MRI_2). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements will be made on each scan for previously specified target lesions (primary and lymph nodes) and change in ADC calculated. Patients will be followed up and disease status for each target lesion noted. The primary aim of the MeRInO study is to determine the threshold change in ADC from baseline to week 3 of RT that may identify the sub-group of non-responders during treatment.The use of DW-MRI as a predictive biomarker during RT for SCC H&N is in its infancy but studies to date have found that response to treatment may indeed be predicted by comparison of DW-MRI carried out before and during treatment. However, previous studies have included all sub-sites and biological sub-types. Establishing ADC thresholds that predict for local failure is an essential step towards using DW-MRI to improve the therapeutic ratio in treating SCC H&N. This would be done most robustly in a specific H&N sub-site and in sub-types with similar biological behaviour. The MeRInO study will help establish these thresholds in OPSCC.",

We evaluated the occurrence of a tumor shift between the diagnostic MRI and radiotherapy planning MRI. For 42 brain metastases the tumor and peritumoral edema were delineated on the contrast enhanced T1weighted and FLAIR images of both the diagnostic MRI and planning MRI examinations. Centre of Mass (CoM) shifts and tumor borders were evaluated. We evaluated the influence of steroids on peritumoral edema and tumor volume and the correlation with CoM and tumor border changes.The median values of the CoM shifts and of the maximum distances between the tumor borders obtained from the diagnostic MRI and radiotherapy planning MRI were 1.3\u00a0mm (maximum shift of 5.0\u00a0mm) and 1.9\u00a0mm (maximum distance of 7.4\u00a0mm), respectively. We found significant correlations between the absolute change in edema volume and the tumor shift of the CoM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and tumor border (p\u00a0=\u00a00.040). Patients who received steroids did not only had a decrease in peritumoral edema, but also had a median decrease in tumor volume of 0.02\u00a0cc while patients who did not receive steroids had a median increase of 0.06\u00a0cc in tumor volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035).Our results show that large tumor shifts of brain metastases can occur over time.

For each biomarker, treatment response and survival was compared between low and high-staining groups by logrank testing and multivariate analyses.High Glut-1 expression was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS), (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and overall survival (OS), (HR 5.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) on multifactor analysis adjusting for stage, node positivity, tumour volume and uterine corpus invasion. High Glut-1 correlated with increased risk of distant failure (HR 14.6, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) but not local failure. Low Glut-1 was associated with higher complete metabolic response rate on post-therapy positron emission tomography scan (odds ratio 3.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). Ki-67 was significantly associated with PFS only (HR 1.19 per 10 units increase, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Biomarkers for hypoxia were not associated with outcome.High Glut-1 in LACC is associated with poor outcome post CRT. If prospectively validated, Glut-1 may help select patients for more intensive treatment regimens.",

Chemotherapy was given before, during and after radiotherapy.None of the patients had intracranial recurrence. One patient experienced severe, but transient encephalitis-like symptoms that could only be attributed to radiotherapy. No long term side effects in the CNS were observed.The treatment was feasible, but with possible severe, but transient side effects. It should be considered in cases with head and neck cancer, with a high risk of intracerebral metastasis, as well as a significant overlap between the primary irradiated volume and the brain.",

Their ability to control radiobiologically-relevant cellular processes strengthens their potential as novel markers of response to radiation therapy.To identify miRNAs associated with increased clonogenic survival following radiation exposure.The miRNA expression profiles of a panel of 22RV1 cells with varying levels of radiosensitivities (hypoxic H-22Rv1 cells, RR-22Rv1 cells derived from WT-22Rv1 cells through 2-Gy fractionated repeated exposure, the associated aged matched cells (AMC-22Rv1) and the WT-22Rv1 cell lines) were generated and cross-analysed to identify common miRNAs associated with a radioresistant phenotype.Increased clonogenic survival following irradiation was associated with significant modifications in miRNA expression pattern. miR-221 (up) and miR-4284 (down) in RR-22Rv1 and MiR-31 and miR-200c in AMC-22Rv1 were the most uniquely significantly deregulated miRNAs when compared to WT-22Rv1 cells. miR-200c ranked as the most downregulated miRNAs in hypoxic, when compared to RR-22Rv1 cells. miR-200a was the only differentially expressed miRNA between RR-22Rv1 and AMC-22Rv1 cells. miR-210 yielded the highest fold change in expression in H-22Rv1, when compared to WT-22RV1 cells.This study identifies candidate miRNAs for the development of novel prognostic biomarkers for radiotherapy prostate cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "The SCF/c-Kit pathway is often overexpressed in human tumors leading to an enhanced tumorigenesis, proliferation and migration. It was now tested for NSCLC and prostate cancer cells growing in 2D and 3D whether the inhibition of this pathway can be used to achieve a significant radiosensitization and whether a respective biomarker may be identified.Experiments were performed with different cancer cell lines (NSCLC: H23, H520, H226, H1975 and PrCa: DU145) growing either under 2D or 3D conditions. Expression of SCF and c-Kit was determined by RT-PCR and Western blot, SCF was knocked down by siRNA, c-Kit was inhibited by ISCK03 inhibitor and cell survival was determined by colony formation assay.There is a profound variation in the expression of both c-Kit and SCF with no association between each other. Neither levels did correlate with the respective cellular radiosensitivity determined for 2D or 3D with only a trend seen for SCF. Knock-down of SCF was generally found to result in no or only minor reduction of plating efficiency or cellular radioresistance. A significant reduction was only obtained for H520 cells characterized by an extreme over-expression of SCF. The inhibition of c-Kit by a specific inhibitor was also found to result only in minor radiosensitization.Generally, the SCF/c-Kit pathway does not have a dominant effect on both, cell survival and radioresponse and, as a consequence, knockdown of this pathway does not result in a strong effect on radioresistance, except when SCF is strongly over-expressed.",

GTV was defined separately on PET/CT (GTV-PET) and CT (GTV-CT) datasets. A corresponding PTV was generated for each patient. Volumetric and spatial analysis quantified the proportion of FDG-avid disease not included in CT-based volumes. Clinical data was collected to determine locoregional control and overall survival rates.13 (24.1%) of 57 accrued patients had metastatic disease detected on PET. Median follow up was 4\u00a0years. FDG-avid disease would have been excluded from GTV-CT in 29 of 38 patients (76%). In 5 patients, FDG-avid disease would have been completely excluded from the PTV-CT. GTV-CT underestimated the cranial and caudal extent of FDG-avid tumour in 14 (36%) and 10 (26%) patients. 4-Year overall survival and locoregional failure free survival were 37% and 65%.PET/CT altered the delineation of tumour volumes when compared to CT alone, and should be considered standard for treatment planning. Although clinical outcomes were not improved with PET/CT planning, it did allow the use of smaller radiotherapy volumes.",

The plan quality is inter-planner dependent since it is dependent on the skills and experience of the dosimetrist. This study presents a blinded prospective clinical comparison of automatic (AU) and manually (MA) generated H&N VMAT plans made for clinical use.MA and AU plans were generated for 30 consecutive patients in Pinnacle3 using the IMRT optimisation module and the new Autoplan module, respectively. The plan quality was blindedly compared by three senior oncologists and the best plan was selected for treatment of the patient. Planning time was measured as the active operator time used. The plan quality was analysed with DVH metrics and the dose delivery accuracy validated on the ArcCheck phantom.For twenty-nine out of the thirty patients the AU plan was chosen for treatment. Target doses were more homogenous with the AU plans and the OAR doses were significantly reduced, between 0.5 and 6.5\u00a0Gy. The average operator time spent on creating a manual plan was 64\u00a0min which was halved by Autoplan. The AU plans were more modulated as illustrated by an increase in MUs, which might cause the slightly lower pass rate of 97.7% in the ArcCheck measurements.Target doses were similar between MA and AU plan, while AU plans spared all OAR considerably better than the MA plans.",

The results of the exploration cohort have previously been reported by the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG; Lohaus et al., 2014; Linge et al., 2016).For 152 patients with locally advanced HNSCC the impact of HPV16 DNA status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Out of them, 40 patients received postoperative radiochemotherapy. Cox models presented in a previous study were validated using the concordance index as a performance measure. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control. Results were compared to those previously reported by DKTK-ROG.Loco-regional control, freedom from distant metastases and overall survival were inferior to the previously reported cohort. Despite of this, the prognostic value of the combination of HPV infection status, CSC marker expression (SLC3A2) and tumour hypoxia status could be validated in univariate analyses using an independent validation cohort. For multivariate models, the concordance index was between 0.58 and 0.69 in validation, indicating a good prognostic performance of the models. The inclusion of CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia signature moderately improved the performance compared to a baseline model without CSC markers or hypoxia classifiers.The HPV status, CSC marker expression of CD44 and SLC3A2 as well as hypoxia status are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by postoperative radiotherapy.",

Survival, loco-regional or distant failure and upstaging were analyzed according to the waiting time.Mean waiting time for treatment was 62.5\u00a0days for the hypopharynx subgroup (range\u00a0=\u00a037\u2013102), 63\u00a0days for the larynx subgroup (range\u00a0=\u00a019\u2013128) and 58.5\u00a0days for the oropharynx subgroup (range\u00a0=\u00a029\u201399) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.725). Nine patients (14%) experienced upstaging. Loco-regional or distant failure occurred in 18 patients.
