     "abstract": "Activating mutations of the tyrosine kinase receptor KIT have been described in both mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), but are usually found in separate domains and often respond differently to signal transduction inhibitors. We describe here a large family with both GIST, mastocytosis, and achalasia. Affected family members have a unique activating mutation in exon 9 of KIT which show promise to a novel signal transduction inhibitor.Clinical data was collected from 15 family members, 7 of whom were variably affected with GIST, achalasia and mastocytosis. DNA was prepared from WBC of 12 subjects (6 affected and 6 unaffected) and exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of KIT were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced.A unique activating single base pair mutation in the extracellular domain of KIT was found in all 6 affected subjects resulting in a K>I amino acid change at codon 509.In the family reported here, a unique mutation in the extracellular domain leads to receptor activation resulting in GIST and mastocytosis as well as achalasia. Initial data suggests that this activation can be suppressed by signal transduction inhibitors and these patients may benefit from such therapy.",

Although the survival rate in children is much higher than adults, but there's a need to find new potential molecular targets with better treatment outcome. Genomic profiling has made it possible to identify various genetic defects important for driving leukemogenesis. Study of the genetic lesions not only give a better understanding of genes function but also helps to target various signaling pathways involved in disease progression. The current review provides an overview of important genetic defects and dysregulation in their downstream signaling pathways in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "MECOM rearrangement is associated with rapid disease progression and poor prognosis in myeloid neoplasms. Previous studies were often based on 3q26.2 abnormalities without confirmation of MECOM status. The frequency of MECOM rearrangement and attribution of various chromosomal aberrations remain poorly characterized. This study presented 129 cases with confirmed MECOM rearrangement by karyotyping and multiple FISH methodologies. MECOM rearrangement arose through translocation (49.6%, n\u202f=\u202f64), inversion (40.3%, n\u202f=\u202f52), insertion (5.4%, n\u202f=\u202f7) or unknown mechanism(s) (4.7%, n\u202f=\u202f6). The classic inv(3)(q21q26.2) was dominant (n\u202f=\u202f50) in inversion-driven MECOM rearrangement; and 3 of them also had double inv(3). For translocation-driven MECOM rearrangement, t(3;21) was most common (n\u202f=\u202f15), followed by t(2;3) (n\u202f=\u202f13), t(3;12) (n\u202f=\u202f10), t(3;3) (n\u202f=\u202f9), t(3;8) (n\u202f=\u202f6), t(3;6) and t(3;17) (n\u202f=\u202f4 each), t(1;3) and t(3;?) (n\u202f=\u202f1 each). Cases with t(3;3)-, t(3;12)-, and insertion-driven MECOM rearrangement were prone to exhibit a complex karyotype, while cases with t(2;3)-, t(3;21)- and insertion-driven MECOM rearrangement were prone to have an \u201cunbalanced\u201d MECOM FISH signal pattern, likely caused by uncommon breakpoint(s) within the target of 5\u2019MECOM probe. Therefore, atypical chromosomal aberrations and/or mechanisms are involved in MECOM rearrangement. Confirmation/exclusion of MECOM rearrangement is necessary in all cases with a 3q26.2 abnormality.

We retrospectively evaluated results from 183 solid tumor samples that were received during a 24 month period for testing using the FusionSeq\u2122 assay, an RNA-based Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel of 53 genes known to form fusions in solid tumors. Positive yield rate (actionable fusions) was evaluated for all samples tested, as a correlate for clinical utility. Twenty five fusions (actionable, variants of uncertain significance \u2013 VUS, and benign) were identified, of which 7 were classified as actionable gene fusions, resulting in an overall positive yield rate of \u223c3.8% (7/183). Sixteen mostly novel fusions were classified and reported as VUSs. Five fusion events were classified as false positives, occurring due to mispriming or wild-type read through while 2 were classified as likely benign. Additionally 68% of fusions (17 of 25) detected in our study were present in prostate, colorectal, and gynecological cancers, suggesting that the frequency of fusions identified is dependent on specific tumor type. The high number of novel fusions identified highlights the potential for fusions in precision medicine.",

This is especially detrimental in syndromes such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer due to a CDH1 germline mutation, for which lifesaving prevention is possible. Surveillance for diffuse gastric cancer in the syndrome is limited, hence the recommendation for prophylactic total gastrectomy for mutation carriers. Genetic counseling and testing is crucial in suspected families but initial contact could be limited, leading to the importance of an interval comprehensive review every 5\u20138 years to identify and screen additional high-risk individuals.Our contact with a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer family in Jordan in 2011 led to a number of family members receiving education and genetic counseling. Our model of interval comprehensive assessment (MICA) was constructed and implemented by conducting family information service, video call and emails to the high-risk individuals 7 years after initial contact. Using an updated family pedigree we reached out to an additional thirteen high-risk members in six different countries and provided them with genetic education, counseling, and testing. Six members agreed to CDH1 testing (46%). Four tested positive (66%) and one member (25%) underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of anoctamin-1 (ANO1) and miR-9 on colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and determined the underlying molecular mechanisms.Thirty-two paired CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed for ANO1 expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with miR-9 mimic, miR-9 inhibitor, or si-ANO1. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT, and flow cytometric analysis, while cell migration and invasion were assayed by trans-well migration and invasion assay in HCT116 cells. ANO1 was validated as a target of miR-9 using luciferase reporter assay and bioinformatics algorithms.We found that ANO1 expression was up-regulated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. ANO1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, and there was an inverse relationship between miR-9 and ANO1 mRNA expression in CRC specimens, but no significant difference was found between miR-9 and ANO1 expression. ANO1 is a direct target of miR-9, and overexpression of miR-9 suppressed both mRNA and protein expression of ANO1 and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCT116 cells. We also showed that overexpression of miR-9 suppressed expression of p-AKT, cyclin D1, and p-ERK in HCT116 cells.We conclude that miR-9 inhibits CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by directly targeting ANO1, and miR-9/ANO1 could be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",

These efforts, although in small number, have revealed heterogeneous molecular findings that may explain astroblastoma's unpredictable clinical outcome. Here, we report a case of recurrent astroblastoma in a 23-year-old female with a unique molecular characteristic. Our patient's tumor harbored an RNA-binding motif 10 (RBM10) truncation. RBM10 codes for a widely expressed RNA binding protein, and its mutation has been described in a variety of solid cancers. RBM10 is thought to be involved in stabilization of pro-apoptotic proteins in breast cancer, and its reduced protein expression is associated with advanced stages of lung adenocarcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of astroblastoma harboring RBM10 truncation.

Seventy melanoma cases were evaluated for BRAF V600 mutation by pyrosequencing. Overall, BRAF mutations were detected in 30% of the patients. All mutations observed were missense type (GTG\u202f>\u202fGAG) resulting in p.V600E, while none showed V600K/R mutation. The frequency of BRAF V600E mutations were more in patients with onset age of 50 years. BRAF mutations were significantly associated with tumor site wherein more mutations were seen in tumors from head and neck and extremities region. Acral and mucosal tumor subtype showed a mutation frequency of 31% and 20%, respectively. Epithelial cell morphology tends to harbor frequent BRAF V600E mutation (36%) than other morphological subtypes. Tumors with ulceration and necrosis showed increased BRAF mutation rate (32.5% and 33%) respectively. In conclusion, this is the first study to report a mutation frequency of 30% in this cohort.

Survival analysis of available TCGA data demonstrated that overall survival of patients with low (below the median) expression of untouchable mucins was better compared to patients with high expression of untouchable mucins.

Numerous studies have reported the abnormal expression of miR-708-5p in tumors of different origins. However, its role in EWS remains unclear.qRT-PCR was performed in nineteen consecutive EWS samples and twelve non-tumor bone samples from age-matched controls. Functional assays were performed in SK-ES-1 cells transfected with miR-708 lentiviral-based vectors and results analyzed in terms of clonogenicity, migration, invasion and western blot.We show that miR-708-5p is downregulated in EWS tissues though no associations with any prognostic features such as HUVOS grade, event or survival were found in our cohort. Nonetheless, expression levels of this micro-RNA were inversely associated with the presence of the EWS/FLI1 translocation. When miR-708-5p was transfected into the SK-ES-1 cell line, it did not affect migration or clonogenicity, but promoted a significant increase on the invasive potential of cells endorsed with high expression of MMP2.Taken together, our results suggest that despite downregulated in EWS samples, this miRNA might represent a secondary genetic alteration derived from the pleiotropic cellular effects of the abnormal EWS/FLI1 transcription factor that does not affect tumor growth but instead, is related with the promotion of tumor invasion, not being suitable for future therapeutic intervention.",

The double inv(3) was detected by karyotype and confirmed by FISH on both homologs in a 41 year old female and a 72 year old male with AML. In the latter case, a 2.26-fold increase in MECOM RNA level was found using an NGS myeloid gene panel. Chromosomal microarray analysis identified segmental copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) at 3q21 extending to near the q-arm terminus. This is the third report of distal 3q CN-LOH, substantiating that the double inv(3) arises through somatic repair of acquired segmental LOH. Long term clinical and genetic evaluation revealed no discernible morphologic difference between single and double inv(3) cases, conventional chemotherapy resistance and rapid dominance of the double inv(3) clone. The two new cases are consistent with relatively longer survival of double inv(3) patients in the absence of concurrent chromosome 7 loss compared to those with both abnormalities. Importantly, the first known outcome data of bone marrow transplantation in double inv(3) AML is also presented.",

Mate-pair sequencing (MPseq) was performed on cases with constitutional chromosome mimics of recurrent AML abnormalities to further define the rearrangement breakpoints.Three cases with constitutional rearrangements were identified, including t(6;9)(p23;q34), inv(16)(p13.1q22), and t(9;22)(q34.1;q12.2). Two cases were bone marrow specimens being evaluated for hematologic neoplasms, while one case was a blood specimen being evaluated for primary ovarian insufficiency. MPseq provided high-resolution and precise rearrangement breakpoints, and resolved the atypical FISH results generated with each rearrangement.Our findings illustrate that constitutional rearrangements can mimic recurrent genetic abnormalities observed in AML, and we emphasize the importance of correlating genetic data with clinical and hematopathologic information.",

Our analysis found that a variety of mRNA isoforms showed differential expression in LUAD tumor samples. Some of them even showed distinct variations compared to their host genes. Further analysis of functional enrichment revealed that up- and down-regulated mRNA isoforms took part in different types of biological process. In addition, we also identified hundreds of isoforms that expressed exclusively in LUAD tumor samples.

RAD9A is also required for proper localization of both TopBP1 and the Claspin adaptor protein during the DNA damage response. We have shown large, RAD9A-dense nuclear foci containing several members of the homologous recombination pathway as well as BRCA1 and the DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX. This RAD9A-dense body is closely associated with the inactive X in HeLa cells but not in other cell types analyzed including a Klinefelter's syndrome-derived line containing multiple Xi. We have also shown these foci disappear after cell synchronization but are enriched after treatment with the homologous recombination inhibitor pentoxifylline. We conclude these foci are the result of an active process, suspended in perturbed cells, that involves interaction between the cell cycle checkpoint and homologous recombination machinery.",

Karyotypic analysis of tumor cells is somewhat limited due to a low proliferative index coupled with a low frequency of tumor cells in clinical samples.

In this study we evaluated the karyotypes obtained in a single institution to identify recurring cytogenetic abnormalities. We constructed evolutionary pathways to differentiate abnormalities present at the beginning of evolution from those that developed later in evolution. We then estimated genetic progression scores and the clinical impact of the cytogenetic abnormalities on survival. In addition, we also evaluated the clinical significance of MYC related abnormalities (translocations and numerical changes) in disease evolution and on survival. Our results indicate that PCM with MYC related abnormalities in general have advanced tumors and adverse outcomes even with low proliferation.

Current available imaging modalities do not reveal micrometastasis and tumor biopsy is an invasive method to detect early stage or recurrent cancer, signifying the need for an inexpensive, non-invasive diagnostic modality. Cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been tried for early detection and targeted therapy of breast cancer, but its diagnostic and prognostic utility is still under investigation. This review summarizes the existing evidence on the use of ctDNA specifically in breast cancer, including detection methods, diagnostic accuracy, role in genetics and epigenetics evaluation of the tumor, and comparison with other biomarkers. Current evidence suggests that increasing levels of ctDNA in breast cancer can be of significant diagnostic value for early detection of breast cancer although the sensitivity and specificity of the methods is still suboptimal. Additionally, ctDNA allows for characterizing the tumor in a non-invasive way and monitor the response to therapy, although discordance of ctDNA results with direct biopsy (i.e. due to tumor heterogeneity) is still considered a notable limitation.",

Molecular subtypes have been defined by recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and somatic mutations that are prognostic and predictive. Karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have historically been used to guide management; however, new technologies and markers raise the need to reassess current testing algorithms.We convened a panel of representatives from international clinical laboratories to capture current state-of-the-art testing from published reports and to put forward recommendations for cytogenomic testing of plasma cell neoplasms. We reviewed 65 papers applying FISH, chromosomal microarray (CMA), next-generation sequencing, and gene expression profiling for plasma cell neoplasm diagnosis and prognosis. We also performed a survey of our peers to capture current laboratory practice employed outside our working group.Plasma cell enrichment is widely used prior to FISH testing, most commonly by magnetic bead selection. A variety of strategies for direct, short- and long-term cell culture are employed to ensure clonal representation for karyotyping. Testing of clinically-informative 1p/1q, del(13q) and del(17p) are common using karyotype, FISH and, increasingly, CMA testing. FISH for a variety of clinically-informative balanced IGH rearrangements is prevalent. Literature review found that CMA analysis can detect abnormalities in 85\u2013100% of patients with PCNs; more specifically, in 5\u201353% (median 14%) of cases otherwise normal by FISH and cytogenetics. CMA results in plasma cell neoplasms are usually complex, with alteration counts ranging from 1 to 74 (median 10\u201320), primarily affecting loci not covered by FISH testing. Emerging biomarkers include structural alterations of MYC as well as somatic mutations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and TP53. Together, these may be measured in a comprehensive manner by a combination of newer technologies including CMA and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our survey suggests most laboratories have, or are soon to have, clinical CMA platforms, with a desire to move to NGS assays in the future.We present an overview of current practices in plasma cell neoplasm testing as well as an algorithm for integrated FISH and CMA testing to guide treatment of this disease.",

This study aimed to assess diagnostic yield and clinical characteristics of pediatric and adult patients undergoing germline DES for hereditary cancer. We retrospectively reviewed 2171 patients referred for DES; cases with a personal and/or family history of cancer were further studied. Of 39 cancer patients, relevant alterations were found in eight individuals (21%), including one (3%) positive pathogenic alteration within a characterized gene, two (5%) uncertain findings in characterized genes, and five (13%) alterations in novel candidate genes. Two of the 5 pediatric patients, undergoing testing, (40%) had findings in novel candidate genes, with the remainder being negative.We include brief case studies to illustrate the variety of challenging issues related to these patients. Our observations demonstrate utility of family-based exome sequencing in patients for suspected hereditary cancer, including familial co-segregation analysis, and comprehensive medical review. DES may be particularly useful when traditional approaches do not result in a diagnosis or in families with unique phenotypes. This work also highlights the importance and complexity of analysis of uncharacterized genes in exome sequencing for hereditary cancer.",

Our observations are broadly representative of previous cytogenetic studies of UL: karyotypically abnormal tumors were detected in 30.7% of women and 17.4% of analyzed tumors. No notable association was observed between race and increased occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities that might contribute to any population-specific morbidity or prevalence rate. Our data on MED12 mutation analyses (73.2% of tumors harbored a MED12 mutation) provide additional support for a significant role of MED12 in tumorigenesis. Although the effect of MED12-mediated tumorigenesis appears significant irrespective of race, other genetic events such as the distribution of karyotypic abnormalities appear differently in black women.

SVAtools can also predict gene disruptions and gene fusions, and characterize the genomic structure of complex rearrangements.To illustrate the power of SVAtools' junction detection methods to provide comprehensive molecular karyotypes, MPseq data were compared against a set of samples previously characterized by traditional cytogenetic methods. Karyotype, FISH and chromosomal microarray (CMA), performed for 29 patients in a clinical laboratory setting, collectively revealed 285 breakpoints in 87 rearrangements. The junction detection methods of SVAtools detected 87% of these breakpoints compared to 48%, 42% and 57% for karyotype, FISH and CMA respectively. Breakpoint resolution was also reported to 1\u2009kb or less and additional genomic rearrangement complexities not appreciable by standard cytogenetic techniques were revealed. For example, 63% of CNVs detected by CMA were shown by SVAtools' junction detection to occur secondary to a rearrangement other than a simple deletion or tandem duplication. SVAtools with MPseq provides comprehensive and accurate whole-genome junction detection with improved breakpoint resolution, compared to karyotype, FISH, and CMA combined. This approach to molecular karyotyping offers considerable diagnostic potential for the simultaneous detection of both novel and recurrent genomic rearrangements in hereditary and neoplastic disorders.",

Rare recurrent genetic abnormalities related to this group of cancers are associated with poor outcomes. One such abnormality is the MECOM gene rearrangement that typically occurs in cases with chromosome 7 abnormalities. MECOM encodes a transcription factor that plays an essential role in cell proliferation and maintenance and also in epigenetic regulation. Aberrant expression of this gene is associated with reduced survival. Hence, its detailed characterization provides biological and clinical information relevant to the management of pediatric myeloid neoplasms. In this work, we describe a rare karyotype harboring three copies of MECOM with overexpression of the gene in a child with a very aggressive myeloid neoplasm. Cytogenetic studies defined the karyotype as 46,XX,der(7)t(3;7)(q26.2;q21.2). Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) revealed a gain of 26.04\u2009Mb in the 3q26.2\u20133qter region and a loss of 66.6\u2009Mb in the 7q21.2\u20137qter region.

Eleven families, including four BRCA1-positive and four BRCA2-positive, presented a case of GCS.

Herein, we report a case of a 53-year-old man with eosinophilia and a well-differentiated extramedullary myeloid tumor with evidence of FIP1L1/PDGFRA rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the extramedullary tissue. His bone marrow evaluation revealed a hypercellular marrow with eosinophilia but without evidence of a FIP1L1/PDGFRA rearrangement. The patient was treated with imatinib at a dose of 100\u2009mg daily and responded with normalization of his peripheral eosinophil count. The case raises the possibility that an extramedullary myeloid tumor may represent a primary site for PDGFRA rearrangement, and highlights the importance of performing cytogenetic testing on extramedullary tissue. Detection of the chromosomal rearrangement is critical for initiation of effective targeted therapy that can improve patient outcomes.",

The aim of this research was to assess the role of MALAT1, as one of lncRNAs, as a potential biomarker in breast cancer. This study comprised 80 patients with breast cancer and 80 controls. MALAT1 expression was measured by RT-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). CA15-3 was estimated using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). MALAT1 expression was significantly elevated in breast cancer cases compared to controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). By performing the ROC curve analysis, we assumed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer were 83.7% and 81.2%, respectively for MALAT1 expression and 77.5% and 82.5% respectively for CA15-3 level. Moreover, combination analysis of the 2 parameters improved the diagnostic sensitivity of CA15-3 in breast cancer. In conclusion, MALAT1 expression level was positively correlated with lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER), tumor stage and histological grade indicating its possible prognostic value. MALAT1 expression can be used as an accurate marker for diagnosis of breast cancer, in addition it possesses a prognostic value of such disease.",

Based on a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using BCL2, MYC and IGH, and spectral karyotyping (SKY), the karyotype was interpreted as being the result of a multistep mechanism in which the precursor B-cell gained t(14;18) in the bone marrow and acquired a translocation between der(14)t(14;18) and chromosome 8 in the germinal center, resulting in t(8;14;18). The pathological diagnosis was consistently FL, not only at presentation but even after a second relapse. The patient responded well to standard chemotherapies but relapsed after a short remission.

Subsequent studies elucidated a common region of highest-level amplification that includes RUNX1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most common method used to identify iAMP21, which is defined as the presence of five or more total copies of RUNX1, with three or more extra RUNX1 signals on a single abnormal chromosome 21. More recently, chromosomal microarray (CMA) and next generation sequencing have uncovered a characteristic chromosome 21 copy number profile in cases of iAMP21.We present a case of iAMP21 that does not fit the formal FISH definition. However, CMA uncovered the characteristic chromosome 21 copy number profile that is seen in iAMP21, demonstrating that CMA is helpful for the detection of this entity when FISH results are ambiguous.

Breakpoint analysis of the NGS reads showed fusion of exon 5 of the ETV6 gene to exon 8 of the LYN gene. Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) inferred a four-break rearrangement of three chromosomes, namely 1, 8 and 12. First, there was a balanced translocation t(1;12)(p13;p13.2) in which the ETV6 was split between der(1) and der(12). Second, an inverted insertion of 8q12.1~q24.21 into 1p13 occurred, thus bringing ETV6 and LYN into juxtaposition in the correct 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation to produce an in-frame chimeric fusion gene on der(1). Notwithstanding two previous reports of ETV6-LYN fusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), we report the first case of this fusion in AML and hence broaden its disease association. We also illustrate the clinical utility of NGS based detection of gene fusion in the setting of complex karyotype or cryptic aberration, since this method does not require a priori knowledge of the translocation partner and exact breakpoints to guide the application of appropriate primers or probes.",

This potential for molecular analysis makes ccfDNA attractive for the study of clonal evolution and for uncovering emerging therapeutic resistance or sensitivity. We assessed ccfDNA from colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients using next generation sequencing of 56 cancer-associated genes at the time of primary resectable disease and metastatic progression and compared this to the mutational patterns of the primary tumor. 28%\u201347% of non-synonymous mutations in the primary tumors were also detected in the ccfDNA while 71%\u201378% mutations found in ccfDNA were not detected in the primary tumors. ccfDNA collected at the time of progression harbored 3\u20135 new mutations not detected in ccfDNA at the earlier collection time points.

However, rearrangement involving CSF3R in hematological neoplasms has not been reported. Here, we report a case of a 21-year-old female diagnosed as aCML with t(1;9)(p34;q34) who presented a CSF3R rearrangement. First, RNA sequencing identified a novel fusion transcript involving exon 17 of CSF3R and exon 50 of non-erythrocytic-1-spectrin-alpha (SPTAN1). Subsequent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and bidirectional Sanger sequencing confirmed the in-frame fusion. The breakpoint was located at the C-terminus of CSF3R, suggesting a pattern of truncation mutation of CSF3R. Unexpectedly, the patient failed to achieve a complete hematological response following the SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib therapy, which has been reported to effectively inhibit truncated forms of CSF3R. The patient accepted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and currently remains in a good state. In conclusion, this report is the first to identify a fusion involving CSF3R and SPTAN1 in aCML with t(1;9)(p34;q34).",

Our analysis identified several genes with relatively low mutation frequency, including PTEN, as highly significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001), suggesting these genes may play an important role in the progression of SCLC. Our results also indicated mutations in genes involved in the axon guidance pathways likely play an important role in SCLC progression.

The ACAs were examined for partial or whole chromosomal gains or losses, and structural aberrations. The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients who received hematopoietic cell transplantation were compared between the isolated Ph group and ACA group. ACAs were present in 73.0% of all patients. The recurrent ACAs were extra Ph (24.7%), 9/9p loss (20.2%), and 7/7p loss (19.1%). Complex karyotype was found in 28.1% of patients in the ACA group. Younger patients (19\u201330 years) in the ACA group showed the highest frequency of extra Ph (54%) compared to other age groups. The OS in the ACA group was significantly shorter than in the isolated Ph group. The presence of an extra Ph chromosome or 9/9p loss was significantly associated with shorter OS and DFS, whereas 7/7p loss and complex karyotype were not associated with poorer prognosis.

The differential gene expression analysis using non-parametric Wilcoxon test revealed a total of 479 up-regulated and 91 down-regulated genes in HCC compared to controls. The list of top differentially expressed genes mainly consists of tumor/cancer associated genes, such as AFP, THBS4, LCN2, GPC3, NUF2, etc. The genes over-expressed in HCC were mainly associated with cell cycle pathways. In total, 59 kinases associated genes were found over-expressed in HCC, including TTK, MELK, BUB1, NEK2, BUB1B, AURKB, PLK1, CDK1, PKMYT1, PBK, etc. Overall four distinct HCC subtypes were predicted using consensus clustering method. Each subtype was unique in terms of gene expression, pathway enrichment and median survival.

Furthermore, we show that primary ALL mononuclear cells harboring the JAK2 R938Q mutation display reduced sensitivity to the JAK1/2 ATP-competitive inhibitor ruxolitinib in vitro, compared to ALL cells that carry a more common JAK2 pseudokinase domain mutation. Our findings are in line with previous reports that demonstrate that mutations within the kinase domain of JAK2 are associated with resistance to type I JAK inhibitors. Importantly, given the recent inclusion of ruxolitinib in trial protocols for children with JAK pathway alterations, we predict that inter-patient genetic variability may result in suboptimal responses to JAK inhibitor therapy in a subset of cases. The need for alternate targeted and/or combination therapies for patients who display inherent or developed resistance to JAK inhibitor therapy will be warranted, and we propose that kinase-mutants less sensitive to type I JAK inhibitors may present a currently unexplored platform for investigation of improved therapies.",

GTG-Banding and FISH Panel Testing specifically for \u22125/\u22125q, \u22127/\u22127q, +8 and \u221220q was performed on whole blood or bone marrow samples from 136 patients with MDS.

More than one anomaly was found in 18/54 (33.3%) cases, therefore, overall FISH identified 75 anomalies of which 32 (42.6%) were undetected by CC. FISH provided additional information in cases with CC failure and in cases with a normal karyotype. Further, in ten cases with an abnormal karyotype, FISH could identify additional anomalies, increasing the number of abnormalities per patient. Although CC is the gold standard in the cytogenetic profiling of MDS, FISH has proven to be an asset in identifying additional abnormalities. The number of anomalies per patient can predict the prognosis in MDS and hence, FISH contributed towards prognostic re-categorization. The FISH Panel testing should be used as an adjunct to CC, irrespective of the adequacy of the number of metaphases in CC, as it improves the prognostic classification of MDS.",

An observational cohort study was undertaken. Patients with large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1/BRCA2 were identified from a prospectively maintained database of MLPA test results. Phenotypic and genotypic data were retrieved by chart review. Large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 were identified in 49 families; and in BRCA2 in 7 families, representing ~11% of mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 in Ireland. The most common large genomic rearrangement in BRCA1 was deletion of exons 1\u201323 (11 families, 7 from Co. Galway). Other common mutations included deletions of exon 3 (8 families) and exons 1\u20132 (6 families). Deletion of exons 19\u201320 in BRCA2 represented the familial mutation in five families, all from East Ireland (Wexford/Wicklow/Dublin). It is evident that a significant proportion of highly penetrant pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 will be missed if testing is limited to PCR-based Sanger sequencing alone. Screening for large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the routine diagnostic workflow is critical to avoid false negative results.",

     "abstract": "Renal metanephric adenoma (MA) is a rare benign tumor frequently misclassified when microscopic features alone are applied. The correct classification of a renal tumor is critical for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Despite the advancements in cancer genomics, up until recently relatively few genetic alterations critical to MA development have been recognized. Recent data suggest that 90% of MA have BRAFV600E mutations; the genetics of the remaining 10% are unclear. To date, only one case of a chromosomal translocation, t(9;15)(p24;q24) associated with MA has been reported. However, the potential role of the KANK1 gene, which lies near the breakpoint of the short arm of chromosome 9p24, in the etiology of MA was not examined. We identified the same cytogenetic aberration utilizing molecular cytogenetic techniques in a 22-year-old female patient, and further investigated the genes involved in the translocation that might have contributed to tumorigenesis. A series of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes identified the rearranged genes to be KANK1 on chromosome 9 (9p24.3) and NTRK3 on chromosome 15 (15q25.3). Mate-Pair genome sequencing validated the balanced translocation between 9p24.3 and 15q25.3, involving genes KANK1 and NTRK3, respectively. BRAFV600E mutational analysis was normal. Our findings indicate that gene fusions may be one mechanism by which functionally relevant genes are altered in the development of MA. Molecular and cytogenetic analyses have elucidated a novel genetic aberration, which helps to provide a better understanding of this genomic change and assist in diagnosis and classification of new subgroups/entities in metanephric adenomas.",

Using next generation sequencing (NGS), we uncovered two fusion partners of USP6 in two ABCs: platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1 (PAFAH1B1), which is known to contribute to tumorigenesis in lung cancer, and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), which is known to regulate osteoblastic differentiation, osteosarcoma tumorigenesis and its metastasis. In our study, the PAFAH1B1\u2013USP6 fusion consisted of the promoter of PAFAH1B1 fused to the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of USP6 and was discovered in a typical ABC. The RUNX2\u2013USP6 fusion had the promoter and a short coding region of RUNX2 fused to the translation start codon of USP6 and was detected in an unusually aggressive ABC with an osteosarcoma-like soft tissue extension. Our findings not only expanded the repertoire of the partner genes of USP6 in ABC but also can serve as a reference for future studies to better understand the correlation between various gene fusions and the progression of ABC.",

     "abstract": "Gene copy number changes are important somatic alterations in cancers. A number of high throughput methods, such as next generation sequencing, are capable of detecting copy number aberrations, but their use can be challenging and cost prohibitive for screening a small number of markers. Furthermore, detection of CNAs by high throughput platforms needs confirmation by an orthogonal technique, especially in cases with low level CNAs. Here, we have validated TaqMan based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to detect CNAs in genes of high clinical importance in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. A cohort of 22 tumors of various types that harbor 67 CNAs in 13 genes was assessed. The abnormalities in these tumors were detected by using a NGS-based 50 gene hotspot panel on Ion Torrent PGM and molecular inversion probe (MIP) array. The CNAs included ERBB2 (n\u2009=\u20096), PDGFRA (n\u2009=\u20096), KIT (n\u2009=\u20097), NRAS (n\u2009=\u20093), PIK3CA (n\u2009=\u20096), MYC (n\u2009=\u20097), MET (n\u2009=\u20094), FLT3 (n\u2009=\u20096), FGFR3 (n\u2009=\u20093), FGFR2 (n\u2009=\u20093), EGFR (n\u2009=\u20097), KRAS (n\u2009=\u20096) and FGFR1 (n\u2009=\u20095). Different amounts of input DNA were tested and 5\u2009ng FFPE DNA was found to be adequate without limiting detection sensitivity. All 22 (100%) positive tumor samples revealed by MIP array were confirmed by real time qPCR and 17 of 22 (77.2%) samples tested by NGS were confirmed. The limit of detection of the qPCR assay was determined by serial dilution of SKBR3 cell line DNA (with amplified ERBB2) and showed an ability to detect 3 copies consistently up to 0.75% dilution. The ability to use low input of FFPE DNA, high sensitivity, and short turnaround time makes qPCR a valuable and economically viable platform for detecting single gene CNAs as well as for confirmation of CNAs detected by high throughput screening assays.",

Tumor protein p53 is a key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Paradoxically, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children develop cancer within the first few years of life.To address this paradox, response to UV stress was compared in dermal fibroblasts (dFb) from an affected LFS patient vs. their unaffected carrier parent. UV induction of CDKN1A/p21, a regulatory target of p53, in LFS patient dFb was significantly reduced compared to the unaffected parent. UV exposure also induced significantly greater p53[Ser15]-phosphorylation in LFS patient dFb, a reported property of some mutant p53 variants.Taken together, these results suggested that unaffected parental dFb may express an increased proportion of wild-type vs. mutant p53. Indeed, a significantly increased ratio of wild-type to mutant TP53 allele-specific expression in the unaffected parent dFb was confirmed by RT-PCR-RFLP and RNA-seq analysis.Hence, allele-specific expression of wild-type TP53 may allow an unaffected parent to mount a response to genotoxic stress more characteristic of homozygous wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection from the oncogenesis associated with LFS.",

In this work we analyzed 51 CRC samples and matched normal mucosae by whole genome SNP arrays and compared different bioinformatics tools in order to identify broad (>25% of a chromosomal arm) and focal somatic copy number abnormalities (BCNAs and FCNAs respectively). In 15 tumors, two samples, separated by at least 1\u2009cm, were taken from the same tumor mass (double-sampling pairs) in order to evaluate differences in detection of chromosomal abnormalities between distant regions of the same tumor and their influence on CIN quantitative and qualitative analysis.

On the contrary, a lower correlation is observed in terms of chromosomal distribution of BCNAs, as summarized by a simplified cytogenetic table. Quantitative or qualitative analysis of FCNAs, including homozygous deletions and high level amplifications, did not add further information on the CIN status. The use of the index \u201csomatic BCNA number\u201d can be proposed for a robust classification of tumors as CIN positive or negative even in the presence of a significant tumor regional heterogeneity.",

     "abstract": "Germline mutations in the BRCA tumor suppressor genes account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. However, this contribution is lower than expected. This underestimation can partly be explained by the BRCA alterations missed by using Sanger sequencing methods. Thus, large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for 4\u201328% of all inherited BRCA mutations. In this study, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used for detection of large rearrangements of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 36 unrelated high-risk breast/ovarian cancer patients negative for BRCA1/2 point mutations. MLPA assay for all exons of both genes and for 1100delC variant of CHEK2 gene were performed. Positive MLPA results were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Two different rearrangements in the BRCA1 gene were identified consisting of exon 5 deletion and exon 20 duplication. MLPA analysis did not reveal any large genomic rearrangements in BRCA2 gene. Overall BRCA1/2 LGRs prevalence among high-risk Tunisian patients was 5.5%. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed MPLA findings. Our results suggest the usefulness of screening for LGRs in BRCA genes in the Tunisian population. To avoid false-negative results, we suggest that MLPA should be used in genetic testing programs. These results are important for guidance counseling and clinical management of Tunisian high-risk patients.",

The murine double minutes (MDM2)-specific DNA probe and the satellite enumeration probe for chromosome 12 were used. Three cases (6%) showed more than 25 signals (high gene amplification), and 7 (15%) showed 3\u201310 signals (gains); among these, 4 cases (8%) had an equal number of MDM2 and centromeric signals on chromosome 12 (polyploidy). Genomic heterogeneity was observed only in 3 cases with low gene amplification.In our series, 6% of glioblastomas exhibited high MDM2 amplification (in vivo) with a pattern related to the known double minutes/chromothripsis phenomenon (in situ), and only cases with low amplification showed genomic heterogeneity. We concluded that the rate of MDM2 gene amplification can be a useful predictive biomarker to improve patient selection.",

The purpose of this study is to review therapeutic molecular targets in completed and ongoing later phase (II and III) clinical trials to have a better understanding of the rationale and progress towards targeted molecular therapies for pancreatic cancer. The PubMed database and the NCDI clinical trial website (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were queried to identify phase II and III completed and published (PubMed) and ongoing (clinicaltrials.gov) trials using the keywords: pancreatic cancer and molecular targeted therapy. The search engines were further limited by adding Phase II or III, active enrollment and North American. A total of 14 completed and published phase II/III clinical trials and 17 ongoing trials were identified. Evaluated strategies included inhibition of growth factor receptors (EGFR, PDGFR, VGFR, IGF-1R), tyrosine kinase inhibitors, MEK1/2, mTOR blockade and PI3K and HER2-neu pathway inhibitors. Only one trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and the PANTAR trial have demonstrated a survival improvement from EGFR inhibition using erlotinib. These trials ultimately led to FDA approval of erlotinib/Tarceva in advanced stage disease. It remains unclear whether new combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy plus molecular targeted therapy will be beneficial in management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

MCM9 was recently identified as the DNA helicase in the mammalian MMR complex and loss of helicase activity results in microsatellite instability. We hypothesized that pathogenic variants in MCM9 may account for LLS. The 5\u2032UTR and coding region of MCM9 were sequenced in germline DNA of 109 Australian patients with LLS and variants were cross-referenced with three population-based databases (dbSNP144, 1000 Genomes, ExAC). The functional effect of variants was assessed in silico with PolyPhen-2, SIFT and CONDEL. Fifteen variants that included six common SNPs and nine variants of unknown significance (VUS) were identified.

It is well established from e.g. melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancer that a methylated phenotype can be correlated to prognosis and can be related to BRAF mutations.In the present study we investigated the global methylation level in 67 seminomas and classified them as hypo-methylated, intermediate, patchy and hyper-methylated, respectively. A selected subset representing each level of DNA methylation and the TCam2 seminoma cell line were subsequently analysed for a range of other epigenetic marks (6 histone marks and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine), the presence of the BRAF V600E de novo mutation, differences in the transcriptome and finally correlated to the clinical outcome.We did not identify any histone marks or hydroxymethylation levels that correlated with the methylation level of the genome. Some histone marks, however, showed a great variation while others were found at the same level in all the investigated seminomas. We did not identify any tumours with the BRAF V600E mutation and transcriptome analysis revealed no significant differences between hypo- and hyper-methylated seminomas. Similarly, no obvious differences in the clinical manifestation of the patients representing hypo- or hyper-methylated seminomas were identified.The level of DNA methylation in testicular seminomas consequently seems secondary to the manifestation of the tumour phenotype.",

KRT9 (NM_000226.3:c.487C>T, p.Arg163Trp), and KRT15 (XM_005257346.1:c.212G>T, XP_005257403.1:p.Gly71Val) located in this region, have been identified as two candidate causative genes for EPPK in the Uygur family.

To investigate this, full-length wild-type Keratin9 (KRT9; pKRT9-WT) and p.Arg163Trp (pKRT9-R163W) were then transfected into HaCaT cells. The small interfering RNAs targeting the KRT9 R163W mutant and wildtype KRT9 were transfected into HaCaT cells, and total RNA isolated at 72\u2009h post-transfection.

Furthermore, we investigated the co-existence of the above polymorphisms with G516T polymorphism to determine the CYP2B6 high-risk haplotypes in AML susceptibility. Our study included 619 AML patients and 430 healthy donors. Concerning C777A CYP2B6 polymorphism, no significant difference was found between patients and controls. However, A785G CYP2B6 polymorphism showed a statistically higher frequency of the variant genotypes in patients (48.2%), mainly in secondary AML patients (49.1%) than in controls (26.1%). Moreover, an increased frequency of the variant genotypes was found in those with abnormal karyotypes, especially with \u22127/del(7q), \u22125/del(5q), +8, inv(16) and t(8;21). The combination of the three CYP2B6 polymorphisms (G516T, C777A & A785G) revealed seven haplotypes. Four out of six haplotypes with at least one mutant allele were significantly associated with an increased risk for AML. Interestingly, T516A777G785 haplotype, where the three mutant alleles co-existed, had ~3-fold increased risk to be found in patients than controls. The association between haplotypes and cytogenetic aberrations revealed a positive correlation between specific CYP2B6 haplotypes and AML cytogenetic abnormalities.

However, in some cases, no apparent cancer driver events can be identified. Here, we describe a novel fusion between the transcription factor nuclear factor 1A (NFIA) and Raf-1 proto-oncogene (RAF1) in a 5-year old boy with PA. The novel fusion was identified as part of a comprehensive genomic tumor profiling. We show that the NFIA:RAF1 fusion results in constitutive Raf1 kinase activity, leading to activation of downstream MEK1/2 cascade and increased proliferation of cancer cells. The NFIA:RAF1 fusion displayed distinct subcellular localization towards the plasma membrane indicative of Raf-1 activation, in contrast to both wild type NFIA and Raf-1, which were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively. In conclusion, our data support the existence of rare oncogenic RAF1 fusions with constitutive Raf-1 activity.

Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA), we investigated co-localized mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation data across 15 cancer types, focusing on cases where evidence for direct regulation was strong. Restricting attention to regions where miRNA markers co-localize within a corresponding mRNA transcript, we checked expression data from 2839 samples for 354 mRNAs, 389 miRNAs and 13,809 DNA methylation probes for correlations greater than an absolute 0.6. We identified 32 genes, 34 miRNAs and 143 DNA methylation site probes comprising 180 \u201ctriplet combinations\u201d that together provide evidence of co-localized genomic regulation in cancer. The five triplet combinations showing the highest prevalence across tissue types were found in four genes, HOXC5, PDE2A, SH3TC2 and TP63. Of the total 32 genes, eight among two tumor types (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC, 4) and Low Grade Glioma (LGG, 4)) were significantly associated with survival time (p\u2009<\u20090.002). Together, the data presented in this paper provide evidence toward our primary hypothesis, that both genes and miRNAs strongly correlated with methylation level are more likely to be associated with cancer outcomes.",

Common variants in inflammasome genes are known to affect IL-1\u03b2 expression. To investigate the contribution of inflammasome genetics in melanoma development and progression and to identify a potential prognostic marker, the distribution of selected inflammasome SNPs was analysed in a Brazilian case/control cohort of sporadic malignant melanoma (SMM) and then the expression of inflammasome components was evaluated in melanoma biopsies. Allele and gene-specific Taqman assays were implied for genotyping of case/control DNA samples and for relative expression analysis in skin biopsies respectively. CARD8 rs6509365 was found to be significantly more common in healthy volunteers than in SMM patients suggesting a protection effect of this variant towards melanoma development. Accordingly, CARD8 expression was found to be reduced in nevus compared to melanoma biopsies. Upon stratification, NLRP1 rs11651270 and CARD8 rs2043211 were found associated with nodular melanoma; IL1B rs1143643 to a lower value of Breslow index; IL18 rs5744256 to melanoma development in sun sensitive individuals.

The prognostic significance of such additional chromosomal abnormalities has been controversial. Translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) CCND1-IGH is typically associated with mantle cell lymphoma or a subset of plasma cell myeloma and is exceedingly rare in myeloid neoplasm. Here we report a unique case describing a patient found at diagnosis of chronic phase CML to have both the Philadelphia chromosome as well as t(11;14)\u2014a rare cytogenetic combination. The patient was treated with imatinib with appropriate hematologic response but persistent disease by FISH and RT-PCR. She was switched to dasatinib and eventually achieved cytogenetic remission in both translocations, but still with persistent RT-PCR evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. As cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and is required for the cells to progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, overexpression of cyclin D1 will likely promote cells into cell cycle. This may further augment proliferation in addition to upregulated ABL1 kinase activity in the index case. It may also contribute to the resistance to imatinib, as imatinib only targets on BCR-ABL fusion. Therefore, the addition of t(11;14)(q13;q32) may have significant implication in patient management.",

We report data on BAP1 analysis in four families with multiple mesothelioma cases to investigate possible BAP1 alterations associated with an inherited cancer syndrome.

By genomic direct sequencing, we found no evidence of a BAP1 germline mutation in tumor DNA samples (one mesothelioma per family: n\u2009=\u20093 epithelioid; n\u2009=\u20091 biphasic). On the other hand, we identified a novel BAP1 somatic alteration (c.329_335delinsTC) in exon 5 (n\u2009=\u20091 biphasic), and we hypothesized the occurrence of somatic inactivating events not identifiable by sequencing in the other cases (n\u2009=\u20093 epithelioid), as demonstrated by the loss of nuclear BAP1 immunostaining. History of other cancers was in sites not typical of the BAP1 cancer syndrome. Asbestos exposure was occupational (n\u2009=\u20092 clusters), household (n\u2009=\u20091), and unknown (n\u2009=\u20091). These family units without inheritance of a BAP1 predisposing mutation expand the number of unmutated germline BAP1 families with multiple mesothelioma cases.

Approximately half of all cases of CHL are associated with infection by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic herpesvirus that expresses a number of proteins thought to contribute to transformation. While a small number of published studies have attempted to identify recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in CHL, no large case series have explored karyotypic differences between EBV-positive and EBV-negative tumors. Here, we report a two-institution retrospective investigation of cytogenetic features characterizing CHL. In our cohort, cases of EBV-negative CHL were characterized by more complex routine karyotypes than their EBV-positive counterparts (24.6 versus 15.6 independent aberrations per case, P\u2009=\u20090.009). The increased complexity of EBV-negative cases was driven by a number of features suggestive of genomic instability, including a larger number of independent chromosomal breakpoints (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and apparently aneuploid autosomes (P\u2009=\u20090.008). Compelling but nonsignificant trends also suggest a larger modal number and increased marker chromosomes in EBV-negative cases (P\u2009=\u20090.13 and 0.06, respectively). While some of these differences are related to histologic subtype, others appear independent of histology. Finally, a significant subset of EBV-positive tumors has a surprisingly simple karyotype relative to what is normally seen in CHL, an observation suggesting considerable biological and genetic diversity in this disease.",

We assessed whether a panel assay for recurrent Hispanic BRCA mutations (HISPANEL) has an adequate breadth of coverage to be suitable as a cost effective screening tool for HBOC in a cohort of patients from Southern Brazil. A multiplex, PCR-based panel was used to genotype 232 unrelated patients for 114 germline BRCA mutations, finding deleterious mutations in 3.5% of them. This mutation prevalence is within the range detected by the HISPANEL among BC patients unselected for family history in other Latin American settings. The HISPANEL would have accounted for 27% of the BRCA mutations detected by complete sequencing in a comparison cohort (n\u2009=\u2009193). This prevalence may be region-specific since significant differences in population structure exist in Brazil. Comprehensive analysis of BRCA in a larger set of HBOC patients from different Brazilian regions is warranted, and the results could inform customization of the HISPANEL as an affordable mutation screening tool.",

In order to further clarify the prognostic significance of MK in Chinese MDS patients, 2080 primary patients were retrospectively analyzed in our center. MK was observed in 8.1% patients (168/2080), and monosomies of chromosome 5/7 were the most frequent types of MK. We further found that MK was significantly associated with elderly patients, higher bone marrow blasts and relatively poor cytogenetics.

     "abstract": "Most cancers are driven by somatic mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Genetic changes in a tumor may accumulate in the tissue self-renewal phase prior to neoplasm. The risk of sporadic mutations increases with age. In this regard, a positive association between patient age and the accumulated mutation burden in tumors exists for many cancer types. However, the reported lines of evidence for such a connection are still limited. TP53 is the most frequently mutated cancer gene. The encoded p53 protein plays crucial roles in DNA repair. Hereby, we speculate that mutant TP53 can disrupt the age-related accumulation patterns of somatic mutations in tumors. We performed linear model analysis on the clinically-annotated genomic data published by TCGA. We found that there was a significant interaction between TP53 genotype (mutant versus wild-type) and patient age at the initial clinical date on somatic mutation burden for five cancers. That is, the regression coefficients of mutation burden on patient age were significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for TP53 wild-type tumors but not the mutant counterparts. This disparity was further verified by comparing the group-specific regression coefficients. This finding confirmed our hypothesis and provided unique insights into p53-related tumorigenesis such as the potential temporal order of driver mutations.",

The behavior of SFT is difficult to predict based on morphology. Recently, an intrachromosomal gene fusion between NAB2 and STAT6 was identified as the defining driving genetic event of SFT and different fusion types correlated with tumor histology and behavior. Due to the proximity of NAB2 and STAT6 on chromosome 12, this fusion may be missed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. We evaluated 12 SFTs from 10 patients. All tumors showed strong nuclear staining for STAT6 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The same formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks for IHC were used for gene fusion detection by a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based assay. Targeted RNA fusion sequencing for gene fusions was performed using the Universal RNA Fusion Detection Kit, the Archer\u2122 FusionPlex\u2122 Sarcoma Panel and the Ion Torrent PGM, and data were analyzed using the Archer Analysis Pipeline 3.3.

Immunohistochemical staining for MYC performed on bone marrow core biopsy or clot sections revealed increased MYC protein in all 19 cases tested. Except for one patient, most patients failed to respond to risk-adapted chemotherapies. At last follow up, all patients had died of disease after a median of 5 months following dmin detection. In conclusion, dmin in myeloid neoplasms commonly harbor MYC or MLL gene amplification and manifest as micronuclei within leukemic blasts. Dmin are often associated with myelodysplasia or therapy-related disease, and complex karyotypes.",

Not currently assigned a WHO grade, they typically display indolent behavior, with occasional variants taking a more aggressive course. We characterized the immunohistochemical characteristics, copy number (high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization, OncoCopy) and mutational profile (targeted next-generation exome sequencing, OncoPanel) of a cohort of seven biopsies from four patients to identify recurrent genomic events that may help distinguish astroblastomas from other more common high-grade gliomas. We found that tumor histology was variable across patients and between primary and recurrent tumor samples. No common molecular features were identified among the four tumors. Mutations commonly observed in astrocytic tumors (IDH1/2, TP53, ATRX, and PTEN) or ependymoma were not identified. However one case with rapid clinical progression displayed mutations more commonly associated with GBM (NF1N1054H/K63*, PIK3CAR38H and ERGA403T). Conversely, another case, originally classified as glioblastoma with nine-year survival before recurrence, lacked a GBM mutational profile. Other mutations frequently seen in lower grade gliomas (BCOR, BCORL1, ERBB3, MYB, ATM) were also present in several tumors. Copy number changes were variable across tumors. Our findings indicate that astroblastomas have variable growth patterns and morphologic features, posing significant challenges to accurate classification in the absence of diagnostically specific copy number alterations and molecular features. Their histopathologic overlap with glioblastoma will likely confound the observation of long-term GBM \u201csurvivors\u201d. Further genomic profiling is needed to determine whether these tumors represent a distinct entity and to guide management strategies.",

According to our recent studies, the BAALC gene is identified to have high mRNA expression levels in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and those with multidrug resistance. Several polymorphisms are associated with the expression of this gene. To date, there has been no study on the rs62527607 [GT] single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BAALC gene and its link with childhood acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of this polymorphism in pediatric acute leukemia, as well as its relationship with prognosis. DNA samples were extracted from bone marrow slides of 129 children with ALL and 16 children with AML. The rs62527607 [GT] SNP was evaluated using mismatch polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)-based analysis. The association between the SNP alleles and patient disease-free survival was then assessed. The prevalence of the T-allele of rs62527607 [GT] SNP in childhood T-ALL and pre-B-ALL was 28.3% and 11.2%, respectively. In the pre-B-ALL patients, 3 year disease free survival was associated with the GG genotype. Results showed a robust association between the rs62527607 SNP and the risk of relapse in ALL, but not AML, patients. T-ALL patients with the GT genotype had an 8.75 fold higher risk of relapse. The current study demonstrates a significant association between the genotype GT and the polymorphic allele G424T, and introduces this SNP as a negative prognostic factor in children with ALL.",

Under these circumstances, GISTs are often multiple and associated with accompanying signs peculiar of the hosting syndrome. Moreover, syndromic GISTs themselves tend to show heterogeneous features depending on the underlying condition.Multiple inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFPs) and a jejunal spindle-cell GIST were resected in a germline PDGFRA-mutant individual. Although the association of IFP and GIST is typical of this genetic setting (PDGFRA mutations can in fact trigger both these tumor types), PDGFRA-mutant GISTs are usually epithelioid and gastric. This discrepancy was settled evidencing a somatic KIT mutation in the GIST.The awareness of possible somatic mutations can be critical in the management of high-risk/malignant GISTs arising in syndromic settings. GIST features unusual for a given GIST-predisposing syndrome are a valuable tool in the hands of physicians for suspecting these \u201cextra\u201d triggers, which could not be sought for once a diagnosis of GIST-prone syndrome is well established, in a bona fide cost/benefit perspective.",

Here, we describe such an approach in two retinoblastoma cases. In patient one, allele-specific (AS)-PCR for a somatic nonsense mutation confirmed that a temple mass was metastatic retinoblastoma. In a second patient, a rib mass shared somatic copy number gains and losses with the primary tumor. For definitive diagnosis, however, an RB1 mutation was needed, but heterozygous promoter\u2192exon 11 deletion was the only RB1 mutation detected in the primary tumor. We used a novel application of inverse PCR to identify the deletion breakpoint. Subsequently, AS-PCR designed for the breakpoint confirmed that the rib mass was metastatic retinoblastoma. These cases demonstrate that personalized molecular testing can confirm retinoblastoma metastases and rule out a second primary cancer, thereby helping to direct the clinical management.",

Engraftment was achieved and cytogenetic analyses showed human cells with normal karyotypes. However, in all experiments with NSG mice, mainly control cells or GFP-negative cells were engrafted, not allowing observation of modified HSCs. In NSGS mice, engraftment rate was higher, but mice developed graft-versus-host disease.In summary, engraftment of HSCs is promising and could be used to analyze the induction of CIN. However, the analysis of modified HSCs is limited and further experiments are required to improve this model.",

Approximately 40% of PCCs/PGLs are due to germline mutations in one of 16 susceptibility genes, and a further 30% are due to somatic alterations in 5 main genes. Recently, somatic ATRX mutations have been found in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-associated hereditary PCCs/PGLs. In the present study we applied whole-exome sequencing to the germline and tumor DNA of a patient with metastatic composite PCC and no alterations in known PCC/PGL susceptibility genes. A somatic loss-of-function mutation affecting ATRX was identified in tumor DNA. Transcriptional profiling analysis classified the tumor within cluster 2 of PCCs/PGLs (without SDH gene mutations) and identified downregulation of genes involved in neuronal development and homeostasis (NLGN4, CD99 and CSF2RA) as well as upregulation of Drosha, an important gene involved in miRNA and rRNA processing. CpG island methylator phenotype typical of SDH gene-mutated tumors was ruled out, and SNP array data revealed a unique profile of gains and losses. Finally, we demonstrated the presence of alternative lengthening of telomeres in the tumor, probably associated with the failure of ATRX functions.

With the advent of new technologies to study cancer genomes, transcriptomes and epigenomes, our understanding of sarcoma biology has improved tremendously in a relatively short period of time. However, much remains to be accomplished in this arena especially with regard to translating all of this new knowledge to the bedside. To this end, a meeting was convened in Philadelphia, PA, on April 18, 2015 sponsored by the QuadW foundation, Children's Oncology Group and CureSearch for Children's Cancer that brought together sarcoma clinicians and scientists from North America to review the current state of pediatric sarcoma biology and ongoing/planned genomics based clinical trials in an effort to identify and bridge knowledge gaps that continue to exist at present.

Eight tagging SNPs in THBS2 and THBS4 were genotyped in 761 GC cases and 739 controls from Chinese case\u2013control sets using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. THBS2/THBS4 mRNA expression was studied in 82 human GC tumors and in mouse stomach tissues by real-time PCR. We found that both THBS2 and THBS4 were abundantly expressed in mouse stomach. THBS4 mRNA expression in human stomach was associated with tumor size (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) (P\u2009=\u20090.010), and THBS2 mRNA expression was associated with the TNM (P\u2009=\u20090.010).

THBS4 SNPs (rs77878919 and rs7736549) had a modest cumulative effect on the risk of poor prognosis (TNM), with that risk in the highest trend for patients carrying both these unfavorable genotypes. In addition, individuals carrying the THBS4 rs10474606 variant homozygous AA had a modest reduced GC risk. We conclude that THBS2/THBS4 may be functional in playing important role in GC, which was supported by the evidence of the mRNA overexpression in GC and the modest associations of THBS2/THBS4 polymorphisms to GC.

The BCR\u2013JAK2 fusion was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and demonstrated two in-frame 5\u2032BCR/3\u2032JAK2 transcripts with BCR exon 1 juxtaposed to JAK2 exon 15 and exon 17, respectively. Our results, together with literature review, reveal BCR\u2013JAK2 fusions as oncogenic genetic alterations that are associated with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms and are frequently characterized by eosinophilia. Further, patients with BCR\u2013JAK2 are candidates for JAK2 inhibitor therapy. Given the distinct clinical and pathological characteristics, we believe that hematological neoplasms harboring BCR\u2013JAK2 should be included as an additional distinct entity to the current WHO category of \u201cmyeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR\u201d, and testing for a JAK2 fusion should be pursued in neoplasms with a karyotypic 9p24 abnormality.",

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of combining CMA and NGS for a comprehensive genomic assessment of lung and colorectal adenocarcinomas, especially for detecting drug targets. We compared the results from NGS and CMA data from 60 lung and 51 colorectal tumors. From CMA analysis, 33% were amplified, 89% showed gains, 75% showed losses and 41% demonstrated loss of heterozygosity; pathogenic variants were identified in 81% of colon and 67% lung specimens through NGS. KRAS mutations commonly occurred with loss in TP53 and there was significant loss of BRCA1 and NF1 among male patients with lung cancer. For clinically actionable targets, 23% had targetable CNVs when no pathogenic variants were detected by NGS. The data thus indicate that combining the two approaches provides significant benefit in a routine clinical setting not available by NGS alone.",

High S100P expression was correlated with metastasis, as demonstrated by clinically relevant data, and predicted poor survival more effectively than preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels in colon adenocarcinoma. Stable S100P knockdown CRC cell lines were established to elucidate the relationship between S100P expression and tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. S100P knockdown resulted in reductions in the invasiveness and metastasis of CRC cells.

     "abstract": "Comprehensive genetic profiling by massively parallel sequencing, commonly known as next generation sequencing (NGS), is becoming the foundation of personalized oncology. For sarcomas very few targeted treatments are currently in routine use. In clinical practice the preoperative diagnostic workup of soft tissue tumours largely relies on core needle biopsies. Although mostly sufficient for histopathological diagnosis, only very limited amounts of formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissue are often available for predictive mutation analysis. Targeted NGS may thus open up new possibilities for comprehensive characterization of scarce biopsies. We therefore set out to search for driver mutations by NGS in a cohort of 55 clinically and morphologically well characterized sarcomas using low input of DNA from formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissues. The aim was to investigate if there are any recurrent or targetable aberrations in cancer driver genes in addition to known chromosome translocations in different types of sarcomas. We employed a panel covering 207 mutation hotspots in 50 cancer-associated genes to analyse DNA from nine gastrointestinal stromal tumours, 14 synovial sarcomas, seven myxoid liposarcomas, 22 Ewing sarcomas and three Ewing-like small round cell tumours at a large sequencing depth to detect also mutations that are subclonal or occur at low allele frequencies. We found nine mutations in eight different potential driver genes, some of which are potentially actionable by currently existing targeted therapies. Even though no recurrent mutations in driver genes were found in the different sarcoma groups, we show that targeted NGS-based sequencing is clearly feasible in a diagnostic setting with very limited amounts of paraffin embedded tissue and may provide novel insights into mesenchymal cell signalling and potentially druggable targets. Interestingly, we also identify five non-synonymous sequence variants in 4 established cancer driver genes in DNA from normal tissue from sarcoma patients that may possibly predispose or contribute to neoplastic development.",

Not performing RCA may compromise patient care since RCA is equally important for detecting non-PC related abnormalities when the diagnosis is undefined. To resolve this critical issue, we designed a study where an immuno-magnetic CD138 enriched positive selection was used for FISH while the negative fraction (NF) was used to retrieve other myeloid elements for RCA. Parallel FISH studies were performed using UPC and CD138 EPC, while karyotyping was achieved using whole BM and discarded myeloid elements from the NF.

In parallel, in 15 cases, we also analysed non-neoplastic liver tissues adjacent to the HCC. All samples were analysed with high resolution, microarray-based, comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH).Overall, genomic aberrations in childhood HCC resembled those reported for adulthood HCC. In HBV+ HCC samples, chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 9, 17, 19, and 22 were significantly changed compared to those in HBV\u2212 HCC samples. Most interestingly, aberrations for chromosomes 7, 8, 9, 11, and 19 were also observed in corresponding non-neoplastic samples. A specific set of chromosomal abnormalities, including gains in chromosomes 8q, 9q, 11q, and 19, was significantly enriched in HBV+ compared to HBV\u2212 non-neoplastic tissues.In childhood HCC, HBV+ was correlated to increased chromosomal instability and specific chromosomal imbalances. A subset of aberrations might be essential in HCC carcinogenesis because they occurred in adjacent, non-neoplastic tissues. In particular, the gain in chromosome 19 appeared to be highly important.",

She was negative for APC and MUTYH but showed a reciprocal balanced translocation t(5;7)(q22;p15) at chromosome analysis. FISH analysis using specific BAC probes demonstrated that 5q22 breakpoint disrupted the APC gene. Transcript analysis by MLPA and digital PCR revealed that the cytogenetic rearrangement involving the 3\u2032 end of the APC gene caused a defective expression of a truncated transcript. This result allowed cytogenetic analysis to be offered to all the other family members and segregation analysis clearly demonstrated that all the carriers were affected, whereas non-carriers did not have the polyposis. A cytogenetic approach permitted the identification of the mutation-causing disease in this family, and the segregation analysis together with the transcript study supported the pathogenetic role of this mutation. Karyotype analysis was used as a predictive test in all members of this family. This family suggests that clinically positive TS and FAP cases, which test negative with standard molecular analysis, could be easily and cost-effectively resolved by a classical and molecular cytogenetic approach.",

One frequent acquired abnormality is copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 6p (6p CN-LOH) involving the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus. We hypothesized that because 6p CN-LOH clones may arise from selective pressure to escape immune surveillance through deletion of HLA alleles, the development of 6p CN-LOH may affect response to IST. We used single nucleotide polymorphism array genotyping and targeted next-generation sequencing of HLA alleles to assess frequency of 6p CN-LOH, identity of HLA alleles lost through 6p CN-LOH, and impact of 6p CN-LOH on response to IST. 6p CN-LOH clones were present in 11.3% of patients, remained stable over time, and were not associated with development of MDS-defining cytogenetic abnormalities.

Herein, we present a case of papillary RCC (pRCC) incidentally discovered in a patient with ADPKD following bilateral native nephrectomy during renal transplantation. Whole exome sequencing of the pRCC found a somatic missense mutation in MET proto-oncogene, p.Val1110Ile, not present in kidney cyst epithelium or non-cystic tissue. RNA sequencing demonstrated increased mRNA expression of MET and pathway-related genes, but no significant copy number variation of MET was detected. Genetic analysis of PKD genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes and renal cyst epithelium identified a constitutional PKD1 germline mutation, p.Trp1582Ser, predicted to be pathogenic. Unique somatic mutations in PKD1 were also detected in 80% of the renal cysts analyzed, but not in the pRCC. These results suggest that, in this patient, the pRCC utilized a signaling pathway involving MET that was distinct from the pathogenesis of ADPKD. This is the first report of PKD1 mutations and a somatic mutation of the MET oncogene in a pRCC in ADPKD.",

     "abstract": "Lipoblastoma is a benign myxoid neoplasm arising in young children that typically demonstrates adipose differentiation. It is often morphologically indistinguishable from primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumor of infancy (PMMTI), which is characterized by a well-circumscribed myxoid mass with a proliferation of primitive mesenchymal cells with mild cytologic atypia. PMMTI occurs in the first year of life and is known to have locally aggressive behavior. No specific genetic rearrangements have been reported to date. In contrast, the presence of PLAG1 (Pleomorphic Adenoma Gene 1) rearrangement is diagnostic for lipoblastoma. We hereby demonstrate the combined application of multiple approaches to tackle the diagnostic challenges of a rapidly growing neck tumor in a 3-month-old female. An incisional tumor biopsy had features of an undifferentiated, myxoid mesenchymal neoplasm mimicking PMMTI. However, tumor cells showed diffuse nuclear expression by immunohistochemical (IHC) stain. Conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses as well as next generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated evidence of PLAG1 rearrangement, confirming the diagnosis of lipoblastoma. This experience warrants that undifferentiated myxoid lipoblastoma can mimic PMMTI, and the combination of cytogenetic and molecular approaches is essential to distinguish these two myxoid neoplasms. Literature on lipoblastomas with relevant molecular and cytogenetic findings is summarized. Our case is the first lipoblastoma diagnosed with a PLAG1 fusion defined by NGS technology.",

Evaluation of the potential prognostic value of the TNFAIP3-SNP in esophageal cancer (EC) was the aim of this study. A total of 158 patients underwent complete surgical resection of the esophagus for EC. None of them received any neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment.

Four specimen types were processed on three different microarray platforms\u2014from Affymetrix, Agilent, and Illumina. Each microarray platform was employed at two independent test sites. The results were compared in a blinded manner with current standard methods, including karyotype, FISH, or morphology.

The ANN model for disease prediction showed significant predictability associated with GCPII variants toward breast cancer (area under the curve (AUC): 1.00) and prostate cancer (AUC: 0.97), with clear distinguishing ability of healthy controls (AUC: 0.96). The ANN models for the expression of FOLH1 and PSMA explained 60.5% and 86.7% of the variability, respectively. Thus, GCPII variants are potential contributors of risk toward breast cancer and prostate cancer. Risk modulation appeared to be mediated through changes in the expression of FOLH1 and PSMA.",

Genetic testing plays an important role in the establishment of high-risk PDAC research clinics by delineating those individuals who would benefit from screening protocols. We retrospectively examined patients referred for PDAC-related genetic testing from January 2009 to June 2014. Patients were referred for a personal and/or family history of PDAC or a questioned diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis (HP). Of the 75 referred patients, 36 underwent testing, of which 11 (31%) were mutation-positive. In total, 36% of patients with chronic pancreatitis carried a mutation, 11% of patients with a family history of PDAC carried a mutation, and 20% of patients with a personal history of PDAC carried a mutation. The most common barrier to testing was lack of insurance coverage. Genetic testing yields a suitable number of mutation-positive individuals who may benefit from increased screening. Subjects with possible HP yielded the highest positive rate. Individuals with idiopathic pancreatitis, onset of pancreatitis before the age of 30 years, and those with a family history of PDAC should be considered for testing. Sub-optimal insurance coverage remains a major deterrent to obtaining testing.",

We set out to confirm the role of CDKN1B mutations and copy number variants (CNVs) in primary SBNETs, and whether these are also found in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Genomic DNA was isolated from 90 primary SBNETs and 67 PNETs. Coding exons of CDKN1B were amplified by PCR and sequenced. CNV analysis was performed by quantitative PCR, p27 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. In SBNETS, three frameshifts, one missense mutation, and three CNVs were observed. The total rate of CDKN1B alterations was 7.0% (6 of 86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.2-4.4%). The frameshift rate was 3.5% (95% CI 1.1-9.8%).

Pediatric adipose tumors are mainly represented by lipomas, though only 28 cytogenetic descriptions of pediatric lipoma have been reported to date. Similar to adult cases, most of these pediatric lipomas harbored rearrangements of the chromosomal regions 12q14\u2013q15 and 6p21, involving the HMGA2 and HMGA1 genes. Further cytogenetic studies of pediatric lipoma would be useful to determinate whether some partner genes of HMGA2, such as NFIB, may have a specific role in the early onset of these tumors. Cytogenetically, the best documented pediatric adipose tumor is lipoblastoma, which is the second most frequent adipose tumor in children. Chromosomal alterations in lipoblastoma, observed in 61% of cases studied by conventional cytogenetics, typically involve the 8q11\u2013q12 region. The target gene of this rearrangement is PLAG1. Anomalies of PLAG1 have been observed in 70% of cases of pediatric adipose tumors studied by molecular cytogenetics methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or comparative genomic hybridization on array (array-CGH). The rare described cases of malignant pediatric adipose tumors in children are mostly myxoid liposarcomas. In the 27 cases explored at the genetic level, all pediatric myxoid liposarcomas showed the classical rearrangement of the DDIT3 gene at 12q13. In conclusion, the epidemiology and the prevalence of histological types of adipose tissue tumors differ in the pediatric population compared with adults, whereas chromosomal and genic rearrangements are similar to those of adult cases in each histological type.",

DNA sequence analysis revealed no evidence for an inherited mutation of BAP1. Sequence analysis of other potentially relevant genes, including TP53, CDKN2A, and BARD1, also revealed no mutation. DNA microarray analysis of tissue from two mesotheliomas revealed multiple genomic imbalances, including consistent losses of overlapping segments in 2q, 6q, 9p, 14q, 15q, and 22q, but no losses of chromosome 3 harboring the BAP1 locus. However, the results of immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated loss of nuclear BAP1 staining in three of six mesotheliomas tested, suggesting that somatic alterations of BAP1 occurred in a subset of tumors from this family. Since mesothelioma could be confirmed in only a single generation, domestic exposure to asbestos may be the predominant cause of mesothelioma in this family. Given the existence of unspecified malignant pleural tumors and lung cancers in a prior generation, we discuss the possibility that some other tumor susceptibility or modifier gene(s) may contribute to the high incidence of mesothelioma in this family. Because the incidence of mesothelioma in this family is higher than that expected even in workers heavily exposed to asbestos, we conclude that both asbestos exposure and genetic factors have played a role in the high rate of mesothelioma and potentially other pleural or lung cancers seen in this family.",

Therefore, to reduce artificial C:G\u2009>\u2009T:A SNVs in amplicon-based MPS using FFPE DNA, we evaluated the efficacy of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) pretreatment, which can eliminate uracil-containing DNA molecules, with 126 archived FFPE esophageal cancer specimens. We also examined the association between the frequency of C:G\u2009>\u2009T:A SNVs and DNA quality, as assessed by a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay. UDG pretreatment significantly lowered the frequency of C:G\u2009>\u2009T:A SNVs in highly fragmented DNA (by approximately 60%). This effect was not observed for good- to moderate-quality DNA, suggesting that a predictive assay (i.e., DNA quality assessment) needs to be performed prior to UDG pretreatment. These results suggest that UDG pretreatment is efficacious for mutation testing by amplicon-based MPS with fragmented DNA from FFPE samples.",

A set of 238 tumors were subjected to clinical targeted NGS across all exons of 27 genes. There were 120 actionable variants in 109 cases, occurring in the genes KRAS, EGFR, PTEN, PIK3CA, KIT, BRAF, NRAS, IDH1, and JAK2. Sequencing results for each tumor were modeled as a dichotomized genotype (actionable mutation detected or not detected) for each of the 27 genes. Based upon the entropy of these genotypes, sequencing was most informative for colorectal cancer (3.235 bits of information/case) followed by high grade glioma (2.938 bits), lung cancer (2.197 bits), pancreatic cancer (1.339 bits), and sarcoma/STTs (1.289 bits). In the most informative cancer types, the information content of NGS was similar to surgical pathology examination (modeled at approximately 2\u20133 bits). Entropy provides a novel measure of utility for laboratory testing in general and for NGS in particular. This metric is, however, purely analytical and does not capture the relative clinical significance of the identified variants, which may also differ across tumor types.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement in 83% of interphase cells. The KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1 gene rearrangement was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We suggest that the pathogenesis of BPDCN could be associated with KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement (especially with KMT2A (MLL)-MLLT1) and further study on a larger number of cases is needed.",

Recently, a surge in molecular studies of DIPG has occurred, in large part due to the increased availability of tumor tissue through donation of post-mortem specimens. These new discoveries have established DIPGs as biologically distinct from adult gliomas, harboring unique genomic aberrations. Mutations in histone encoding genes are shown to be associated with >70% of DIPG cases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of the tumorigenicity of these mutations remain elusive. Understanding the driving mutations and genomic landscape of DIPGs can now guide the development of targeted therapies for this incurable childhood cancer.",

Our data suggest that mutation rate, the pattern of copy number variations, and the mutational spectra in the BP-NET cell lines are more similar to the changes observed in small cell lung cancer than those found in primary BP-NET. Likewise, mutation rate and pattern including the absence of mutations in ATRX/DAXX, MEN1, and YY1 in the panNET cell lines BON1 and QGP1 suggest that these cell lines do not have the genetic signatures of a primary panNET.

Forty-five paired tumor-remission samples were genotyped on both platforms, and CNAs were estimated from total signal intensity and allelic contrast values using the allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors (ASCAT) algorithm.

A supervised learning algorithm was used to identify expression signatures capable of predicting pCR, and the predictive value of these signatures was validated using independent samples. We also evaluated the utility of previously published signatures in predicting complete response in our cohort. We identified 27 differentially expressed genes between patients with pCR and patients with incomplete responses to nCRT. Predictive gene signatures using subsets of these 27 differentially expressed genes peaked at 81.8% accuracy. However, signatures with the highest sensitivity showed poor specificity, and vice-versa, when applied in an independent set of patients. Testing previously published signatures on our cohort also showed poor predictive value.

In this study, exome sequencing was performed on four meningiomas and the corresponding peripheral blood DNA from a 61-year-old woman with sporadic multiple meningioma. At least three common mutational events (at the NF2, FAM109B, and TPRXL genes) were detected in the tumors' DNA when they were compared with the lymphocyte DNA from the patient as control.

Genetic alterations are widely recognized as the main drivers of oncogenic transformation. Of considerable interest are mutations affecting the writers of epigenetic marks. In this review, we focus on histone methyltransferases\u2014enzymes that catalyze the methylation of lysine residues in core histones. Histone methylation is a tightly controlled mechanism that is responsible for both activating as well as repressing gene expression in a site-specific manner, depending on which lysine residue is methylated. Histone methyltransferases, including MLL1, DOT1L, EZH2, and SETD2 are recurrently deregulated in human leukemia, either directly by gene mutations or balanced translocations, or indirectly as components of protein complexes that are disturbed in leukemia due to alterations of the other components in these complexes. Several small molecule inhibitors of histone methyltransferases are currently being clinically evaluated for their therapeutic potential in human leukemia. These drugs reverse some of the adverse effects of aberrant histone methylation, and can induce differentiation and cell death in leukemic blasts.",

Recent reports using massive parallel sequencing technologies have discovered additional cancer driver genes. PBRM1 was found to be mutated in about 40% of ccRCC tumors, whereas BAP1 and SETD2 were each mutated in about 10\u201315% of ccRCC tumors. JARID1C and UTX, two histone H3 demethylases, were also found to harbor mutations in ccRCC, albeit at lower rates. ccRCC tumors display a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity, with some mutations present in all cancer cells (ubiquitous), whereas others are subclonal. The VHL mutations were always ubiquitous in the tumors; PBRM1 mutations were also ubiquitous but to a lesser extent. On the contrary, mutations in BAP1, SETD2, JARID1C, and UTX were all subclonal, meaning that they were present in a subset of cancer cells in a tumor. The prognostic value of PBRM1 mutations in ccRCC is still controversial, whereas BAP1 mutations were tightly linked to worse clinical outcomes in multiple studies. The molecular functions of these newly identified cancer driver genes are discussed, and they were known readers, writers, or erasers of histone marks on histone H2 and H3 tails that are very close to each other, suggesting that these factors might functionally interact and affect common pathways. The studies on these newly identified tumor suppressors will shed light on ccRCC tumorigenesis and development, and will likely lead to development of novel therapeutic interventions for ccRCC patients.",

Herein, we show data obtained by novel transcriptomic and corresponding methylomic or proteomic analyses from cell lines treated with pharmacologic doses of respective inhibitors (i.e., simvastatin, ibandronate). Metabolic pathways and their epigenetic consequences appear to be affected by a changed concentration of NADPH. Moreover, since the mevalonate metabolism is part of a signaling network, including vitamin D metabolism or fatty acid synthesis, the epigenetic activity of associated pathways is also presented.

Using principal component analysis, we observed a distinct separation in methylation profiles between tumor and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissue. Tumors were generally hypomethylated compared with adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Of 1,906 CpG sites differentially methylated between tumor and nonmalignant tissue, 1,198 were within classically defined CpG islands where tumors were hypermethylated compared with nonmalignant tissue.

In addition, approximately 5% of individuals with schwannomatosis disease develop meningiomas, through mutation of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, SMARCB1. Recently, a second SWI/SNF complex subunit, SMARCE1, was identified as a cause of clear cell meningiomas, indicating a wider role for this complex in meningioma disease. The sonic hedgehog (SHH)-GLI1 signaling pathway gene, SUFU, has also been identified as the cause of hereditary multiple meningiomas in a large Finnish family.

     "abstract": "Mismigrating germ-cell progenitors have historically been accepted as the cell of origin for central nervous system (CNS) germinomas. However, an alternative hypothesis suggests that CNS germinomas arise from a brain-cell progenitor. Germinomas often acquire Kit signaling pathway mutations, and there is evidence for an oncogenic relationship between KIT and the ETV1 transcription factor. KIT appears to be necessary to stabilize ETV1, and ETV1 then activates oncogenesis-associated genes. ETV1 expression is not increased by KIT, so ETV1 already needs to be expressed in order for KIT to have an oncogenic function. Therefore, if brain-cell progenitors are the cell of origin for germinomas, those cells would already need to coexpress ETV1 and KIT. We examined Kit and Etv1 in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas, for mouse brain tissue at various stages of development. Both Kit and Etv1 were expressed in the regions where germinomas most commonly arise, and in the medulla oblongata. All human cases of germinomas correlated to the regions where ETV1 and KIT are coexpressed. We therefore postulate that germinomas in the brain share a similar mechanism with other KIT-driven cancers, which supports the hypothesis that germinomas arise from a brain-cell progenitor.",

The sequencing of all exons and exon\u2013intron junctions of the EXT1 and EXT2 genes from blood DNA of the proband did not reveal any mutation in the EXT1 gene but did demonstrate the presence of the transition point mutation c.67C\u00a0>\u00a0T in the EXT2 gene, determining the introduction of a stop codon in the coding sequence (p.Arg23*). A mutational analysis of other members of the family and the presence of osteochondromas in the metaphysis of long bones confirmed the diagnosis of hereditary multiple osteochondromas. Direct sequencing from DNA extracted from different sites of two tumor samples (a small rapidly growing osteochondroma and a giant peripheral secondary chondrosarcoma, each located at different chondrocostal junctions) revealed the loss of the germline EXT2 mutation. Analysis of microsatellite polymorphic markers in the 11p region harboring the EXT2 gene did not reveal any loss of heterozygosity. This observation supports a recent model of sarcomagenesis in which osteochondroma cells bear EXT homozygous inactivation, whereas chondrosarcoma-initiating cells are EXT-expressing cells.",

Four GWAS-identified SNPs of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), rs965513, rs944289, rs966423 and rs2439302, were genotyped in a case-control study of 838 patients with PTC and 501 patients with benign thyroid tumor (BTT) from the Chinese Han population. The associations between these SNPs, clinicopathologic features, and the outcome of the PTC patients were examined. The CT and CT\u00a0+\u00a0TT genotypes of rs966423 were more common in PTC patients with extrathyroidal extension and more advanced T stage. The TC and TC\u00a0+\u00a0CC genotypes and the C allele of rs944289 were significantly less frequent in patients with multifocal disease. No correlation was observed between GWAS-identified SNPs and disease persistence of PTC after a short-term follow-up. Significantly different allele distributions between the PTC and BTT groups were observed for all four selected SNPs. Individuals with more than five risk alleles were 8.84-fold (95% CI 3.23\u201324.17) more likely to suffer from PTC compared with those with zero or 1 risk allele. GWAS-identified SNPs affect the individual predisposition to PTC without interacting with existing Hashimoto thyroiditis and BTT lesions. GWAS-identified SNPs were associated with certain clinicopathologic features of PTC, and may contribute to identifying PTC patients with different clinical patterns.

An elderly woman with AML with an inv(2)(p23q13)/RANBP2-ALK and monosomy 7 was treated with crizotinib. After a short-term hematological response and the restoration of normal hematopoiesis, she experienced a relapse of AML. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using the ALK break-apart probe confirmed the inv(2)(p23q13), while G-banded karyotyping revealed the deletion of a segment of the short arm of chromosome 1 [del(1)(p13p22)] after crizotinib therapy. The ALK gene carried a heterozygous mutation at the nucleotide position g.716751G>C within exon 25, causing the p.G1269A amino acid substitution within the ALK-KD. Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that the mutated ALK allele was selectively transcribed and the mutation occurred in the ALK allele rearranged with RANBP2. As both the del(1)(p13p22) at the cytogenetic level and p.G1269A at the nucleotide level newly appeared after crizotinib treatment, it is likely that they were secondarily acquired alterations involved in crizotinib resistance.

Co-deletion of 1p/19q; and IDH1, CIC, and FUBP1 mutations, which are molecular signatures of adult oligodendrogliomas, are extremely rare in pODGs. In this report, two pODGs, one each of grade II and grade III, were evaluated using clinical, radiological, histopathologic, and follow-up methods. IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, and BRAF-V600\u00a0E mutations were analyzed by Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemical methods, and 1p/19q co-deletion was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. PDGFRA amplification, BRAF gain, intragenic duplication of FGFR-TKD, and KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (validated by Sanger sequencing) were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Notably, both cases showed the oncogenic KIAA1549_Ex15-BRAF_Ex9 fusion transcript. Further, immunohistochemical analysis showed activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in both of these cases. However, neither 1p/19q co-deletion; IDH1, TP53, CIC, H3F3A, nor BRAF-V600\u00a0E mutation; PDGFRA amplification; BRAF gain; nor duplication of FGFR-TKD was identified. Overall, this study highlights that pODGs can harbor the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion with aberrant MAPK/ERK signaling, and there exists an option of targeting these pathways in such patients. These results indicate that pODGs with the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion may represent a subset of this rare tumor that shares molecular and genetic features of pilocytic astrocytomas. These findings will increase our understanding of pODGs and may have clinical implications.",

Herein we present a case of AML with MYC amplification in marker chromosomes and a microdeletion of chromosome 7 below cytogenetic resolution. The karyotype of the patient's bone marrow aspirate showed three to five marker chromosomes in all dividing cells without other structural or numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for the human MYC gene revealed amplification of the oncogene localized to the marker chromosomes. Using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis, an approximately 4.4\u00a0Mb amplicon containing the MYC gene was identified with an estimated amplification of about 30 copies per leukemic cell and, thus, an average of about 8 copies per marker chromosome. A 6.4\u00a0Mb hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 7 within band q36.1 was also found by SNP microarray analysis in a cellular-equivalent dosage of 50%. The microdeletion spans multiple genes, including EZH2, a gene with well-known cancer association. No mutation was found in the remaining EZH2 allele by next generation gene sequencing. The combination of MYC amplification and EZH2 deletion, which has not been described previously in AML, may suggest a synergistic role of the two oncogenes in the pathogenesis of the patient's acute leukemia.",

Microarray data were first analyzed by the individual laboratories with their respective software systems; raw data files were then centrally validated using NEXUS software. The results demonstrated the added value of integrating multi-platform data with cytogenetic and FISH data and highlight novel findings identified by array including the co-occurrence of low and high risk abnormalities not previously reported to coexist within a clone, novel regions of chromosomal amplification, clones characterized by numerous whole chromosome LOH that do not meet criteria for doubling of a near-haploid, and characterization of array profiles associated with an IKZF1 deletion.

We investigated the association between lung cancer risk and potentially functional polymorphisms of XRCC1 that were selected using RegulomeDB in a Korean population. A total of 185 polymorphisms of XRCC1 were evaluated using RegulomeDB. Strong evidence suggested that 10 polymorphisms, from among the 185, affected XRCC1 expression with scores of 1a\u20131f that were based on the RegulomeDB scoring system. The rs2854510 polymorphism was rare in Asians (minor allele frequency\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Eight polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). The rs2854509 polymorphism, which was one of the 8 polymorphisms in LD, and rs7248167, which was not in the LD block, were genotyped in 610 lung cancer patients and 607 age- and sex-matched controls.

Dysregulation of specific MAGE genes correlated with reduced overall survival in four cancer types (brain low grade gliomas, renal clear cell carcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, and uterine corpus endometrioid carcinomas), with weaker correlations in four additional cancer types. This study demonstrates (1) the value of cancer-germline antigen expression profiling as a complement to mutation analysis for prognosis in cancer; (2) that over-expression of MAGE genes in a subset of cancers is associated with reduced survival; and (3) that patterns of MAGE expression could inform individualized treatment in cancer.",

All patients were from Finland, a country known for its genetically homogenous population. We searched for rare nonsynonymous variants with allele frequencies below 0.1% in 3,374 Finnish and 58,112 non-Finnish controls. In addition, homozygous and compound heterozygous variants were studied. No genes with rare loss-of-function variants were present in more than one early-onset CRC patient.

Five genes with homozygous variants in early-onset CRC cases were found (MCTP2, ARHGAP12, ATM, DONSON, and ROS1), including one gene (MCTP2) with a homozygous splice site variant. All discovered homozygous variants were exclusive to one early-onset CRC case. Independent replication is required to associate the discovered variants with CRC. These findings, together with a lack of family history in 19 of 22 (86%) early-onset patients, suggest genetic heterogeneity in unexplained early-onset CRC patients, thus emphasizing the requirement for large sample sizes and careful study designs to elucidate the role of rare variants in CRC susceptibility.",

Esophageal adenocarcinoma and extensive polyposis/ganglioneuromatosis could represent less common features of these syndromes, potentially correlating with this novel PTEN frameshift and early protein termination genotype. Alternatively, because simultaneous disruption of both the PTEN and TGF-\u03b2/SMAD4 pathways is associated with development of esophageal cancer in a mouse model and because SMAD4 mutations cause gastrointestinal hamartomas in juvenile polyposis syndrome, the SMAD7 mutation may represent an additional modifier of these individuals' PTEN-mutant phenotype.",

To date, all genetic modifiers in LFS have been shown to map to either TP53 or its principal negative regulator, MDM2. Given this strong association, we set out to investigate the contribution of miR-605, a recently described microRNA (miRNA) regulator of the p53-MDM2 loop. We hypothesized that, if functional, the miR-605 gene and its variant (rs2043556) could impact the cancer risk profile of TP53 mutation carriers. Consistent with this proposition, the variant G-allele of miR-605 was associated with a 10-year acceleration in the mean age of LFS tumor onset (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and caused a 2.6-fold reduction in the processing levels of its host miRNA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We also demonstrate that miR-605 overexpression leads to a decrease in cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and migration in two rhabdomyosaroma cell lines carrying hotspot TP53 mutations.

Moreover, we employed lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock down ZFX expression in two human renal cell carcinoma cell lines, 786-0 and ACHN. Functional analysis indicated that ZFX silencing significantly inhibited renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, probably because of suppression of CDK4 and cyclin D1, and induced apoptosis via activation of Bax, Caspase 3, and PUMA in a p53-dependent manner.

Normalization, segmentation, and identification of corresponding CNAs for meta-analysis was achieved using established commercial software. Unsupervised analysis identified five genomic subgroups in which approximately 90% of the samples were characterized by abnormal profiles with gains of 8q. The most common loss was 8p (NKX3.1). The CNA distribution in other genomic subgroups was characterized by losses at 2q, 3p, 5q, 6q, 13q, 16q, 17p, 18q, and PTEN (10q), and acquisition of 21q deletions associated with the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion rearrangement. Parallel analysis of advanced and primary tumors in the cohort indicated that genomic deletions of PTEN and the gene fusion were enriched in advanced disease. A supervised analysis of the PTEN deletion and the fusion gene showed that PTEN deletion was sufficient to impose higher levels of CNA. Moreover, the overall percentage of the genome altered was significantly higher when PTEN was deleted, suggesting that this important genomic subgroup was likely characterized by intrinsic chromosomal instability. Predicted alterations in expression levels of candidate genes in each of the recurrent CNA regions characteristic of each subgroup showed that signaling networks associated with cancer progression and genome stability were likely to be perturbed at the highest level in the PTEN deleted genomic subgroup.",

Concurrent B-ALL with MPN is uncommon except in the presence of abnormalities of the PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 genes or the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. Herein, we describe a rare concurrence, B-ALL with MPN without the aforementioned genetic aberrations, in a 64-year-old male patient. The patient was initially diagnosed with B-ALL with normal karyotype and responded well to aggressive chemotherapy but had sustained leukocytosis and splenomegaly. The posttreatment restaging bone marrow was free of B-ALL but remained hypercellular with myeloid predominance. Using a single nucleotide polymorphism microarray study, we identified a copy neutral loss of heterozygosity at the terminus of 1p in the bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis and again at remission, 49% and 100%, respectively. Several additional genetic abnormalities were present in the initial marrow sample but not in the remission marrow samples. Retrospective molecular studies detected a MPL W515S homozygous mutation in both the initial and remission marrows for B-ALL, at 30\u201340% and 80% dosage effect, respectively. In summary, we present a case of concurrent B-ALL and MPN and demonstrate a stepwise cytogenetic and molecular approach to the final diagnosis.",

The frequency of MSH6 mutation carriers among patients presenting with MSI-L colorectal cancer has yet to be determined, as has the appropriate genetic workup in this context. We have reviewed here the clinicopathologic characteristics, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing results for 71 patients at a single institution diagnosed with MSI-L colorectal cancers. Of 71 patients with MSI-L tumors, 21 underwent genetic testing for MSH6 mutations, three of whom presented with loss of staining of MSH6 and only one of whom carried a pathogenic germline MSH6 mutation in exon 4 (c.2677_2678delCT; p.Leu893Alafs*6). This latter patient had a significant family history of cancer and had a rectal primary tumor that showed instability only in mononucleotide markers. In this cohort of MSI-L patients, we detected no notable clinicopathologic or molecular characteristic that would help to distinguish a group most likely to harbor germline MSH6 mutations. Therefore, we conclude that the prevalence of MSH6 mutations among patients with MSI-L tumors is very low. Microsatellite instability analysis combined with immunohistochemistry of mismatch repair proteins adequately detects potential MSH6 mutation carriers among MSI-L colorectal cancers.",

The analyzed data was obtained during routine molecular and cytogenetic treatment monitoring, using G-banded trypsin and Giemsa stain (GTG) karyotyping and reverse transcription quantitative PCR.

They were established as an underlying cause of the tumor suppressor syndrome schwannomatosis in 2008. There is a much higher rate of mutation detection in familial disease than in sporadic disease. We have performed extensive genetic testing on a cohort of familial and sporadic patients who fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis. In our updated cohort, we identified novel mutations within the SMARCB1 gene as well as several recurrent mutations. Of the schwannomatosis screens reported to date, including those in our updated cohort, SMARCB1 mutations have been found in 45% of familial probands and 9% of sporadic patients. The exon 1 mutation, c.41C>A p.Pro14His (10% in our series), and the 3\u2032 untranslated region mutation, c.*82C>T (27%), are the most common changes reported in patients with schwannomatosis to date, indicating the presence of mutation hot spots at both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 portions of the gene. Comparison with germline SMARCB1 mutations in patients with rhabdoid tumors showed that the schwannomatosis mutations were significantly more likely to occur at either end of the gene and be nontruncating mutations (P < 0.0001). SMARCB1 mutations are found in a significant proportion of schwannomatosis patients, and an even higher proportion of rhabdoid patients. Whereas SMARCB1 alone seems to account for rhabdoid disease, there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity in schwannomatosis even for familial disease. There is a clear genotype\u2013phenotype correlation, with germline rhabdoid mutations being significantly more likely to be centrally placed, involve multiple exon deletions, and be truncating mutations.",

As this inactivation usually results in loss of SMARCB1 expression, detectable by an antibody against the SMARCB1 protein, the accurate diagnosis of a rhabdoid tumor may be more distinctly and frequently made. Several reports on rhabdoid tumors presenting in various anatomic sites outside the kidneys and CNS are on record. We report two cases of rhabdoid tumors originating in the heart (cardiac tissue), which were entered into the European Rhabdoid Registry (EU-RHAB). The first case presented with intracardial and -cranial lesions as well as malignant ascites, while the second patient demonstrated an isolated cardiac tumor. This induced a different therapeutic approach and subsequently different clinical course (death 7 weeks after diagnosis in patient 1).

Thus, the diagnosis is challenging. We report two cases of pediatric SMARCB1-deficient tumors from the clivus that illustrate the diagnostic difficulties. Both cases were strongly positive for epithelial markers associated with loss of BAF47 (INI1) expression, and were negative for S100 and CD34. Molecular analyses of the SMARCB1 gene found a deletion of all nine exons in both cases. In the first case, a 5-year-old girl presented with a thoracic metastasis of a clival tumor, which was diagnosed as MRT and treated accordingly. The morphological findings and the expression of brachyury would favor the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated chordoma. The second case was a quickly fatal clival tumor in a 2-year-old boy: This tumor was morphologically undifferentiated and raises the problem of differential diagnosis between an MRT, a malignant myoepithelial tumor, or an undifferentiated chordoma due to the location and the expression of brachyury.

HOX genes are transcription factors that play a pivotal role in anterior\u2013posterior body axis patterning and are misexpressed in tumors such as lung carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and glioma. HOX genes are also known to be associated with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as HOTAIR, which induces transcriptional silencing of the HOXD locus by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 to the HOXD locus. In this study, transcriptome analysis using the nanoString platform was performed, and expression of the HOX and HOTAIR genes was studied in pediatric tumors: 20 ATRTs, 10 ependymomas, 10 medulloblastomas, six glioblastoma multiforme, and nine juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas (JPAs). Results indicate that in ATRTs, medulloblastomas, and JPAs, the HOTAIR and HOXC genes are highly expressed; however, HOXD8\u201310 genes are not silenced.

Poor survival rates (28% in CNS tumors) may be attributed to the aggressive biology as well as specific therapeutic limitations innate to the young age of affected patients. Our patient developed synchronous congenital tumors: an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) localized in the right lateral ventricle of the brain and a malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) in the soft tissue of the right orbit. A de novo germline chromosomal deletion in 22q encompassing the SMARCB1 gene was detected, prompting the diagnosis of a de novo rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome 1 (RTPS1). The patient was reported to the European Rhabdoid Registry (EU-RHAB) and treated according to the Rhabdoid 2007 recommendation. Despite the very young age of the patient, the initially desperate situation of RTPS1, and the synchronous localization of congenital rhabdoid tumors, intensive chemotherapy was well tolerated; the child is still in complete remission 5 years following diagnosis. In conclusion, RTPS1 with congenital synchronous MRTs is not necessarily associated with a detrimental outcome. Intensive multidrug chemotherapy, including high dose chemotherapy, may be feasible and justified.",

A highly active interleukin 6 (IL-6)/glycoprotein 130 (gp130)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway has been identified in a subset of primary lung cancer and closely correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. In a previous study, the frequent occurrence of somatic gain-of-function mutations was observed in the gp130-encoding IL6ST gene in exon 6 in 60% of inflammatory hepatocellular adenomas. Prompted by this finding, we assessed 110 Chinese lung carcinomas using PCR and direct DNA sequencing but found no somatic mutation of IL6ST in exon 6. However, one new potential germline missense mutation c.599C>G was identified in one adenocarcinoma that harbors wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS. Protein modeling analysis showed that this mutation might not affect the gp130 protein conformation. Moreover, activated STAT3 was observed in most of the lung tumor tissues at a higher level than that in matched normal lung tissues. In conclusion, the c.599C>G\u00a0mutation may be a new single nucleotide polymorphism of IL6ST, but mutations in exon 6 of this gene are not apparently common genetic variations occurring and leading to constitutive activation of STAT3 in lung cancer.",

Alternatively, microarray analysis provides whole genome data, detecting partial chromosome loss, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or abnormalities unrepresented by FISH probes. Nonfixed frozen tissue is conventionally used for microarray analysis but may not always be available. We assessed the feasibility of genomic microarray analysis for high resolution interrogation of UVM using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) as an alternative to frozen tissue (FZT). Enucleations from 44 patients (clinical trial NCT00952939) yielded sufficient DNA from FFPET (n = 34) and/or frozen tissue (n = 41) for comparative genomic hybridization and select single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (CGH/SNP) on Roche-NimbleGen OncoChip arrays. CEP3 FISH analysis was performed on matched cytology ThinPrep material. CGH/SNP analysis was successful in 30 of 34 FFPET and 41 of 41 FZT samples. Of 27 paired FFPET/FZT samples, 26 (96.3%) were concordant for at least four of six major recurrent abnormalities (-3, +8q, -1p, +6p, -6q, -8p), and 25 of 27 (92.6%) were concordant for -3. Results of CGH/SNP were concordant with the CEP3 FISH results in 27 of 30 (90%) FFPET and 38 of 41 (92.6%) FZT cases; partial -3q was detected in two CEP3 FISH\u2013negative cases and whole chromosome 3, 4, and 6 SNP-LOH in one case. CGH detection of -3, +8q, -8p on FFPET and FZT showed significant correlation with the clinical outcome measures (metastasis development, time to progression, survival). Results of the UVM genotyping by CGH/SNP on FFPET are highly concordant with those of the FZT analysis and with those of the CEP3 FISH analysis, and therefore CGH/SNP is a practical method for UVM prognostication.

The aims of this study were to (i) validate CLL-FISH testing among the BC cytogenetic laboratories to ensure standardization of results and (ii) characterize population-level CLL-FISH abnormalities by pooling provincial data. From 2004 to 2011, 585 consecutive patients underwent pretreatment CLL-FISH testing at laboratory A (50.1%), laboratory B (32.3%), or laboratory C (17.6%). For validation purposes, 26 CLL-FISH abnormalities were tested by each laboratory's protocol, with 91% result concordance. Discordant results involved percent abnormalities at or near cutoff values; therefore, a 10% universal cutoff was established when pooling results. Applying the universal cutoff to the provincial cohort, CLL-FISH abnormalities were detected in 74.9%: 54.9% 13q-, 18.8% +12, 8.5% 11q-, and 7.7% 17p-. In this large population-based cohort of patients referred for CLL-FISH testing, frequencies of abnormalities detected by FISH analysis were highly consistent with those reported in single-institution and clinical trial populations.

Our main objective was to determine the DLX4 copy number status in sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis to assess its involvement in the initial stages of the axillary metastatic process. A total of 37 paired samples of SLN metastasis and primary breast tumors (PBT) were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and array comparative genomic hybridization assays. DLX4 increased copy number was observed in 21.6% of the PBT and 24.3% of the SLN metastasis; regression analysis demonstrated that the DLX4 alterations observed in the SLN metastasis were dependent on the ones in the PBT, indicating that they occur in the primary tumor cell populations and are maintained in the early axillary metastatic site. In addition, regression analysis demonstrated that DLX4 alterations (and other DLX and HOXB family members) occurred independently of the ones in the HER2/NEU gene, the main amplification driver on the 17q region. Additional studies evaluating DLX4 copy number in non-SLN axillary lymph nodes and/or distant breast cancer metastasis are necessary to determine if these alterations are carried on and maintained during more advanced stages of tumor progression and if could be used as a predictive marker for axillary involvement.",

Losses at 9p and 9q appeared to be hallmarks of metachronous BM events, whereas an absence of detectable chromosomal changes at 3p was often associated with synchronous BM events. Correspondingly, k-means clustering showed that cluster 1 cases generally exhibited low copy number chromosomal changes that did not involve 3p. Cluster 2 cases had a high occurrence of \u20139p/\u20139q (94\u201398%) deletions, whereas cluster 3 cases had a higher frequency of copy number changes, including loss at chromosome 14 (80%). The higher number of synchronous cases in cluster 1 was also associated with a significantly shorter RFS-BM compared with clusters 2 and 3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Conversely, a significantly longer RFS-BM was observed for cluster 2 versus clusters 1 and 3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of miR-21 in NSCLC sensitivity to DDP in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect miR-21 expression in lung cancer cell lines.

Finally, the effect of miR-21 downregulation on in\u00a0vivo sensitivity of A549 cells to DDP was determined in BALB/c nude mice. miR-21 expression was significantly higher in A549 than in other lung cancer cell lines. LNA-based knockdown of miR-21 significantly inhibited growth and induced death in A549 cells, possibly via apoptotic signaling.

To investigate whether the BTG1 deletions occur in other BCR-ABL1\u2013positive acute leukemias besides BCP-ALL, we analyzed 44 leukemia cases harboring the BCR-ABL1 transcript [32 BCP-ALL, six mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and six chronic myeloid leukemia in B-lineage blast crisis (CML-BC)] by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and reverse transcription\u2013PCR.

Of note, the intragenic deletion breakpoints, mapping to 5 different positions at the proximal end of the breakpoint, clustered tightly within exon 2 of BTG1, which were located within a stretch of 20 bp from nucleotide 284 to nucleotide 304 and led to truncated BTG1 transcripts. There were no significant differences in the median white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, bone marrow blast count, sex, age, or overall complete remission rate between patients with and without BTG1 deletions.

Nineteen of 56 low grade gliomas (LGGs) demonstrated a duplication in 7q34, which resulted in a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Chromosome band 7q34 deletions, which resulted in a FAM131B-BRAF fusion, were identified in one pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) and one dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). One ganglioglioma (GG) demonstrated a 6q23.3q26 deletion that was predicted to result in a MYB-QKI fusion. Gains of chromosomes 5, 6, 7, 11, and 20 were seen in a subset of LGGs. Monosomy 6, deletion of 9q and 10q, and an i(17)(q10) were each detected in the medulloblastomas (MBs). Deletions and regions of loss of heterozygosity that encompassed TP53, RB1, CDKN2A/B, CHEK2, NF1, and NF2 were identified in a variety of tumors, which led to a recommendation for germline testing. A BRAF p.Thr599dup or p.V600E mutation was identified by Sanger sequencing in one and five gliomas, respectively, and a somatic TP53 mutation was identified in a fibrillary astrocytoma. No TP53 hot-spot mutations were detected in the MBs.

The majority were older males between the ages of 63\u221293 years. The underlying bone marrow pathologic diagnoses ranged from no diagnostic features of malignancy to AML. Our data suggest that isolated trisomy 2 could represent an age-related phenomenon since all 11 cases were age 63 and over. It appears that isolated trisomy 2 harbors little prognostic significance and that, instead, the prognostic significance is driven by the underlying pathologic diagnosis. For example, whereas 3 of the cases with AML survived only 7\u221210 weeks post\u2212bone marrow biopsy, 1 of the cases without diagnostic features of malignancy survived 10 additional years.

The presence of palindromic AT-rich repeats (PATRRs) at the translocation breakpoints suggested a palindrome-mediated mechanism in the generation of several recurrent constitutional rearrangements: the t(11;22), t(17;22), and t(8;22). To date, all reported PATRR-mediated translocations include the PATRR on chromosome 22 (PATRR22) as a translocation partner. Here, the constitutional rearrangement, t(3;8)(p14.2;q24.1), segregating with renal cell carcinoma in two families, is examined. The chromosome 8 breakpoint lies in PATRR8 in the first intron of the RNF139 (TRC8) gene, whereas the chromosome 3 breakpoint is located in an AT-rich palindromic sequence in intron 3 of the FHIT gene (PATRR3). Thus, the t(3;8) is the first PATRR-mediated, recurrent, constitutional translocation that does not involve PATRR22. Furthermore, we detect de novo translocations similar to the t(11;22) and t(8;22), involving PATRR3 in normal sperm. The breakpoint on chromosome 3 is in proximity to FRA3B, the most common fragile site in the human genome and a site of frequent deletions in tumor cells. However, the lack of involvement of PATRR3 sequence in numerous FRA3B-related deletions suggests that there are several different DNA sequence\u2013based etiologies responsible for chromosome 3p14.2 genomic rearrangements.",

These loci included 153 genes, with 65% located at 22q11-q13. Oncostatin M signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway was the most relevant pathway, with immunohistochemical staining showing that OSM and LIF, both included in this pathway, were overexpressed in tumors. Copy number gains at 5p15.33 and 22q13.33 were correlated with early systemic recurrence in the bile duct cancer patients. In conclusion, copy number gains at 22q11-q13 were the most frequent and were correlated with poor disease-free survival.

Approximately 10% of all cases occur in families with an inherited predisposition for melanoma. In Sweden, only a minor portion of such melanoma families carry a mutation in the known melanoma gene CDKN2A, and there is a need to identify additional melanoma susceptibility genes. In a recently performed genome-wide linkage screen, novel loci with suggestive evidence of linkage to melanoma were detected. In this study, we have further analyzed one region on chromosome 3q29. In all, 89 affected and 15 nonaffected family members from 42 melanoma-prone families were genotyped for 34 genetic markers. In a pooled linkage analysis of all 42 families, we detected significant evidence of linkage, with a maximum heterogeneity logarithm of odds (HLOD) score of 3.1 with 83% of the families contributing to the linkage score. The minimum critical region of linkage (defined by a 1LOD score support interval) maps to chromosome 3q29, spans 3.5 Mb of genomic sequence, and harbors 44 identified genes. Sequence variants within this region have previously been associated with cancer susceptibility. This study reports the presence of a putative novel melanoma susceptibility locus in the Swedish population, a finding that needs to be replicated in an independent study on other individuals with familial melanoma.

Therefore, we sought to determine the role of FoxM1 in gastric cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The down-regulation of FoxM1 expression by the transfection of cells with FoxM1 siRNA decreased cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Moreover, the over-expression of FoxM1 promoted cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, which led to the acquisition of an EMT phenotype by up-regulating the protein expression of the mesenchymal cell markers ZEB1, ZEB2, and vimentin and by down-regulating the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin in gastric epithelial cells. More important, the depletion of FoxM1 levels in gastric cancer cells led to significant decreases in the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit, cyclin D1, Hes-1, VEGF, and EpCAM protein levels. Real-time PCR examination showed that the down-regulation of FoxM1 expression significantly inhibited vimentin and N-cadherin expression compared to that in control cells. Most important, cells transfected with FoxM1 siRNA displayed an elongated/irregular fibroblastoid morphology and reduction of the vimentin expression. Our current study strongly suggests that FoxM1 signaling has important roles in tumor cell aggressiveness through the acquisition of the EMT phenotype in gastric cancer cells.",

Although increased expression of the EVI1 gene is mainly caused by chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome band 3q26, where EVI1 is located, it can also be identified in cases without these rearrangements. The mechanisms that cause increased EVI1 expression in the absence of 3q26 rearrangements remain unclear. Here, we present four cases with increased EVI1 expression due to EVI1 amplification on cytogenetically cryptic double minutes (dmin). The dmin are small acentric chromosome structures and were observed in about 1% of AML\u00a0and MDS. We investigated the four cases by conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and array comparative genomic hybridization. Furthermore, EVI1 expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. By conventional chromosome analysis, the EVI1 dmin cannot be detected, due to the small size of the amplicons of 0.49\u20130.78 Mbp. Median % EVI1/ABL expression was 88.9% and therefore comparable to the median % EVI1/ABL expression of patients with EVI1 rearrangements. In conclusion, EVI1 amplification on cytogenetically cryptic dmin causes increased expression of EVI1 and is a new mechanism that causes increased EVI1 expression without a 3q26 rearrangement.",

These techniques require expertise, time, and funding and are not easily incorporated into the routine workflow of the cytogenetic laboratory. We have modified and refined the technique using fixed cell pellets to achieve nicely separated and easily identifiable PC. With immunostaining and subsequent FISH (i.e., cytoplasmic immunoglobulin FISH, cIg-FISH), this technique can be easily incorporated into every cytogenetic laboratory. Twenty samples from patients with MM were subjected to routine FISH, cIg-FISH, and chromosomal karyotyping and the results were compared.

Through this process, we identified limitations of insertion, deletion (indel), and single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection using standard approaches and described novel strategies to improve overall somatic mutation detection. Using these artificial data sets, we were able to demonstrate that NGS assays can have robust mutation detection if the data can be processed in a way that does not lead to large genomic alterations landing in the unmapped data (i.e., trash). By using these pipeline modifications and a new variant caller, AbsoluteVar, we have been able to validate SNV mutation detection to 100% sensitivity and specificity with an allele frequency as low 4% and detection of indels as large as 90 bp. Clinical validation of NGS relies on the ability for mutation detection across a wide array of genetic anomalies, and the utility of artificial data sets demonstrates a mechanism to intelligently test a vast array of mutation types.",

     "abstract": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase protein implicated in a variety of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Since the identification of the ALK gene in 1994 as the target of the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK has been proven a remarkably promiscuous oncogene. ALK contributes to the development of a notable assortment of tumor types from different lineages, including hematolymphoid, mesenchymal, epithelial and neural tumors, through a variety of genetic mechanisms: gene fusions, activating point mutations, and gene amplification. Recent developments led to significant diagnostic and therapeutic advances, including efficient diagnostic tests and ALK-targeting agents readily available in the clinical setting. This review addresses some therapeutic considerations of ALK-targeted agents and the biologic implications of ALK oncogenic promiscuity, but the main points discussed are: 1) the variety of mechanisms that result in activation of the ALK oncogene, with emphasis on the promiscuous partnerships demonstrated in chromosomal rearrangements; 2) the diversity of tumor types of different lineages in which ALK has been implicated as a pathogenic driver; and 3) the different diagnostic tests available to identify ALK-driven tumors, and their respective indications.",

     "abstract": "Immortalization is an important step toward the malignant transformation of human cells and is critically dependent upon telomere maintenance. Two mechanisms are known to maintain human telomeres. The process of telomere maintenance is either mediated through activation of the enzyme telomerase or through an alternative mechanism of telomere lengthening called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Whereas 85% of all human tumors show reactivation of telomerase, the remaining 15% are able to maintain telomeres via ALT. Telomerase inhibitors are already investigated in clinical trials, although the regulation as well as potential coexistence and redundancy of both telomere maintenance mechanisms during distinct steps of carcinogenesis are poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that telomerase activity and ALT alternate in a cell cycle dependent fashion in human esophageal epithelial cells, and can coexist in a genetically defined model of oral-esophageal squamous carcinogenesis. Moreover, we show that immortalized premalignant cells as well as cancer cells are able to switch from telomerase activation to ALT upon inhibition of telomerase. This indicates that cancer cells treated with telomerase inhibitors can use alternative and adaptive ways to maintain their telomeres and thereby escape telomere-based therapeutic strategies.",

Concomitant loss of normal chromosomes (i.e., 11 in patient 1 and 22 in patient 2) caused loss of the WT1 or EWSR1 wild-type allele. M-CGH identified other genomic imbalances: gain at chromosome 3 in both cases and chromosome 5 polysomy in patient 1. Common genomic events (i.e., trisomy 3 and extra EWSR1-WT1 and WT1-EWSR1 copies) probably contributed to disease pathogenesis and/or evolution of DSRCT. Our study demonstrated that an integrated molecular cytogenetic approach identified EWSR1-WT1 cooperating molecular events and genetic markers for prognosis.

The RHOV gene encodes the atypical Rho family GTPase Chp/RhoV, which is capable of transforming fibroblasts, although other functions of Chp remain largely elusive. RHOV is expressed in normal lung tissue in rats, but not in humans. RHOV expression was found in several human cancer cell lines, including non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549, but expression of RHOV in NSCLC tumors has never been investigated. Here we studied the expression of the RHOV gene in lung cancer cell lines and in 29 matched pairs of NSCLC tumors and adjacent nontumorous tissues. We found that RHOV is expressed in lung cancer cell lines and is upregulated in the majority of studied lung tumors. Analysis of the Oncomine database revealed correlation between elevated RHOV level and poor patient survival. We propose that the RHOV gene could be validated as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for NSCLC, and that observed overexpression of RHOV might contribute to tumorigenesis.",

Here, we compared the abnormality detection rate of clinically requested testing (i.e., G-banded chromosome analysis and FISH) with high-resolution oligo (i.e., array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/oligo hybrid (i.e., SNP-CGH) arrays in a series of patients, in an effort to assess the ability of newer technologies to overcome these limitations.

Evidence suggests that deregulated miRNA expression is associated with pancreatic cancer development. In this study, we analyzed the expression of several miRNAs in different types of pancreatic disease to determine if miRNA expression could aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its precursor, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm (PanIN). Pancreatic resection specimens were selected, which included PDAC (n = 16), benign pancreatic parenchyma from corresponding carcinoma cases (n = 16), chronic pancreatitis (n = 4), normal pancreatic parenchyma (n = 5), and PanIN (n = 5). The expression levels of five miRNA (miR-148a, miR-217, miR-21, miR-196a, and miR-10b) were assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Our data demonstrate that compared to the normal pancreatic parenchyma, miR-148a and miR-217 expression levels were down-regulated in PanIN, particularly in PanIN II-III and PDAC, whereas the level of miR-196 was significantly up-regulated in PDAC and its precursor, PanIN II-III. In addition, we observed that miR-21 was significantly overexpressed in PDAC, and miR-10b was highly expressed in PanIN II-III. Our study demonstrates that certain miRNAs, especially miR-148a, miR-217, and miR-196a, are significantly deregulated in PDAC, including in the early stage of PDAC. These markers can potentially be used as diagnostic markers to distinguish PDAC and its precursor from benign lesions.",

The mutagenic processes involved are believed to be activated in many nonlymphoid tissue types\u2014for example, initiating some cancers and/or leading to further somatic mutagenesis. To investigate the extent that codon context might be important in influencing the likely location of TP53 mutations in breast cancer, the codon-bias patterns resulting from the ssDNA target specificities of cytidine deaminases of the AID/APOBEC family were analyzed. The data indicate that codon context strongly influences the likely location of mutations at motifs for AID/APOBEC1/APOBEC3G, and at W A sites. An unexpected finding is a highly significant preference for transitions of cytosine to occur at the first nucleotide position and for transitions of guanosine to occur at the second nucleotide position in the mutated codon (read 3\u2032 to 5\u2032). Thus, the mechanisms involved appear to be sensitive to codon reading frames and to have an intrinsic ability to differentiate between the cytosines on the nontranscribed strand and those on the transcribed strand in the context of an open \u201ctranscription bubble.\u201d",

To study this ethnic influence, mononuclear cells were obtained from bone marrow samples from 143 patients with ALL. We performed RNA extraction and reverse transcription, then assessed the quality of the cDNA by amplifying the ABL1 control gene, and finally evaluated the presence of the four transcripts by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We found 10 patients who had the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (7%); 3 patients (2%) were TCF3-PBX1 positive; and 6 patients (4.5%) were ETV6-RUNX1 positive. The incidence of this last fusion gene is quite low when compared to the values reported in most countries. The low incidence of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene found in Guatemala matches the incidence rates that have been reported in Spain and Indian Romani. Since it is known that an ethnic resemblance exists among these three populations, as shown by ancestral marker studies, the ALL data suggests an ethnic influence on the occurrence and frequency of this particular fusion gene.",

It has been proposed that the multiple breakage events occur at a single point in time. Here we introduce the term anachromosome to describe an abnormal chromosome produced by chromothripsis. We report two cases of acute myeloid leukemia matching the description of chromothripsis that illustrate different aspects of this phenomenon from a cytogenetic perspective. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, including multicolor FISH and FISH for repeat elements that are not present on microarrays and that are resistant to sequencing, helped interpret the rearrangements but did not reveal their level of complexity. The anachromosomes conformed to the normal constraints of chromosome structure by including segments that provide two telomeres and a centromere. In patient samples, there are mixtures of cells with and without deletions. The deletion B allele frequencies for heterozygous loci in a mixture of cells with and without the deletions create a distinctive array pattern that is consistent with all the deletions in the anachromosomes having occurred concurrently. This evidence supporting the single-event hypothesis for chromothripsis has not previously been highlighted, to our knowledge. In the context of exploring mechanisms for chromosome shattering, we discuss a possible connection between chromosome pulverization and fragile sites. Understanding chromothripsis in the context of chromosome biology will help us identify its causes and consequences.",

Our purpose was to study whether epigenetic mechanisms were involved in the down-regulation of expression in gastric cancer. Expression analysis of SOSTDC1 in gastric cancer cell lines indicated mRNA down-regulation. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation studies using 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, and trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the down-regulation of SOSTC1 expression. Methylation analysis of the SOSTDC1 promoter CpGs using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed methylation in gastric cancer cell lines and tissue samples. A majority of tumors (17 of 18) with observed methylation exhibited down-regulation of mRNA expression relative to apparently normal gastric tissues. Immunoreactivity for SOSTDC1 in gastric tumors (24 of 46, 52.1%) was down-regulated relative to normal tissues (36 of 38, 94.7%) (P = 0.00001). The difference in expression between gastric tumor subtypes, intestinal and diffuse, was significant (P = 0.040). Expression of SOSTDC1 in gastric tumors increased the probability of both overall and disease-free survival. When overexpressed in AGS cells, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth was repressed. The present findings indicate SOSTDC1 down-regulation involves methylation; SOSTDC1 expression is a potential prognostic factor and tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.",

In this study, 34 tumors were screened by both FISH and aCGH. In all cases showing amplification by FISH, aCGH also unambiguously revealed the abnormality. The aCGH technique was also performed on tumors showing no amplification by FISH, and the absence of amplification was confirmed in all cases. Interestingly, one tumor showed a subclonal MYC amplification by FISH. This subclonal amplification was observed in approximately 20% of tumor cells and was clearly evident on aCGH. In conclusion, our analysis confirms that aCGH is as safe as FISH for the detection of MYC/MYCN gene amplification.

We evaluated two molecular methods to genotype this polymorphism.

The samples were tested for the FCGR3a polymorphism using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by melt curve analysis or by a standard TaqMan allelic discrimination assay using the ABI 7500 FAST real-time PCR instrument. With the TaqMan allelic discrimination assay, we found that 16 cases were the wild type genotype, homozygous phenylalanine (F/F), for the FCGR3a receptor, whereas two cases had the homozygous valine (V/V) polymorphism and eight cases were heterozygous with a V/F genotype. Results with the real-time PCR followed by melt curve analysis were similar for 25 cases; however, four samples did not have sufficient DNA for the melt curve analysis method, and the result from one sample was discordant. The new TaqMan assay offers several advantages over previously published assays, such as faster turnaround time and ease of interpretation.

     "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity that characterizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with survival times ranging from months to decades, reflects its biological diversity. Our understanding of the biology of CLL has helped us identify several markers of prognostic significance, by which CLL can be differentiated into several distinct diseases. The presence of specific chromosomal abnormalities is a prognostic indicator of disease progression and survival. Conventional cytogenetic analyses have revealed chromosomal aberrations in 40\u201350% of patients, but the detection of abnormalities is limited by the low mitotic activity of CLL cells. Metaphase analysis has recently undergone a \u201crevival\u201d because the metaphase yield has been improved by stimulation of CLL cells with alternative methods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization identifies chromosomal changes in approximately 80% of patients with CLL, and comparative genomic hybridization using high-density arrays (i.e., array comparative genomic hybridization [aCGH]) enables high-resolution genome-wide scanning for detecting copy number alterations in a single hybridization. The mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes identifies two subsets of CLL with different outcomes. Unfortunately, the determination of IGHV mutation status may not be practical in all laboratories, and for this reason characteristics that are correlated with IGHV mutation status are needed\u2014zeta-chain associated (TCR) protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) being that most commonly used currently in routine clinical practice. Whole genome sequencing has offered new insights into the mutational status of the disease, highlighting the role of several genes previously unrelated to CLL. Of these, NOTCH1 and SF3B1 are the most frequently mutated genes that predict poor prognosis. MicroRNA alterations are also involved in the initiation and progression of CLL, and the expression levels of some microRNAs correlate with previously established prognostic markers such as IGHV mutation status or ZAP-70. In addition, both global and gene-specific aberrant DNA methylation have been observed in CLL. Aberrant methylation has been described for genes that are specifically deregulated in CLL, such as BCL2, TCL1, and ZAP-70. Expanding knowledge of aberrant methylation profiles in CLL has a potential future impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response in CLL patients.",

This status change can be a consequence of the natural evolution of the tumor or can be induced by therapy. The HER2 gene status is, in the majority of cases, established at the moment of diagnosis. After chemotherapy, monitoring HER2 status can be a challenge because of ploidy changes induced by drugs. The cytogeneticist or the pathologist can face real difficulties in distinguishing between a true HER2 amplification and HER2 copy number increase by polyploidization. We performed a HER2 genetic examination by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of invasive breast cancers before and after taxane treatment. The majority of patients (91%) were HER2-negative both at diagnosis and after treatment. Thirty of 344 patients (9%) whose tumors were initially HER2-negative were found by FISH to have supernumerary HER2 gene copies (up to 15 copies) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This HER2 copy increase could not be attributed to true gene amplifications and instead reflected polyploidization events, which presumably affected all chromosomes. Indeed, when we used other FISH probes, we found other gene copy numbers to parallel those of HER2. We recommend careful checking of invasive breast carcinomas by supplementary FISH probes if the copy number of the HER2 gene is >6. This procedure allows the discrimination of specific HER2 gene amplifications and global increases in ploidy.",

The discovery of these subtypes suggests that molecular genetic tests are and will be useful, beyond classical histology, for the clinical classification of gliomas. While a familial susceptibility to glioma has been identified, only a small percentage of gliomas are thought to be due to single-gene hereditary cancer syndromes.

Of\u00a0the nine cases studied with a clone showing a del(20q) as the sole abnormality, 8\u00a0of 9 demonstrated loss of the D20S108 signals in non-plasma cells only and 5 of 9 had either a confirmed myeloid malignancy in addition to PCM or showed evidence of dysplastic changes in the marrow; however, of the 11 patients with a del(20q) within a complex PCM karyotype, 4\u00a0of 11 showed loss of the D20S108 signals in plasma cells only and 7 of 11 showed no significant loss in either plasma cells or non-plasma cells. Therefore, our results indicate that a del(20q) as the sole abnormality in PCM is present in non-plasma cells and, therefore, suggests the presence of an associated myeloid malignancy.",

Unfortunately, a small fraction of these patients develop secondary hematologic malignancies as a consequence of their exposure to genotoxic anti-cancer regimens. Most of these are myeloid malignancies, therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or myelodysplasia (t-MDS); however, a small but growing body of literature exists, which describes therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemias (t-ALL). Nearly all these cases are reportedly associated with translocations involving chromosome 11q23, the site of the MLL gene. We herein report two cases of ALL occurring after chemotherapy for other malignancies that showed complex karyotypic abnormalities and distinct MLL amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that both cases expressed a pro-B cell (CD10\u2212) phenotype with aberrant myeloid antigen expression.

Different genome-wide analysis techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), have been suggested for detecting chromosome segmental abnormalities. In this study, we compared the results of the two technologies in the analyses of the DNA of tumor samples from 91 neuroblastoma patients. Similar results were obtained with the two techniques for 75 samples (82%). In five cases (5.5%), the MLPA results were not interpretable.

The MLPA results showed that the 7p, 7q, and 14q chromosome arms were affected in six cases, while in two cases, 2p and 17q gains were observed; these results were confirmed by neither aCGH nor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Because of the higher sensitivity and specificity of genome-wide information, reasonable cost, and shorter time of aCGH analysis, we recommend the aCGH procedure for the analysis of genomic alterations in neuroblastoma.",

Recently, a PHAT with a similar t(1;10) was reported, suggesting a genetic link between MIFS/HFLT and PHAT. To ascertain whether PHAT is also associated with this translocation, two cases were subjected to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses.

Of the 99 mCRC patients, we studied differential miRNA expression by microarrays from primary tumors of 33 patients who had wild-type KRAS/BRAF and third- to sixth-line anti-EGFRmAb treatment, with/without irinotecan. We tested the association of each miRNA with overall survival (OS) by the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Significant miR-31* up-regulation and miR-592 down-regulation appeared in progressive disease versus disease control. miR-31* expression and down-regulation of its target genes SLC26A3 and ATN1 were verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Clustering of patients based on miRNA expression revealed a significant difference in OS between patient clusters. Members of the let-7 family showed significant up-regulation in the patient cluster with poor OS. Additionally, miR-140-5p up-regulation and miR-1224-5p down-regulation were significantly associated with poor OS in both cluster analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

However, the function of Ror2 in noncanonical Wnt signaling resulting in cancer metastasis is largely unknown. Here, we show that Ror2 expression is higher in the highly metastatic murine B16-BL6 melanoma cells than in the low metastatic variant B16 cells. Overexpression of Ror2 increases the metastasis ability of B16 cells, and knockdown of Ror2 reduces the migration ability of B16-BL6 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of Src kinase activity is critical for the Ror2-mediated cell migration upon Wnt5a treatment. The C-terminus of Ror2, which is deleted in brachydactyly type B (BDB), is essential for the mutual interaction with the SH1 domain of Src. Intriguingly, the Neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homologue (NRAGE), which, as we previously reported, can remodel the cellular skeleton and inhibit cell\u2013cell adhesion and metastasis of melanoma and pancreatic cancer, sharply blocks the interaction between Src and Ror2 and inhibits Ror2-mediated B16 cell migration by decreasing the activity of Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).

This study used high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization and a variety of informatics tools to aid in the identification of disease-associated genome-wide DNA copy number aberrations in canine and human OS. Our findings support and build upon the high level of cytogenetic complexity, through the identification of shared regions of microaberration (<500 kb) and functional analysis of possible orthologous OS-associated genes to pinpoint the cellular processes most commonly affected by aberration in human and canine OS. Aberrant regions contained previously reported genes such as CDC5L, MYC, RUNX2, and CDKN2A/CDKN2B, while expanding the gene of interest list to include ADAM15, CTC1, MEN1, CDK7, and others.

This study was performed on 643 individuals (249 CRC cases and 394 healthy controls). We selected five cancer-related genes (IL-16, CDKN2A (p16), RAF1, PTGER4, and ITGB4) and investigated the genotypes of the 3\u2032 untranslated region miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in these genes in our study population.

We found a statistically significant difference between the rs1131445 polymorphism of the IL-16 gene and CRC. The frequencies of the genotypes TT, CT, and CC in controls were 51%, 40.4%, and 8.6%, respectively, and in cases were 41.4%, 44.1%, and 14.5%, respectively, which shows a significant association between the CC genotype of the rs1131445 polymorphism and CRC (P = 0.004). The frequency of the C allele in the CRC group was higher than in the controls, and the C allele of the rs1131445 polymorphism was found to be in association with CRC (P = 0.009). These associations remained significant after Bonferroni's correction for multiple testing. We found that the AA genotype of the rs743554 polymorphism in the ITGB4 gene and the T allele of the rs1051208 polymorphism of the RAF1 gene were associated with the risk of CRC in females; however, after Bonferroni's correction we found that they were non-significant.

We evaluated the association between two polymorphisms (rs4645978 and rs4645981) of the CASP9 gene and the risk of breast cancer (BC). Genotypes and allelic frequencies for the two polymorphisms were determined in 261 patients with breast cancer and 480 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used, and statistical significance was determined by the \u03c72 test. Carriers of the rs4645978G allele (AG and GG genotypes) were at higher risk for BC than individuals with other genotypes (odds ratio (OR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07\u20132.37, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). The rs4645978GG genotype, in particular, was associated with the highest risk for BC development (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.45\u20133.49, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0003). Similarly, individuals with at least one rs4645981T allele were at a significantly increased risk of developing BC compared with those harboring the CC genotype (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.99\u20133.78, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and the risk of BC increased with increasing numbers of rs4645981T alleles (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.91\u20133.69, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for the CT genotype; OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.58\u20139.88, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004 for the TT genotype). The CASP9 promoter polymorphisms rs4645978 and rs4645981 are associated with BC susceptibility and suggest that CASP9 transcriptional regulation is an important factor during BC development.",

     "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene; this fusion gene is usually a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph+) chromosome, which results from the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Patients newly diagnosed with CML are routinely treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, the clinical course of the disease can vary, and this variance may be associated with genetic heterogeneity. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) technology is a powerful tool for identifying subtle genomic segmental alterations, which can result from either losses or gains of chromosomal material. These changes may reveal the presence of genes that play important roles in disease initiation or progression or in treatment outcomes. To investigate whether subtle somatic copy number changes (CNCs) are commonly present in CML patients, a pilot study of 19 patients with the Ph+ chromosome, but who were negative for common secondary chromosomal anomalies [+der(22), +8, i(17q), and +19], was conducted using a high-density whole genomic oligonucleotide array CGH analysis. Four of the 19 cases had somatic segmental CNCs, including the loss of 9q34, 15q25.3, and 15q13 and a gain of 7p21.1\u2013p15.3. The findings demonstrate that subtle genomic changes are relatively common in CML patients with a Ph+ chromosome and that the clinical significance of these findings, especially the newly discovered regions, must be determined in large patient population studies.",

The human IPP5 cDNA encodes a protein of 116 amino acid residues, which shares high homology with human protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). The effect of IPP5 on tumor growth and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated by overexpression of IPP5 in HeLa cells, a human cervical carcinoma cell line. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of the active mutant IPP5 inhibited the growth of HeLa cells both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that active mutant IPP5-mediated G2/M arrest of HeLa cells involved regulation of cyclin A1, cyclin B1, CDK1, p21, and p53, as well as increased inhibition of ERK activation. Furthermore, overexpression of the active mutant IPP5 leads to the formation of dikaryons following the failure of cytokinesis. Therefore, IPP5 might be a potential growth inhibitor for human tumor cells, especially for cervical carcinoma cells, and it could contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for human cervical cancer treatment.",

Molecular cloning of the breakpoint revealed that the reciprocal translocation fused the 5\u2032 proximal region of the B-cell lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) gene segment (on 14q32) to the third intron of the HELIOS gene (on 2q34). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the leukemia cells revealed that a substantial level of the HELIOS-BCL11B fusion mRNA was expressed relative to the level of wild-type (WT)-BCL11B derived from the intact allele. In contrast, an aberrant HELIOS isoform was detected at a low level of expression compared to the expression of normal HELIOS isoforms. Functional analysis of the HELIOS-BCL11B fusion protein revealed reduced transcriptional suppression activity compared to that of the WT-BCL11B due to the loss of the N-terminal friend of GATA-repression motif, which functions as a metastasis-associated protein 2 binding site. We also found abnormal subnuclear localization of the ectopically expressed fusion protein compared to the localization of WT-BCL11B to subnuclear speckles in HEK293T cells.

Three cases of the recently described translocation, t(7;21)(p22;q22), were identified, which expressed RUNX1-USP42 (ubiquitin-specific protease 42) fusion transcripts, associated with 5q abnormalities and hyperploidy. These cases displayed homogeneous morphological features (including phagocytosis) and aberrantly expressed CD56 and CD7 lymphoid antigens. Although very few data are available from previously reported cases, when these features are present, a detailed chromosomal analysis, including hybridization with RUNX1 FISH probes, should be performed at diagnosis to recognize chromosomal abnormalities. Additional cases of t(7;21) positive AML should be evaluated to characterize this potentially rare AML entity in greater detail.",

     "abstract": "The role of energy deregulation and altered/adapted metabolism in tumor cells is an increasingly important issue in understanding cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of fumarate hydratase (FH), followed by somatic loss of the remaining wild-type allele and known to be a highly metastatic and lethal malignancy compared to other RCCs. The intrinsic loss of normal tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle presumably aids tumorigenesis due to the necessary metabolic alterations required and the enforced dependence on glycolysis derived energy, mimicking the Warburg effect. Thus, there is considerable utility in establishing a preclinical cell model from these tumors to study energy metabolism deregulation, as well as developing new targeted therapeutic approaches for TCA cycle enzyme-deficient cancers. Here, we describe a new immortalized cell line, UOK268, derived from a patient's primary HLRCC-associated kidney cancer. This represents the first primary renal cell line to model TCA cycle gene loss and provides a perfect partner cell line to our previously described metastasis-derived HLRCC-associated cell line, UOK262. We identified a novel germline FH missense mutation, p.His192Asp, and the subsequent loss of heterozygosity in UOK268. The UOK268 cell line expressed mutant FH protein, which localized to the mitochondria, but with loss of almost all catalytic activity. The UOK268 cells had severely compromised oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolytic flux. Ingenuity pathways analysis of human mitochondria-focused cDNA microarray (hMitChip3) gene chip data confirmed the altered mRNA expression patterns of genes involved in several important pathways, such as lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and energy production/glycolysis. UOK268 provides a unique model of a primary cell line demonstrating an enforced, irreversible Warburg effect and, combined with UOK262, provides a unique in\u00a0vitro preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer.",

In recent years, important new information has been generated on the contribution of BMP family members, such as BMP4, in cancer pathogenesis. First of all, BMP4 gene variants have been shown to predispose to colorectal cancer. In sporadic cancer, BMP4 expression levels are commonly altered in many tumor types and have been linked to patient prognosis in hepatocellular and ovarian cancer. In terms of BMP4 function in cancer cells, the majority of studies demonstrate that BMP4 suppresses cell growth both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and at the same time is able to induce migration, invasion, and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. These latter phenotypes are typically associated with cancer metastasis and progression, and thus BMP4 seems to elicit effects that are both detrimental and beneficial for the cancer cells. The functional effects of BMP4 are not restricted to the control of cell proliferation and mobility, since it also contributes to the regulation of differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. The latter is especially intriguing since the formation of new blood vessels is a prerequisite for sustained tumor growth and cancer progression. Mainly due to its growth suppressive abilities, BMP4 has been suggested as a possible therapeutic target in cancer cells. However, the other functional characteristics of BMP4, especially the promotion of cell mobility, make such strategies less appealing. Improved knowledge of the downstream mediators of BMP4 effects in cancer cells may allow dissection of the different BMP4-induced phenotypes and thereby generation of specific targeted therapies.",

The HMGA2 breakpoint leads to the loss of seven 3\u2032UTR binding sites for the microRNA (miRNA) let-7 tumor suppressor. The breakpoint in the EFCAB6 gene abrogates transcription of EFCAB6. Measurement of expression showed retention of HMGA2 transcription and no detectable EFCAB6 transcript. Allele burden comparison in a sample containing the translocation, showed 90% HMGA2-EFCAB6 versus 50% JAK2V617F allele dose, suggesting HMGA2-EFCAB6 rearrangement plays a more ancestral role, pre-JAK2V617F, in the neoplastic process. The pathogenicity of the translocation may rest on collaborations among JAK2V617F-induced constitutive activation of JAK2, the oncogenic property of HMGA2, and disrupted pathways, such as alteration in DJ-1 expression, resulting from the impact of EFCAB6 abrogation.",

Since GGAA-containing microsatellites within key target genes are necessary for Ewing sarcoma\u2013specific EWS/FLI DNA binding and gene activation, and gene expression is positively correlated with the number of repeat motifs in the promoter/enhancer region, we sought to determine if significant polymorphisms exist between African and European populations which might contribute to observed differences in Ewing sarcoma incidence and outcomes. GGAA microsatellites upstream of two critical EWS/FLI target genes, NR0B1 and CAV1, were sequenced from subjects of European and African descent. While the characteristics of the CAV1 promoter microsatellites were similar across both populations, the NR0B1 microsatellite in African subjects was significantly larger, harboring more repeat motifs, a greater number of repeat segments, and longer consecutive repeats, than in European subjects. These results are biologically intriguing as NR0B1 was the most highly enriched EWS/FLI bound gene in prior studies, and is absolutely necessary for oncogenic transformation in Ewing sarcoma. These data suggest that GGAA microsatellite polymorphisms in the NR0B1 gene might influence disease susceptibility and prognosis in Ewing sarcoma in unanticipated ways.",

Focusing only on miRNAs that were deregulated in the majority of osteosarcoma cell lines, we identified several miRNAs with oncogenic and tumor suppressor properties, including various members of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster. In addition, several genes involved in differentiation (RGMB, LRRC17), cell cycle control (CCNE1), and apoptosis (LIMA1, CAMK2N1) were found to be deregulated in osteosarcoma cell lines, most likely due to altered miRNA expression patterns. Our findings indicate a crucial impact of deregulated miRNAs with consecutive changes in gene expression in osteosarcomas, which strongly suggests pathogenetic and potentially therapeutic implications.",

     "abstract": "Embryonal brain tumors, which include medulloblastoma and the more aggressive supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (sPNET), comprise one of the largest group of malignant pediatric brain tumors. We observed in high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analyses that several different components of the CDK/CYCLIND/pRB regulatory complex, including the CDK4/6 and CCND1/2 loci, are targets of gene amplification in medulloblastoma and sPNET. CDK6 and CCND1 gene amplification were respectively most common and robust, and overall CDK/CYCLIND gene amplification was more commonly observed in sPNET (25%) than medulloblastoma (1\u20135%). CDK6 overexpression enhanced in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo oncogenicity and endogenous CDK6 or CCND1 knockdown decreased pRB phosphorylation and impaired cell cycle progression in both medulloblastoma and sPNET cell lines. Although animal models implicate the pRB tumor suppressor pathway in medulloblastoma and sPNET, mutations of RB1 or the related INK4 tumor suppressor loci are rare in primary human tumors. Our data suggest that CDK/CYCLIND gene amplification may represent important mechanisms for functional inactivation of pRB in medulloblastoma and sPNET.",

For instance, dystrophin-deficient mdx and dysferlin-deficient A/J mice, models of human Duchenne MD and limb-girdle MD type 2B, respectively, develop mixed sarcomas with variable penetrance and latency. To further establish the correlation between MD and sarcoma development, and to test whether a combined deletion of dystrophin and dysferlin exacerbates MD and augments the incidence of sarcomas, we generated dystrophin and dysferlin double mutant mice (STOCK-Dysfprmd Dmdmdx-5Cv). Not surprisingly, the double mutant mice develop severe MD symptoms and, moreover, develop rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) at an average age of 12 months, with an incidence of >90%. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses, using a panel of antibodies against skeletal muscle cell proteins, electron microscopy, cytogenetics, and molecular analysis reveal that the double mutant mice develop RMS. The present finding bolsters the correlation between MD and sarcomas, and provides a model not only to examine the cellular origins but also to identify mechanisms and signal transduction pathways triggering development of RMS.",

In this review, we describe the findings of studies that have examined the molecular basis of ACTs, and we compare transcriptome analysis with other diagnostic approaches. ACTs are occasionally difficult to classify. Therefore, molecular techniques, such as microarray analysis, have recently been applied to overcome some of these diagnostic problems. We also discuss the likelihood of the diagnosis and discernment between ACAs and ACCs based on the molecular tests. To show the recent progress in understanding the etiology of ACTs, we highlight the relationship between genetic analysis and transcriptome analysis.

Tissue microarrays composed of 50 ER+PR+ and 50 ER+PR\u2212 tumors were developed to validate the comparative genomic hybridization array results. The genes of interest were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The ER+PR\u2212 group had a slightly different genomic profile when compared with ER+PR+ tumors.

The aim of this study was to extend establishing the cytogenetic profile of this type of malignancy in advanced and metastatic cases, and to demonstrate its relation to the end results of systemic therapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied to interphase nuclei to detect numerical chromosome changes in 41 patients with bladder cancer. Numerical chromosome aberrations were detected in 27 of 41 cases (66%). In 17 (41%) cases, a gain of chromosome 7 was observed, while losses in chromosomes 9 and 17 were detected in 20 (49%) and 18 (44%) cases, respectively. Loss of chromosome Y was detected in 7 of the 32 male patients included in this study (22%). There was a statistically significant association between stage of the disease and overall survival; Bajorin score and time to disease progression and overall survival; and between response to systemic therapy and time to disease progression and overall survival. The only chromosomal abnormality that had a significant relationship with overall survival was the gain of chromosome 4.

The wild-type activity is associated with the (TA)6TAA allele (UGT1A1*1), whereas UGT1A1 expression decreases with the increase of the TA-repeat number. We hypothesize that the low-activity allele UGT1A1*28 with seven TA repeats is associated with a higher risk for colorectal cancer. Our study involved 168 patients with histopathologically confirmed sporadic colorectal cancer and a control group of 96 individuals with no personal history of colorectal cancer.

We describe the evolution of DFTs in the field and speculate on the possible impacts on the disease, including (1) development of less aggressive forms of the disease; (2)\u00a0development of more aggressive forms of the disease; (3) development of forms capable of affecting closely related species of dasyurids (e.g., quolls); (4) extinction of the disease as it acquires additional deleterious mutations that affect either cell viability or transmissibility; and (5) co-evolution of the disease and the host. We also speculate about the future of the Tasmanian devil in the wild. We note that although DFTs are regarded as unstable by comparison with another much older transmissible cancer, canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT), the potential for development of less aggressive forms of DFTs or for development of resistance in devils is limited by devils\u2019 small numbers, low genetic diversity, and restricted geographical distribution.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 21-23 nucleotide RNA molecules that play critical roles in the regulation of various cancers, including human lung cancer. Among them, miR-26a has been identified as a tumor-related regulator in several cancers, but its pathophysiologic properties and correlation with the development of human lung cancer remain unclear. In this study, it was determined that miR-26a expression is clearly down-regulated in human lung cancer tissues relative to normal tissues. Meanwhile, the overexpression of miR-26a in the A549 human lung cancer cell line dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, blocked G1/S phase transition, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell metastasis and invasion in\u00a0vitro. In contrast, a miR-26a inhibitor was used to transfect A549 cells, and the inhibition of endogenous miR-26a promoted cell metastasis and invasion. In addition, miR-26a expression inhibited the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and transactivated downstream target genes, including disabled homolog 2 (Drosophila) interacting protein gene (DAB2IP) and human Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), which suggests that EZH2 is a potential target of miR-26a as previously reported. In conclusion, miR-26a plays an important role as an anti-oncogene in the molecular mechanism of human lung cancer and could potentially be used for the treatment of lung cancer.",

In the literature, two cases of partial monosomy 13 have been reported in adenomatous goiters, suggesting that this abnormality characterizes a rare but distinct subgroup of benign thyroid lesions histologically presenting as adenomatous goiters.

They are rare and often benign tumors that are associated with high morbidity and mortality due to mass effect and high circulating catecholamines. Although most PCCs and PGLs are thought to be sporadic, over one third are associated with 10 known susceptibility genes. Mutations in three genes causing well characterized tumor syndromes are associated with an increased risk of developing PCCs and PGLs, including VHL (von Hippel-Lindau disease), NF1 (Neurofibromatosis Type 1), and RET (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2). Mutations in any of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunit genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD) can lead to PCCs and PGLs with variable penetrance, as can mutations in the subunit cofactor, SDHAF2. Recently, two additional genes have been identified, TMEM127 and MAX. Although these tumors are rare in the general population, occurring in two to eight per million people, they are more commonly associated with an inherited mutation than any other cancer type. This review summarizes the known germline and somatic mutations leading to the development of PCC and PGL, as well as biochemical profiling for PCCs/PGLs and screening of mutation carriers.",

In our previous study, we found variability of the fusion transcripts of the t(1;3)(p36;q25) translocation among different patients with EHE. Thus, we undertook a molecular analysis of six samples from two patients with multicentric hepatic EHE to test our hypothesis that the presence of identical breakpoints in WWTR1 and CAMTA1 support the monoclonal nature of multifocal EHE. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and subsequent sequencing, we confirmed an identical WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion transcript product from different nodules in each patient.

The aim of this project was to identify structural chromosomal aberrations which may be characteristic for intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) and cervical carcinomas (CxCa). Two independent HPV16 immortalized keratinocyte cell lines (HPKIA, HPKII) were used as a cell culture model system for cervical carcinogenesis. Different passages of HPKIA and HPKII were analyzed by multicolor spectral karyotyping. Several chromosomal translocations were identified in HPK cells and were validated by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH). Three unbalanced whole chromosome arm translocations, der(10;14), der(7;21), and der(7;12), were cell line specific.

     "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically heterogeneous disease. The methods currently used for monitoring CLL and determining conditions for treatment are limited in their ability to predict disease progression, patient survival, and response to therapy. Although clonal diversity and the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities during the disease course (clonal evolution) have been associated with disease progression, their prognostic potential has been underappreciated because cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have a restricted ability to detect genomic abnormalities and clonal evolution. We hypothesized that whole genome analysis using high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays would be useful to detect diversity and infer clonal evolution to offer prognostic information. In this study, we used the Infinium Omni1 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) array for the analysis of genetic variation and percent mosaicism in 25 non-selected CLL patients to explore the prognostic value of the assessment of clonal diversity in patients with CLL. We calculated the percentage of mosaicism for each abnormality by applying a mathematical algorithm to the genotype frequency data and by manual determination using the Simulated DNA Copy Number (SiDCoN) tool, which was developed from a computer model of mosaicism. At least one genetic abnormality was identified in each case, and the SNP data was 98% concordant with FISH results. Clonal diversity, defined as the presence of two or more genetic abnormalities with differing percentages of mosaicism, was observed in 12 patients (48%), and the diversity correlated with the disease stage. Clonal diversity was present in most cases of advanced disease (Rai stages III and IV) or those with previous treatment, whereas 9 of 13 patients without detected clonal diversity were asymptomatic or clinically stable. In conclusion, SNP microarray studies with simultaneous evaluation of genomic alterations and mosaic distribution of clones can be used to assess apparent clonal evolution via analysis of clonal diversity. Since clonal evolution in CLL is strongly correlated with disease progression, whole genome SNP microarray analysis provides a new comprehensive and reliable prognostic tool for CLL patients.",

     "abstract": "Rapidly evolving genomic technologies have permitted progressively detailed studies of medulloblastoma biology in recent years. These data have increased our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma, identified prognostic markers, and suggested future avenues for targeted therapy. Although current randomized trials are still stratified based largely on clinical variables, the use of molecular markers is approaching routine use in the clinic. In particular, integrated genomics has uncovered that medulloblastoma comprises four distinct molecular and clinical variants: WNT, sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4. Children with WNT medulloblastoma have improved survival, whereas those with group 3 medulloblastoma have a dismal prognosis. Additionally, integrated genomics has shown that adult medulloblastoma is molecularly and clinically distinct from the childhood variants. Prognostic and predictive markers identified by genomics should drive changes in stratification of treatment protocols for medulloblastoma patients on clinical trials once they can be demonstrated to be reliable, reproducible, and practical. Cases with excellent prognoses (WNT cases) should be considered for therapy de-escalation, whereas those with bleak prognoses (group 3 cases) should be prioritized for experimental therapy. In this review, we will summarize the genomic data published over the past decade and attempt to interpret its prognostic significance, relevance to the clinic, and use in upcoming clinical trials.",

HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on all (CK+ and CK\u2212) captured cells was compared to HER2 status on the primary tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a054) of patients with late stage metastatic/recurrent breast cancer.

Over 90% contain a missense point mutation (C134W) in the FOXL2 gene at 3q22.3. The relationship between FOXL2 mutation and cytogenetic abnormalities is unclear, although both are presumably early events in tumorigenesis. In addition, FOXL2 C134W mutant allele imbalance has been noted in a minority of AGCTs, but the mechanism for allelic imbalance has not yet been described. We used a microarray platform designed for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, the Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Express 330K Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) array, to explore the correlation between genomic imbalances detected by microarray and FOXL2 mutation status detected by pyrosequencing in a series of 21 archived AGCTs. Tumors were characterized by histopathologic features, stage, and alpha-inhibin expression by immunohistochemistry. All tumors were positive for inhibin, and 18/21 tumors contained a FOXL2 mutation. The most common genomic imbalances were a gain of 14q, a loss of 16q, and a loss of 22q. Three tumors showed evidence of FOXL2 mutant allele imbalance by pyrosequencing; microarray revealed a 32.5 Mb deletion encompassing FOXL2 in 1 case and a 70.9 Mb stretch of homozygosity encompassing FOXL2 in the other case. The third case, with a FOXL2 mutant allele imbalance, showed a diminished mutant allele population (32%) despite high estimated tumor content (>90%), suggesting tumor heterogeneity for the mutation. This study provides the first correlation of FOXL2 mutation status and genomic imbalances in AGCTs, and it further elucidates the mechanisms for mutant allele imbalance in cancer.",

To determine whether high-resolution microarray analysis would reveal new or additional aberrations, we analyzed 35 samples derived from patients with a diagnosis or suspicion of MDS and abnormal karyotypes. We used a whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray with targeted coverage of approximately 1900 genes associated with hematologic and other cancers. Clinically relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs) were identified by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in all samples (range 1\u201331, median 5). In 28 of 35 samples (80%), aCGH revealed new cytogenetic aberrations not seen by karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Furthermore, 132 cryptic aberrations (\u22645 Mb) were identified in 25 cases (71.4%) including deletions of NF1, RUNX1, RASSF1, CCND1, TET2, DNMT3A, HRAS, PDGFRA and FIP1L1. Additionally, aCGH clarified known complex aberrations in 17 of 35 samples (48.6%). Finally, our results using whole-genome arrays with higher density coverage targeted to cancer features demonstrate the usefulness of arrays to identify rare and cryptic recurring imbalances that may prove to be significant in disease progression or transformation to AML and may improve the suitability or efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy.",

In addition, the role of the deficient BRCA1/2-mediated homologous recombination (HR) (\u201cBRCAness\u201d) pathway is presented. Understanding the molecular biology of these pathways in the context of contemporary drug development means that somatic mutations and epigenetic losses of BRCA1/2 and PTEN in ovarian cancer are being used to predict sensitivity to new poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors that exhibit synthetic lethality with BRCA1/2 dysfunction and other repair pathways.

Atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs) display supernumerary ring or giant marker chromosomes with amplification of several genes including HMGA2 and MDM2. A study of HMGA2 expression in a variety of adipocytic tumors showed aberrant expression in lipomas with 12q13-15 aberrations and ring chromosomes as well as in ALTs and well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLSs), and frequent differential expression of HMGA2 exons 1\u20132 versus that of exons 4\u20135. A minor subset of adipocytic tumors harbors unbalanced karyotypes with extra copies of 12q sequences in structures that are not giant marker or ring chromosomes. Out of a series of ten such tumors, three lipomas and four ALTs with more than two copies of 12q13-15 and breakpoints in 12q13-15 could be analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to find out whether HMGA2 and MDM2 expression was more similar to the levels seen in lipomas with cytogenetically balanced aberrations of 12q13-15, or to ALTs with giant ring or marker chromosomes. One of two ALTs with more complex, hyperdiploid karyotypes had expression levels closer to those seen in ALT, whereas the remaining six cases were similar to lipomas with 12q13-15 changes and ring chromosomes. Differential expression was seen in two ALTs and all three lipomas. Two cases showed MDM2 expression levels similar to those found among WDLSs, two cases showed levels similar to those found among lipomas, whereas the remaining three cases displayed intermediate expression levels. The studied cases represent intermediates between lipoma and ALT, insofar as they\u00a0shared 12q13-15 rearrangements and karyotypic stability with lipomas and gain of 12q sequences with ALTs. Neither of these characteristics can be used to discriminate between lipoma and ALT.",

Five years after the initial diagnosis, investigators identified a complex rearrangement of the MLL gene without progression to acute leukemia. The 5\u2032 part of the MLL gene is fused out of frame with the LOC100131626 gene, and the 3\u2032 part of the MLL gene out of frame with the TCF12 gene. Rapid amplification of complementary DNA 3\u2032 ends yielded two main fusion transcripts, which is in concordance with the two described isoforms of the LOC100131626 gene. For both isoform-fusion transcripts, the open reading frame terminates shortly after the breakpoint that is predicted to form two de facto truncated MLL proteins and disrupts the open reading frame of the LOC100131626, TCF12, and UBE4A genes. Neither dimerization nor a transcriptional activation domain, each of which is causally linked to MLL protein\u2013mediated transformation, is present. This and other unusual MLL rearrangements probably represent a subclass of MLL gene abnormalities that have intrinsically no ability or only a weak ability to transform hematopoeitic cells and are identified only in the context of other hematopoetic malignancies.",

We applied this combined strategy to map rearrangements in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and HCC1954. We detected and validated a total of 91 somatic rearrangements in MCF7 and 25 in HCC1954, including genomic alterations corresponding to previously reported transcript aberrations in these two cell lines. Each of the genomes contains two types of breakpoints: clustered and dispersed. In both cell lines, the dispersed breakpoints show enrichment for low copy repeats, while the clustered breakpoints associate with high copy number amplifications. Comparing the two genomes, we observed highly similar structural mutational spectra affecting different sets of genes, pointing to similar histories of genomic instability against the background of very different gene network perturbations.",

This approach produced enough template for 100 inverse PCR reaction from as little as 20 ng of patient DNA, consequently enabling the use of up to 500 times less patient DNA compared to standard inverse PCR. The method is based on identifying restriction sites in a putative breakpoint area in a cancer-specific translocation, followed by circularization and amplification of the restriction DNA products by using T4 DNA ligase and Phi29 enzyme, respectively. The amplified DNA thus obtained is used as a template in long-distance inverse PCR to amplify and detect the precise breakpoint of the chromosomal rearrangements in question by sequencing of the obtained PCR products. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by identifying fusion genes TAF15\u2013ZNF384 (brought about by a (12;17)(p13;q21) translocation) and BCR\u2013ABL1 (produced by a (9:22)(q34;q11.2) translocation) in five leukemia samples.

At the molecular genetic level Ewing\u2019s sarcoma is characterized by a balanced reciprocal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), which encodes an oncogenic fusion protein and transcription factor EWS/FLI. This tumor-specific chimeric fusion retains the amino terminus of EWS, a member of the TET (TLS/EWS/TAF15) family of RNA-binding proteins, and the carboxy terminus of FLI, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. In addition to EWS/FLI, variant translocation fusions belonging to the TET/ETS family have been identified in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. These studies solidified the importance of TET/ETS fusions in the pathogenesis of Ewing\u2019s sarcoma and have since been used as diagnostic markers for the disease.

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) analysis on benign as well as malignant thyroid neoplasias has been performed in the past, but rarely in combination with CC. In the present paper, we have analyzed 161 benign thyroid lesions both with CC and I-FISH on touch preparations by using a multi-target, triple-color FISH assay as well as dual-color break-apart probes for detection of the main cytogenetic subgroups. Within the samples, I-FISH detected tumors belonging to either of the subgroups more frequently than CC (23 vs. 11.4%), either due to small subpopulations of aberrant cells or to cryptic chromosomal rearrangements (three cases). Thus, I-FISH seems to be more sensitive than CC, particularly in the detection of subpopulations of cells harboring cytogenetic aberrations that may be overlooked by CC. In summary, I-FISH on touch preparations of benign thyroid lesions seems to be a favorable method for cytogenetic subtyping of thyroid lesions.",

In addition, we re-analyzed 10 SNPs of PPP2R2A in sporadic PCa cases and controls. No significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies were observed among either PCa cases and controls or PCa aggressive and non-aggressive cases.

Exogenous overexpression of Tuba8 inhibited cell growth and proliferation in Huh7 but not in HepG2 cells, while cell migration was increased in HepG2 cells but not Huh7 cells.

Each of the most common histologic subtypes harbors specific recurrent genetic abnormalities, such as deletion of 3p in conventional clear cell carcinoma, trisomy 7 and 17 in papillary renal cell carcinoma, multiple monosomies in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, and a nearly diploid genome in benign oncocytomas.

In addition, the improved understanding of the hereditary causes of renal tumors and their role in sporadic malignancies has led to the development of more effective targeted therapies. This review summarizes the genetic and genomic changes in the most common types of renal epithelial tumors and highlights the clinical implications of these aberrations.",

However, the incidence of ACT in South Brazilian children is 10 to 15 times greater than the worldwide incidence. Comparative genomic hybridization studies have revealed the presence of a high degree of chromosomal instability in ACT. We evaluated 16\u00a0ACT, 8 of them carcinomas and 8 adenomas. The presence of changes in DNA copy numbers was determined by comparative genomic hybridization, and the findings were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction on the basis of IGF-II gene expression. The adenomas showed a mean of 19.7 imbalances per case, with the most frequent gain and loss being 4p15.1\u2013p15.3 and 20p11.2\u2013p13.2, respectively. The carcinomas presented with a mean of 35.5 imbalances per case, with the more frequent gain being 2q14.1\u2013q24.3 and the more frequent losses being 3q21\u2013q26.2, 20q12\u2013qter, and 22q11.2\u2013q13.3. The most frequent imbalances in both adenomas and carcinomas were gains of 1p21\u2013p31.2, 2p12\u2013p21 and loss of 20p11.2\u2013p12. The expression of IGF-II mRNA (11p15.5) was higher in samples that presented with a gain of this region. It has been established that great genomic instability exists in pediatric ACT.",

Integrated aCGH and cytogenetic analyses of the adenoma and lipoma tissues revealed somatic inactivation of the wild-type MEN1 allele by different routes: the second hit of MEN1 recessive oncogenesis leading to adenoma implied a loss of heterozygosity, whereas a balanced translocation deleting the wild-type MEN1 allele primed the lipoma development.

It remains unclear whether this reflects true rarity in such tumors - the fact that such cases are not routinely submitted for cytogenetic studies, or that suspension culture techniques are erroneously used rather than in situ cultures. We report a localized plasma cell variant of CD (PC-CD) with clonal abnormalities. A human immunodeficiency virus\u2013negative 35-year-old man sought care for vague abdominal pain and was found to have an isolated 6-cm mesenteric mass. PC-CD was diagnosed by integrating clinical, laboratory, morphologic, and immunophenotypic studies. Flow cytometric, immunohistochemical, and molecular IGH@ gene rearrangement studies were all negative for a clonal B or plasma cell population. A cytogenetic in situ culture analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,add(6)(p23),add(7)(p15),del(7)(p15),add(9)(q22)[4]/46,XY,inv(9)(p13q22)[2]/46,XY,\u22123,+r[2]/46,XY[3]. A cytogenetic suspension culture showed a normal karyotype. On the basis of the morphologic and immunophenotypic features, these genetic changes are attributed to the non-lymphoid cells, most probably of stromal, dendritic, or endothelial origin. Because the pathogenesis of PC-CD is not thought to typically involve the proliferation of these cell types, this is a new and unexpected finding and may provide pathogenetic insight.",

Later, a fusion of the genes PAX8 and PPARG resulting from this translocation was frequently observed in follicular carcinomas and considered as a marker of follicular thyroid cancer. According to subsequent studies, however, this rearrangement is not confined to carcinomas but also occurs in adenomas, with considerably varying frequencies. Only five cases of thyroid adenomas with this translocation detected by conventional cytogenetics have been documented. In contrast, studies using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected fusion transcripts resulting from that translocation in an average of 8.2% of adenomas. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the PAX8-PPARG fusion in follicular adenomas and to use the HMGA2 mRNA level of such tumors as an indicator of malignancy. In cytogenetic studies of 192 follicular adenomas, the t(2;3)(q13;p25) has been identified in only two cases described herein. Histopathology revealed no evidence of malignancy in either case, and, concordantly, HMGA2 mRNA levels were not elevated. In summary, the fusion is a rare event in follicular adenomas and its prevalence may be overestimated in many RT-PCR\u2013based studies.",

The inv(16)(p13q22) results in a fusion gene comprising the 5\u2032CBFB gene and the 3\u2032MYH11 gene on the short arm of chromosome 16. The fusion gene interferes with the normal transcription of the CBFA/CBFB heterodimer and disrupts myeloid differentiation. The inv(16) is associated with a good prognosis. The inv(16) with deletion of the 3\u2032CBFB region of the gene is a very rare occurrence. Although the number of cases is small, inv(16) with a deleted 3\u2032CBFB seems to be associated with a poorer prognosis than that generally associated with inv(16). Our patient was a 30-year-old man with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who was found to have a CBFB\u2013MYH11 fusion by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction. The high blast count and lack of differentiation were not typical for this entity and suggested clonal progression. The initial karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis, in all metaphases examined, was 46,XY,del(7)(q32),del(16)(q22). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a dual-color, break-apart probe corresponding to the CBFB gene locus (Abbott, Des Plaines, IL) showed a derivative chromosome 16 resulting from an inversion of the CBFB gene with a deletion of the 3\u2032CBFB probe region. Oligonucleotide array comparative genetic hybridization analysis was performed on this patient's diagnostic bone marrow DNA referenced to a normal male control DNA by using the DNAarray Heme Profile (CombiMatrix Diagnostics, Irvine, CA) microarray. This analysis showed a 1.2 Mb loss of 16q22.1, which did not include loss of the 3\u2032CBFB gene locus, but rather sequences distal to this locus. The DNAarray Heme Profile results illustrate the importance of microarray in the correct identification of abnormalities that will affect prognosis.",

In the present study, based on in-silico analysis, we carried out a case-control study in a Chinese population (207 cases and 245 controls) to investigate the association between HCC susceptibility with a 7 base pair (bp) insertion/deletion polymorphism (rs3917) in the 3\u2032UTR of COL1A2. Our results showed that the ins/del + del/del genotype had an odds ratio of 1.76 (95% C.I.=1.03\u20133.01; P=0.028) for developing HCC compared to the ins/ins genotype. Carriers for the \u201cdel\u201d allele of rs3917 were associated with a 1.73-fold increased risk for HCC (95% C.I.=1.06\u20132.84; Ptrend=0.02). Computational modeling suggests that this polymorphism is located in the hsa-let-7g potential target sequence in the COL1A2 3\u2032 untranslated region.

In the single-locus analysis, only the heterozygous TP53 Arg72Pro genotype was significantly associated with the risk of developing a cervical carcinoma, while the RNASEL polymorphism showed no association after age adjustment. In addition, the combination of both polymorphisms gives near-null information gain.

     "abstract": "USP6 rearrangement is the most common genetic abnormality in primary aneurysmal bone cyst, and SS18 rearrangement has not been previously described in any type of tumor where synovial sarcoma was excluded from the differential diagnosis. We report a case of solid aneurysmal bone cyst in which fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated rearrangements of both USP6 and SS18, but histologic features were consistent with aneurysmal bone cyst throughout the lesion. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the SS18-SSX1 and SS18-SSX2 translocations, identity testing, and SS18 FISH were performed on cytogenetic monolayer cultures and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Genomic microarray, FISH, and immunohistochemistry were performed on follow-up studies of the FFPE specimen. The karyotype was 45,X,add(X)(p11.2),add(4)(q13),add(8)(p21),-13,add(17)(p11.2),add(18)(q11.2) in all 20 cells analyzed from monolayer cultures. The karyotype showed no cytogenetically visible alterations of chromosomal regions harboring known partners for USP6. Metaphase FISH with a commercial SS18 break-apart probe showed translocation of the 5\u2032 portion of the SS18 probe to the short arm of the derivative X, as is observed in synovial sarcoma. RT-PCR showed no evidence of a SS18-SSX fusion, and immunohistochemistry was negative for TLE1, EMA, and cytokeratin AE1/3 expression. FISH on FFPE sections with a custom break-apart probe flanking USP6 showed evidence for a USP6 rearrangement throughout the tumor (25\u201350%). FISH on FFPE sections with a commercial SS18 break-apart FISH probe showed more variable results (0\u201350% split signals). There was no evidence of a SS18-USP6 fusion by FISH or RT-PCR. A molecular inversion probe array revealed a deletion encompassing the entire SS18 gene and its promoter, as well as portions of the region targeted by the commercial SS18 FISH probe. In conclusion, results obtained from commercially available FISH probes may occasionally yield misleading results. In this case, the SS18 rearrangement by FISH resulted from a complex rearrangement of 18q11.2 with a deletion of the SS18 gene. The translocation partner for USP6 remains unknown in this case.",

     "abstract": "Morphologic evaluation of samples from fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle (CN) biopsies is an important part of the pretreatment diagnosis of bone and soft tissue tumors. Because most such tumors have characteristic, sometimes even specific, chromosomal rearrangements, ancillary genetic analyses could provide important diagnostic information. Whereas directed analyses, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction, for specific genetic aberrations are well suited for the relatively small cell numbers obtained with FNA biopsies, the possibility to obtain tumor karyotypes after cell culturing has been less well studied. In the present study, karyotypes from 114 FNA biopsy samples were compared to those in corresponding surgical tumor samples; in addition, results on 31 CN samples and their corresponding tumor samples were available. Of the 138 surgical tumor samples, 88 (64%) showed clonal acquired chromosome aberrations, 42 (30%) displayed a normal karyotype, and 8 (6%) did not yield any karyotype as a result of infection or poor cell growth. The corresponding figures for the 114 FNA samples were 27 (24%), 28 (25%), and 59 (52%), and for the 31 CN samples 15 (48%), 10 (32%), and 6 (19%). The relatively low success rate, with the possible exception of primitive round cell/Ewing sarcomas (abnormal karyotype in 6 of 11 FNA samples), strongly indicates that it is not meaningful to attempt cell culturing and chromosome banding analysis on FNA biopsy sample cells in patients with suspected bone or soft tissue tumors. The use of ancillary techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization might improve the diagnostic value from FNA. Our preliminary data suggest that if a pretreatment karyotype is wanted, the cytogenetic analysis should be made on cells from CN samples, close to half of which showed an aberrant karyotype.",

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood and is responsible for 10% of childhood cancer related mortality. The genetic etiology of rare families with hereditary neuroblastoma is now largely understood, with the majority having activating mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple common, low penetrance genetic polymorphisms that are associated with a predisposition to sporadic neuroblastoma, and these associations are disease phenotype specific. While many of the discoveries related to variations in the host genome that predispose to neuroblastoma are recent, there is a long and robust history of investigation of tumor cell genomics, leading to the identification of multiple biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness. Current patient risk stratification algorithms utilize key genomic features for therapy assignment. Microarray-based tumor DNA and RNA profiling techniques and next generation sequencing efforts may further refine these risk groups and identify new tractable therapeutic targets. Moving forward, integrative genomics efforts will be needed to discover how the interaction of germline genetic variations influence oncogenesis in neuroblastoma\u2014both initiation and progression.

This study assesses whether deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression is a post-transcriptional mechanism leading to gene expression changes in osteosarcoma. miRNA expression profiling was performed for 723 human miRNAs in 7 osteosarcoma tumors, and 38 miRNAs differentially expressed \u226510-fold (28 under- and 10 overexpressed) were identified. In most cases, observed changes in miRNA expression were DNA copy number-correlated. However, various mechanisms of alteration, including positional and/or epigenetic modifications, may have contributed to the expression change of 23 closely linked miRNAs in cytoband 14q32. To develop a comprehensive molecular genetic map of osteosarcoma, the miRNA profiles were integrated with previously published array comparative genomic hybridization DNA imbalance and mRNA gene expression profiles from a set of partially overlapping osteosarcoma tumor samples. Many of the predicted gene targets of differentially expressed miRNA are involved in intracellular signaling pathways important in osteosarcoma, including Notch, RAS/p21, MAPK, Wnt, and the Jun/FOS pathways. By integrating data on copy number variation with mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, we identified osteosarcoma-associated gene expression changes that are DNA copy number-correlated, DNA copy number-independent, mRNA-driven, and/or modulated by miRNA expression. These data collectively suggest that miRNAs provide a novel post-transcriptional mechanism for fine-tuning the expression of specific genes and pathways relevant to osteosarcoma. Thus, the miRNA identified in this manner may provide a starting point for experimentally modulating therapeutically relevant pathways in this tumor.",

Breakpoint mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected deletions at or adjacent to all breakpoints. Subsequently, array comparative genomic hybridization on the 244\u00a0K Agilent platform refined the deletion boundaries, revealing a 1.7 Mb deletion directly adjacent to the 6q23.3 breakpoint, and a 562 kb deletion at 17p13.3 in the first case.

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in Denmark and in the western world in general, and the prognosis is generally poor. According to the traditional molecular classification of sporadic colorectal cancer, microsatellite stable (MSS)/chromosome unstable (CIN) colorectal cancers constitute approximately 85% of sporadic cases, whereas microsatellite unstable (MSI) cases constitute the remaining 15%. In this study, we used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify genomic hotspot regions that harbor recurrent copy number changes. The study material comprised fresh samples from 40 MSS tumors and 20 MSI tumors obtained from 60 Danish CRC patients. We identified five small genomic regions (<15 megabases) exhibiting recurrent copy number loss, which, to our knowledge, have not been reported in previously published aCGH studies of CRC: 3p25.3, 3p21.2-p21.31, 5q13.2, 12q24.23-q24.31, and 12q24.23-q24.31. These regions contain several potentially important tumor suppressor genes that may play a role in a significant proportion of both sporadic MSS CRC and MSI CRC. Furthermore, the generated aCGH data are in support of the recently proposed classification of sporadic CRC into MSS CIN+, MSI CIN-, MSI CIN+, and MSS CIN- cancers.",

     "abstract": "The last decade has revealed fundamental new insight into the existence of intrinsic molecular subclasses of breast carcinomas. By using immunostaining on archival tissue, we classified tumor pairs from 50 patients with bilateral disease into molecular subgroups (luminal, triple-negative basal-like, and triple-negative unclassified). Synchronous tumors showed a slightly higher rate of concordant pairs than metachronous tumors, and luminal tumors were highly concordant regardless of being synchronous or metachronous (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Metachronous cases had a higher degree of discordance if the time interval was longer than 10 years; this was most pronounced for triple-negative tumors. The relationship found between subtypes of bilateral tumors provides additional evidence for the role of host-related factors in determining the molecular type of breast cancer.",

These well-characterized extranodal lymphomas have a disguised onset, secondary to intrasinusoidal infiltration of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, with a rapidly progressive course that is poorly responsive to chemotherapy and often ensues in the setting of immune system suppression. We describe the clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and molecular analyses for T cell receptor gene rearrangement in a 21-year-old man diagnosed with HSTCL. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed negativity for CD5 as well as double negativity for CD4/CD8 mature T-cell immunophenotype, which suggested the diagnosis of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. Molecular analysis confirmed a TCR gene rearrangement, thereby verifying the common T-cell origin of the present HSTCL case. Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis revealed a novel chromosomal rearrangement, t(7;15)(p22;q21). Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed the translocation of a chromosomal segment from 15q21 to 7p22.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by very complex cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations. In newly diagnosed symptomatic patients, the modal chromosome number is usually either hyperdiploid with multiple trisomies or hypodiploid with one of several types of immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig) translocations. The chromosome ploidy status and Ig rearrangements are two genetic criteria that are used to help stratify patients into prognostic groups based on the findings of conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In general, the hypodiploid group with t(4;14)(p16;q32) or t(14;16)(q32;q23) is considered a high-risk group, while the hyperdiploid patients with t(11;14)(q13;q32) are considered a better prognostic group. As the disease progresses, it becomes more proliferative and develops a number of secondary chromosome aberrations. These secondary aberrations commonly involve MYC rearrangements, del(13q), del(17p), and the deletion of 1p and/or amplification of 1q. Of the secondary aberrations, del(17p) is consistently associated with poor prognosis. All of these cytogenetic aberrations and many additional ones are now identified by means of high resolution molecular profiling. Gene expression profiling (GEP), array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have been able to identify novel genetic aberration patterns that have previously gone unrecognized. With the integration of data from these profiling techniques, new subclassifications of MM have been proposed which define distinct molecular genetic subgroups. In this review, the findings from conventional cytogenetics, interphase FISH, GEP, aCGH, and SNP profiles are described to provide the conceptual framework for defining the emerging molecular genetic subgroups with prognostic significance.",

     "abstract": "Two recent genome-wide association studies reported that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in (or near) TERT (5p15), CCDC26 (8q24), CDKN2A/B (9p21), PHLDB1 (11q23), and RTEL1 (20q13) are associated with infiltrating glioma. From these reports, it was not clear whether the single nucleotide polymorphism associations predispose to glioma in general or whether they are specific to certain glioma grades or morphologic subtypes. To identify hypothesized associations between susceptibility loci and tumor subtype, we genotyped two case-control groups composed of the spectrum of infiltrating glioma subtypes and stratified the analyses by type. We report that specific germ line polymorphisms are associated with different glioma subtypes. CCDC26 (8q24) region polymorphisms are strongly associated with oligodendroglial tumor risk (rs4295627, odds ratio [OR] = 2.05, P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u221211) but not glioblastoma risk. The opposite is true of RTEL (20q13) region polymorphisms, which are significantly associated with glioblastoma (rs2297440, OR = 0.56, P = 4.6 \u00d7 10\u221210) but not oligodendroglial tumor. The SNPs in or near CCDC26 (8q24) are associated with oligodendroglial tumors regardless of combined 1p and 19q deletion status; however, the association is greatest for those with combined deletion (rs4295627, OR = 2.77, P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22129). These observations generate hypotheses concerning the possible mechanisms by which specific SNPs (or alterations in linkage disequilibrium with such SNPs) are associated with glioma development.",

     "abstract": "Clinical cancer genetic susceptibility analysis typically proceeds sequentially, beginning with the most likely causative gene. The process is time consuming and the yield is low, particularly for families with unusual patterns of cancer. We determined the results of in parallel mutation analysis of a large cancer-associated gene panel. We performed deletion analysis and sequenced the coding regions of 45 genes (8 oncogenes and 37 tumor suppressor or DNA repair genes) in 48 childhood cancer patients who also (i) were diagnosed with a second malignancy under age 30, (ii) have a sibling diagnosed with cancer under age 30, and/or (iii) have a major congenital anomaly or developmental delay. Deleterious mutations were identified in 6 of 48 (13%) families, 4 of which met the sibling criteria. Mutations were identified in genes previously implicated in both dominant and recessive childhood syndromes, including SMARCB1, PMS2, and TP53. No pathogenic deletions were identified. This approach has provided efficient identification of childhood cancer susceptibility mutations and will have greater utility as additional cancer susceptibility genes are identified. Integrating parallel analysis of large gene panels into clinical testing will speed results and increase diagnostic yield. The failure to detect mutations in 87% of families highlights that a number of childhood cancer susceptibility genes remain to be discovered.",

The high resolution, genome-wide coverage, minimal DNA requirements, and relatively short turnaround time are advantageous for use in a clinical setting. We validated the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip array for clinical use by analyzing 127 pediatric leukemia and lymphoma samples that had previously been characterized by means of standard cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A higher resolution Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip array was ultimately used for clinical testing. To date, 180 samples from children with a suspected or confirmed hematologic malignancy have been analyzed. Of the 180 clinical samples, 130 (72%) bone marrow or lymphoma specimens had aberrations revealed by the array that were not seen in the karyotypes. These typically included deletions in genes associated with B- or T-cell malignancies, such as CDKN2A/B, PAX5, and IKZF1. There were also 75 regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (>5 Mb threshold) detected in 49 samples in this cohort, which could be categorized as constitutional or acquired abnormalities. On the basis of our experience in the last 2 years, we suggest that single nucleotide polymorphism arrays are a valuable addition to, but not a replacement for, standard cytogenetic approaches for hematologic malignancies.",

To our knowledge, however, there have been no studies on variables influencing the risk of MDS/AML in patients with specific Phneg karyotypes. We systematically examined studies reporting -7 or del(7q) within Phneg cells in TKI-treated CML patients, and abstracted clinical and cytogenetic data from individual reports into a standardized format for further analysis. Of 53 patients, 43 had Phneg -7 clones [as the sole abnormality (-7sole) in 29, or with other clones (-7dual) in 14], and del(7q) was present in 10. A total of 16/51 evaluable patients, all with -7, transformed to MDS/AML. Transformation was more frequent (15/16 patients) within 6 months of Phneg -7 detection rather than subsequently (P < 0.0001). At first detection after TKI therapy, Phneg abnormal clones comprised \u226550% of Phneg cells in a greater proportion of patients with -7 than del(7q) (P = 0.035). Upon comparing -7sole and -7dual, the latter was likely to be transient (P = 0.004), and AML was frequently observed with persistent -7 clones (P = 0.03). By logistic regression analysis (n = 36), clone size (P = 0.017), time-to-detection longer than 15 months (P = 0.02), and CML response (P = 0.085) were associated with MDS/AML.

Thirteen EML4\u2013ALK fusion variants have been identified, affecting eight EML4 exons. We have developed an exon scanning approach using multiplex reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify known and potential variants involving the first 22 EML4 exons. A total of 55 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung cancer tumors were screened, of which 5 (9%) were positive for EML4\u2013ALK fusions. Four positive cases harbored known fusion variants: variant 3a, 3b, or both in three cases and variant 1 in one case. The fifth positive specimen harbored two novel variants, designated 8a and 8b, involving exon 17 of EML4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of EML4\u2013ALK fusions in three of the four RT-PCR-positive specimens with sufficient tissue for examination, and also confirmed absence of fusions in all 19 RT-PCR-negative specimens tested. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed ALK protein expression in the sample containing the novel 8a and 8b variants. This RT-PCR-based exon scanning approach avoids the limitations of screening only for previously identified EML4\u2013ALK fusions and provides a simple molecular assay for fusion detection in a clinical diagnostics setting.",

Chromosomal aberrations have been observed in the majority of lipomas, two-thirds of which involve chromosomal region 12q14.3. To date, structural rearrangements have been reported affecting every chromosome except chromosome Y. Here we report a case of a lipoma that shows a novel apparently balanced translocation involving chromosomes Y and 12. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using a break-apart HMGA2 in-house probe set detected a single signal on the normal chromosome 12 but not on either the derivative chromosome Y or 12, indicating a cryptic loss of 12q14.3, where HMGA2 is mapped. Immunohistochemical studies, however, revealed overexpression of HMGA2 with nuclear expression in the majority of tumor cells, whereas MDM2 and CDK4 were negative. The overexpression of HMGA2 may be caused by a cryptic chromosomal aberration affecting either the cytogenetically unaltered HMGA2 allele or HMGA2 regulators elsewhere. The current case broadens our knowledge about the translocation partners of HMGA2 in lipomas and highlights the biological complexity in regulating HMGA2 expression.",
